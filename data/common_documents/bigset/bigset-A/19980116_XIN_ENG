<HEADLINE> China Stabilizer Of Financial Situation  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of the combined effect of the surplus and net capital
influx in the capital account, the yuan has experienced
appreciation pressure in the last several years, Bottelier
explained.
</P>
<P>
A strong currency and a high amount of foreign reserves in
relation to imports and short-term debt also helped to keep China
unaffected by the financial crisis that has engulfed Indonesia,
the Philippines, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the origin of the crisis in China's
neighboring countries underscores the urgent need for China to
increase supervision over all its financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Although China is relatively well insulated from the crisis,
there is no room for complacency," Bottelier said, and a slowdown
in exports and reduced foreign investment must be anticipated in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
To protect the country from possible economic difficulties in
future and to sustain the reforms and modernization, China should
accelerate reforms in state-owned enterprises and the
commercialization of the state banks, as was decided by the 15th
Party Congress and the State Council, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> HK Air Cargo Throughput Hits Record High in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The volume of air cargo
throughput which passed through Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport
reached a record high of some 1.7 million tons in 1997, the air
cargo operator, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd. (HACTL),
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,695,127 tons of air freight passed through HACTL's
cargo complex during the year. Courier traffic and commercial
goods carried in baggage handled through the complex amounted to a
further 28,233 tons, taking the overall tonnage to 1,723,360.
</P>
<P>
Final figures show that HACTL surpassed the million-ton mark
back in August and since then has maintained a strong performance
with three new monthly records set during September, October and
November, resulting in a tonnage growth of 13.8 percent for the
year.
</P>
<P>
"It has truly been a good year in every respect. Since the
start of 1997, the growth in air cargo has outpaced our
forecasts," commented HACTL Managing Director Anthony Charter.
</P>
<P>
Kai Tak overtook Tokyo's Narita Airport in 1996 for the first
time to become the world's biggest airport in terms of
international cargo.
</P>
<P>
"With a growth rate of 13.8 percent and in view of the slower
economy in Japan over the past year, it is very likely that Kai
Tak will again rank first in this league of airports," Charter
said.
</P>
<P>
Over 14 million tons of air freight have been managed by the
air cargo operator since it commenced operation in Hong Kong 22
years ago. Five months away it will move to SuperTerminal 1 at the
Chek Lap Kok new airport, which is due to open on July 6.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Cooperation Between Shenzhen, Hong Kong's Customs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation between customs
officers in Shenzhen, in China's Guangdong Province, and nearby
Hong Kong will be increased to improve economic ties between Hong
Kong and the rest of China.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Li Decheng revealed this at a conference of
ministerial department officials today on reforming customs work
in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Shenzhen customs office will try to improve
the ties with joint inspections, improved office conditions, and
new customs facilities. The reforms will make Shenzhen customs
closer to Hong Kong customs in work methods to improve future
cooperation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, Shenzhen was the first city in China to have
customs office reforms and these have made it much more efficient.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Shenzhen customs handled 73.29 million people, 8.83
million vehicles, and 46.36 million tons of goods, up 15.9
percent, 3.4 percent and 7.5 percent year-on-year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Shenzhen Port handled 1.14 million TEUs, an increase
of 94.1 percent, making it the country's second largest container
port.

<HEADLINE> US Airlines, Couriers Ignore Hazardous Cargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. airlines and courier
services do not strictly follow the required security procedures
designed to detect dangerous cargo despite repeated warnings, a
government report said.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted inspections
of airlines and courier services in New York and Miami and found
that the current level of compliance with approved security
procedures was unacceptably low.
</P>
<P>
Security was so lax that 10 suitcases loaded with 50 pounds
each of pesticide slipped by airline personnel undetected in Miami
three months ago and were not discovered until one burst as it was
being loaded onto a plane, the FAA said in a report released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In May 1996, a ValuJet plane crashed in the Florida Everglades,
killing all 110 people on board. Investigators believe poorly
packaged oxygen canisters ignited or fueled a fire that caused the
crash.
</P>
<P>
Even one year after the accident, seven oxygen generators were
shipped aboard a Continental Airlines flight in violation of rules
imposed after the ValuJet crash.
</P>
<P>
The FAA has made rules for years that require air cargo
companies and courier services, which deliver packages to the
commercial airlines for shipment, to certify that bags or packages
do not contain any explosives or hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
Airlines are also required to demand to see the documentation
before loading the cargo.
</P>
<P>
But in a test at the Miami Airport in October, inspectors found
10 of the 17 courier services were willing to accept packages from
shippers they had not dealt with previously, but none of the 10
followed the security procedures. Also, none of the 13 airlines
that agreed to carry the packages followed the procedures, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
In a test at the New York John F. Kennedy Airport in November,
inspectors found that two of the 11 courier services and five of
the 21 air carriers failed to follow the FAA rules.
</P>
<P>
In response to the findings, the FAA issued a strict warning to
airlines and courier services that transport cargo or baggage on
airlines for customers.
</P>
<P>
The FAA also said it was considering additional procedures to
prohibit luggage or cargo from carrying onto planes without check.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis to Reduce Canada's Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing crisis in Asian
economies has forced some Canadian economists to reduce their
predictions for the country's economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
In its latest annual forecast, economists at the Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) predict that Canada's economy
will grow 3.3 percent this year, down from the 3.5 percent
forecast earlier.
</P>
<P>
The present forecast could be further revised downward if the
Asian crisis worsens, said Joshua Mendelsohn, chief economist of
the CIBC, Canada's second largest commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
In a similar move, the Bank of Nova Scotia said it was reducing
its economic growth forecast to 3 percent from 4 percent in
November.
</P>
<P>
Warren Jestin, Nova Scotia's chief economist, said the real
impact of Asia problems will not begin to show up in Canada's
trade performance and in the profits of Canadian companies for
another few months.
</P>
<P>
When it does, there will be a lot of earnings surprises, the
economist warned.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Farmers Seek to Reduce AIDS Menace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Farmers Union
today held a one-day AIDS workshop here to deliberate on the
impact of HIV/AIDS on the agricultural sector and seek ways to
reduce the AIDS menace.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 delegates from the communal farming sector are
attending the workshop which aims to identify strategies of
coping with HIV/AIDS in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Some 13 years after the first case was identified in Zimbabwe,
HIV infection is still spreading at an alarming rate with 67,198
cumulative cases having been reported up to June last year.
</P>
<P>
Coordinator of the Zimbabwean National AIDS Coordination
Program Everisto Marowa said today at the workshop, ''It is
estimated that more than 1.4 million people have been infected
with HIV while a cumulative total of more than 300,000 cases of
full blown AIDS had occurred since the beginning of the
epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
With dozens of non-governmental organizations having been
established to help the 12.5 million population deal with the
pandemic, HIV related illnesses account for more than 50 percent
of the country's bed occupancy in health institutions.
</P>
<P>
Rapid spread of the virus and subsequent illness and death has
resulted in lowered productivity levels due to high absentism.
</P>
<P>
''The overall objective of the workshop is to find an action
plan of how to deal with this from a farming perspective,''
Deputy Director of the Zimbabwe Farmers Union Emmerson Zhou said.

<HEADLINE> London Gold, Silver Clearing Hits Records in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The average daily clearing
turnover for gold and silver in London both hit records in
December, the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing figures from the London Bullion Market Association, the
newspaper said that the average daily volume of gold cleared in
London, the international settlement center for gold bullion, was
43.7 million troy ounces, the highest level recorded since
statistics began in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the fall of gold price to the lowest level for
18 years, the value of daily turnover was only at 12.6 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figure was well below the record of 14 billion dollars seen
in February 1997 although it was slightly up on the 12.5 billion
dollars a day cleared in November when the average daily volume
was 40.8 million ounces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the association said that the volume of silver
cleared daily last month was also at the highest level it has yet
recorded, as was the daily value.
</P>
<P>
The volume and value of silver cleared daily were at 395.8
million troy ounces and 2.3 billion dollars respectively, compared
with the previous records of a daily volume of 345.5 million
ounces set in October 1997 and a value of 1.7 billion dollars
recorded in both October and November last year.

BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, a member of the

outlining three needs in building cultural and ethical
progress: Persisting in using Deng Xiaoping Theory as a guiding
principle; persisting in making economic construction the central
task; and persisting in being oriented toward the masses.
</P>
<P>
He also called for measures to increase the Party's role in
cultural and ethical progress, and urged Party officials to

<HEADLINE> HK Customs Seizes 24 Smuggled Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Customs officers
seized 24 smuggled left-hand drive vehicles worth about 10 million
HK dollars (1.3 million U.S. dollars) Wednesday, the Customs and
Excise Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The brand-new vehicles, 13 Japanese made and 11 German made,
were found inside six containers after the officers intercepted a
vessel conveying 14 40-foot loaded containers to Shantou,
Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
The left-hand drive vehicles, being prohibited articles and
controlled under the Import and Export Ordinance, were not covered
by any valid export license.
</P>
<P>
Initial inquires led to the arrest of three men, aged between
25 and 39, suspected of exporting the seized shipment. The crew of
the vessel were released to continue their voyage after the
officers found that they were not involved in the smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person who is
convicted of "attempting to export prohibited article without a
license" will be liable to a maximum penalty of a fine of 2
million HK dollars (256,000 U.S. dollars) and imprisonment of
seven years.
</P>
<P>
This is the second left-hand drive vehicle smuggling case
detected by Customs this year. In 1997, Customs seized 170
left-hand drive vehicles and arrested 42 persons in 32 cases. The
seizure value amounted to 95.5 million HK dollars (12.2 million
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> EU Defines Position on Internet Telephony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Those hooked to PC's chatting
away via Internet telephony will continue to enjoy their almost
free long distance calls over mike and loudspeaker in European
Union countries.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
union, defined Thursday its position toward Internet telephony in
the context of the liberalization of the union's
telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
Under the defined EU law, the provision of voice service on the
Internet is not voice telephony and may therefore not be subject
by member states to individual licensing procedures.
</P>
<P>
Voice communications can be made through the commercial
services provided either from PC to PC, between PC and telephone
handsets connected to the public switched telecommunications
network (PSTN), or between two telephone handsets connected to
PSTN.
</P>
<P>
Only the third and last way is currently regarded as being
close to voice telephony or voice communications.
</P>
<P>
Internet telephony can be defined as voice telephony and
therefore be subject to standard voice telephony regulation only
if the communications are the subject of a commercial offer; the
service is provided for the public; the service is provided to and
from PSTN, and the service involves direct transport and speech in
real time.
</P>
<P>
The commission considered that Internet telephony currently
does not meet all these criteria and therefore will not be
considered as voice telephony for the time being.
</P>
<P>
The commission's definition will keep markets open for
innovation regarding the Internet, which could lead to multimedia
telephony offered over the computer network.
</P>
<P>
Voice on the Internet will therefore still enlarge the scope of
services available to consumers and is likely to help foster
consumer access to what is commonly known as the Information
Society.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi today said Moslems and Christians have lived
together for centuries in Ethiopia with love and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by the Ethiopian premier when he
received and held talks with Ishmael Noko, Secretary General of
the Lutheran World Federation.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Ethiopian News Agency, Meles
said, freedom of worship is one of the provisions enshrined in
the constitution of Ethiopia and has been implemented
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
He said, religious tolerance has been a long standing
tradition of Ethiopians.
</P>
<P>
Meles told the visiting guest that his government has returned
properties which were nationalized under the previous regime.
</P>
<P>
He said, the prevalence of peace is decisive for
democratization and development to gain momentum, adding that the
church could play a key role in the effort to restore peace in
the continent.
</P>
<P>
While peace has been prevailing in the southern part of
Africa, there is yet much to be done in this respect in the Horn
and the Great Lakes region, Meles said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Noko said on his part that the
federation is grateful to the Ethiopian government for its
positive attitudes toward church operations.
</P>
<P>
Noko said that he is closely following the democratization
process in Ethiopia and urged the continuation of efforts by
Prime Minister Meles for the restoration of peace and stability
in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The Lutheran World Federation has played a decisive role for
the restoration of peace in different parts of the world, Noko
said, adding that it supports the effort to bring about peace and
stability in the Horn of Africa.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Confident to Overcome Temporary Difficulties: Tung (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa said
Thursday that he believed the SAR will be the first to get back on
its feet after the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a question-and-answer session of the Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC), Tung told members of the PLC: "We have
no reason to lose confidence of ourselves, nor have we any ground
to believe that Hong Kong will never be able to scale new
heights."
</P>
<P>
The problem Hong Kong is now facing is nothing but to find the
way to overcome the temporary difficulties and keep moving ahead
to reach new heights.
</P>
<P>
In the face of this financial situation, the SAR government's
most important task at hand is to take firm and resolute measures
to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong's economic system, Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this, it is vital for the SAR to defend the linked
exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar,
and the SAR government is determined to do so.
</P>
<P>
This is a basic policy to maintain Hong Kong's economic
stability and prosperity, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will succeed in defending the linked exchange rate
due to its sound economic foundation, huge fiscal reserves and
effective financial system and monitoring mechanism, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"The staggering events in some Asian countries have only served
to strengthen our determination to maintain the linkage. Failure
to do so will bring disastrous consequences," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the course of defending the linked exchange rate system, the
interest rate of the HK dollar goes up; property prices come down;
the stock market lingers at low levels; tourism is in the
doldrums; the consumer spending sentiment diminishes; Hong Kong's
economic growth in 1998 will slow down and unemployment figures
will be on the rise, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
If the external uncertainties do not clear up as soon as
possible, there will be difficult times for all of the Hong Kong
people in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government is well aware of the sufferings and problems
encountered by the people in the current financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
However, the economic adjustment that comes as a result of the
recent financial turmoil has certain positive effects on Hong
Kong's economy, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He listed the effects as the decline of property prices and the
slow-down of salary adjustment and inflation, which will enhance
Hong Kong's competitiveness and be conducive to the long-term
healthy economic development of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain a very optimistic attitude towards Hong Kong's
inherent strengths as well as its resilience in adapting itself to
unfavorable circumstances," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The forecast of the relevant government department reveals that
Hong Kong's economy will continue to grow in 1998 despite the
marked economic slow-down in the city, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"We should remember in particular that upon the smooth return
of Hong Kong to China on July 1, 1997, we have become masters of
our own home," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government has great confidence in Hong Kong and
believes that the Hong Kong people is able to administer Hong Kong
properly under the principle of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
"Given the trust of the Central Government as well as that of
the entire nation, there is no reason for us not to trust
ourselves," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung expressed his hope that the SAR government, the PLC
members and the whole community will work together to build a
harmonious and cooperative society to surmount difficulties in
adverse situation and to rise to challenges.

<P>
During the session, the chief executive answered questions from
the PLC members.
</P>
<P>
Asked to predict the growth rate of Hong Kong in 1998, Tung
said that Hong Kong would see four percent growth in gross
domestic product (GDP) despite Asia's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The growth will not be zero or negative," Tung said. But this
depends largely on external factors, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some PLC members concerned that the maintenance of the peg will
reduce Hong Kong's competitiveness as other countries and regions
in Asia have devalued their currencies.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that what is important now is to create a good
investment environment and regain the confidence of investors. He
believed investors will not leave Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Some PLC members also raised questions about such issues as
avian flu and environmental hygiene and using mother-tongue as the
medium of teaching.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the avian flu, Tung said that the government
attaches great importance to public health. He expressed his
thanks to various sectors that have provided help for the massive
killing of chickens in Hong Kong to prevent possible spread of
bird flu.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the mother tongue teaching, Tung said that the
purpose is to let students to grasp both Chinese and English
languages and the three spoken languages in Hong Kong --
Cantonese, English and Putonghua (Mandarin Chinese).
</P>
<P>
Tung said that education experts pointed out that in the
environment of mother tongue teaching, students can learn their
subjects better.
</P>
<P>
Tung also said that the government will offer more financial
aid to schools that conduct mother tongue teaching.
</P>
<P>
Upon the closing of the session, Rita Fan, president of the PLC
said that the PLC supports Tung in his determination to fight for
the best of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> German FM Expresses Confidence in Eastern Slavonia's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel Thursday expressed confidence in the future of Eastern
Slavonia which is being returned to Croatia following two years of
United Nations administration.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident that the Croatian government and Serb
representatives in the region have the genuine will to continue
the course towards reconciliation even after the end of the UN
mandate," Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which has been supporting Eastern Slavonia's
reintegration into Croatia from the start, will continue to offer
assistance to the reconciliation process there, he added.
</P>
<P>
The UN took control of Eastern Slavonia in January 1996 from
the Serb forces that seized it in 1991. At midnight Thursday the
UN mandate will officially expire and Croatia will finally have
full control of all the land within its borders.

<HEADLINE> EU Should Not Ban Canadian Beef, WTO Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization
(WTO) has ruled that the European Union is breaking international
trading rules by banning Canadian hormone-treated beef, said
reports today.
</P>
<P>
Canadian sources said that Ottawa has received the confidential
ruling from the WTO, but will not make any comment until the
decision becomes public Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, Canada has not been able to export beef to the
lucrative European market.
</P>
<P>
A favorable ruling could open the market up again, Vern
Greenshields, spokesman for the Canadian Agriculture Ministry, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The WTO ruled in favor of Canadian challenges to the EU beef
ban last summer.
</P>
<P>
The EU appealed, arguing that beef treated with growth hormones
was unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
The WTO appeals body ruled that the EU failed to provide an
assessment of the health risk that justified the ban.

<HEADLINE> US-Israeli Talks Focus on Peace Process, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton will
limit his discussion with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
next week to merely the Middle East peace process, a U.S. official
said today.
</P>
<P>
"This is not designed to be a stop-by visit by the prime
minister to go over broad regional issues," the official said.
"This is focused on what Israel needs to do and what the
Palestinian Authority needs to do to get the peace process back on
track."
</P>
<P>
The official said the meeting Tuesday was scheduled for one
hour and the two leaders would not share a meal.
</P>
<P>
Irael's media have reported that the Clinton administration had
turned a request from Netanyahu to cover other issues in the
meeting and they interpreted the absence of a meal as a sign of
U.S. impatience with Israel over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But the official said the planned agenda for the meeting and
the absence of the meal were arranged because of Clinton's tight
schedule. There is not an effort to set a frosty tone for the
visit.
</P>
<P>
He said apart from the talks with the president, Netanyahu will
have separate meetings with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger Tuesday where broad
issues are expected to come up.

<HEADLINE> Russia Proposes Sending Spy Planes for UN to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev proposed here today that Russia can send its spy planes
for the United Nations to Iraq to ensure the control of
disarmament there by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Sergeyev, who was on a visit
in the French capital, as saying that if Iraq is opposed to the
use of U2 spy plane of the United States by the U.N. in
supervising the disarmament, Russia "is ready to propose its own
planes."
</P>
<P>
He said that Russian planes own the same functions as the U.S.
planes.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev also emphasized the Russia is opposed to the use of
force against Iraq, and recalled that both Russia nad France
"contributed a lot to" a diplomatic solution to the last
confrontation between Iraq and the U.N arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The Russian defense minister held talks with his French
counterpart, Alain Richard, today.
</P>
<P>
A new crisis has erupted between Iraq and the United Nations
arms inspectors in Iraq after the Iraqi government blocked an
inspectors' team headed by a U.S. Gulf War veteran from pursuing
its work.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council called the Iraqi decision
"unacceptable" Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> EU Troika Mission to Visit Algeria Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain, the current European
Union (EU) president, announced here this afternoon that the EU
delegation will leave for Algeria on 19 January.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The Algerian government early today agreed to receive the EU
mission after the EU decided to raise the status of the delegation

<HEADLINE> Kenya Committed to Improving Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Newly-elected President Daniel
arap Moi today said that his government is committed to improving
investment environment to attract more investment.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the 1998 Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE)
market this morning, Moi said his presence at NSE underscored
that "my government places economic growth high on its agenda."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government would focus more attention to the
task of alleviating poverty and improving people's living
standards through speedy economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Moi pointed out that the newly appointed cabinet would make
efforts to ensure stable macro-economic environment which is a
pre-requisite for attracting investments.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Kenya's inflation has been tamed to single
digit while the exchange rate has been fairly smooth and
predictable.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader stated that the infrastructure of the east
African country, especially the road network, had been
deteriorated during the past three months due to the continuous
heavy rains caused by the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government will give special attention in
maintaining the dilapidated road network to acceptable standards
as a sound infrastructural network is key to the socio-economic
development, he added.
</P>
<P>
President Moi expressed his government's determination to
stamp out corruption which, he said, is "a cancer that has
contributed to the inefficient management of public resources and
tarnished the name of our country both locally and
internationally."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the head of state noted that Kenya is committed to
the integration of the great east African market as a way of
accelerating economic growth and development.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi Stock Exchange was started in 1954 and since then
the NSE has made great contributions to Kenya's economic
development.

DHAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The one-day
Bangladesh-India-Pakistan business summit ended here on Thursday
after adopting a joint declaration calling for greater
consultations and close economic cooperation among the three South
Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the summit as "constructive and useful", the
declaration said the three countries possess vast human and
natural resources, offering great opportunities for economic and
social development.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the South Asian region is an attractive
destination for foreign direct investment, with a considerable
scope for promoting investment through mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The heads of government stressed the importance to develop
infrastructure and adequate communications network to accelerate
economic cooperation, acknowledging that inadequate communication
facilities constitute a major obstacle to closer economic
cooperation, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
They are committed to the establishment of a free trade area in
South Asia by the year 2001, it added.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in science and technology is imperative in ensuring
global competitiveness and acceleration of development in the
region, the declaration pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral arrived here on
Wednesday afternoon and left for home Thursday night, and
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who arrived Thursday
morning, will stay here for a two-day official visit to

<HEADLINE> Canada's Airlines Vie for Asian Routes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The fight between Canada's two
major airlines for Asian routes will likely intensify once Air
Canada buys new wide-body jets, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
Lamar Durrett, president and chief executive of Air Canada,
said he expects the company's board to approve the acquisition of
five new jets when it meets in March.
</P>
<P>
The new jets will be capable of flying Toronto to Hong Kong
non-stop, according to the Financial Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In this case, Air Canada will likely step up its lobbying of
the federal government for permission to fly more often to Asia.
</P>
<P>
At present, Air Canada is only allowed to fly four times a week
from Vancouver to Hong Kong, but wants to do so daily and add
flights from Toronto, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Its arch rival Canadian Airlines International Ltd., whose
survival hinges on its dominance of the Canada-Asia market, has
said it would resist any changes to air routes.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, IMF Welcome Indonesian Reform Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today expressed
their welcome and pleasure for Indonesia's extensive new
commitment to economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"This is a huge step forward in restoring investor confidence,"
World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn said. "The program
contains just about everything the government can hope to do to
get its economy back on track and to protect the poor from the
worst effects of the financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank was ready to do its share in providing
quick-disbursing loans in support of the reforms and in helping
the Indonesian government to carry out the program, Wolfensohn
stated.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank approved in December last year a 20 million U.S.
dollar Banking Reform Assistance Project as technical assistance
to help the Indonesian government implement banking sector
reforms. This loan will be followed by a financial sector
adjustment loan, a structural adjustment loan, a rural employment
project and an urban community works project. The planned loans
will reach 3 billion dollars and will be supplemented by the World
Bank's normal investment operations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus issued a
statement expressing his pleasure over the preliminary agreement
with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence in the success of the program which
includes the budget cut, fiscal transparency, monetary policy,
bank and corporate sector restructuring and structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
"The program provides for strengthened measures targeted to
alleviating the plight of the most vulnerable people in the
country," Camdessus noted.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief has paid a visit to Indonesia to push for
stronger and quicker reforms amid concern that President Suharto
was reluctant to implement austerity measures linked to a 40
billion dollar rescue package.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus revealed that World Bank President Wolfensohn will
also visit Indonesia very soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers is
on a whirlwind Asia tour aimed at restoring confidence in the
region's battered currencies and markets.
</P>
<P>
Since July, the Washington-based IMF has arranged more than 100
billion dollars in bailouts for South Korea, Indonesia and
Thailand.

<HEADLINE> UK Schools Hit by Headteacher Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Record numbers of state schools
in Britain advertised for headteachers in 1997, said local press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
Citing figures from a survey by the National Association of
Head Teachers, reports said that a record one in 10 state schools
which amount to a total number of 2,411 schools could not find
competent heads and deputies.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that the situation was partly because of senior
staff seeking early retirement before changes in pension
regulations.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 389 secondary schools advertised for heads
last year, compared with 258 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The situation was much worse in primary schools where vacancies
for headteachers passed the 2,000 mark to reach 2,022 for the
first time since the 1980s despite the fact that 600 headteacher
posts were cut between 1991 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, among all the schools advertised for headteachers,
14 percent of secondary schools and 24 percent of primary schools
failed to attract candidates of sufficient caliber during the
first round of interviews and were forced to readvertise the
posts.
</P>
<P>
The worst area was inner London, where more than 50 percent of
posts had to be readvertised.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Foreign Minister to Visit Iran Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf is expected to arrive here Friday for an official
visit, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted an unnamed official from the Iranian Foreign
Ministry as saying that Sahhaf's visit will focus on the
outstanding issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, a Western diplomat here said that Sahhaf will try to
win Tehran's support for Baghdad to break Western isolation,
particularly to solve the current crisis over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been blocking a U.N. arms inspection team led by
American Scott Ritter, whom it accused as a U.S. spy, from
carrying out search for weapons of mass destruction because of the
"unbalanced" composition of the team.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament Saadoun Hammadi has forwarded a
letter to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, asking Iran, now
chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, to help
lift the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Sahhaf also will discuss the issue of
prisoners of war (POW) and payment of war reparations between the
two countries in order to improve relations between the two former
enemies.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year bloody war in 1980-88 which
killed hundreds of thousands of Iranian and Iraqi soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Offers Loans to Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
made available a 35 million U.S. Dollars loan facility to new and
existing small- to medium-scale exporters aimed at ensuring
increased and sustainable export-led growth by the sector.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Industry and Commerce said in a statement
today the loan would be disbursed by the apex unit of the Reserve
Bank of Zimbabwe through most local banks and financial
institutions which are participating in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
Eligible borrowers include individuals and companies employing
not more than one hundred people and have net assets, excluding
land, not exceeding 500,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said all exports qualify except tobacco and that
borrowers can apply for up to 150,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
On contribution by the borrower, the ministry said, "borrowers
are expected to contribute at least 20 percent toward the total
costs of executing the export order either in cash or in kind."
</P>
<P>
Lending rates would be determined by the financial
institutions and would be commensurate with costs and risks of
each application.
</P>
<P>
"Successful applicants are required to have either an
irrevocable letter of credit or a confirmed export order
supported by export credit insurance," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It added, "to enhance the security offered by the borrower to
the participating financial institution, the credit guarantee
agency within the apex unit can cover default risk up to 80
percent of the loan amount."

<HEADLINE> Namibia, Botswana to Hold Summit over Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam
Nujoma and his Botswana counterpart Ketumile Masire will meet to
discuss rising tensions over a small island in the Linyanti River
bordering the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In its statement issued today, the Namibian Foreign Ministry
urged Namibians, and in particular those from Singobeka village
near Situngu Island in the Caprivi Region, to "remain calm and
refrained from taking unwise steps".
</P>
<P>
"The president is dealing personally with the Situngu Island
issue," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is Namibia's strong belief that Namibia-Botswana relations
are too critical for both sides to suffer under a heavy load of
boundary claims and military operations," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Botswana soldiers had occupied Situngu
Island and had harassed Namibian farmers who had crops planted
there.
</P>
<P>
However, the Botswana High Commission in Windhoek denied the
reports, saying at no time did Botswana troops cross the Linyanti
River into Namibians territory.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, in order to plough fields on the
Botswana side of th border, the Namibian nationals actually cross
the Linyanti River using canoes in the deeper areas, and where
the river is low they place logs on the papyrus to cross into
Botswana," the commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The island dispute is being addressed by the Namibian-Botswana
joint commission on defense and security, which met a number of
times last year.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to the inflammatory press reports, the operatives of
the two countries pose no danger to each other or the security of
the two countries," the Botswana statement said.
</P>
<P>
The world court in the Hague is to adjudicate on another
disputed small island in the Chobe River bordering Namibia and
Botswana.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Launches Private Airline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The launching of Rwanda
Airlines company marked a great leap forward in breaking the
country's isolation, said the manager of the new company here
today.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan businessman, Charles Ngarambe, who is running the
company, was quoted by the Rwandan News Agency as saying that he
established the airlines because he knew Rwanda is landlocked and
has no easy air links with outside.
</P>
<P>
"I'll put it at the disposal of Rwandans for charter" he
underlined, adding that he would even undercut other airlines
operating in the region.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda Airlines, with its "mountain gorilla in the sunset"
logo, is opened by Ngarambe, a reknown Rwandan businessman, after
the merger of state-owned Air Rwanda and the South African
Alliance Airlines.
</P>
<P>
At present, this company has a BAC 1-ll 78-seat jet which
Ngarambe said is second-hand, but still in excellent condition.
</P>
<P>
However, Rwanda Airlines faces a tough competition with other
regional airlines like Cameroun Airlines, Uganda Airlines, and
kenya Airways which are on the regional routes.
</P>
<P>
No definite routes for Rwanda Airlines have been so far fixed
for Rwanda Airlines, but it is scheduled to link Rwanda to
various cities of the region.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Enforces First Provincial Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's first
provincial constitution was signed into law today by Western Cape
Premier Hernus Kriel, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
About 200 African National Congress (ANC) and South African
Communist Party supporters sang and chanted in a peaceful protest
outside the provincial legislature building while the signing
ceremony was under way, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Western Cape is the only province governed by the opposition
National Party (NP).
</P>
<P>
The constitution, certified by the Constitutional Court late
last year as complying with the national constitution, provides
for Kriel to constitute his own cabinet, breaking up the former
government of provincial unity stipulated by the 1993 national
interim constitution.
</P>
<P>
The ANC had four out of 10 cabinet ministers (members of
executive committee, or MECs), while it has chosen to be excluded
from the new 12-member provincial cabinet to be sworn in next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ANC declined to take up two posts offered to it by Kriel,
arguing that as the second biggest party in the province in terms
of the 1994 general election, it should have remained entitled to
at least the four MECs it had previously had.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party (DP) and African Christian Democratic
Party have one post each in the new cabinet, with the NP
occupying the other positions.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet would consist of eight whites and four
coloreds without any African.
</P>
<P>
Kriel has said the signing of the constitution heralded a new
era in the country's constitutional process.
</P>
<P>
"We are making use of a constitutional right which can promote
the eventual coming into being of a fully-fledged federal
dispensation."
</P>
<P>
The ANC, in calling on the people of the Western Cape to join
it in protesting against the constitution, said, "we need to send
a clear message to the National Party that their constitution
does not enjoy any legitimacy."
</P>
<P>
It was clear that the NP had chosen a path of division and
conflict by ending the government of unity in the province and
kicking out the four ANC MECs, the ANC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The ANC accused Kriel and his NP of being "nothing less than
racism", referring to the fact that Africans were excluded from
the new provincial cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The NP had chosen a path against transformation and the
country's nation-building project, the ANC said. "They have
chosen to divide and rule."
</P>
<P>
DP Western Cape leader Hennie Bester, who chaired the
provincial committee that drew up the constitution, welcomed its
signing and coming into operation.
</P>
<P>
"It heralds the birth of a new and exciting era for this part
of our country," said Bester, who is to become the new economic
affairs MEC in Western Cape.
</P>
<P>
He accused the ANC of hypocrisy, saying that the ANC had never
been in favor of a continuation of the government of provincial
unity during the constitution-writing process.
</P>
<P>
"They only wanted to keep their jobs until 1999," SAPA quoted
Bester as saying.

<HEADLINE> PNA Blasts Israel for Shrinking From Commitments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERICHO, PALESTINE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- In response to an
Israeli Cabinet decision to retain vast areas of the West Bank, a
leading Palestinian negotiator Thursday blasted Israel for
refusing to implement signed agreements by using any excuses.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, Minister of Local Governments in the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), made the accusation at a news
conference held here. This was the first official response to an
Israel document that listed a number of obligations it requires
the PNA to fulfill before any Israeli troop redeployment in the
West Bank can be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh formally
informed the PNA of the Israeli Cabinet document in a letter sent
to him Wednesday. The document demanded the PNA fight terrorism,
restrict police forces and activities in Jerusalem, and extradite
terror suspects.
</P>
<P>
He blasted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for
attempting to use any excuses to avoid implementation of signed
agreements. "The aim of the game of Mr. Netanyahu is very
clear: it will use any excuse and pretext for Mr. Netanyahu not to
implement the further redeployment," he said.
</P>
<P>
As to the Israeli demand for tougher measures against
terrorism, Erekat reminded Netanyahu that it was the Israeli side
that refused to attend a ceremony scheduled on December 22, 1997,
to conclude and sign a memorandum of understanding on security
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the memorandum, mediated by the United States,
contains the PNA promise to "zero tolerance" of violence against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of revising the Palestinian Charter, Erekat noted
that it has already been modified in April, 1996 by the
Palestinian National Council to eliminate the articles calling for
Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
Israel maintains that the charter has not been in fact revised
since no new version has been drafted. Erekat firmly rejected the
Israeli notion, saying "it's our Palestinians' business whether we
have a new charter or not."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Jerusalem, Erekat said the status of Jerusalem
is open to final-status talks and that doest not mean Jerusalem
belongs to Israel before the talks begin. He said the previous
Labor government in Israel pledged to preserve all existing PNA
institutions in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Erekat also attacked Israeli Cabinet's recent debate on setting
up security zones in the West Bank as a "unilateral declaration that
there will be no peace process."
</P>
<P>
Israeli ministers have been holding consecutive sessions over
the past few days in a bid to work out maps which will lead to
Israel's continued control over at least half of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most dangerous development till this moment by
Mr. Netanyahu," said Erekat, warning that the Palestinians are
running out of their patience toward the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The senior negotiator called on responsible international
leaders to intervene in the deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian peace
negotiations so as to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the best way to advance the peace process is for Israel
to honor the United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 and
the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Erekat also disclosed that PNA President Yasser Arafat would
present U.S. President Bill Clinton a comprehensive road-map on
reviving the peace process, including demands on Israel's
fulfillment of its commitments and proposals on Israeli
redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is to hold separate talks with Netanyahu and Arafat in
Washington next week in an effort to restart the peace
process, stalled since Israel went ahead with Jewish settlement
expansion in East Jerusalem in March.

<HEADLINE> Americans' Rally Supports Iraqi Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.S. citizens held a
demonstration Thursday before U.N. office in Baghdad to show
support for the Iraqis in their struggle to have the economic
sanctions lifted, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
A demonstrator John Hide told the INA that they would observe a
hunger strike in the coming three days before the United Nations
Special Commission, which is responsible for verifying the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction ordered by the
U.N. in 1991 after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators belong to a U.S. organization called "Voices
in the Wildness," which upholds the slogan of lifting the
sanctions against the Iraqi people, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Hide said the hunger strikers intended to express their sorrow
for the hardship suffered by the Iraqis due to U.N. sanctions
which have been mounted by direct U.S. support.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990, which bars Iraq from exporting oil, its main
revenue earner.
</P>
<P>
Jane Hoscank, a woman demonstrator, said they were demanding
for an end to the crippling economic sanctions on Iraq and U.S.
military threats to the Iraqi people, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
She called on world humanitarian organizations to join hands in
exposing the scandalous embargo policy and its grave consequences
on Iraqi children and elderly.
</P>
<P>
Another member Eline Barfield criticized the U.S. for
masterminding most of the U.N. Security Council resolutions on
Iraq, which she said were arbitrary and inhuman.
</P>
<P>
She said the oil-for-food agreement between the U.N. and Iraq
proved to be ineffective in meeting the growing needs of the Iraqi
people for food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that true relief of the Iraqi people's sufferings
is the lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal between Iraq and the U.N. allows Iraq to
sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in every six months to
buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The "Voices in the Wildness" organization has dispatched nine
teams to Iraq, which have brought large amount of medicine and
toys to the Iraqi children hospitals.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 15 (Xinhua)-- Iraq has started exporting the
first batch of its oil under the third phase of the
Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food program through its southern port of
Al-Bark, Iraq's official news agency INA reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted Director General of South Oil Company Yassin
Ad-Dabbouri as saying that the first oil tanker, Inenbra, has been
loaded with 600,000 barrels of Iraqi crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The second super tanker, Nacazaki, is due to arrive on Friday
to be loaded with 290,000 barrels of Iraqi crude oil, said Yassin.
</P>
<P>
The quantities of Iraqi Oil exported under the first phase
totaled 51 million barrels and was carried by 44 oil tankers,
while in the second phase, it reached 54 million barrels and was
carried by 30 tankers, Yassin added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food deal, first implemented in December
1996, was renewed last month for the third time, but Iraq refused
to export oil until U.N. chief Kofi Annan approved its food
distribution plan earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Iraq is allowed to export 2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil every six months to buy food, medicine and
other humanitarian supplies.

LUANDA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos and the former rebel UNITA (the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola) Jonas Savimbi are to meet by the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Riberto de Almneida, speaker of the Angolan Parliament who is
on his Italian tour, said in Rome today that the meeting, the
fifth since the Lusaka Peace Protocol in 1994, would be held in
Luanda.
</P>
<P>
He said both sides are paying much attention to the meeting
and the special committees on both sides are discussing on the
details concerning the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a UNITA high-level delegation is to
arrive at Luanda to consult with the government on issues
concerning the summit meeting, including the number of guards
Savimbi should take for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both sides believed peace process have developed into a
certain level which makes it necessary for such a meeting,
Almneida said.
</P>
<P>
The summit, if held, would serve as an important landmark in
Angolan peace process, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the new year, both the government and UNITA
have expressed that they are hoping to accomplish the peace
process by the end of February, and UNITA has handed over about
31 diamond mines it used to control to the government, thus
ending one of the most sticky problems in the peace process in
the country.

<HEADLINE> US Experts Reconsider Asia Crisis Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Top American economists are
growing more pessimistic about the impact of the Asian financial
turmoil on the U.S. economy, said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis has been unfolding faster and more seriously than
people have anticipated," says Robert McGee, economist at Tokai
Bank in New York.
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. economists have been citing the Asia crisis as the
biggest threat the country's economy is facing. They estimate that
it will reduce growth some 0.6 percentage points this year and
balloon the trade deficit by nearly 40 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The USA TODAY quarterly economic survey of 55 economists
forecast that economic growth will slow sharply to 2.4 percent in
1998 from 3.5 percent or more last year as the Asia crisis hurts
U.S. exports and takes a bite out of corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
But the reports said that most of the economists still did not
expect the fallout to derail the nearly seven-year expansion of
the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
They also predict that U.S. unemployment will remain under 5
percent through 1998, keeping the jobless rate at its lowest
levels since the early 1970s.

<HEADLINE> UK Chemical Output Slips as Drug Sector Weakens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The UK chemical industry output
last year slipped for the first time since 1990 because of
weakness in the pharmaceutical sector and export pressures, a
conference was told here today.
</P>
<P>
Total production dropped 0.2 percent on the back of a 1.5
percent fall in the contribution from pharmaceuticals, which
accounts for more than a quarter of the industry output, Malcolm
Mitchell, BP Chemicals economist, said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
The growth in export volume more than halved from 6.7 percent
in 1996 to 3 percent but the strength of sterling meant foreign
trade in value terms was down 3 percent - 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for the UK industry this year remain "more difficult"
compared with the rest of Europe, said a delegate at the
conference organized by the Chemical Industries Association.
</P>
<P>
UK chemicals growth, predicted to be 2 percent, will be the
most sluggish among the big four, though export growth is forecast
to edge up to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
German output is projected to grow by 4 percent against 6
percent last year, with France 3.1 percent (4.6 percent last year)
and Italy 2.7 percent (2.5 percent last year).

Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Derek Fatchett and EU peace
envoy Miguel Moratinos, Arafat said the Israeli government is
putting more road blocks for the Washington summit meetings to be
held later this month.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are
sheduled to hold talks separately next weeek in Washington
with U.S. President Bill Clinton on reviving the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel is trying to place more obstacles in the
peace process, the PNA will definitly continue to push this
process forward, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Arafat to criticize the
Israeli government after it decided on Wednesday to put about
60 percent of the PNA's West bank territories under its
control.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet decided on Wednesday not to hand over to the
PNA such areas of vital security interests including two security
strips on each side of the West Bank, water resources, certain
roads, areas surrounding Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and Jewish
historical sites in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
This decision of the Israeli cabinet has faced sharp crticisim
from the PNA and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett, who arrived here on Wednesday for a three-day visit
to Israel and the Palestinian self-rule area, told reporters after
his meeting with Arafat that Britain is against the Israel's
settlement policy and its unilateral actions.
</P>
<P>
The United States was also not happy after learning it.
</P>
<P>
"We are taken by surprise and it is not helpful to our ability
to conduct diplomacy on this important subject in advance of the
(Washington) meetings," State Department Spokesman James Foley
was reportedly said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The America's reaction also caused Netanyahu off-guard
again. Netanyahu this morning told his cabinet, which met for the
fourth time this week to discuss the scope of the second stage
troop redeployment in the West Bank, that the size of the second
stage redeployment will depend on whether there will be a third
stage redeployment, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet once again has not reached a final decision on
this issue, and decided to meet again on Sunday for further
discussion.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who did not turn up at
today's cabinet meeting, told the high-ranking military officers
in Tel Aviv that if there is no redeployment, there will
bo no problem for him to resign.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Rate Ends Year Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's year-on-year
inflation ended the year at 20.1 percent, up 0.7 percentage
points, underpinned by a hike in all components, the Central
Statistical Office said today.
</P>
<P>
Annual rate of inflation on one hand was pegged at 18.6
percent last year, about 3 percentage points lower than 1996, the
drastic fall to 14.4 percent in September having contributed to
this.
</P>
<P>
Inflation had been on a continuous upward trend since October
and market analysts foresaw this continuing into the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
They had predicted inflation would end the year at around 19
percent, but due to a spate of administered price increases and
above inflation wage settlements, the rate shot up.
</P>
<P>
Standard Chartered Bank also predicted a higher annual rate of
inflation this year.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes British Foreign Secretary's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Thursday welcomed
statements by British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, that a
Cyprus solution is not a condition for progress on Cyprus'
accession to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Government Spokesman, Manolis Christofides, told his daily
press briefing that the governments of Cyprus and Greece had
worked in close cooperation to promote Cyprus' EU membership
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed satisfaction with the fact that Cook,
current president of the EU Council of Ministers, declared
that the EU has the opportunity to contribute to a Cyprus
settlement through the prospect of the Republic joining its
ranks.
</P>
<P>
Outlining his country's agenda for the current six-month
rotating EU presidency, Cook reiterated Tuesday before the
European Parliament that a solution to the Cyprus problem is
not a condition for progress on the Republic's accession.
</P>
<P>
"The prospect of Cyprus joining the EU offers us the
opportunity to contribute to the peace and prosperity to all
of the people of that island," he added.
</P>
<P>
Christofides also mentioned about U.S. President Bill Clinton's
 latest report to Congress on Cyprus which said that senior
U.S. officials met extensively with EU officials to support
Cypriot EU accession prospects and to encourage stronger
EU-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided in its Luxembourg summit last December to open
accession negotiations with the Cypriot government on March 30,
this year.
</P>
<P>
The EU's decision was rejected by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash, who insisted that Cyprus can join the EU only after a
political solution is found. Denktash has ordered a suspension of
bi-communal contacts in retaliation to the EU move.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third in the wake of a
short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Airbus Weighing Super Passenger Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The German partner of the Airbus
Industrie today said the European planemaker is working seriously
to examine the feasibility of building a 600-seater super
passenger jet in a bid to boost its share in the global market.
</P>
<P>
Gustav Humbert, a senior manager with the German Daimler-Benz
Aerospace Airbus GmbH, said that he expected the technical and
finanicial problems concerning the super jumbo project to be
clarified by the end of this year or the beginning of next year so
that a final decision on whether to proceed with the project could
be made in 1999.
</P>
<P>
At issue is a 600-passenger double-decker plane, dubbed the
A3XX, which could have a range of 13,440 to 15,360 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Airbus promises that the super jumbo will be faster, quieter,
more cost-efficient and able to fly farther than the Boeing 747
which was introduced by the U.S. Boeing Co. nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, say that the new jet, which will cost a
minimum of 10 billion U.S. dollars to produce, will have a
formidable price tag. And most fundamentally, they are also not
sure whether the world will really need a passenger jet larger
than the 420-seat Boeing 747.
</P>
<P>
Although both Airbus and Boeing agree that passenger traffic
will nearly triple in 20 years, Boeing believes that smaller,
longer-range planes will meet the needs of most future travelers,
industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
According to Humbert, if executives give the project the green
light, the first A3XX could be delivered as early as 2003. He also
expressed the belief that with the introduction of the new jet,
Airbus should be able to boost its global market share to 50
percent from about 40 percent today.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Eberhard Birke, a director of the German Aviation
and Aerospace Industry Federation, said today in Bonn that Airbus
had received 29.6 billion U.S. dollars in binding orders for 460
planes in 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the current year, Airbus would deliver 235 planes, and from
1999 to 2001, it was planning to have an annual production of
about 260 planes, Birke said.

<HEADLINE> PNA Official Urges Israel to Implement Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) official Thursday urged Israel to implement the
Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement in a bid to move the Mideast
peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, PNA Minister of Planning
and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath said that Israel
should implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed
with the PNA instead of making its own decisions which are against
the provisions of these agreements.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath made the remark while commenting on an Israeli document
concerning PNA's obligations and decisions relating to Israel's
security in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Israeli cabinet passed a 12-page document
accusing the PNA of violating its obligations. And on Wednesday,
the cabinet decided to keep all the areas in the West Bank it
termed as vital to Israel's security and national interests in a
permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
These areas include two security strips on each side of the
West Bank, water resources, Jewish settlements, strategic roads and
Jewish historical sites.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath said the Hebron agreement signed early last year
stipulate that Israel carry out a three-stage troop redeployment
in the West Bank by mid-1998, adding the Israeli cabinet's
decisions on security issues in the West bank meant that it does
not want to redeploy its troops in the West Bank but rather
permanently occupy the Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the final-status talks as initiated by Israel, he
said how the PNA could enter into such talks with the Israeli
government which refused to redeploy its troops in the West Bank
and commit to its obligations as specified by the signed accords.
</P>
<P>
The permanent solution of the Middle East problem is the
establishment of an independent state of Palestine, safe borders
between Israel and Palestine, safe cooperation in all fields
between the Palestinians and the Israelis, Jerusalem should be the
safe capital of the two peoples, Sha'ath said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. and other countries to put pressure on Israel
to implement all agreements it signed with the PNA.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Moscow and Ashgabat have reached
in principle an agreement on purchases of Turkmen gas, the
Interfax news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Gazprom Chief Executive Rem Vyakhirev, who paid a
visit to Ashgabat Wednesday, Gazprom, Russia's gas giant, would
purchase the gas itself without any intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
He said Gazprom was ready to purchase about 30 billion cubic
meters of gas in Turkmenistan, but considered the proposed price
of 42 U.S. dollars for 1,000 cubic meters on the Central Asian
market was too high.
</P>
<P>
Vyakhirev believed that there were a number of actors that went
into pricing the gas. He warned that it would be difficult to find
buyers for that amount of gas in Russia, the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), and Eastern Europe who were ready to pay
cash.
</P>
<P>
He said that any purchase agreement could be realized only when
all pricing issues were resolved.
</P>
<P>
It was said that both sides had set up working groups to
consider the issue. The groups might meet in Moscow on January 26.

<HEADLINE> Britain Criticizes US Iran Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The British foreign
secretary today criticized the U.S. policy toward Iran, saying
isolation of the Islamic country would not work.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the European Institute in Washington, Robin Cook
said, "We must respond to the dangers posed by isolating as well
as the opportunities. But isolating Iran is not the right
response."
</P>
<P>
Cook, current president of the European Union, condemned the
Iran-Libya Sanctions Act punishing foreign companies investing in
Iran's oil and gas sectors, saying it was unacceptable to European
states and counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
He said that by punishing foreign companies under the Sanctions
Act, the United States risked provoking a transatlantic trade war,
which he said could "benefit only the hawks in Iran."
</P>
<P>
Britain is making the coordination of transatlantic policy on
Iran a priority of its tenure of the six-month EU presidency,
which took over on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Britain and its European allies could not forge a new
partnership with the United States on Iran "while we are looking
down the barrel of the Sanctions Act gun," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook welcomed Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's appeal for
cultural exchanges between the United States and Iran, saying,
"There are the first signs of Glasnost appearing in Iran and we
must do what we can to encourage it."
</P>
<P>
Cook also reiterated Britain's strong support for Washington's
tough position against Iraq to force it to allow U.N. weapons
inspectors access to any sites they want for checking weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed the U.N. Security Council must stand by its
commitment that sanctions were being applied "for specific
purposes." "There is light at the end of the tunnel for Iraq," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Once Saddam Hussein complies fully with the Security Council's
requirements on weapons of mass destruction, then the U.N. will
need to take action on the oil embargo (on Iraq)," he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Likely to Concede to S. Leone Junta: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations might prepare
to make some concessions to the ruling military junta of Sierra
Leone to break the deadlock in the peace process in the troubled
west African country.
</P>
<P>
The "strongest" indication was given by UN special envoy
Francis Okello in Freetown today, according to a British
Broadcasting Corportion report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The peace process in Sierra Leone has been stalled since the
junta, which seized power in a coup last May, said the peace plan
to hand over power to ousted president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by
April 22 this year had become unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
Koroma insisted that the former rebel leader should be
released from alleged detention in Nigeria, his army not be
disarmed and the dominant role of Nigeria in the west African
peacekeeping force be diminished.
</P>
<P>
These are the sticking points of Koroma during the past two
days' meetings with the UN fact-finding team led by Okello, which
arrived in the capital Freetown only on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to what he described as a "comprehensive and very
useful statement" by Koroma shortly after the team's arrival,
Okello said that the three fundamental issues raised by the junta
since the signing of the Conakry peace accord last October are
"legitimate".
</P>
<P>
The envoy promised the junta that he had taken "very careful"
notes of their concern and suggestions and would report carefully
and objectively to the UN secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
"I think that one of our recommendations will be that there
shall be a meeting between the two sides as soon as possible to
review these concerns," Okello said.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted Koroma as saying that these issues were
raised in Conakry, Guinea last October, but time was not in favor
of his delegation.
</P>
<P>
The junta leader said that not signing the peace accord at
that time would have sent a wrong signal to the world.
</P>
<P>
However, Koroma said the junta was reminded today that the
overall commitment of the Conakry peace plan was that there shall
be a restitution of constitutional order and the reestablishment
of the constitutionally elected Sierra Leonean government in
April 1988.
</P>
<P>
So far no response has been heard from the Economic Community
of West African States, which has been asking the junta to stick
to the Conakry accord.

expected to reach between 100 and 130 megawatts, and the
government is still seeking funds to construct the Rumakali and
Ruhuji power projects which are expected to produce a total of
600 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The projects will reduce the country's heavy dependence on
hydro-electricity to a great extent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Following a severe drought, Tanzania introduced power
rationing system in early September last year. People in a number
of areas complained that they had no supply of electricity in
five days a week during the worst period.
</P>
<P>
The power supply situation did not come back to normal until
early this month thanks to El Nino rains pouring into major dams
of the country from December.
</P>
<P>
"We have realized our problems so we should strive to make
sure that the power rationing system does not come again," Kigoda
said.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the country's industries will have an even higher
demand for power, and the present generating capacity of 360
megawatts is far from enough, he noted.
</P>
<P>
To improve working efficiency, the minister said TANESCO, the
country's major power supplier, will be restructured and some
workers will be retrenched to enhance the company's efficiency.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the official revealed that the country will
take measures to encourage private investment in the power
sector.

<HEADLINE> UN/ECE: 1997 World Crude Steel Production Reaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- World crude steel production is
estimated to reach a record level of 798.5 million tons in 1997,
6.6 percent higher than the previous year, according to a press
release by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe
(UN/ECE).
</P>
<P>
The old record of 784.9 million tons was set in 1989, said the
UN/ECE in its first estimates on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in 1997 is largely due to a rebound in economic
growth in the European Union and to a continuous increase in new
crude steel-making capacity in the United States of America and in
Asia, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
China was the world'largest steel producer for the second
consecutive year. It was followed by Japan, the US, the Russian
Federation, Germany and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Asia saw dynamic growth in steel production in 1997. China
showed a steady rising trend of crude steel production despite
official prohibition of the construction of large capacity
greenfield steelworks. Production increased from 100.00 million
tons in 1996 to 107.3 million tons in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, output increased by 6.0 percent and exceeded the 100
million ton level for the first time in two years (104.7 million
tons) owing to steel exports supported by the devaluation of the
Yen.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, production rose by 8.4 percent (42.18 million
tons) and in Taiwan Province of China by 31.2 percent (15.87
million tons).
</P>
<P>
Total crude steel production within the EU increased by 9.1
percent to 159.9 million tons. In the US, production reached its
highest level since 1981, increasing from 94.7 million tons in
1996 to 99.2 million tons in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In central europe as a whole, crude steel production recovered
from a decline registered in 1996, reflected by a surge in steel
exports, the UN/ECE said.
</P>
<P>
However, in the Russian Federation, crude steel production
declined by 2.1 percent owing to a fall in domestic steel
consumption, although an increase in steel exports made up for
this shortfall to some degree.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, crude steel production registered an increase
of 4.5 percent as a whole, with a 6.6 percent increase in Mexico
and 3.8 percent in Brazil.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman Thursday denied she took bribes from an African businessman
to use her influence as a top White House official.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference today Herman said she couldn't discuss the
issue publicly because of a Justice Department probe into the
charges and she pledged her full cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said, "The allegations are not true."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton said he didn't think Herman
would take money to peddle influence in the administration.
</P>
<P>
He stated, "I don't believe that for a minute."
</P>
<P>
Herman said she would not let the new investigation by Attorney
General Janet Reno affect her work at the Labor Department, and
she left, as planned, with Clinton to attend a Wall Street
conference in New York hosted by civil rights activist Jesse
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said: "The president has
enormous confidence in her and we expect the Justice Department to
closely examine the facts...and apply the law."
</P>
<P>
McCurry said that investigators have already cleared Herman of
other charges brought by African businessman Laurent Yene, who
claimed she took a kickback of 10 percent of his consulting fees
from a company seeking a federal telecommunications license, when
Herman was White House director of public liaison.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania Seeking for Good Relations with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania hopes that Russia will
not reproach the Baltic states with the signing of the U.S.-
Baltic Partnership Charter to be held in Washington on January 16,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported from Vilnius, Lithuania, on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the ELTA news agency Lithuanian Prime
Minister Gediminas Vagnorius said, "the most important document
stresses the need to develop good relations with Moscow."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Charter should not infringe upon the
development of good relations between Lithuania and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania is the first country among the former Soviet
republics which signed the border treaty with Russia, and it is
extremely interested in continuing this process, Vagnorius said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the U.S.- Baltic Charter is not aimed against
Russia. On the contrary, it stresses the need to establish
fruitful and good neighbourly relations between the Baltic states
and Moscow, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today the Russian side expressed "deep concern" over
the signing of a U.S.- Baltic Partnership Charter. The Russian
Duma and Foreign Ministry hold that it indicates the beginning of
preparations for the next stage of NATO's eastward expansion since
the Baltic states have refused to accept the security guarantees
proposed by the Russian president.
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian prime minister believed that tension would not
grow between Russia and the Baltic countries if Vilnius and
Washington sign a political declaration on Lithuania's security.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of the three Baltic states are now visiting
Washington for the signing with the U.S. President Bill Clinton
the Partnership Charter.

<HEADLINE> Greek Seamen Striking over Cabotage Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Greek seamen staged a nationwide
strike on Thursday in protest against the lifting of cabotage
coastal shipping restrictions under European Union (EU) transport
deregulations.
</P>
<P>
The seamen's 24-hour strike brought the country's shipping
transport to a standstill as all Greek-flag merchant vessels
anchored at ports, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The cabotage restrictions ceases to be in effect for
cruiseships as of 1999 and for coastal shipping as of 2004. Under
which, only Greek vessels are allowed to carry out coastal
passenger and cargo routes originating in one Greek port and
ending in another Greek port.
</P>
<P>
Yannis Halas, secretary general of the Hellenic Seamen's
Federation (PNO), said today that the scrapping of the
restrictions would create severe unemployment problems among the
Greek seamen.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Encouraged by U.N. Statement on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Thursday that he was encouraged by a U.N. Security Council
statement demanding Iraq to stop blocking an American-led weapons
inspection team from doing its job.
</P>
<P>
He said it was because even those who had been more sympathetic
to Iraq "saw through" Iraq's complaints of unbalanced composition
of the weapons inspection team and allegation of spying by former
marine Scott Ritter, who led the inspection team.
</P>
<P>
"I am very encouraged that even those who had been more
sympathetic to Iraq saw through this totally unacceptable action,"
Clinton told reporters on the South Lawn at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on Wednesday unanimously adopted the
statement deploring the blocking of the Ritter-led inspection team
and "Iraiq's failure to fulfill its obligations to provide the
inspectors with full, unconditional and immediate access to all
sites."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States would wait and see what would
happen following the Security Council statement and after U.N.
weapons inspection chief Richard Butler's trip to Baghdad to
resolve the latest standoff between Iraq and the United Nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin signed a document Friday to re-allocate the duties of
the Vice-Premiers in an effort to ensure the reforms of the main
branches of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying that
the First Vice-Premier Anatoly Chubais "will be in charge of the
entire economy, supervising the actions of all agencies to realize
the medium-term development program of the Russian Federation."
</P>
<P>
Chubais will look after the Finance Ministry's activities in
working out financial development programs, in particular the
budget and the collection of budget revenue.
</P>
<P>
First Vice-Premier Boris Nemtsov, Chernomyrdin said, will
supervise reform-related matters, including the
housing-and-utilities reform, the activities of the Transport
Commission, the energy and natural monopolies services.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Anatoly Kulikov has retained charge of
the Interior Ministry only. He will supervise the Federal Railroad
Troops Service and the collection of the budget revenue by the
State Customs Committee, the Federal Taxation Police Service and
the Federal Currency and Export Control Service.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin described the move as "nothing sensational,"
saying that the distribution of the vice-premiers' duties "have
always been subject to change or re-distribution depending on the
government's task at each specific stage."

<HEADLINE> Somali Factions Welcome Ali Mahdi's Return From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The armed militia forces of
Mogadishu's main factions today for the first time in six years
came out together at Isaley airstrip to welcome a delegation led
by Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed, who has signed a peace pact in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Painted battle wagons from Hussein Aidid's faction and
technical wagons from Osman Ali Atto together with those of Ali
Mahdi accompanied by hundreds of militiamen from all sides have
lined up the road between Mogadishu and Isaley airstrip, 15 km
North of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Mogadishu's people mainly from North Mogadishu
were transported with buses and lorries to the airstrip for the
arrival of Ali Mahdi's delegation which has been abroad for more
than four months.
</P>
<P>
People carrying a portrait of Ali Mahdi, and placards and
waving green leaves sang the national anthem of the divided
nation which has been plunged into clan wars since the overthrow
of former Somali President S. Barre in 1991.
</P>
<P>
At the heavily guarded airstrip, just beside the plane, the
top political aids of the three main factions gave a hug and hand
shake to Ali Mahdi Mohamed and other members of his delegation,
the first of the Cairo signatories to reach the capital.
</P>
<P>
Most of the cheering crowds were expected to see a return of
the factional leaders together. However, their hope has dashed
following a minor misunderstanding between the joint technical
committee.
</P>
<P>
During the speeches at Ali Mahdi's residence, Issa Weheliye
Malin, a member of the welcoming committee told the people that
Mogadishu will be a peaceful place if an equal effort is exerted
on pacifying the capital just as the factional leaders do at the
welcome ceremony today.
</P>
<P>
"This is the beginning of a new hope for Mogadishu and Somalia
as a whole," said Mr Malin.
</P>
<P>
Among the people that welcomed and hugged Ali Mahdi's
delegation today is his main arch rival in North Mogadishu,
religious leader Sheikh Ali Sheikh Mohamud (Sheikh Ali Dhere).
The conflicts between them led to the collapse of the Islamic
courts in North Mogadishu. And the two men embraced each other at
the airport to show to the public a sign of forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
The North Mogadishu faction leader, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, has
urged the Somalis to take and implement the historic Cairo
agreement reached by his National Salvation Council Alliance and
Hussein Aidid last year.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the people of Mogadishu to orchestrate a
similar warm welcome later for Hussein Aidid and other factions.
</P>
<P>
Aidid and Osman Atto who are currently in Cairo are expected
to arrive together at km-50 road Sunday according to the
preparatory committee for a mild reception of the leaders.

<HEADLINE> Seminar Discusses How China's Rural Firms Can Clean Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and foreign
environmental experts gathered in the city of Xiamen in the
southeastern Chinese province of Fujian yesterday to discuss ways
to help the country's rural firms clean up their production
methods.
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that the question of whether China can reach its
environmental protection goals by the year 2000 depends largely on
the extent to which it can control pollution caused by the growing
number of township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A recent study by the National Environmental Protection Agency
and the Ministry of Agriculture found that township enterprises,
which are often small in scale but big in energy consumption, are
responsible for half the industrial pollution in China.
</P>
<P>
Experts suggest that cleaner production methods be used to cut
pollution to a minimum. At the seminar they discussed
concrete ways to standardize practice, set up administrative
agencies, designate piloting firms, and train personnel.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was sponsored by the China Environment and
Development International Cooperation Commission.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Rejects Talks With US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Friday rejected any talks and ties with
the United States, saying they would be harmful to the Iranian
nation and the Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the prayer congregation on the campus of Tehran
University in the morning, Khamenei said that as before Iran would
stand firmly on its stances and would never abandon its values and
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
"The Iranian nation stands against the United States, regards
it as 'Great Satan,' and even dislikes to speak to it," Tehran
radio quoted the Iranian leader as saying.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Khamenei's strong-worded remark was
unexpected, particularly for the United States. This came after
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami called for cultural dialog
between Iranian and American nations although he said there was
"no need to have ties with the U.S.."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that any talks and ties with the U.S. would
damage the Islamic Revolution led by the Iranian late supreme
leader Imam Khomeini and would make the country lose its
independence "which was achieved by the Iranian nation through
struggle against the world powers for over one century."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei lashed out at the U.S. Administration and U.S. media
for "making hue and cry" over Khatami's interview with the Cable
News Network (CNN) last week, rejecting "the claims that Khatami's
remarks indicated Iran's demand for resumption of ties with the
United States."
</P>
<P>
"The claims are baseless and cruel to the Iranian nation
and President Khatami," he said, adding that "the Iranian
nation, the youth in particular, should realize the real goals
of this kind of dangerous propaganda and should be cautious
to the actions of the enemies."
</P>
<P>
He lauded Khatami for his statement that "we feel no need to
have relations with the U.S.," saying that the president well
explained all the principled stances of the country, particularly
Iran's ties with the U.S. and the issue of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei noted that there were some evil objectives behind the
"hue and cry" of the U.S. officials and media, saying that the
U.S. Administration intends to create differences among Iranian
officials in order to damage the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is important for the U.S. to bring Iran to the
negotiation table, because Washington wants to create a uni-polar
world and wanted to be the leader of the world while "Iran is the
only country that does not submit itself to the U.S.."
</P>
<P>
He termed Iran and the United States as two rival polars
during the past two decades, saying that Tehran-Washington talks
are important for the U.S. because "it wanted to show that the
polar of the Islamic resistance failed in the confrontation."
</P>
<P>
He regarded the severance of diplomatic relations between Iran
and the U.S. as "natural result of the U.S. cruel behaviors" in
Iran, lauding the Iranian students who occupied the U.S. embassy
in Tehran in November, 1979.
</P>
<P>
He also attacked Washington for its support to Israel, saying
that "the Israeli regime, as what President Khatami said, is a
terrorist state and the U.S. support for such a state is enough
for Iranian nation to fight against it."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also rejected that claims that the problems and
difficulties Iran is facing are the result of the severance of
Tehran-Washington relations, saying that facts show that talks and
ties with the U.S. would never solve the problems and difficulties
in Iran.
</P>
<P>
He termed the U.S. efforts to isolate Iran as a "failure,"
stressing that the efforts to isolate Iran would never have effect.
</P>
<P>
However, like Khatami, the Iranian leader also stressed that
Iran is not against the American nation, but the
U.S. Administration, saying that "we have repeatedly stated the
U.S. government, not the American people, is the enemy of the
Iranian country, nation and the Islamic system."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Waste Importer in China Ordered to Pay Compensatory Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A company that imported waste
products from outside China was ordered by a court in the eastern
Chinese province of Shandong today to pay 124,920 US dollars in
compensation for losses suffered by a shipping company.
</P>
<P>
The importer, Shandong Weifang Fuxiang Paper Co. Ltd, was
discovered in June 1996 to be importing containers of wastes from
the U.S. that could pollute the environment. It issued a statement
saying that it was giving up the practice, and left the waste at
an international goods distribution center for more than a year
and a half.
</P>
<P>
The shipper, the China Ocean-Going Shipping (Group) Corp., then
filed a lawsuit against the company, and an investigation revealed
that the wastes included surgical gowns and gloves, shoes,
stockings, cans, clothes hangers, bottles, plastic buckets, and
bags.
</P>
<P>
Fuxiang Paper left the imported items on center's grounds
saying that they were not the same as the items listed in the
contract.
</P>
<P>
According to today's verdict, Fuxiang Paper must remove the
items from the plaintiff's property within ten days.

BONN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Deutsche Telekom Friday reported
it achieved 3.3 billion marks (1.8 billion U.S. dollars) in
profits last year, up strongly from the 1.8 billion marks (1.0
billion dollars) in 1996, lower, however, than earlier expected.
</P>
<P>
Telekom previously projected that profits would come to 5 billion

turnover for 1997 reached 67.1 billion marks (36.6 billion dollars),
up 6.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Pro-Islamic Party RP Shut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- President of Turkey's
Constitutional Court Ahmet Necdet Sezer Friday announced the
closure of Turkey's pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) headed by
former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Sezer made the announcement following the voting of the members
of the Constitutional Court on the ban with nine for and two
against, which started at 14:30 local time (12:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Under the decision, the status of Erbakan's deputy and other
five RP deputies in the parliament would be canceled when the
Turkish Official Gazette is published, said Sezer.
</P>
<P>
The case, demanding the Islamist party be shut down on the
grounds of its support for fundamentalism, was filed by Turkey's
High Appeals Court Chief Prosecutor Vural Savas with the
Constitutional Court last May.
</P>
<P>
Security was tightened around the building of the
Constitutional Court during the meeting on the closure of the RP.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of reporters and correspondents waited outside the
building for the verdict.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkey's Party Law, Erbakan and some senior RP
officials will be banned from engaging in politics for at least
five years if the party is outlawed.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, 71, resigned as prime minister last June under
pressure from the pro-secular military which criticized him for
his reluctance to take tough measures against fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan's political career started in 1967. He became the
chairman of the National Order Party. After the closure of this
party by the Constitutional Court, Erbakan went abroad and stayed
out of politics for a while.
</P>
<P>
He returned to Turkey and continued his political career with
the National Salvation Party. This party was banned again during
the the military coup on September 12, 1980 and Erbakan was
imprisoned in a military jail for a few years.
</P>
<P>
Following his release, Erbakan joined the RP, which was
founded on July 19, 1983, and became the leader of the party in
1987.

<HEADLINE> Oil Products Prices Hiked in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' energy
authorities on Friday finally agreed to hike the prices of
petroleum products by an average 6.2 percent to avert a petroleum
product shortage in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Energy Regulatory Board under the Department of Energy said
in an order that the prices of all oil products but liquefied
petroleum gas will be raised as of Friday afternoon by an average
of 0.53 pesos (1.3 U.S. cents) per liter.
</P>
<P>
The board said that the issuance of the provisional authority
for the country's three major oil firms to increase petroleum
prices was needed to ensure that the public get an adequate supply
of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The country's three oil firms -- Petron, Pilipinas Shell and
Caltex
-- earlier warned in their petition filed to the board that their
ability to absorb the losses due to the peso depreciation has
reached "a critical point."
</P>
<P>
The three firms said they could no longer guarantee their
capacity to maintain full supply levels to homes and industries.
</P>
<P>
They had already stopped importation of crude oil and refined
oil products last month after the Energy Regulatory Board rejected
their requests to hike oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso has so far lost more than 50 percent in its
value against the U.S. dollar since its de facto devaluation in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil companies were stripped of the right to
determine oil prices in November last year after the Supreme Court
abolished the nine-month-old oil deregulation law designed to
liberalize the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The Energy Regulatory Board had repeatedly rejected the demand
for oil price hikes for fears of massive protests by labor
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Urges Improvement of Road Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has urged traffic authorities in his country to
take stricter measures to stop road accidents.
</P>
<P>
In a message of condolences sent Thursday to the bereaved
families of 25 people killed in a bus accident Wednesday, Mkapa
called on people to cooperate with the authorities in combating
dangerous driving, press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
"You should report to the police reckless bus drivers," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the message, the president said it is "disheartening" to
note that innocent Tanzanians continued to perish in road
accidents.
</P>
<P>
Police said the driver of the bus was driving at high speed
competing with another bus before it overturned, resulting the
death toll of 25 people.
</P>
<P>
Drivers of both buses escaped unhurt and they are being
questioned by the police.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Fredrick T. Sumaye said he was
shocked by the accident, the worst this year.
</P>
<P>
It is also Tanzania's worst traffic accident in the last three
months. On November 16 last year, a mini-bus driving at high
speed hit the road embankment in the northern region of Mara,
killing 17 people and seriously injuring eight others.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicated that between January and September last
year, 1,249 people were killed and 10,195 others injured in
11,420 road and railway accidents.
</P>
<P>
The government has repeatedly called for an end of driving
with overspeed, but only to the deaf ear of a number of drivers.
The traffic authorities have even equipped buses with speed
limits in an attempt to reduce the driving speed. However,
drivers play tricks to tamper with the devices.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Tanzanian Licensing Authority announced to
suspend transport licenses of 46 bus drivers who were found to be
driving with tampered limits, for three months beginning January
12.

GENEVA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Influenza Type A (H5N1)

"They also do not indicate whether domestic ducks raised on

having more than 100 square meters.
</P>
<P>
University teachers' housing has lagged behind other
development, and of the 180,000 families with a poor housing, the
majority are young, Li said, adding that this problem must be
solved in major universities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Culture Liu Zhongde
told the ministry's annual meeting today that 1997 was a
historical year for culture and arts in China and that artists
held the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory high.
</P>
<P>
Advances were made in reforming state-owned theatrical troupes,
which were badly influenced by Soviet methods and sluggish.
</P>
<P>
There were more artistic performances last year like the
country's fifth art festival, he said, and the climax was an
evening performance to celebrate the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
He also said that China investigated a certain amount of
illegal activities in the sector, and that vulgar performances and
beauty contests have been curbed, but that highbrow arts,
traditional arts, and healthy pop arts are going through a good
period.
</P>
<P>
He praised cultural exchanges with foreign countries and the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Taiwan, and Macao, and
the effort to limit decadent foreign culture.
</P>
<P>
The major problems are a shortage of funds and a lack of very
good artistic works, the minister concluded.

PARIS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- France expressed concern Friday
over the most recent decision by Israel to exclude the greater
part of the West Bank from its negotiations with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"This decision does not appear to us to be in the nature of
restoring confidence between the two sides," French Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said.
</P>
<P>
"We even fear that it could close the door to the
implementation of the agreements on Palestinian autonomy," she
said.

<P>
The spokeswoman hoped the Washington trips of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
next week could help the leaders "find the field of understanding."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has decided to retain control of 60
percent of the territories of the West Bank, even after peace
returns to the Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
The territories marked by Israel include the Valley of Jordan,
the lands along the border of Israel, the area around Jerusalem
and those covering 148 Jewish settlements and their surroundings.

"Wu is my best friend," Chen said. "I'm as happy as she is."

<P>
In the women's 4x100m medley relay, Jenny Thompson grabbed her
fourth title here as she led Lea Maurer, Kristy Kowal and Amy van
Dyken to the top of podium.
</P>
<P>
The American quartet timed 4:01.93, 3.19 seconds clear of
second-placed Australia. Japan got the bronze medal in 4:06.27.
</P>
<P>
Olena Zhupyna made it a golden double on Friday, winning the
women's platform synchronized diving.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Arms inspection team
headed by American Scott Ritter left Baghdad Friday after Iraq has
blocked it from carrying out missions for two consecutive days on
the ground that the composition of the team lacks balance.
</P>
<P>
Ritter, head of the 16-member U.N. arms inspection team,
including nine Americans and five Britons, held a news conference
Friday outside the U.N. Special Commission on disarmament in Iraq
(UNSCOM) headquarters in Baghdad before they left here.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be back," said Ritter, who was accused by Iraq of an
American spy. He added that "the departure of this team in no way
reflects a change in UNSCOM's determination to conduct
inspections."
</P>
<P>
Iraq barred the team, which arrived in Baghdad on Monday, from
carrying out its work from Tuesday on the ground that the
composition of this team does not reflect a balanced
participation of permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for us to leave and let the business of what is
going to happen next go to the (UNSCOM) executive chairman." said
Ritter.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, the chief U.N. arms inspector, will visit
Baghdad on January 19-21 to hold talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz on the issue of U.N. inspectors' access to
Iraqi presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM decided on Thursday to withdraw Ritter's team a day
earlier than scheduled. The team was supposed to leave on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The team was blocked on Tuesday and Wednesday from carrying
out its work and after orders from Butler they did not make
another attempt on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Other U.N. inspectors have been able to carry out their work
with no limitations.

Hong Kong," Hearder commented.
</P>
<P>
Of the new court insolvency cases, there were 503 new
compulsory liquidations of companies and 639 new bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
The number of new compulsory liquidations was about 0.1 percent
of the total number of companies, or 1 percent of the number of
new companies incorporated during the year, he added.
</P>
<P>
The nature of the businesses which were the subject of
compulsory liquidation and bankruptcy included garment, knitting
and textile manufacturing, restaurant and canteen, import and
export as well as construction and engineering.

<HEADLINE> China Plans To Reform Publishing, Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China plans to make the press
and the publishing business more market oriented and
industrialized, according to a national press and publications
conference that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that publishing houses would be made more
efficient and management and operations improved. China will also
establish some publishing and newspaper groups.
</P>
<P>
China's publishing houses and big bookstores are all run by the
state and the planned economy has long been their mode of
operation. So, bookstores at the county level will be introduced
to the leasing, contract, share holding, and cooperative system to
topple the old form of ownership, and chain stores will be
encouraged.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, it was decided that some state-owned printing
houses will become companies and some newspapers will be selected
for management reforms on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
China is a publishing giant, releasing more than 100,000 titles
annually, but many of them are poorly written and do not appeal to
readers, because market needs are seldom considered.
</P>
<P>
Although the sector will become more industrialized and market
oriented in the future, moral and social effect will still be a
major consideration, according to Yu Youxian, director of the
Press and Publications Administration.

<HEADLINE> French Banker Says Asian Crisis Won't End in 6 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- President of the French banking
group Paribas, Andre Levy-Lang, said Friday that it is not likely
the Asian financial crisis will end in six months.
</P>
<P>
``This is a crisis of rebounding. It will mark the year 1998,''
Levy-Lang said in the French economic daily La Tribune.
</P>
<P>
He said Paribas began to exercise prudence in Asian investments
beginning in 1997. In 1997, the organization invested 9 billion
U.S. dollars in Asian countries, excluding Japan, and 4.5 billion
francs (750 million dollars) in Japanese banks.
</P>
<P>
Other French commercial banks, such as La Societe Generale, le
Credit Lyonnais, and the Bank Nationale de Paris (BNP) have also
invested heavily in Asia.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Sustainable development will
be placed firmly in the center of government policy formulation
and strategic planning, a Hong Kong official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
It will also form the central theme of a new White Paper on the
Environment to be published in 2000, said Deputy Secretary for
Planning, Environment and Lands Benjamin Tang.
</P>
<P>
He told government green managers at the second Green Manager
Plenum that the government is committed to ensuring that Hong Kong
becomes a world class city and acknowledges that this requires a
first class environment.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this objective, we need to do more than we have
been able to so far and strike a better balance amongst economic
and social development and the environment," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
It means that each and every bureau and department of the
government will have a much greater responsibility for
environmental concerns, he added.
</P>
<P>
The green managers were updated on recent developments in
environmental protection and green management: the trial on the
use of liquefied petroleum gas for taxis, the signing of a new
agreement with Canada on environmental cooperation, and the
stepped-up cooperation with neighboring Guangdong province in the
field.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Li Tieying, member of the
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party's Central
Committee and state concilor, strongly condemned the ugly doping
offences here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of directors of the provincial sports
committees, Li Tieying said the drug cases at the World Swimming
Championships damaged the image of the Chinese sports.
</P>
<P>
The International Swimming Federation announced on January 11
four Chinese swimmers were tested positive in their A samples in
an out-of-competition test at the World Swimming Championships in
Perth, Australia, and a swimmer and her coach were caught of
trafficking in banned substances by the Sydney Customs on January
8.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying said drug abuse is a kind of corruption and
immorality in sports. The scandal smeared the reputation of the
Chinese sports.
</P>
<P>
The annual meeting of the directors of the provincial sports
committees and organizations started on January 12 and ended here
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Li said to the delegates that it is a long-term struggle to
fight against drug abuses in sports and the stance of the Chinese
government against doping is firm, unequivocal and persistant.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government firmly supports the principle and
unremitting efforts of the Chinese Olympic Committee in the
anti-doping campaign," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Chinese sports fields should implement
the strictest and the most effective measures in the fight against
doping.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Chinese Satisfied with Their Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A survey has shown that most
Chinese believe the society of China is stable and more than 80
percent of them are satisfied with their lives.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS), reports that government officials regard
sustained economic development, political stability and improved
living standards are the criteria of a stable society, and the
rapid economic development and low inflation in 1997 provided a
basis for that.
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts from some 20 government departments and
academic institutions discussed some of these at a meeting today.
</P>
<P>
They say that 112 million people have bought pension insurance
policies and 206 cities have established a minimum wage system to
guarantee a certain income.
</P>
<P>
Income of urban and rural people in 1997 were up seven percent
on 1996 and bank deposits were up 18 percent. Economists estimate
that the amount of capital and assets held by ordinary Chinese has
grown to 7 trillion yuan (870 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The improvements in living standards and market supply have
made the society even more stable, says Li Peilin, a sociologist,
who participated in the survey. Li attributed this to
urbanization, changes in employment, fewer crimes, and the return
of Hong Kong to the motherland, which has increased the Chinese
people's national pride.
</P>
<P>
However, experts say that unemployment is still a major
problem which, coupled with social welfare and the reform in
state-owned enterprises, is causing public concern.
</P>
<P>
The CASS researchers suggest that the macro-economic control be
maintained in 1998, and the reform of the social welfare system be
stepped up.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Issue "Year of Tiger" Stamps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to issue a set of new
stamps featuring the "Lunar Year of the Tiger" in 1998 on Sunday
to mark the Chinese lunar year, a Macao posts official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Lopes, director of the Macao Posts and
Telecommunications Department (CTT), announced at a press
conference on Friday that a total of 2.3 million pieces of the new
stamps, with a face value of 5.5 patacas (0.69 US dollars), will be
issued.
</P>
<P>
Legend has it that tiger was fundamentally a terrifying entity
in ancient China. Its mask would repel the malignant spirits or
demons; thus it was displayed at the courts' doors to drive away
the spirits of injustice and of corruption. Its power as a guard
could also be witnessed in the stone sculptures placed by graves.
</P>
<P>
Collection of such stamps issued in Macao has become
increasingly popular. Macao issued 500,000 pieces of stamps for
the Year of the Rat in 1996, and 1.5 million pieces for the Year
of Ox in 1997. Officials said that the demand may outnumber the
planned 2.3 million this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 sets of stamps were issued last year,
contributing about 200 million patacas of gross income for
CTT. Lopes said that his department has decided to raise the
benchmark of each new issue from 1.5 million pieces in 1997 to
2.1 million pieces this year to meet increasing demand of Macao
stamps.

JAKARTA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad is scheduled to arrive here Saturday morning to
meet with President Soeharto and discuss the regional economic and
financial crisis, a senior official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I think the reason for the Malaysian prime minister's visit is
the same as the recent visit of Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chock
Tong. They will discuss the monetary crisis in our region,"
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono also said that on Thursday night, at about 23:00
local time, President Soeharto spoke by phone with U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"President Soeharto expressed his gratitude to President
Clinton and the American people for their attention to Indonesia
in overcoming the monetary crisis," Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was pleased with the results of talks between
Soeharto and IMF (International Monetary Fund) Managing Director
Michel Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, like other Southeast Asian countries, has been badly
hit by the current monetary crisis. The rupiah has lost more than
200 percent of its value against the US dollar since July last
year.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, Indonesia agreed to an IMF-led 23 billion
dollars bailout package. In exchange, Indonesia vowed to dismantle
trading monopoly, overhaul the financial sector and scrap or
suspend costly infrastructure projects.

<HEADLINE> British Trade Secretary Vows to Build Strong Ties With Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The British Government is
"absolutely determined" to build a strong and close relationship
at every level with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) of China, a senior British trade official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon organized by the British Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong, Margaret Beckett, president of the British
Board of Trade, said that although Britain's political
relationship with Hong Kong changed on July 1, 1997, all those
other links which have bound Britain and Hong Kong together remain
firmly in place.
</P>
<P>
These include the business links and the massive levels of
British investment in Hong Kong, said Beckett, who arrived in Hong
Kong Thursday for a four-day visit following her trips to Beijing
and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Two way trade flows between Britain and Hong Kong are now
running at over seven billion pounds (about 11.3 billion U.S.
dollars) per year. Hong Kong is now Britain's 12th largest export
market.
</P>
<P>
Total British investment in Hong Kong now stands at over 145.4
billion Hong Kong dollars (18.64 billion U.S. dollars) and
accounts for over 25 percent of all external investment in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
There are around 1,000 British companies with offices in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"These are staggering figures which indisputably make Hong Kong
the most important hub for British business in Asia," Beckett
said.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that our commercial links will deepen and grow
over the coming years," she added.
</P>
<P>
Beckett said that while there may continue to be difficult
times ahead for Hong Kong, Britain's confidence in Hong Kong's
strong economic fundamentals remains undiminished.
</P>
<P>
Whilst the Asian financial crisis may have impacted upon Hong
Kong's own prospects for growth in the short term, what has been
impressive has been the robust way in which it has been handled by
the authorities here, Beckett said.
</P>
<P>
She recalled that when British Prime Minister Tony Blair met
Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Hong Kong last June Blair said
that Britain saw the transfer of Hong Kong as a bridge not a
barrier to its future relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
"What struck me most during my recent visit to Beijing and
Shanghai was the genuine enthusiasm amongst Chinese leaders for a
strong and positive business relationship with Britain," Beckett
told members of the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The size of China's economy and its ability to maintain
manageable and sustainable growth rates whilst bringing inflation
down to low single figures means it is a market which any British
company that is serious about a long term exporting strategy
cannot afford to ignore.
</P>
<P>
"In this respect the role of Hong Kong is particularly
important," Beckett said.
</P>
<P>
"I should also say how much we in Britain have been encouraged
and heartened by the recent clear public affirmations by senior
Chinese leaders that they are fully committed to the principle of
'one country, two systems' as enshrined in the Joint Declaration,"
Beckett said. She added that this gives a strong boost to
confidence in Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
Friday morning, Beckett opened the 1998 British Education
Festival at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the festival, Beckett said
that it was a great pleasure for her to be in Hong Kong just
over six months after the handover and she was delighted to see
how smooth the transition has been.
</P>
<P>
Beckett was scheduled to meet Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Friday
afternoon and visit the new airport at Chek Lap Kok Saturday.

BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The State Pharmaceutical
Administration of China (SPAC) has urged Chinese pharmaceutical
companies to attach great importance to developing new drugs to
increase market shares both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The administration has called on the sector to inject increased
capital into hi-tech projects and the development of new drugs
during 1998. SPAC sources say the government will provide
additional funding for related efforts.
</P>
<P>
Fifty of the nation's most competent drug manufacturers will be
selected to lead the giant industry which has long been dominated
by the production of medicinal raw materials and imitations of
foreign products.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises will be expected to contribute more than 60
percent of the industry's annual sales volume, and allocate from
3-5 percent of annual sales to developing new products.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors will be encouraged to invest in hi-tech drug
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,500 Chinese pharmaceutical enterprises currently produce
1,350 types of medicinal raw materials annually, with China
ranking second in the world in terms of both the production and
exports of pharmaceutical materials.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the ongoing national project centers on developing
10 types of new drugs and establishing a network of research
centers to select new drugs, assess safety and conduct clinical
research.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today
condemned a decision of the Israeli cabinet to retain large parts
of the West Bank in any final settlement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"This step by the Israeli cabinet is yet another preemptive
attempt to create facts on the ground, which make a mockery of
the Oslo Accords and sincere efforts to reach negotiated
solutions for a durable peace in the Middle East," South African
Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Israel must accept that this type of action
can only compound an increasing lack of understanding among the
international community for Israel's cause, ultimately leading to
a further hardening of attitudes and undermining of the very
goals the Netanyahu government states it wishes to achieve."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet announced Wednesday that certain strategic
positions in West Bank are vital to Israel's national security
and interests and that those positions will never be given up in
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The Department (of Foreign Affairs of South Africa) reaffirms
that Israel's occupation and settlement of the West Bank is
illegal in terms of international law and contrary to various
United Nations Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"Israel therefore has no legitimate pre-existing claim to any
territory, road or water resource in the West Bank," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa urged Israel to negotiate with the Palestinians
on this issue.
</P>
<P>
"These issues fall within the parameters of "final status
issues" as defined by the Oslo Accords and must still be
negotiated with the Palestinians."

<P>
WUHAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- An environmental official has
called on Chinese society to pay serious attention to the
worsening pollution problems along the Yangtze River, the
country's longest river.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for the country to effectively control
pollution along the Yangtze in order to avoid repeating the
ill-fated Huaihe River," according to Yang Zhenghuai, vice
director of the Environment and Resources Protection Committee of
the National People's Congress, China's top legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Yang was in Wuhan to preside over a meeting on protecting
Yangtze River water resources. Some 30 large enterprises attending
the meeting which ended yesterday, including the Wuhan Iron and
Steel Corp. and Yangtze Petrochemical Corp., proposed that
factories and enterprises along the river protect related
resources "as if they were protecting their mothers" and to strive
to ensure a pollution-free Yangtze in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River, the third longest river in the world, flows
from the west to the east and meanders through 11 provinces and
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the National Environmental Protection Agency
(NEPA) show that some 15 billion tons of waste waster are
discharged into the river annually.

the river, a pollution belt stretching 565 km. has formed between
25 coastal cities, with increasing water contamination in many
areas.
</P>
<P>
"The dry-up in various sections of the Yellow River and
serious pollution problems along the Huaihe River have sounded alarm
bells. We cannot afford to delay efforts to save the Yangtze
River," said Yang, who also expressed his appreciation for the
proposal tabled by enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for gradually readjusting industrial and
production structures, introducing advanced technology, promoting
clean production and reducing discharges to a minimum.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Does Not Need IMF Programs to Recover Its </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia does not need
International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs to help its economy to
recover, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has a strong economic fundamentals and in the past few
months the authorities have taken important preemptive measures to
address the situation, particularly on the fiscal side, Camdessus
said at a news conference at the end of his two-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said he applauded the measures notably in the
economic package announced by Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim last month.
</P>
<P>
The austerity measures announced by Anwar include scaling down
of economic growth from seven percent to between four and five
percent, deferring large projects, cutting government expenditure
by 18 percent, curbing credit growth and ensuring loans for
productive sectors only.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief was of the view that Malaysia's financial
position was strong and there was no need to raise taxes and that
the country's fiscal position was also sufficiently strong.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there was a need for Malaysia to continue
strengthening its policies, particularly on the monetary side, to
achieve a better policy mix in efforts to secure market confidence
given the volatile currency markets and exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia does not need a Fund (IMF) program to achieve this.
Our strategy is to help Malaysia as much as Malaysia wishes to
continue solving its problems on its own," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the IMF team, which is here for consultations,
would come back in March to further discuss the implementation of
the tough measures that Malaysia has taken so far.
</P>
<P>
To a question on the structural reforms that Malaysia could
undertake, the IMF chief said the system of control of prices of
goods as well as intervention by the government in certain
economic areas "certainly has to be re-analyzed and possibly
canceled."
</P>
<P>
On Malaysia's proposed mergers of local financial institutions,
Camdessus welcomed the move as it would lead to reinforcing their
positions and increasing their competitive edge when the local
financial market was further liberalized.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus told reporters the reforms being taken by the
affected regional economies such as Indonesia, South Korea and
Thailand with the IMF assistance.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said he was pretty certain that it would take about
two and a half years for the countries in the region to recover
back to their high growth in a more sustainable way and eventually
put them in a better position.
</P>
<P>
"Our work is to help countries to establish confidence among
international investors...this is in our chapter but not in
whatever miracle way...we help them in their policies and
reestablish confidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus, who flew in from Indonesia Thursday afternoon, met
Mahathir Friday and Anwar Thursday evening to discuss the current
economic problems facing several Asian countries, including
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus is visiting a number of Asian countries, including
South Korea, in efforts to mitigate the economic crisis facing the
region.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus is leaving for Singapore later Friday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Academy Expands International Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CASS) sent 5,100 people to study or work overseas, and hosted
visits by 2,050 foreign scholars and officials during 1997,
according to CAAS President Lu Yongxiang.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign-funded cooperative projects also grew,
with foreign partners providing 89 million yuan in funding and
scientific equipment, some 50 percent of which came from Japan,
said Lu.
</P>
<P>
Financial aid from international organizations enabled CAAS
members to attend international symposia and launch new research
projects, said Lu, adding that the CAAS has expanded cooperation
with enterprises in a number of countries and regions, including
Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Lu said China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong has
greatly promoted cooperation with universities and institutes in
the new administrative region. More than 800 CAAS members visited
Hong Kong to participate in various projects during 1997. In
addition, the CAAS and universities in Hong Kong jointly
established laboratories in wide-ranging fields, including the
life sciences, bioengineering and information sciences.
</P>
<P>
The CAAS also developed scientific cooperation with
institutions in Taiwan. Some 180 members visited Taiwan for short
visits, with additional 20 members working on mid- to long-term
projects. The academy hosted visits by more than 400 scholars
and researchers from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The CAAS plans to invite 100 foreign scholars to work in the
academy during 1998, said Lu.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Secretariat To Be Relocated at Waterfront Tamar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tamar basin reclamation
site will be withdrawn from the land sales program and be
earmarked for relocating the existing Government Secretariat,
Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands Bowen Leung said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The site, located between the Prince of Wales Building and the
CITIC Tower, occupies an area of 2.56 hectares on the waterfront
of Victoria Harbor. About half of the site was scheduled for
auction in March 1998 under the 1997/1998 Land Sales Program.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that the Government Secretariat located in the
Central Government Offices at Lower Albert Road and Murray
Building at Garden Road has been experiencing a severe shortage of
space for some years.
</P>
<P>
"A number of bureaux are now housed elsewhere in Central or
Wanchai," he added.
</P>
<P>
"In order to meet present and future needs for office space and
the new requirement as a Special Administrative Region, the
government has been searching for some time for a suitable site
for relocating the Government Secretariat," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tamar site has now been identified as the most suitable
site and will therefore be withdrawn from sale.
</P>
<P>
The sites occupied by the existing Central Government Offices
and Murray Building have a total area of 2.43 hectares. They will
be considered for commercial use after the relocation of the
Government Secretariat.

<HEADLINE> New Type of Public Bus Put in Use in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A new type of 20-seat bus that
are most suitable to Macao's narrow roads was put into use here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
With a capacity of accommodating 49 passengers at the peak
period, the new bus is one meter longer, 0.30 meter wider and
0.135 meter higher than the 20-seat bus currently in use in
Macao. It is said to be the first of its kind in Macao, Hong Kong
and China's inland.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the new bus can best cope with Macao's roads,
which are characterized by its narrowness, sharp turns and
countless oneways. The densely-populated peninsula have some roads
which, when a bus moves ahead, no one can go by the bus.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hei Wan, managing director of the Transmac Public Bus
Company, said it is worthwhile although the new "Benz" brand bus
costs two to three times as much the old 20-seat bus bought from
Japan.
</P>
<P>
"The new bus can carry more people at the peak time and
passengers are more comfortable on it," he told reporters at a
ceremony on Friday. "Passengers will also have more convenience in
getting on and off the bus."
</P>
<P>
Transmac and the Macao Public Bus Company are the two public
bus companies in Macao. Together they run more than 30 lines in
Macao Peninsula and its two islands. Public bus is the most
favored form of public transportation in Macao as it is
comfortable, convenient, and cheap.

</P>
<P>
Luo Bin, director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Defense

<HEADLINE> Fund to Upgrade Fire Safety Gear in HK Old Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A 200 million HK dollar (25.6
million U.S. dollars) fund will be created to help owners of Hong
Kong's old commercial buildings modernize fire safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
Owners of some 400 pre-1973 commercial buildings here are
thought to be the first batch of borrowers for the Fire
Improvement Fund.
</P>
<P>
No detailed criteria or ceiling for the fund has been fixed,
according to Deputy Secretary of Security Alex Fong Chi-wai.
</P>
<P>
Legislators' approval of the fund will be sought in March and
an advisory committee will be set up to vet loan applicants and
oversee the fund's revolving operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Potential borrowers also include owners of some of the 500
commercial buildings required to upgrade fire safety equipment by
a law proposed in 1994. The law, enacted last May, will be
extended to all 400 pre-1973 commercial buildings under the Fire
Safety Bill 1998 approved by the Executive Council of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region government.
</P>
<P>
Government officials hope to have the upgrading of the 400
blocks completed within three years.
</P>
<P>
Poor safety status in many of the old commercial buildings
poses great hazards to local residents. A blaze in the Garley
Building in Kowloon in November 1996, believed to be the worst
fire in Hong Kong over the past century, left 39 people dead and
81 injured.

<HEADLINE> More Victims Added to Pastor Murder List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- At least seven more victims
have been added to the suspected murder list of Hungary-born
pastor Andras Pandy, increasing the total to 13 now.
</P>
<P>
The addition came out as a result of initial laboratory
analysis of the human remains exhumed from within the houses of
the pastor last September in the Belgian capital city, according
to local television RTBF reports today.
</P>
<P>
Analysis, carried out at the KUL Human Heredity Research
Center, showed that the remains belonged to none of the six
reported missing members of the Pandy family.
</P>
<P>
The two ex-wives and four of the pastor's eight children were
feared killed by the pastor though Pandy claimed that they had
returned to Hungary where local police has been tracing their
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
The six Pandy family members were reported missing between 1986
and 1989.
</P>
<P>
Agnes Pandy, the eldest daughter of the pastor also detained by
the Belgian police on charges of assistance in the murder case,
told the police that the bodies of the six family members had been
dissolved in acid.
</P>
<P>
The new murder victims found in Pandy's houses were feared to
have come from Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have been trying to identify the victims but the
task proved to be difficult in that starting from 1980 more than
1,000 people had been reported missing in this country.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Iranian Leader Rejects Talks with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Friday rejects any talks and ties with
the United States, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made the remark at the Friday prayer congregation. He
said that any talks and ties with the "great Satan," the United
States, would be harmful to the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
"We feel no need to have relations with the United States, the
(Iranian) President (Mohammad Khatami) made a right statement" in
his recent interview with the American Cable News Network, Khamenei
said.
</P>
<P>
Lauding Khatami for his statement about the U.S. crimes against
the Iranian nation during the past half century, the Iranian
leader stated that "today Iran and the United States represent
two rival fronts, i.e. Islam and arrogance."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the strong words by the Iranian
leader indicated a dark future for any rapprochement between the
two sworn enemies, although Khatami called for cultural dialogue
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the United States severed diplomatic relations in 1980
after Iranian students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran.

<HEADLINE> HK to Clean Up Kai Tak Airport Site for Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government has
decided to carry out a 60 million HK dollar (7.69 million U.S.
dollars) clean-up operation after the closure of the Kai Tak
Airport in July to prepare the site for development.
</P>
<P>
Investigations conducted by the Environmental Protection
Department at the Kai Tak Airport site have found leaks of
aviation fuel and other toxic pollutants under the north apron.
Aircraft fuel leakage is a common problem at airports worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The Kai Tak Airport is to be replaced by the new Hong Kong
International Airport at Chek Lap Kok, which is now under
construction and scheduled to open in July, and the government
plans to use the site for a housing project.
</P>
<P>
The pollutants identified in the soil and water in the area
include such toxic and inflammable substances as petroleum,
benzene and methane.
</P>
<P>
Exposure to these substances could prove hazardous to health
and may lead to cancer, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Volatile pollutants are to be extracted by blowing air into the
soil while less volatile pollutants will be injected with oxygen
to remove their toxicity.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes to begin its housing construction project
on the 154-hectare site at the airport's north apron in Kwon Bay
by 1999.

</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair last night reassured older workers and those

</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The virulent strain of "bird flu" that broke out in Hong

<HEADLINE> Oil leak Suspends Export in Southeast Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Exports of two cargoes of crude oil
from a terminal in southeast Nigeria's Akwa Ibom State were postponed
on Thursday due to the continued loss of 100,000 barrels per day of oil
by the world giant Mobil operating there.
</P>
<P>
The exact volume of crude shipment affected by the deferment is yet
to be ascertained but Mobil officials figured the company could have
already lost 2.1 million U.S.Dollars, according to press reports
today.
</P>
<P>
Mobil last month pushed oil output of the joint venture with the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to 700,000 barrels per day. It
now has the production slashed to 600,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
But officials said the joint venture's target of hitting an output
level of 900,000 barrels per day in the next two years still remained
on course.
</P>
<P>
Mobil reported an oil spill of about 40,000 barrels resulting from
a leak in a pipeline running between a production platform and the Qua
Iboe terminal earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The affected 24-inch pipeline was installed in 1971 and was last
certified on May 1, 1991 for a period of 20 years up to 2011.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, more than half of the oil spill had been cleaned up,
while the slick formed by the spill on the ocean had started clearing
away, companies sources said.
</P>
<P>
The leaking pipeline is regarded to have precipitated the single
largest oil spill in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mobil officials said that the company is battling to have the spill
under control and minimize the impact on the environment, where
additional dispersant and equipment have been ordered from abroad.
</P>
<P>
The last incident of suspension in Nigeria's oil delivery was in
1994, when Shell Petroleum Development Company was constrained by an
oil workers strike to do so.

SHENZHEN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Chung Ying Street, on the
border with Hong Kong's New Territories, has 10 or 20 thousand
visitors every day, not only to see its ancient sites, but also
the inexpensive fashionable goods.
</P>
<P>
Some come just to see the changes instead of shopping, as did a
group of tourists from Heilongjiang Province in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
There are banners flying above the street announcing its
presence, and there is an old landmark from the Qing Dynasty. The
Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress decided to
keep the name of the 250-meter street, which runs through
Shatoujiao Town.
</P>
<P>
It is known as "one street with two social systems" and is
marked by eight boundary tablets. Chinese armed police and Hong
Kong police patrol the street every day on their respective sides.
</P>
<P>
The government of Shatoujiao has organized many clean-up
operations on the street, and the local industrial and commercial
administration cracked down on fake goods being sold in shops on
the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen authorities intend to promote tourism, shopping and
entertainment along the street, local officials say.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rise on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Share prices finished higher
as the strength in most regional stock markets lured buying on the
local bourse, with the Straits Times Industrials Index (STII)
reversing its early decline to end at 1245.26 points, up by 11.9
points.
</P>
<P>
The stability or firmness in regional currencies has also
stoked buying on the Singapore bourse, dealers said.

Moderate bargain hunting by overseas funds shored up the
market, especially the banking and property stocks, which led the
market's advance, they added.

<P>
The total market volume stood at 266.48 million units, valued
at 476.08 million Singapore dollars (273.61 million US dollars).

counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Wing Tai was the most actively traded counter as it registered
a turnover of 18.91 million units. It was followed by Renong Bhd
which had 15.9 million shares traded. Singapore Telecom was next
with 14.16 million shares changed hands.

the day as it rose by one dollar to end at 23 Singapore dollars.

while KL Kepong gained 58 cents to finish at 3.38 Singapore
dollars.
</P>

declined by 1.08 dollars to close at 1.22 Singapore dollars. Ipco
Warrant fell by 27 cents to finish at 1.02 Singapore dollars.

NEW DELHI, January 16 (Xinhua)-- 12,999 more Chakma refugees
have returned to their homeland in Bangladesh in the last
fortnight, official sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 25,285 Chakmas had been repatriated from India's
Tripura State Since 1994 to Chittagong Hill Tract of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
About 60,000 Bangladeshi tribals, mostly Chakmas, had crossed
over to Tripura on various occasions since April 1986, following
disturbances in the Chittagong Hill Tract areas.
</P>
<P>
The final phase of repatriation started following the assurance
by Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to the Chakma leaders
that the 20-point agreement signed on March 9 last year in India's
Agartala would be implemented. Under the agreement, both India and
Bangladesh would provide some economic assistance to those
refugees who return to their homeland, the Bangladesh government

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Daily Oil Output to up 60,000 Barrels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's crude oil output is to
increase by 60,000 barrels a day following the start-up of oil
production in a new oil field late last month.
</P>
<P>
The Ofon Field, scheduled to go on stream this month, is jointly
developed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and
the world oil giant Elf, at a cost of 300 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The production capacity of 60,000 barrels per day is to be attained
fully by the turn of the century, an equivalent of three percent to
the country's current daily total, the Daily Times reported today,
quoting Elf officials.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has projected a revenue of 9.833 billion
U.S. Dollars from crude oil in this year's budget, based on a
production level of 2.175 million barrels per day and official selling
price of 17 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The production capacity of the country however is expected to be on
the rise as Shell, which accounts for about 60 percent of Nigeria's
oil production, said two days ago that it might have a breakthrough in
production in deep offshore fields.

<HEADLINE> India to Introduce Eurotrain Explorer Pass Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 16 (Xinhua)-- India is to introduce a
Eurotrain Explorer Pass Scheme (EEPS) for foreign National and
non-resident Indians, similar to Indrail Pass, against payment in
foreign exchange to attract more foreign tourists, the Railway
Ministry announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The scheme was formulated following a proposal from
Denmark-based M/S Eurotrain International for introduction of
explorer pass on Indian railways. Under the scheme, an explorer
pass holder will get the pass exchanged at pre-determined
locations in India with Indrail pass before traveling on Indian
railways.
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, railways have decided to expand the network for
sale of Indrail pass in collaboration with Air India and Indian
Airlines. This strategic alliance with two national air carriers
will go a long way to offer an air-cum-rail ticket to travelers
residing abroad, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Indrail pass scheme has been introduced to facilitate foreign
tourists to travel on Indian railways without any restriction of
mileage or number of trips during the validity of the pass. At
present, Indrail passes are sold at important stations in India
and in 13 foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Gain 1.1 Percent on Asian Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
bounced off morning lows to finish more than one percent higher
Friday after a healthy gain on Japan's key Nikkei index brought
some much-needed confidence back to the market.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index added 29.5 points to 2614.0 with the
market struggling off a poor performance on Wall Street overnight
where the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 92.92 points, or
1.19 percent, to 7691.77.
</P>
<P>
The Australian market opened near its low for the day of 2571.4
before bouncing back on higher Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Henderson Charlton Jones dealer Scott Emms said the rally also
had been fueled by overseas institutional buying.
</P>
<P>
"There's a bit of positive sentiment coming out of the Asian
markets," Emms said.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index finished the day up 45.8 points at
4510.7 and the all resources was 17.2 points up at 1096.6.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Nikkei index surged 924.0 points to 16046.0 and Hong
Kong's Hang Seng climbed 264.5 points to 8843.4 in afternoon
trade.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 336.52 million shares valued at 846.44
million Australian dollars (550.18 million US dollars), with
rising stocks beating falling stocks by 549 to 477.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said one of the leading stocks behind the late rally
was Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which rocketed to the 9.00
Australian dollars mark during the day before resting up 21.9
cents, or 2.52 percent stronger, at 8.91 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other major movers included retailer Woolworths, which was one
of the most heavily traded shares and rose 18 cents.
</P>
<P>
Analysts and brokers said Woolworths shares have been propelled
by growing investor-enthusiasm about the retailer's interim sales
results - due out next week - after Harvey Norman Holdings Lt.'s
buoyant result Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among the resource companies, BHP was 18 cents higher, MIM was
one cent stronger and Rio Tinto gained 54.3 cents.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks also showed strong improvement thanks to a 5.90
rise in the gold bullion price. Bullion in Sydney closed at 287.75
US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Half US Cent Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar clawed
up by almost half an US cent Friday, inspired by a higher gold
price and improved Asian financial markets.
</P>
<P>
A fall in the US dollar against the Japanese yen also buoyed
the local dollar to end the week on a positive note.
</P>
<P>
The currency closed at 65.58 US cents, from 65.13 Thursday and
near its highs of the session.
</P>
<P>
Citibank Australia foreign exchange dealer Nigel Dobson said
there was a lot of two-way interest in the market.
</P>
<P>
"The yen strengthened overnight and I think that's indicative
of less negative sentiment coming out of Asia," Dobson said.
</P>
<P>
Sentiment in the region has been boosted by signs of an
improvement in the Asian crisis after the Indonesian government
and the IMF reached agreement on a revised reform program.
</P>
<P>
Reports that the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party may release
another economic stimulus package in March, featuring an extension
of the two trillion yen income tax cut to two to three years also
added support.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso, the South Korean won, the Taiwan dollar
and the Hong Kong dollar all strengthened Friday, counterbalancing
falls in the Indonesian rupiah, the Malaysian ringgit, the
Singapore dollar and the Thai baht.
</P>
<P>
The jump in the gold price provided further support for the
Australian dollar. Gold bullion in Sydney closed 5.25 higher at
287.75 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also ended at 84.02 yen from 85.13 and at
1.2021 marks from 1.1868.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Face Severe Drought: Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam forecast that a large
part of the country is to face severe drought, according local
press reports Friday.
</P>
<P>
The forecast was made by the General Department of
Hydrometerology based on the fact that rain gauges recorded in
those localities since the beginning of the year were lower than
previous corresponding periods.
</P>
<P>
Warmer weather in many localities has caused much concern among
farmers about the approach of a drought.
</P>
<P>
Average temperature in the northern region stood at 21-22
Celsius degrees or six degrees higher than the average of previous
years and the highest recorded temperatures in the last 41 years.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's central and southern provinces have also suffered
from warmer weather.
</P>
<P>
Water levels in rivers and reservoirs across the country are
low, dropping between 10-20 percent in the north and 20-25 percent
in the central and central highland regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile water levels in southern rivers have decreased by
0.4-0.5 meters compared to levels recorded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, the early intrusion of salt water to river mouths
is causing much concern among southern farmers.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's prime minister sent this week an official message,
requesting officials in the northern and northern central
provinces to map out effective measures to help farmers avoid crop
failure caused by warmer weather.
</P>
<P>
The message warned that transplanting over-mature rice
seedlings due to the prolonged warmer weather in the spring crop
would cause a sharp drop in rice yield.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The economic performance of 177
financially-troubled industrial firms in Tianjin, or more than
half of the city's money-losing enterprises, took a favorable turn
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five of them have eliminated deficits, said an
official of the Tianjin Municipal Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, an old industrial center, has 323 money-losing
enterprises which turn out less competitive products as a result of
obsolete equipment and poor management.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government take 20 measures last year to assist
those enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 22 such firms received 17 million yuan in loans for
use as operating capital. Consequently, their output value
increased by 18 percent and sales by 16 percent last year. Three
enterprises formerly in the red are now reporting profits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 1,200 redundant workers have either been urged to
retire or channeled into the service trade sector to
alleviate the burden of those enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Visit of Israeli Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi has denied the report that an Israeli
delegation had visited Iran, saying that Israel spread such rumors
in an effort to seek legitimation from Iran.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi Thursday termed the report about a visit of Israeli
technicians to Iran as "baseless rumors," according to Tehran
radio Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel made such baseless rumors about Israeli
demand for contacts with Iranian officials with the aim of
diverting the public opinion from Iran's anti-Israeli stance.
</P>
<P>
Iran has made several denials about contacts and cooperation
between Tehran and Tel Aviv since the beginning of this year,
saying that the reports were aimed at distorting Iran's image.
</P>
<P>
Tehran stressed that Iran would not recognize the Israeli
government due to its aggressive nature, calling on Islamic
countries to reconsider their relations with Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Iran broke off its diplomatic relations with Israel soon after
the Islamic Revolution in 1979, accusing Tel Aviv of occupying
Arab lands, particularly Jerusalem, the holy place for Muslims,
Jews and Christians.
</P>
<P>
However, media reports said that secret contacts and even
cooperation between the two sworn enemies had continued during the
past 18 years, although Iran repeatedly denied them.

SHIJIAZHUANG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.42 million
poor people in north China's Hebei Province rose above the
poverty line last year, a provincial official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The number of poverty-stricken people in Hebei has declined
from seven million to 2.44 million, or 4.6 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the success to financial aid and
technical guidance from other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 18 central government departments in Beijing
provided Hebei with a direct investment of 20 million yuan and
sent experts to Hebei to promote technological progress.
</P>
<P>
They have helped their partners in poor areas to dig 1,905
wells, build 121 pump stations to increase the irrigated
area by 60,660 hectares, bring electricity to 360 villages by
putting up 300-kilometer-long power-transmission lines and open
3,600 training courses.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Seek New Ways of Embalming Ancient Corpse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
successfully used a new biological plastination process to
preserve an ancient corpse of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),
keeping the body for three months at normal room temperature.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said it is a major breakthrough in embalming
ancient corpses. It is the first time in the world that an ancient
corpse has been treated this way, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
The process involves immersing the body in epoxy resin and
polymers for at least one week following antiseptic injection. The
body is placed on a special wooden bed for hardening.
</P>
<P>
The Ming Dynasty corpse was unearthed in Dongguan, a city in
South China's Guangdong Province, at the beginning of last
year. Cooperating with the Dongguang Museum, the Guangdong College
of Pharmacy used the biological plastination process after 10
months.
</P>
<P>
After plastination, the body has kept its original shape, color
and elasticity just as it was after being unearthed. The preserved
corpse is on exhibit in the Dongguan Museum.
</P>
<P>
In the past, unearthed ancient corpses were kept in a
formaldehyde solution or in a half dry-half wet manner. The
ancient bodies would become dry, deformed and change color over
time.
</P>
<P>
The new method is considered better than the formaldehyde
treatment as the plasticized corpses do not have a bad odor, are
non-toxic and cannot easily be damaged.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong College of Pharmacy introduced the technology from
abroad and has established a biological plastination lab.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Scientists Develop Silage from Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan scientists have
successfully developed silage from water hyacinth, The New Vision
reported today.
</P>
<P>
David Mutetikka, a senior animal science lecturer in the
faculty of agriculture in Makerere University in Kampala, said he
had made the silage from four doses of water hyacinth mixed with
one dose of maize bran kept in air-tight polythene bags for three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Maize bran is the best additive the scientists tried, and can
give the silage the best flavor and form, and the cattle like
the mixed silage, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The mixed silage can be stored for several years and can be
used as a buffer feed for cattles, the scientist said.
</P>
<P>
The spell of long drought has caused death of cattles in this
country due to lack of grass to feed them.
</P>
<P>
But Mutetikka added that they are still testing the silage.
</P>
<P>
"The next step is to find out how well the animals grow when
fed on this mixture," he told the paper.
</P>
<P>
Water hyacinth covers 6,000 hectares of Lake Victoria and has
posed as an environmental pollution in the region. People
collected the weed and dumped it as rubbish.

<HEADLINE> 34,000 Prisoners Escape in S. Africa in Last Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A police survey has shown
that more than 34,000 prisoners in South Africa have escaped from
custody in the past four years, local daily the Citizen reported
today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 34,128 awaiting-trial prisoners have escaped
countrywide since 1994 when the first non-racial general
elections were held, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Leon Engelbrecht, a senior police official in South Africa's
Crime Prevention Division, said the escapes mainly were results
of negligence on the part of police officers.
</P>
<P>
Last year 888 police officers were prosecuted departmentally
in this regard, which was an increase of 30 percent over the
previous year while 171 officers were criminally prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Police commissioners in South African provinces late in
December submitted contingency plans to curb escapes in their
areas and it was decided, among other things, that standing
regulations pertaining to prisoners should be adhered to more
strictly.
</P>
<P>
The provincial plans are in the process of being evaluated
with a view to drawing up national orders for the prevention of
escapes from police custody.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises in Tibet Filled with New Lease of Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises in the Tibet
Autonomous Region are striving to increase cooperation and
exchanges with their counterparts in the inland areas through
various forms in an effort to boost economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics said that the autonomous region introduced a
total of 76.5 million yuan (9.21 million US dollars) and 42
projects last year, and basically formed a range of industries
involving farming and animal husbandry products processing,
mining, building material, transportation and the catering trade.
</P>
<P>
Since the central government held the third conference on the
work of Tibet in 1994, a boom of helping Tibet has surged across
the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the principles of mutual benefit and common development,
and cooperations in providing funds, technology, talents and
information between Tibet and China's inland areas are carried out
on a broad scale.
</P>
<P>
The Lhasa city government organized many township entrepreneurs
on a tour of inland areas last year and signed contracts worth 200
million yuan (24.1 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the region sent more than 100 prefectural, county
and township officials to Beijing municipality, and Guangdong and
Shandong provinces on an investigative tour, and some 1,000 people
from Tibet received training on business administration in inland
areas.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enthusiastic in Art Collection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- For many Chinese residents, it
has become fashionable and sometimes profitable to decorate their
homes with calligraphy and paintings.
</P>
<P>
As people's standard of living has raised, so has their
acquisitiveness in private collections of art for both decorative
and investment reasons.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows the number of art collectors in China now
exceeds 30 million, 15 times the figure in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Among the collectors are a handful of wealthy and influential
art connoisseurs as well as people from officials, teachers,
military officers and students.
</P>
<P>
Masterpieces by such Chinese calligraphers as Zhang Daqian, Fu
Baoshi, Qi Baishi, Xu Beihong and Li Keran now sell for more than
one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
People say that investing in private art collections is quite
different from investing in securities or property.
</P>
<P>
Art experts attribute the rapid development of private
collections to the sustained economic development. In addition to
color TVs and refrigerators, people now want other items of status.
</P>
<P>
The auction market has been expanding since its founding in
1990 as more and more international auction companies eyed the
potential in traditional Chinese paintings and calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, capital of China, has more than 10 auction companies
and the price of almost all calligraphy is soaring, a major
attraction for collectors.
</P>
<P>
Art experts also say that some purported collectors are
actually profiteers who buy large quantities of artwork to resell
to auction companies for a big profit.
</P>
<P>
The China Association for Collectors was founded in Beijing in
June of 1996, and associations and societies for collectors are
forming nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In more than 20 cities there are special markets for stamps,
antiques, paintings and calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
"It is a common practice not only for people in booming coastal
cities, but also for those living in the remote, mountainous
northwestern parts of the country," said Chen Baodin, a well-known
collector.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests US for Violating Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran has lodged a strong
protest against the United States for "its violation of Iran's
sovereignty and territorial integrity," Tehran radio reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
It said that Iran's permanent representative to the United
Nations sent two notes to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The notes said that the U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf
"bothered and inspected Iranian ships for several times and a
U.S. aircraft with four crew members also violated Iran's air
space."
</P>
<P>
The notes elaborated the details of the U.S. aggressive
actions, Tehran radio said, but giving no detailed about the
actions.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Republic of Iran announced its strong protest to
the U.S. unjustified actions and strongly demanded an end to such
actions which violates Iran's sovereignty and territorial
integrity," the notes said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for Iran to lodge such protest against
the U.S. this year. During the past years, Tehran repeatedly
accused Washington of violating Iran's sovereignty and stationing
military forces in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. regards Iran as the main threat to the
regional peace and stability due to what it called Iran's policies
of "supporting international terrorism, sabotaging the Middle East
peace process and seeking weapons of mass destruction."

<HEADLINE> EU Eases Ban on Fish Imports From East Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
relaxed the ban on fish imports from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and
Mozambique, the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Products from fish caught, frozen and packed in their final
packaging off the coast of the above countries and exported
directly to the EU are now exempted from the embargo, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, frozen or processed fish products from the three east
African countries and Mozambique will be subjected to a
microbiological examination "to verify that they pose no threat
to public health," said an EU statement issued here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The examination shall be carried out, in particular, to
detect the presence of salmonellae," said the statement, adding
that sterilized fish products are exempted from the test.
</P>
<P>
The EU introduced the sanction of importation of fish and fish
products from the four nations on December 23, 1997 as a result
of a cholera outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Medical and Fisheries Department officials in Kenya criticized
the move, saying it was unjustified.
</P>
<P>
The cholera outbreak owing to heavy rains caused by the El
Nino weather phenomenon, has claimed over 1,000 lives since
November in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A blanket of snow has
covered structures destroyed in the devastating January 10
earthquake which hit Zhangbei and Shangyi Counties of north
China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Some 500,000 victims living in affected areas covering over
2,000 sq.km. find it difficult to face unfamiliar surroundings of
collapsed houses, buried grain and damaged belongings. Nonetheless
they sincerely hope the snow will provide them with sustenance and
bring vitality to surrounding farmland.
</P>
<P>
In one case, Xing Zhao and his mother, villagers in Xingjialiang
Village, Zhangbei County, near the epicenter, stood silently in
front of their destroyed courtyard staring at the ruins of what
was once their new house.
</P>
<P>
Xing, 25, spent two years building the house in time for his
wedding. The young man picked up pieces of broken tile and bricks
and pledged, "I'll rebuild the house when it gets warmer."
</P>
<P>
The quake, which measured 6.2 on the Richter Scale, and
frequent aftershocks over the past six days have killed about 50
people, left over 12,000 people injured, and destroyed or damaged
well over 200,000 houses.
</P>
<P>
Many of the victims in the affected areas are living in tents
equipped with stoves. Smiles on the faces of villagers living in
the new tent compounds hint that they have regained hope and
courage for rebuilding their homes and villages.
</P>
<P>
Twenty soliders from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) are
busy erecting new tents for villagers from Xingjialiang Village.

</P>
<P>
One officer named Xu Xinyin rubbed his hands to keep warm and
commented: "We've spent the last two days trying to move all
villagers to warm tents with cooking equipment."
</P>
<P>
PLA soliders, 17 medical teams and rescue teams have continued
to work despite new difficulties created by heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
"We will most likely spend Spring Festival (which will fall on
January 28 this year) here, and my colleagues are prepared to stay
even longer," according to Liu Minghua, a PLA medical officer.
</P>
<P>
Liu's medical team, consisting of 26 doctors and nurses, has
treated 3,005 injured villagers in Dahe Township over the past few
days alone.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles carrying relief supplies from nearby cities are a
common site along highways leading to quake-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Statistics covering the period through Thursday show that
affected areas have received donations of over 10 million yuan,
120,000 coats and more than 70,000 quilts, as well as 20,000 boxes
of instant food products and pharmaceuticals valued at 200,000
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Relief aid from throughout the nation will enable local
residents to bear the burdens of even more difficulties arising
from frigid temperatures forecast for the coming days.

trafficking in banned substances by the Sydney Customs on January
8.
</P>
<P>
"The cases during the championships dealt a heavy blow to the
Chinese sports. I feel heart broken about this," he said. "Some
persons did not join in the fight against doping seriously, but
tried to exploit the regulations."
</P>
<P>
It was announced at the meeting that a five-member special
panel has been set up to carry out its serious and thorough
investigation into the cases.
</P>
<P>
The panel includes COC vice president, director of the COC
Supervision Office, an anti-doping expert and official as well as
a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
COC Vice-President Yuan Weimin said at the meeting that COC
will continue to tackle such doping offences comprehensively by
combining efforts through legislative, adminstrative, technical
and economic measures and to ensure its anti-doping momentum and
effectiveness with special anti-doping offices to be set up in the
provincial level.
</P>
<P>
"Some persons only take an anti-doping token campaign and
became the victims of honors and incentives such as administrative
posts, priviliges, housing and money," Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not only make our unremitting efforts to fight against
doping, but also reject biased attacks by a few sports officials
with double standards," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yang Tianle, an anti-doping Chinese expert, warned those who
take the risk to break the rules will eventually do harm to
themselves and distort the image of the country.
</P>
<P>
"As the technology advances, even the most shrewd users of the
banned substance will be caught up for sure," Yang said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Economist Makes Predictions for '98 Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China, thanks to its huge
surplus in trade and a foreign exchange reserve of more than 100
billion U.S. dollars, would be able to weather economic turmoil
unlike other Asian nations, said Kazuo Nakamura, chief economist
of Japan's Daiichi Kangyo Bank.
</P>
<P>
However, China would also slow down a bit owing to the
depression in Asia which would force the whole world to enter a
period of economic adjustment, Kazuo said.
</P>
<P>
Kazuo made his predictions here today in an economy and finance
report jointly organized by China's Five Best Economic Consulting
Companies and the Daiichi Kangyo Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the world's economy will grow only 3
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
After looking back to the global economy and finances in 1997,
he said the limited pace of the Asian economy and a slower
increase in the United States and other countries would slow the
speed of world economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the actual growth rate of the global economy
this year would fall 0.9 percentage to 3 percent from last year's
3.9 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate of some Asian countries will slump
this year, he predicted, saying that Thailand would have a second
year of declining economic growth while the Republic of Korea
(ROK) would stay at the 1996 levels.
</P>
<P>
However, he said these countries have already endured high
inflation, and would restore exports and reduce imports. As a
result, the slump should hit bottom by the second half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
He also forecast economic growth by the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations at around 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Japan's economy fell by 0.2 percent last year, he said, and
predicted it would drop even lower if no good policy was put
forward.

CANBERRA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's top player Tim

<P>
Henman, ranked 19 in the world, pulled off a straight-set

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Reforms Fail to Impress Currency, Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- New reform measures announced
by the Indonesian government Thursday failed to impress the
financial markets, with both the rupiah, the national currency,
and share prices losing ground in moderate trading.
</P>
<P>
"The price of the rupiah in the market has been discounted by
the high expectation of the market on the visit of IMF
(International Monetary Fund) officials to Indonesia," local press
Friday quoted a currency dealer as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government announced Thursday transparent and concrete
economic measures including a more realistic review of the 1998/99
state budget proposed to curtail government financial support for
a national car project and scrap some agricultural monopolies.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah strengthened to as high as 6,950 against the U.S.
dollar shortly after President Soeharto announced the economic
reforms, but it failed to maintain its extended three-day gains
and fell to as low as 8,450 to the dollar in the afternoon on a
combination of high dollar demand by local corporations.
</P>
<P>
The spot rupiah closed at 8,450/8,700 after crossing the 8,000
psychological level against an opening of 7,200/7,400 in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
"But (the) volume remains thin with very limited transactions,"
a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a pity that good news on economic reforms announced
by the government failed to put the rupiah on an upward trend,
because (U.S.) Standard and Poor's announced the downgrade rating
of Indonesian banks," another dealer said.
</P>
<P>
As the rupiah fell, stock prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange
also descended after a three-day rally on profit taking, with the
main price index falling 13.74 points to close at 387.243 from
403.98 the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Stock brokers attributed the fall of stock prices to profit
taking by most investors.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Opens Domestic Market Wider to Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The annual growth rate in
introducing overseas funds by south China's Guangdong Province
exceeded 23.6 percent during the 1993-1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao and a financial
center for Southeast Asia, actually used 13.9 billion U.S. dollars
of overseas funds in 1997, said Lu Ruihua, provincial governor.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the rapid growth in overseas investment and exports is
the key force driving the province's economy.
</P>
<P>
The imports and exports of the province have accounted for 40
percent of the country's total. And the annual growth rate of
foreign trade has reached 14.1 percent during the past five years,
according to Lu.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 the province earned 127 billion U.S. dollars in foreign
trade. The exports totaled 72 billion U.S. dollars, up 21.3
percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Lu pointed out that the province should introduce more advanced
technologies, key equipment and raw materials in which China is
deficient, while exporting products with high added value and
technological content.
</P>
<P>
The province, the ancestral home of approximately 20 million
overseas Chinese, should create more efficient access to recruit
overseas investment, especially large trans-national companies, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the priority for absorbing overseas funds should be
given to highly efficient agriculture, basic industries,
infrastructure construction and high-tech projects.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the province should provide a healthy
environment and favorable conditions for the promotion of economic
and technological cooperation with Hong Kong and Macao, and seek
common development and prosperity with the two regions in line
with policies of the Chinese central government.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Make Kenya's Maize Yield Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Last season's maize production
around Kenya is expected to drop by nearly 20 percent, largely
due to mounting post-harvest losses caused by continuous heavy
rains, the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Famine Early Warning System section of USAID
and the Regional Economic Development Services Office says the
nationwide long rains maize output is expected to drop from a
1991-96 average of 2.22 million tons to 1.83 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit area is Kenya's Rift Valley Province, the
national breadbasket, where production will drop by a third, from
an average of 1.25 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The report says harvesting of the season's maize crop has
neared completion with a significant decline in output due to
"increased post-harvest losses as a result of high moisture
content of harvested grains, amidst inadequate on-farm storage
capacity."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it predicts a temporary decline in prices in the
short-rains producing areas during the February peak harvesting
period.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, production of beans in Eastern
Province is "expected to decline by up to 30 percent" in the
current short rains season.
</P>
<P>
Excessive rainfall in the Lake Victoria basin has resulted in
major rivers bursting their banks, "destroying 650 hectares of
crops and submerging 3,000 hectares of land and displacing up to
2,000 families," the report added.

<HEADLINE> South China Province Attains Self-Sufficiency in Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 16 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province, one of the country's most developed areas, harvested 19
million tons of grain in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that it was the first time for the province to
have good grain harvests for consecutive four years.
</P>
<P>
The per capita farmland of the province is only equal to half
the national average, but its economic growth rate of 10.6 percent
in 1997 was 1.8 percent higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
The province has reached self-sufficiency in grain because of
efforts made by the local government, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government would allocate 50 million yuan (6.25
million U.S. dollars) to explore farmlands every year since 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the province has paid close attention to the
use of agro-sciences and reclaiming farmland, which are the key
forces driving its agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The advanced rice-seedling-throwing technique has been used on
930,000 hectares of farmland. The province has improved more than
130,000 hectares of low-yield farmland in the last three years,
with a combined investment of more than 5 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cultural Relics To Be Show in U.S. Modern Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- American people will have a
chance to watch creams of Chinese cultural relics without the
trouble of coming to China.
</P>
<P>
It is learned here today that New York-based Guggenheim Museum,
which is famous for its modern architectural style and modern art
collection, will play host to an exhibition on Chinese cultural
relics next month.
</P>
<P>
The four-month exhibition starting from early February, will be
sponsored by China Cultural Relics Exchange Center. The exhibition
is expected to outline the 5,000-year civilization of China.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent of the 250 items of exhibits are
first-grade rare relics of the country, much higher than previous
exhibitions overseas.
</P>
<P>
Included in the exhibition are some 30 modern paintings and 218
items of historical relics such as painted pottery, bronze, jade,
gold and silver, lacquer, stone sculptures, silk and traditional
Chinese paintings.
</P>
<P>
The relics, dating from as early as the late Stone Age to the
late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), are mostly creams of those
unearthed in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
Some of exhibits represented the top level of their kind in
ancient China, such as a neolithic pottery basin with the design
of a human face combined with a fish, a jade sacrificial article,
a bronze mask with protruding eyes, and silk of the Han Dynasty
(206 BC-220 AD) found in a prince's tomb.
</P>
<P>
Experts value a "mi se" (mysterious color) porcelain vase from
the Tang Dynasty (618-907) found in the underground palace of a
temple in northwest China's Shaanxi Province. Yet the visitors
might be more interested in terracotta warriors serving as nether
world guards of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China who set
up the Qin Dynasty 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Also attractive might be a stone sculpture of a Buddha, which,
though headless, has a beautiful figure in exquisite clothes and
decorations.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the sculpture is regarded as "Oriental Venus."

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Help China Reform Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is willing to
provide the techniques and funds necessary for China's
pension insurance reform, a bank official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yukon Huang, director of the World Bank in China, made this
pledge during a three-day seminar on the old-age insurance reform
and funds management.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 financial experts and officials from at home and
abroad attended the seminar, which was held in Yangzhou city, east
China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Huang predicted that China will soon become a gerontological
society, with declining birth rates and longer life spans. China
will have 300 million elderly by 2015.
</P>
<P>
China began setting up a large-scale old-age insurance system
in 1986. By the end of 1996, 87 million employees had joined
various pension plans and 23 million retired workers had received
money from the plans.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that expanding the country's pension funds will have
a major impact on the capital market in China and the world. By 2030
China's old-age insurance funds are expected to reach nearly 1.8
trillion U.S. dollars by 2030.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank has cooperated with the country on
research and held information seminars.
</P>
<P>
China has decided to establish a unified pension insurance
system by the end of the century to replace the current flexible
pilot program.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Flood Parts of Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A sixteen hour non-stop
downpour, blamed on the El Nino phenomenon, Thursday flooded
Nairobi's already collapsing roads and submerged houses in some
middle-class neighborhoods and shacks in teeming shantytowns.
</P>
<P>
More rains are expected today, said weather experts, adding
that Thursday's rains, recorded at 107 mm, were the heaviest
experienced by Nairobi in current season, with southern and
eastern districts suffering the highest rainfall level.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of city residents failed to report to work and were
kept at home by the rains while huge queues of cars, trucks and
commuter buses struggled through pools of water on main roads to
the city, many having to dodge vehicles stalled in the deluge.
</P>
<P>
"I have lived here for more than 10 years and can tell you
I've never seen anything like this," said businessman Onesmus
Gathoga, surveying his submerged new house in Nairobi's Eastleigh
suburb.
</P>
<P>
In a middle-class estate in Nairobi's South B, teenagers
formed emergency water transport gangs, ferrying residents on
their backs or in makeshift plastic canoes.
</P>
<P>
Children unaware of potential health hazards splashed in pools
of water next to a rubbish tip. The rains have added to a
deteriorating sanitary situation in Nairobi, once rated one of
Africa's best-kept cities.
</P>
<P>
Last November, when the El Nino rains first hit Kenya and
wreaked havoc in Coast and North Eastern provinces, Nairobi was
spared.
</P>
<P>
With many bridges washed away and landslides blocking roads in
far-flung parts of the country, economists have warned the
authorities of a threat to economic growth and a major headache
for an already tight state budget.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi said Thursday the government was
starting emergency food distribution to all areas under floods.
</P>
<P>
This year's long rains season, which should start in Kenya
late March, may also be replaced by a spell of drought, the
experts predicted earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Global forecast indicated that the El Nino weather phenomenon
has been on a downward trend from December and was likely to end
in May.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Ends Mandate in Eastern Slavonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, January 15 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Transitional
Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and West Sirmium
(UNTAES) formally transferred its powers to the Croatian
authorities Thursday after two years of administration over the
three territories.
</P>
<P>
A handover ceremony was held in Vukovar, capital of Eastern
Slavonia.
</P>
<P>
According to the No.1023 U.N. Resolution passed by the U.N.
Security Council, the mandate of UNTAES and international armed
forces expires on January 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Attending a celebration here tonight, President Franjo Tudjman
expressed his great delight over Croatia's exercise of sovereignty
over its entire territory.
</P>
<P>
He said the handover marked the beginning of a new era for his
country, which would be able to concentrate on economic and
cultural development and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Other Croatian officials attending the ceremony in Vukovar
hoped the refugees from the region could quickly return home after
the handover.
</P>
<P>
They also hoped the international community could extend
financial support to help the refugees rebuild their homes.
</P>
<P>
Following the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia, the
Serbs, who were the majority of the habitants in the three
regions, sought independence and ran into armed conflicts with the
Croatian authorities.
</P>
<P>
To prevent a potential civil war, the U.N. Security Council
adopted a series of resolutions on administrative intervention and
established UNTAES to ensure a gradual and peaceful transfer of
the local authorities to the Croatian government.

<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will speed up the pace
in pushing re-employment projects involving laid-off workers,
according to the municipal bureau of labor.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing Evening News" reported that according to the bureau's
policies on re-employment, laid-offs who are younger than 35 years
old are encouraged to find jobs by themselves; those who are
between 35-45 years old can find jobs through the labor market and
technical training.
</P>
<P>
State enterprises are encouraged to develop diversified
businesses based on their existing equipment and technologies to
create more jobs for their own workers; laid-off workers and
people who are waiting for jobs are also encouraged to set
stock-holding joint ventures and other economic entities with
their funds, technologies and labor skills.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the total number of the city's laid-off
workers will reach 190,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1997, 137,000 out of the city's 170,000
laid-offs found new jobs.

BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a massive
battle to crack down on the smuggling and production of poor
quality and counterfeit cigarettes to defend the tobacco monopoly.

<HEADLINE> China's Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Overcoming Difficulties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Faced with both declining
product prices and cost hikes in 1997, China's non-ferrous metals
industry was still able to increase its efficiency based on
economies of scale and lower production costs.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Guang, assistant to the general manager of
the China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corp. (CNNC), they
saved 1.1 billion yuan of energy in 1997 as well as 107 million
yuan in administration expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The industry's deficit was reduced substantially after CNNC's
restructuring and personnel cutbacks. After May, financially
troubled enterprises under CNNC reduced their losses on a monthly
basis and profitable ones increased their earnings.
</P>
<P>
The corporation is expecting a full year's profit of 100
million yuan for 1997 when statistical information is completed.
</P>
<P>
Last year was the first of three during which CNNC will be
transformed into a joint-stock company with the state holding
majority interest, according to China Metals, an industry
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 16 more CNNC enterprises began the transformation into
modern companies, bringing the number of such enterprises to
27. The 27 enterprises own two-thirds of all state assets in the
corporation.

Twelve CNNC mergers and so-called "personnel-reduction-and

State Office on Enterprises Merger, Bankruptcy, PREE and
Re-employment Program, China Metals reported. The enterprises
involved in the program have been exempted from a combined
interest payment of 430 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade of non-ferrous metals made progress in 1997. The
total trade volume is estimated at 1.8 billion U.S. dollars,
including exports totalling 1.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The corporation won 18 overseas engineering contracts worth 500
million U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
CNNC has also begun to unify exports and imports of staple
commodities. In 1997, it imported 483,500 tons of copper
concentrates and 404,000 tons of alumina oxide, and exported
325,000 tons of zinc ingots.
</P>
<P>
The non-ferrous metals industry maintained growth for the 15th
year. Its total production remained the world's largest next to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to CNNC estimates, production of the 10 major metals
-- copper, aluminum, lead, zinc, nickel, tin, magnesium, antimony,
mercury and titanium -- reached 5.3 million tons, up 1.33 percent
over 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, by type of metal, copper production is estimated at
1.05 million tons, up 15.38 percent; aluminium, 2.05 million tons,
up 15.17 percent; zinc, 1.35 million tons, up 20.54 percent; and
lead, 600,000 tons, down 15.03 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province in southwest
China is taking steps to encourage workers to buy into their
enterprises as one form to bring the poorly-operating state
sector out of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The Jijie Smeltery in Gejiu city is one of the examples. It was
transformed into a stock company last November, registering 20
million yuan worth of 20 million shares. Workers of the factory
bought 85 percent of the stocks, while the state kept only 10
percent, with the remainder going to society at large.
</P>
<P>
The smeltery is one of China's major wolfram enterprises, with
its lead and zinc production ranking 11th in the country, but its
asset-liability ratio was as high as 90 percent. It has 2,500
workers and staff members, as well as 450 retired workers.
</P>
<P>
The reform was designed to link up workers financially with
enterprises in the form of capital, and to promote workers to help
run their businesses, according to local economic departments.

<HEADLINE> China-Kazakhstan Relations Expected to Move Forward: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh Ambassador to China
Kuanysh Sultanov told a news conference Thursday that he is
confident of further development of China-Kazakhstan relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries yielded successful results in
bilateral cooperation in 1997. Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev paid a state visit to China early last year, during
which the two sides formulated a plan for bilateral cooperation
for the whole year, including oil and transportation cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Nazarbayev's visit to China, the two countries also
attended a five-country summit held in Moscow in April of 1997 and
signed a military agreement, establishing a relationship of mutual
trust in the military field, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng and Vice-Premier Li Lanqing visited
Kazakhstan in September of 1997, when the two countries signed an
oil agreement valued at 9.5 billion U.S. dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador pointed out that bilateral relations will
continue to grow in the new year through the implementation of the
oil agreement and the visit to China by the head of the Kazakh
government.
</P>
<P>
He said Kazakhstan is expected to hold a symposium in the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region to attract investment.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Chinese language has become more popular
in Kazakhstan thanks to the development of bilateral relations in
recent years. Many colleges and middle schools in the country now
offer language training in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the China International Trade Center is
also under way in Akmola, the new capital city of Kazakhstan,
according to the ambassador.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Want Shia Scholars Out of Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A peaceful resolution of the
Afghan imbroglio seems elusive again after the Islamic Taliban
militia declined to accept Islamic scholars from the rival
northern alliance for proposed peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's supreme leader Mohammad Umar has announced that
only those opposition Ulema of the Muslim religion, who had passed
out from the recognized institutions, would be acceptable for
discussions, according to a report carried by a major local
newspaper The Muslim on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued from Kandahar, a major city in southern
Afghanistan, Umar said the Taliban will not succumb to any
pressures for a broad-based government in Kabul as it would
further complicate the problem, the paper said. However, it did
not mention when Umar issued the statement.
</P>
<P>
Umar said those Ulema holding degrees of international repute
would be invited to the commission as agreed after the shuttle
diplomacy of Pakistan in a bid to bring all the major warring
factions of Afghanistan to the negotiating table, The Muslim said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some of the opposition parties have also threatened
not to join the proposed commission if the Taliban fail to
entertain scholars from the north, particularly those belonging to
Shiite Hezb-e-Wadhat, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to Afghan sources, the convening of a joint meeting
of Ulema from the Taliban and the northern alliance seems to be
unlikely at present as the Taliban leaders are hardly prepared to
accommodate Ulema of the Shia, who dominate the anti-Taliban
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban now control two-thirds of Afghanistan including the
capital of Kabul while the northern alliance holds the remaining
one-third.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Financial turbulences in
Southeast Asian countries will not affect the implementation of
China's policy to open its financial sector to the outside world,
Dai Xianglong, central bank governor, said here today.
</P>
<P>
To this end, China is expected to give approval to more
overseas banks and insurance companies to set up branches in the
country this year, and more overseas bank branches will be given
the license to handle the RMB yuan business, Dai said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
"But we will impose stricter control over the applicant's
qualifications and the operations of such institutions," according
to the central bank governor.
</P>
<P>
And China will draw lessons from the financial volatility in
Southeast Asia and will take a more cautious approach to realizing
the convertibility of the RMB yuan under the capital account, Dai
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The operational branches of overseas financial institutions in
China already reached 166 last year, with the combined assets
estimated at 30.64 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> International Flights to, From Bangkok Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Several international airlines
have in the past few months reduced or requested to reduce their
flights to and from Bangkok as the economic crisis in Asia has
affected their profitability.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has urged the Thai people to tour their own
country rather than spend their holidays aboard and Thais must
produce air tickets and visas if they want to get foreign
currencies for their overseas trips.
</P>
<P>
Passenger numbers on Asia routes have fallen 50-70 percent
because of the economic downturn in the region and Indonesia's
thick smog, according to the Nation newspaper on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Airways International (THAI), the Thai national
flag-carrier, plans to cut its Bangkok-Seoul flights from 25 a
week to 21, and Bangkok-Ho Chi Minh City from 15 to 13 a week.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Asiana has slashed its Seoul-Bangkok operations
from nine flights to eight a week while Air Macau has reduced its
Macau-Bangkok flights from four to three a week.
</P>
<P>
France's Cors Air has cut down its Paris-Bangkok flights from
two to one each week and the Germany-based Lufthansa Airlines has
announced plans to reduce its operations between Germany and
Thailand from 13 flights to 10 a week, effective from late March,
for the summer season.
</P>
<P>
From late February Australia's Qantas is to suspend its three
weekly services between Brisbane and Bangkok and its twice weekly
non-stop service between Perth and Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The slump in Asia's outbound tourism has forced airlines
managers to reconsider their pricing strategies and revise route
destinations to survive fiercer competition among airlines.

ULAN BATOR, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian State Great
Hural (Parliament) members regained the possibility of holding
concurrent posts in the government after an amendment was adopted
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hural said the amendment was adopted to strengthen
its supervision in the government and prevent rivalries.
</P>
<P>
As a parliamentary country, the Mongolian government should be
appointed by the Great Hural.

Members of the Great Hural were allowed to be a government
minister two years ago but were forbidden from July of 1996 after
the Democratic Union won the parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the adoption of the amendments opened the

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia's Trade Increases in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The total trade volume of
Yugoslavia reached 7.167 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, up 20.8
percent from 1996, the Yugoslav news agency, Tanjug, reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Milovan Zivkovic, chairman of the Yugoslav Statistics Bureau,
said the export volume of the country reached 2.368 billion
dollars in 1997, an increase of 28.6 over 1996. Imports increased
by 17 percent, amounting to 4.799 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has more than 100 trade partner countries, and.
exports to the European Union market accounted for 85 percent of
the total export volume.
</P>
<P>
The biggest trade partner on the import side was Italy which
took 272 million dollars worth of goods from Yugoslavia, while the
biggest exporter was Germany which sold 730 million dollars worth
of goods to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Zivkovic said Yugoslavia's imports of materials were mainly for
making goods which could be exported. That was why the country had
a trade deficit of 2.4 billion dollars in 1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia would reduce this deficit step-by-step in the
future, Zivkovic said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Slip Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Uncertainty generated by the
Asian currency crisis continued to drive wool prices down at sales
in the two Australian cities of Sydney and Geelong this week.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator fell 10 Australian cents to finish
at 673 cents a clean kilogram, bordering on its lowest level for
this season, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The western market indicator remained unchanged at 633 cents
per kilogram as there were no sales in Fremantle city.
</P>
<P>
A total of 60,621 bales were offered.
</P>
<P>
"Although wool remains relatively cheap in terms of U.S.
dollars, and with respect to some of the major European
currencies, there is not much confidence in the buying and
exporting trade at present as most people expect that it will take
a considerable time for stability to return to both Asian and
global markets following developments of the last six months," the
council said.
</P>
<P>
"It is also not clear whether the fallout seen in (South) Korea
will flow on to other major Asian wool consuming markets such as
Japan and China."
</P>
<P>
Little business has been written since early November as Korean
wool importers, mills and banks have been hit by severe liquidity
problems.
</P>
<P>
"Similarly, most exporters to China are anxiously awaiting the
opening of many overdue letters of credit," it said.
</P>
<P>
About 83,300 bales are rostered for sales in Sydney, Melbourne
and Fremantle next week.
</P>
<P>
Wesfarmers Dalgety is more optimistic in its weekly wool
report, noting the fall was not as severe as last week.
</P>
<P>
"Many buyers have adopted a wait and see attitude in the
current uncertain environment created by the Asian economic
downturn and the sharp drop in wool prices last sale," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"In the medium term, the Asian economic situation looks set to
continue to have a negative effect on wool prices, although the
extent of this is still uncertain," it said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian, IMF Officials Discuss Regional Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad met here Friday with International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Managing Director Michel Camdessus to discuss the current
economic problems facing several Asian countries, including
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief praised Malaysia for the measures taken to
overcome its economic problem. The measures include scaling down
economic growth from 7 percent to between 4 and 5 percent,
deferring large projects, cutting government expenditure by 18
percent, curbing credit growth and ensuring loans for productive
sectors only.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said he appreciated and welcomed the austerity
measures adopted by Malaysia as announced by its Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim on December 5 last
year.
</P>
<P>
"I told the prime minister my appreciation for the adoption of
the measures ... it was timely adopted," Camdessus told reporters
after the talks here.
</P>
<P>
"We have commented about the prospective of this country
(Malaysia) and the way in helping it recover from the present
downturn and strengthen it enough to enable it to have a
sustainable growth to achieve the ambition Prime Minister Mahathir
has for his country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief hoped that Malaysia could weather its economic
crisis on its own without having to resort to major international
support.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has said that it has no intention of seeking IMF
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Soon after his arrival here Thursday evening, Camdessus
discussed with Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar
Ibrahim the attack on regional currencies and the policies adopted
by countries affected by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus is visiting a number of Asian countries in an effort
to mitigate the economic crisis facing the region.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus, who flew in from Indonesia Thursday for a two-day
visit, will leave for Singapore later Friday.

<HEADLINE> Three Australians Return From South Pole Walk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The first three Australians to
walk to the South Pole without support returned to Sydney Friday.
</P>
<P>
Peter Treseder, Ian Brown and Keith Williams, all in their 40s,
described their epic 60-day trek as exhausting but exhilarating,
the Australian Associated press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Apart from deadened skin on their noses, fingernails blackened
by frostbite and full-faced beards, they showed few visible signs
of their epic feat.
</P>
<P>
They left Sydney on October 20 last year, reached Berkner
Island, Antarctica, on November 3 and arrived at the pole on New
Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
Treseder, who led the expedition, said the toughest part had
been its totality.
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing to break the monotony, there's no bird life,
no animal life and you get up every morning out of your tent ...
and it looks exactly the same," he told journalists at Sydney
airport.
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like a giant treadmill ... and it's so big you can
see the curvature of the earth as you look right around the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
"Just endless, endless white and nothing to stop the katabatic
winds that ... bombard you all day."
</P>
<P>
He said the success of the campaign had been seriously
jeopardized only once, when Brown's inner thighs had become so
severely frostbitten he was reluctant to go on.
</P>
<P>
"There were moments when we had our doubts whether the team
would make it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Three packs of biscuits served as the staple diet for each of
them throughout their nine-hour daily trek, complemented by 6,000
calorie worth of dried milk, pasta, olive oil, soup, vitamin
supplements and chocolate to ward off minus 30 degree
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Christmas Day included a feast of cashews and the luxury of
"climbing over each other to talk to our wives by radio."
</P>
<P>
Treseder celebrated his 40th birthday on November 11 and Brown
his 43rd a week later.
</P>
<P>
Williams, 40, said his biggest thrill had been crossing the
Trans-Antarctic Mountains.
</P>
<P>
"I'd been basically looking to see them (all my life) and it
was an emotional moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the terrain as a frozen seascape featuring
hundreds of kilometers of sastrugi, or chest-high ridges,
knee-deep snow and hard bare ice often laid over hidden glacial
crevasses.
</P>
<P>
Antarctica was not seen by human eyes until 1830.
</P>
<P>
The South Pole was first reached by Norwegian explorer Roald
Amundsen using dog teams in 1912, while the British "Footsteps of
Scott" Expedition became the first to walk there in 1986, AAP
said.

FTAA, to group Mexico, Canada, the United States and the Mercosur
members of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, was proposed
by U.S. President Bill Clinton at the 1994's Summit of the
Americas Conference in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has been keen in pushing ahead with the plan but Brazil
and Argentina remained lukewarm for fear that the U.S. blueprint
may overwhelm their own bloc.
</P>
<P>
The Second Summit of the Americas will be held on April 18 and
19 in Santiago, Chile.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The landmark five-star Galadari
Hotel in Colombo, which was seriously damaged in last October's
massive bomb blast, is scheduled to reopen in March, hotel
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said reconstruction work on the hotel has just
begun and they hope the hotel will be operational by March.
</P>
<P>
About 100 rooms and the ground floor restaurants will be put
into use by the time the reconstruction work is completed, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The hotel, along with the nearby Hilton Hotel, the Ceylon Bank
and many other buildings, was badly damaged when a truck-bomb
exploded in the hotel's car park. The bombing attack, carried out
by a group of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels, killed at
least 18 people and injured more than 100 others on October 15,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The hotel had said earlier that it would be reopened in
January. However, reconstruction work was delayed due to various
reasons, on which they didn't elaborate.

<P>
NEW YORK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton has already sent to Congress the documents required by law
to implement an agreement on nuclear cooperation between the U.S
and China, the White House announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"China has met the nuclear non-proliferation requirements and
conditions necessary under U.S. law to engage in peaceful nuclear
cooperation with U.S. industry," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry said in a statement issued during a visit to New York by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton signed the formal certifications and reports
required by U.S. law to implement the agreement on nuclear
cooperation reached last October between President Clinton and
Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement serves U.S. national security and economic
interests, and demonstrates that the administration's policy of
engaging China is achieving concrete results," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to work with the Chinese government to
strengthen our cooperation on other arms control and
non-proliferation issues," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has 30 legislative days in which to review
the documents submitted by the president.

<HEADLINE> Peso Crunch Takes Toll on Philippine Embassies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of
Foreign Affairs is recalling as many as 400 personnel assigned
abroad as part of its effort to cut expenses after the sharp
depreciation of the country's currency, the peso.
</P>
<P>
The 40-percent reduction in the staff of 80 embassies and
consulates all over the world is one of the ways the department is
using to cushion the blows of the currency turmoil, the local
daily Manila Standard reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon was quoted as saying Thursday
that the department has called on those assigned abroad to come
back in answer to voluntary recall.
</P>
<P>
Siazon hinted that this is not a good time to be assigned
abroad since the home office has already mandated a 30-percent
slash in all overseas allowances.
</P>
<P>
According to Siazon, the department will incur a deficit of 1.8
billion pesos if the peso is traded at 45 to one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The peso recently dipped to a record low of 45 to the dollar
before slightly picking up to the 42 level Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The peso has so far lost nearly 60 percent of its value against
the dollar since its de facto devaluation in July 1997. Prior to
the devaluation, the peso-dollar exchange rate was at 26.4 pesos
to a dollar.

<HEADLINE> China's Electronics Industry Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Production and sales in China's
electronics and information industries soared in 1997. The
increase in domestic computers was 38.2 percent; color
televisions, 14.6 percent; and video compact disc (VCD) players,
300 percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by China's Ministry of Electronics Industry
show that many Chinese-made electronic products now dominate the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
To date, 57 percent of the color TV market is claimed by
Changhong, Konca, Panda and TCL. Domestic VCD players have 81
percent of the market share.
</P>
<P>
The computer market is also dominated by Chinese manufacturers
such as Legend and Great Wall. The two Chinese computer giants
took 60 percent of the domestic market last year.
</P>
<P>
Program-controlled switchboards made in China appeared on the
international market last year while their role at home was even
larger.
</P>
<P>
The output of the electronics industry in 1997 is estimated at
380 billion yuan, up 24.9 percent over 1996. The industry made 12
billion yuan in profits, up 13.2 percent. These figures were
announced at the recent annual meeting of the Ministry of
Electronics Industry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is estimating electronic exports will be valued at
25 billion U.S. dollars for 1997 when all the figures are in.
</P>
<P>
New breakthroughs have been reported in restructuring
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Mergers were completed by such groups as Changhong, Konca, TCL
and Hisense which brought together enterprises in different
regions or involved in different businesses.
</P>
<P>
Mergers also took place between state-owned enterprises and
competitive township businesses as well as other collectively
owned ones. The Haier Group and Xihu Electronics Group merged last
year, for example, combining to gain competitive advantages in the
market.

<HEADLINE> China to Introduce New Loan Classification System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China is to apply a new loan
classification system from the end of this year in line with
international practice, according to China's leading banking
official.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, made the
remarks in a press conference this morning.
</P>
<P>
Dai told the press that the new system will classify loans into
five categories, including "standard, special mention, substandard,
doubtful and loss."
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the new system is aimed at tackling the
existing problems in China's financial sector, such as high
proportion of problem loans of the state commercial banks,
remaining problems of non-bank financial institutions, illegal
establishment of financial institutions by some localities and
departments, and unlicensed financial business activities. "These
deep-rooted problems reflect the unrevolved structural imbalances
in the economy," Dai noted.
</P>
<P>
China has already launched an overall investigation on the
risks of financial institutions. On-going monitoring was imposed
on financial institutions with high risks. "Financial risks that
had already cropped up were timely dealt with and mitigated," Dai
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that another two years of efforts will bring
loan management of the Chinese commercial banks to a "relatively
high standard," Dai said.

<HEADLINE> China to Remain Attractive to Foreign Investors: Bank Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) - The governor of China's central
bank said today that the nation will overcome the effects of the
financial crisis in other Asian countries and continue to be an
ideal place for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"I believe China will retain its position in 1998. China will
remain very attractive for foreign investment," Dai Xianglong,
governor of the People's Bank of China, said at a press conference
here this morning.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's second largest absorber of foreign
investment after the United States. Foreign direct investment
totaled 43 billion U.S. dollars in China last year.
</P>
<P>
Dai expected that the gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by
around eight percent this year, despite predictions that the Asian
crisis will affect China's exports.
</P>
<P>
"If we can put more vigorous efforts into opening up
international markets, then growth will be over eight percent," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He told that the national credit ceiling will hit 900 billion
yuan this year against 820 billion yuan in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Thai Canned Fruit Exporters Call for Easing Liquidity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports of canned
fruit and vegetables are expected to run into trouble this year if
the liquidity crunch and high interest rates are not eased, the
newspaper The Nation reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although a weakened baht has benefited agricultural exports,
continued lack of liquidity and high interest rates remain a
critical problem for exporters, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The lack of rainfall last year, attributed to the El Nino
phenomenon, could affect fruit and vegetable production and cause
difficulties to exporters of these products this year.
</P>
<P>
"If the liquidity crisis is not resolved as a matter of
priority, it will result in lower export growth this year,"
Phairoj Wangthamrongwit, managing director of Grand Asia Group, a
leading fruit and vegetable canner, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some major importers of Thai products are
reluctant to place bulk orders for various reasons, such as their
own domestic economic downturn or the currency fluctuations, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Besides lower market demand, the liquidity problem has forced
exporters to cut prices to improve distribution.

<HEADLINE> China to Readjust Interest Rates Timely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China will make fresh
readjustments to interest rates in line with changes in the
national economy this year, central bank governor Dai Xianglong
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Aggregate interest rates as well as their structure will be
timely and gradually adjusted," Dai told a press conference,
adding that one of the central bank's major tasks is to control
money supply appropriately through interest rate adjustments.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the central bank "does not intend to lower
interest rate at present".
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that monetary targets for 1998 include 16 to 18
percent increase in broad money, 17 percent increase in narrow
money and 14 percent increase in currency in circulation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy grew by 8.8 percent last year, with retail
price index climbing just one percent, leaving room for a further
interest rate cut following a reduction last October.
</P>
<P>
Dai forecasted that the Chinese economy will grow by more than
eight percent in 1998 while inflation will remain low.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the growth in retail price index will be well
under three percent this year, while the consumer price index is
expected to keep below five percent.
</P>
<P>
While reaffirming the central bank's "appropriately tight
monetary policy", Dai told that the overall scale of bank loans
will increase this year so as to ensure a proper economic growth.
</P>
<P>
More investment will be made to improve the agricultural
infrastructure and a housing oriented financial service system
will be developed to foster a housing market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dai told the press that the central bank has projected 100
billion yuan in loans to help foster a housing market.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Role of Financial Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China is to give more financial
supports to agriculture, state-enterprise reform and housing this
year, said China's leading banking official in a press conference
held this morning.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, told the
press that no less than 10 percent of the credit growth of
the state banks will be ear-marked for agricultural
development. Loans granted by the rural credit cooperatives for
the sector should also be gradually increased in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Also, priority will continue to be given to the large and
medium-sized state enterprises. Meanwhile, the state banks are
expected to support small enterprises in their restructuring as
well as the development of non-state sector, said Dai.
</P>
<P>
Dai noted that a residential housing financial service system
will be developed to foster a housing market. "Mortgage business
will be expanded to cater to the needs of more customers and
credit ceilings imposed on 'basic housing projects' will be
removed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dai pointed out that efforts will also be made to restrict bank
loans to luxury real estate projects so as to prevent bubble
elements in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Domestic foreign exchange loan facilities will be developed to
expand domestic and international markets, he said.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Defense Minister Decorated by Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Peter
Stoyanov Thursday conferred a decoration on Joris Voorhoeve, the
visiting Dutch defense minister, in recognition of his contribution
to the development of bilateral military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The decoration was the Order of the Balkan Range, First Class,
the highest Bulgarian award to a foreigner who contributes to the
development of bilateral military relations.
</P>
<P>
Voorhoeve and his Bulgarian counterpart, Georgi Ananiev,
Wednesday signed an agreement on safeguarding classified military
information. It opens an opportunity for cooperation between the
two countries in the sensitive area of military intelligence
which, as Voorhoeve said, makes it very important.
</P>
<P>
The two defence ministers also discussed further cooperation
with the NATO-led multinational Stabilization Force (SFOR) in
Bosnia. They reached an understanding on the third group of
Bulgarian engineering troops which will relieve the Bulgarian
platoon currently committed to SFOR to undergo training in the
Netherlands in March.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral military cooperation is developing at high speed,
Voorhoeve told a joint news conference. He highly praised
Bulgaria's efforts to preserve stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Bulgaria, Voorhoeve also met Prime Minister
Ivan Kostov, Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova, and the army's
chief of staff, Miho Mohov.
</P>
<P>
"Along with expanding our military cooperation we should also
expand our economic cooperation in order to secure the
Netherlands' support for our bid for NATO and European Union
membership," Ananiev told the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Voorhoeve, who headed a military delegation, ended his two-day
visit to Bulgaria Thursday.

BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China will make fresh
readjustments to interest rates in line with changes in the
national economy this year, central bank governor Dai Xianglong
said here today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Import More Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
negotiating for the import of an additional 150,000 metric tons of
rice this year to boost the country's rice stock to prevent a rice
shortage, a senior food official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The extra amount will bring the total rice importation to
650,000 tons, of which some 500,000 tons were negotiated late last
year, National Food Authority Deputy Administrator Gregorio Tan
said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are going on with Thailand, Vietnam and China on
the supply of the additional rice, Tan said, adding that the bulk
of rice imports this year are expected to come from Vietnam and
China.
</P>
<P>
Tan said the total 650,000-ton rice imports should arrive
before May just in time for the lean months.
</P>
<P>
During the first and second weeks of this month, a total of
74,500 tons of rice imports coming from Vietnam and China have
already arrived in the country.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the standby authority to import some 350,000
tons of corn has been frozen due to the high price of corn on the
world market and a high exchange rate, Tan said.
</P>
<P>
The government approved last month the import of more rice and
corn for fears of a rice and corn shortage as a result of a severe
drought brought about by the El Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
El Nino has begun to affect the country since the last quarter
of 1997, leading to water shortages in many parts of the country.

<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- CSKA Moscow took a crucial step
towards classification for the next round of the men's Euroleague
Championship after ralling to win over Spain's Estudiantes for
their first away victory on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side trailed by 11 points before the break, but
bounced back to score a 85-78 victory.

<P>
The Spaniards lost their momentum after Russian coach Stanislav
Eremin called a time-out and the visitors overtook the lead 63-62
at the end of a crucial three-minute spell.
</P>
<P>
CSKA improved their rebound work and hit a series of
three-pointers to run out easy winners despite seeing both Marcus
Webb and Valery Daimeko fouled out with over five minutes from
time.
</P>
<P>
CSKA were 7-5 from their 12 matches while Estudiantes slipped
to 6-6.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President's Press
Secretary Sergi Yastrzhembsky Thursday criticized the delayed
ratification of the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(START-2) by the State Duma, the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference here that the delay does not conform
to the on-going Russian military reform and will have a negative
impact on the Russian-United States relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the postponement of ratifying the START-2 will also
affect the further progress of the strategic arms reduction
treaty, which is in the interests of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The START-2 was signed by Russia and the U.S. in early
1993. The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in 1996, but the Russian
State Duma has failed to endorse it so far.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton has said that he refused
to visit Russia before its ratification of the treaty.

<HEADLINE> Spain to Strengthen Military Ties With NATO </HEADLINE>

<P>
MADRID, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Spain wants more of its officers
to be in the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty
organization (NATO) and its ties with the Allied Command of
Atlantic to be promoted.
</P>
<P>
This was indicated by Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
during his meeting Thursday with visiting Supreme Allied Commander
Harlod Gehman.
</P>
<P>
Admiral Gehman arrived here Thursday on his first visit to
Spain after he was appointed as the allied commander last
September.
</P>
<P>
Gehman also held talks with Spanish Minister of Defense Eduard
Serra Rexach Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held after their talks, both Gehman and
Serra stressed that the decision of Spain to fully join in the
military alliance would benefit both sides because of Spain's
strategic location between the Atlantic Ocean and the
Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The supreme allied commander is scheduled to visit the capitals
of other allied nations later.

BELGRADE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said Thursday that his country will further develop
relations with Russia, Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
The economic cooperation between Yugoslavia and Russia had made
remarkable achievements, with the trade volume last year reaching
one billion U.S. dollars, said Milosevic while meeting with
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky.
</P>
<P>
The two agreed that Yugoslavia had made active and constructive
contributions to peace and stability in Bosnia as well as to the
implementation of the Dayton peace accord, which was signed in
December, 1995 and ended three-and-half-year war in the region,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to further strengthen the functions of the
elected agencies in Bosnia and to maintain peace and stability in
the Bosnian Serb Republic by political means.
</P>
<P>
Afanasyevsky, who is in charge of European affairs, said Russia
supported Yugoslavia's efforts in realizing peace in the region
and smoothly developing the country.

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed in Renewed Clash in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Four rebels and one soldier were
killed in a clash between the Philippine government troops and the
rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) Thursday in southern
Mindanao island, local press reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Rosque Garingalao, spokesman of an army division based in
Cotabato Province, was quoted as saying the MILF rebels fired 12
rounds of mortar shells at a government post, killing the soldier.
</P>
<P>
Government troops fired back with artillery rounds and two
helicopter gunships rained rockets on the rebel positions in
Buldon City in Cotabato, leaving four rebel fighters dead, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Garingalao said an unknown number of rebels could have been
wounded in the three-hour duel.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of mortar and artillery fire was the first clash
between the government troops and the MILF since a cease-fire was
reached in October 1997 to pave the way for further exploratory
peace talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the renewed conflict might affect the next
round of exploratory talks in February, which are expected to
discuss the agenda for reaching a preliminary peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-MILF peace talks, starting in January 1997, have
been on-and-off due to sporadic fighting between the two forces.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has refused to be included in a peace treaty that the
government signed with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the MNLF, wants a separate
peace agreement with the government.
</P>
<P>
With an estimated 12,000 fighters, the MILF is the largest
anti-government force in the country.

<HEADLINE> China to Help Displaced Workers Find New Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Labor will
launch a job training program for the country's estimated 10
million laidoffs in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The program is to help the unemployed people find new jobs by
improving their work skills, Li Boyong, Minister of Labor, was
quoted as saying by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
One important measure contained in the program will be setting
up "re-employment funds" in various places.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers from the sectors such as textile, military
projects, machinery manufacturing and coal mining will have
priority to participate in the training program.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor plans to increase re-employment in
northwest, northeast and southwest China, "especially the
northeast areas, where many large, middle-sized and out-dated
state-owned enterprises are located," told Li.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in China's urban areas remained at three
percent during the first nine months in 1997, according to data
from the Ministry of Labor. Meanwhile, some 5.3 million people had
registered as unemployed by the end of September, down 3.6 percent
from the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The nation-wide re-employment project has helped 2.3 million
laidoffs return to work after receiving occupational training and
unemployment relief during the first nine months last year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor will speed up building a labor
information network to provide accurate and timely information for
both employees and job hunters.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China's tobacco industry set an
all time high record in its pre-tax profit, which stood at 90
billion yuan (10.84 billion US dollars), despite the fact that the
production nd sales of cigarettes slumped in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The figure was up 8.4 percent from that in 1996, which saw the
figure hit 83 billion yuan, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The industry turned out 1,683.55 billion cigarettes last year,
down one percent from the previous year. The sales reached 1,694.7
billion cigarettes in 1997, down 0.4 percent from that a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
"The saturated market, fake products, rampant smuggling plus
people's increasing awareness of health have combined to restrict
the production level of the tobacco industry," the newspaper
quoted Zhou Ruizeng, spokesman for the State Tobacco Monopoly
Administration, as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, improvement in technology and increase in quality
brands have ensured the sector's tax revenues "going up", which
account for one-tenth of the country's total fiscal income, Zhou
said.
</P>
<P>
And the advanced equipment and technical renovation has made
the industry's profits rise up 4.5 percent to 11.78 billion yuan
last year.

<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are highlights of
major Beijing-based newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
"People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- President Jiang Zemin attended a forum yesterday discussing
the newly published Military writings of Luo Ronghuan, one of the
founders of the People's Liberation Army who fought to expand the
revolutionary bases and the Communist Party of China's armed
forces before 1949.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked to learn from the late Marshal Luo's glorious
deeds, revolutionary thinking, and lofty morals, and called him a
faithful fighter, a tested proletarian revolutionary and
strategist, an outstanding Party, state, and army leader.
</P>
<P>
-- Premier Li Peng yesterday said that China's oil industry
should continue its policy of "stablizing production in the east
and developing oil production in the west," speed up oil
exploration, and explore domestic and international markets.
</P>
<P>
Li, meeting with delegates to a China National Petroleum
Corporation conference, thanked the industry's employees for
their enormous contribution to the national economy last year with
their new developments in exploration, production, and research.
</P>
<P>
The utilization of overseas oil resources should become an
important part of future development of the country's oil
industry, Li told delegates to a national conference of China
National Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- President Jiang Zemin told a group of provincial publicity
departments officials yesterday that publicity departments should
do a practical and active job of holding the banner of Deng
Xiaoping Theory high.
</P>
<P>
Building socialism with Chinese characteristics was the theme
of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) and the Party's work theme.
</P>
<P>
He asked publicity departments to help promote a new upsurge of
studying Deng Xiaoping Theory among the masses, and to sum up the
experience they gained in the efforts to combine the Party Central
Committee's line and policies with local realities, emancipating
their minds, and seeking truth from facts.
</P>
<P>
-- Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee, told a national meeting on cultural and ethical
progress yesterday that there must be continued efforts in
cultural and ethical work.
</P>
<P>
 "China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The Ministry of Labor will carry out occupational training
programs for the estimated 10 million laid-off workers across the
country in three years to help them find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
The strategy is to improve trainees' work skills and enhance
their capacity to find new jobs. One measure is to establish
"re-employment funds" in various places. Displaced workers from
the sectors of textile, military projects, machine-building
and coal mining will have priority to take part in the training
program.
</P>
<P>
-- China appealed yesterday for holding a dialogue to settle
differences regarding the United Nations' weapons inspections in
Iraq, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang yesterday.

XI'AN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The largest environmental
protection project in central and west China has officially
started in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Costing 2.55 billion yuan (307 million US dollars) of which 156
million US dollars will be loaned by the Asian Development Bank,
the project is aimed at fighting air pollution in Xi'an, Xianyang,

<HEADLINE> EU to Investigate Belgian F1 Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Thursday that it would investigate a complaint against the
International Automobile Federation (FIA) for threatening to
cancel the Belgian Formula One Grand Prix race.
</P>
<P>
A source close to European Union competition commissioner Karel
van Miert said that the commissioner would consider the complaint
and analyze it seriously.
</P>
<P>
The complaint was filed by some 60 Formula One enthusiasts,
some of whom are cafe and restaurant holders near the Spa
Francorchamps race track.
</P>
<P>
FIA said on Wednesday that it gave the organizers of the
Belgian Formula One race until February 15 to give guarantees that
the country's ban on tobacco sponsorship and advertising would not
affect the race.
</P>
<P>
Spa Francorchamps is still one of this year's stops on the FIA
circuit but FIA said that the race could be scrapped from next
year's calendar when the new Belgian law banning tobacco
advertising enters into force on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
A local court in the Belgian province of Wallonia has already
ruled that it was powerless to suspend the government ban to bring
it in line with the more lenient EU legislation.
</P>
<P>
The European Union decided to phase out most tobacco
advertising within three years but would give tobacco sponsorship
of events such as the Formula One races until 2006.
</P>
<P>
Representing the Spa Francorchamps enthusiasts is lawyer
Jean-Louis Dupont who successfully helped Belgian soccer player
Jean-Marc Bosman winning his case in the European Court of
Justice.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Daniel Plaza of Spain, the
20-kilometer walk champion in the 1992 Olympics, won his appeal to
compete again despite his positive results for steroid, local
reports said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Plaza was free to compete again after a Madrid court halted his
suspension for doping pending further investigation.
</P>
<P>
In October, Spain's Sport Disciplinary Committee suspended
Plaza for two years for his positive results for steroid
nandrolone on June 28, 1996, just before the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
He tested negative in two subsequent tests prior to Atlanta and
was allowed to enter the games.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy about the decision because it shows that there
are enough reasons to doubt the committee's decision and to back
my innocence," Plaza said.
</P>
<P>
Plaza won the 20K event in Barcelona in 1992 but finished 11th
in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> U.S., EU Promote Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
European Union (EU) concluded a one-day ministerial meeting here
today for promoting the trans-Atlantic relations soured since the
end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary Madeleine Albright, British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook and Vice President Sir Leon Brittan of the European
Commission discussed a series of issues ranging from Turkey-EU
relations, the Middle East and Bosnia peace process
</P>
<P>
"The primary purpose of our meeting today, however, was to
discuss the relationship between the United States and the
European Union," Albright told a press conference after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Those ties are a central part of a broader new Atlantic
community that includes NATO, the OSCE (Organization on Security
and Cooperation in Europe) and other transatlantic organizations,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
"As the United Kingdom begins its six- month term as EU
president, Europe and the United States have an opportunity and a
responsibility to lead in a range of areas where, if we don't show
the way, no one else can or will," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the three discussed how to sustain the
Middle East peace process, promote reconciliation in Bosnia and
combat climate change.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the importance of strong transatlantic
leadership on trade and economic affairs, according to Albright.
</P>
<P>
Cook indicated that transatlantic dialogue is "of great
importance" on fighting jobless, crime and the climate change.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, Cook said both sides
recognized the "frustrating stalemate," expressing EU's full
support for the talks brokered by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the U.S. and EU have become sour both in
trade and security after the Cold War ended as the trans-Atlantic
alliance's common adversary, the Soviet Union, disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the two sides on a U.S. anti-Cuba law is
still in an impasse while their row over the control of NATO's
southern command is still unsettled.
</P>
<P>
Brussels opposes the Helms-Burton Law which sanctions any
foreign firms which do business with Cuba. Paris insisted that the
alliance's southern commander should be a European but the idea
was rejected by Washington.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of trade, Brittan said that "there are bound to be
conflicts," but hen stressed that "we have a commitment to resolve
those problems."
</P>
<P>
On the Helms-Burton Law dispute, Brittan indicated that the
two sides will continue to negotiate based on the understanding
they reached last April. "We need agreement in order to avoid
having to return to the WTO (World Trade Organization)."

WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
approved a 30 million U.S. dollar loan for Dominican Republic's
provincial health services project.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to finance the first World Bank-backed
health care project in the republic, which is one of the most
densely populated countries in Latin America and the Caribbean,
whose health care indicators compare unfavorably with countries of
similar per capita income.
</P>
<P>
With a total cost of 42 million dollars, the project will help
decentralize the country's health care system by transferring
resources and responsibilities from the national government to the
provincial governments and organizations within a framework that
facilitates the integration of public and private providers to
improve access to, as well as efficiency of health services.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Congress to Act on Tobacco Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
referring to new evidence that the tobacco industry targeted
teenagers, Thursday urged Congress to pass anti-tobacco
legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton cited reports that the nation's second-largest
cigarette company, R.J. Reynolds, had developed aggressive
marketing proposals to reach adolescents as young as 14.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "The documents that came to light today show more
than ever why it is absolutely imperative that Congress take
action now to get tobacco companies out of the business of
marketing cigarettes to children."
</P>
<P>
The company's internal documents, covering 1973 to 1990, show
it tried to target teens to reverse declining sales of its brands.
</P>
<P>
The president said, "I am confident that every member of
Congress, without regard to party, who reviews these documents
will resolve to make 1998 the year that we actually pass
comprehensive legislation to protect our children and the public
health."

<HEADLINE> Baltics Regard Charter with U.S. A Step to NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting leaders of the
three Baltic nations said here today that the charter to be signed
on Friday with Washington was an important step toward joining the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference, Presidents Lennart Meri,
Guntis ULmanis and Algirdas Brazuskas of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania said that the charter moves their countries "closer to
NATO" but is not targeted against Russia.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a substitute for NATO membership. On the contrary,
the charter is moving us closer to NATO," Estonia's Meri said.
</P>
<P>
"It clearly states the United States' policy agenda on the
strategic issues -- the security of the Baltic region and
Europeans a whole," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meri said the Baltic states' application to join NATO, which is
fiercely opposed by Moscow and has been shelved by the alliance
until an undetermined future date, was "the next big challenge to
NATO."
</P>
<P>
"Allies and partners, like NATO and Russia, do not need a band
of neutral states to stand in between them," Meri said.
</P>
<P>
The Estonian president recalled that Russia had first opposed,
and later acquiesced to, NATO's offer last July of membership to
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Russia itself signed a
charter with NATO last May.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's Brazauskas said: "We all understand the U.S.-
Baltic charter is not directed against a third country or third
country groups."
</P>
<P>
Latvia's Ulmanis added, "I think that our relations with the
USA transcend the boundaries of the partnership concept. We are
becoming allies, allies in the new, broader meaning of the next
millenium."
</P>
<P>
"The charter points to the U.S.'s true interest in the
independence and sovereignty of the Baltic states," said Ulmanis.
"It defines a resolution to facilitate the further inclusion of
the Baltic states in European and trans-Atlantic organization."
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted the charter as saying that the United States
will provide help to the three states to join NATO but will not
guarantee the membership.
