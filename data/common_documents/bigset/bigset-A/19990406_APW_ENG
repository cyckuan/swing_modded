<HEADLINE> Hawk Kills Duck on White House Lawn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The victor stood over its prey on the White  
House lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprised tourists stared and pointed from outside the gates.  
Photographers hurried to take pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, it's not every day you see a red-tailed hawk kill a  
duck at the White House and then feast on its remains. 
</P>
<P>
	The large hawk -- some people think there are two --has been  
hanging around the White House for the last week or so. Squirrels 
that roam the 18-acre compound rush into hiding when the hawk is 
around. The duck wasn't that smart.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rally / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term bond prices jumped Tuesday on hopes  
that interest rates might stay at their low levels for the time 
being. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 15/16  
point, or $9.38 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 5.52 percent from 5.59 percent 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations that Federal Reserve policy-makers did not adopt a  
bias toward tightening rates at their meeting last week helped 
bolster bond prices. Higher rates would hurt the value of bonds, 
which pay a fixed rate of return. Hopes that the European Central 
Bank and the Bank of England may cut rates this week also helped 
lift bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the gains were concentrated in the long-term bond. In  
the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities were 
up between 1/32 point and 5/32 point, and intermediate maturities 
were up 7/32 point to 15/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.39 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point from the auction Monday to 4.28 
percent. Six-month yields were 4.51 percent, as the discount was 
unchanged from the weekly auction at 4.35 percent. One-year yields 
were 4.64 percent as the discount fell by 0.01 percentage point 
from late Monday to 4.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.50 percent from 4.75 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 124 3/8 from 124 1/8. The average yield to 
maturity fell to 5.22 percent from 5.24 percent.

<HEADLINE> Zale Corp. Is Sparkling Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Zale Corp., America's leading jewelry chain, is  
sparkling again. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the dark days of bankruptcy, the jewelry chain has posted  
five consecutive years of 20 percent annual growth primarily by 
keeping up with minimalist fashion trends and selling precious, 
although sometimes small, jewelry pieces to middle America. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say, `Let's get the real thing rather than a piece of  
costume jewelry that you throw in a drawer,''' Lynn Ramsey, 
president of the Jewelry Information Center, said of a renaissance 
in national jewelry sales. ``Zale has really benefited from that 
mindset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Irving, Texas-based Zale isn't the only retailer  
cashing in on people's growing preference for real gold, pearls and 
precious gems. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, sales volume for jewelry and watches was $1.67 billion  
at Wal-Mart; No. 2 Zale rang up $1.25 billion that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Zale has the most stores in the United States -- 1,140  
operating in this country and Puerto Rico under the names of Zales 
Jewelers, Zales Outlet, Zales Direct, Gordon's Jewelers and Bailey 
Banks &AMP; Biddle Fine Jewelers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has led the industry in an effort to cater to  
consumers who are becoming more value-conscious about their 
bracelets, necklaces and rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all part of people wanting to put their money into things  
that are lasting and that reflect quality,'' Ms. Ramsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say independents, who control about 67 percent of the  
industry, have benefited least by Americans' interest in fine 
jewelry. Instead, shoppers have headed to discounters and malls, 
where Zale stores are located. 
</P>
<P>
	Zale is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, but its  
history hasn't been all rosy. 
</P>
<P>
	The company grew to 1,800 stores in the 1980s. Heavy debt pushed  
it into bankruptcy in 1992 and forced the closure of 700 stores. 
The company emerged 18 months later lacking focus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issues were that Zale had no direction. There was no  
business plan. Things were pretty broken at the time,'' said Robert 
J. DiNicola, Zale's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	DiNicola came to the company in 1994 after spending 27 years in  
retail with Federated Department Stores and R.H. Macy &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prior to my arrival there had been seven CEOs in six years,''  
DiNicola said. ``The folks here at the corporation were somewhat 
skeptical and one could even say cynical. My objective was to keep 
it simple and go back to the fundamentals and sell the best jewelry 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collette Foreman, a store manager in Dallas for 15 years, said  
the management upheaval meant she and her colleagues were receiving 
mixed messages before DiNicola arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worried that our checks would bounce, worried that our doors  
would close,'' she said. ``It's an honor to work for a company that 
has redeemed itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the old days, Zale concentrated on diamond solitaires. The  
bridal business was 65 percent of all sales. DiNicola saw missed 
opportunities to lure in the customers who weren't planning a trip 
down the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	The company now has 30 percent bridal sales, 30 percent fashion  
jewelry sales, 30 percent gifts and 10 percent watches and other. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a battery put in yesterday and I'm happy. It's not too  
expensive,'' said Brigitte Laurant, a customer who said she 
appreciates the convenience of going to Zale while at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
	And DiNicola implemented other changes as well. Each store also  
used to buy two of each jewelry piece, or ``one to show and one to 
go.'' DiNicola instead pushed for an aggressive approach to 
inventory management, getting rid of the items that didn't sell and 
concentrating on the top-movers. 
</P>
<P>
	He also refocused advertising to build Zale name recognition.  
</P>
<P>
	The changes have worked, analysts say.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're doing a lot of things right and I really can't  
think of anything they're doing wrong,'' said Harry Ikenson, senior 
retail analyst for Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. 
</P>
<P>
	To capitalize on its accomplishments, Zale plans to open 75 new  
stores a year for at least three years. It also plans to continue 
remodeling stores to add more display area, which has been proven 
to boost sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes have grown the business from $900 million in sales  
in 1994 to around $1.5 billion for fiscal 1999. But DiNicola still 
isn't satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Zale Corp. said it would buy Peoples Jewellers  
Corp., a privately owned chain of 175 jewelry stores in Canada, for 
about $75 million. DiNicola said it was ``a natural extension of 
our long-term plan to expand'' Zale operations internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	And DiNicola also plans to start opening stores outside the  
malls. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the Zale brand we can do things like online shopping for  
jewelry under the Zale banner,'' he said. ``Customers trust us, 
they know who we are. They know they can go to a store if they want 
to exchange. Trust is utmost in the jewelry business.''

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Shellfish Harvesting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- Private property owners and commercial  
shellfish growers were stunned by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling 
affirming Washington tribes' right to harvest shellfish on private 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials, shellfish growers and private property owners  
contended the American Indians' 19th century treaties give them no 
legal claim to shellfish on private property. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high court on Monday rejected without comment a ruling  
by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld the tribes' 
shellfish rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our members are devastated,'' said Bill Dewey, a spokesman for  
the Puget Sound Shellfish Growers Association. ``This is an 
incredible burden for the growers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial shellfish growers contend the ruling could threaten  
their livelihoods and ``will cripple or destroy the growers'' by 
allowing tribal members to enter their property. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal leaders said the ruling does not mean American Indians  
will be indiscriminately tramping private beaches to dig clams, 
mussels and other shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long process before you can go on a beach and  
harvest,'' said Doug Williams, a spokesman for the Northwest Indian 
Fisheries Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``There must be a biological assessment of the area, sampling  
and testing, and a written notice. In fact, as far as I know, there 
has been only one harvest off of a private landowner's beach'' 
since the case began with a 1994 ruling on tribal shellfish rights 
in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the 17 Indian tribes noted in their appeal that the  
9th U.S. Circuit ruling allows tribes to harvest only shellfish 
that would exist naturally, without the growers' help. 
</P>
<P>
	Dewey doesn't see it that way.  
</P>
<P>
	``The burden is on the grower to prove'' which shellfish are  
naturally occurring and which are not ``for every bed,'' he said. 
``This is an incredible burden for the growers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under treaties signed in 1855, the tribes gave up most of their  
land in then-Washington Territory in exchange for reservations, 
money and the right to continue fishing in traditional fishing 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of court rulings during the 1970s defined what areas  
are traditional Indian fishing grounds, and affirmed the tribes' 
right to take up to half of the salmon and other fish. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie said shellfish are  
also covered by the 1970s rulings. The 9th Circuit upheld most of 
Rafeedie's ruling and allowed the Indians to harvest shellfish on 
some private cultivated beds.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Judge Bars Part of Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The judge in Susan McDougal's trial  
Tuesday barred the jury from considering a major part of her 
defense -- that Kenneth Starr was trying to get her to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury is permitted to consider her attacks against Starr on  
the obstruction of justice charge she faces, but not in connection 
with two charges of criminal contempt, U.S. District Judge George 
Howard Jr. stated in jury instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have heard evidence that the defendant believed that  
certain prosecutors wanted something other than her truthful 
testimony,'' Howard wrote in the instructions which will be 
delivered following closing arguments Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This evidence should be considered by you only when  
considering ... the obstruction of justice charge,'' the judge 
wrote. ``You are not to consider this evidence when considering'' 
the contempt charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Another instruction says ``the law does not recognize as a  
defense to these charges that the defendant was motivated to commit 
her acts by sincere moral, political or religious convictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal maintains that Starr wanted to ``get'' the  
Clintons and that she feared he would charge her with perjury if 
she didn't say what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked for a response to the jury instructions, Pat Harris, Mrs.  
McDougal's finance and co-counsel for the defense, said ``Some of 
them we got'' in our favor and ``some of them we didn't.''

<HEADLINE> Astrodome Awaits a Long Goodbye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- They could have used shovels for the  
groundbreaking, but this called for Texas flair. 
</P>
<P>
	The guests fired Colt .45 pistols into a vacant lot, marking the  
start of Harris County Domed Stadium, otherwise known as the 
Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	The man behind the project, Judge Roy Hofheinz, modestly  
suggested the stadium be dubbed the Eighth Wonder of the World. 
</P>
<P>
	That was 34 years and several facelifts ago. Now the Astrodome  
is losing its oldest tenant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Astros next season move to a 42,000-seat downtown  
ballpark with a retractable roof. The team began its long goodbye 
Tuesday night, with Sammy Sosa and the Chicago Cubs in town for the 
1999 opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad from one standpoint, but that's got to be tempered  
with the excitement of moving into a new facility,'' Astros 
president Tal Smith said. ``I think the Astrodome lost a lot of its 
character when they took down the scoreboard and changed the 
configuration of the exterior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exodus began in 1997, when the NFL's Houston Oilers headed  
to Tennessee even after the $2 million scoreboard was removed to 
satisfy owner Bud Adams' demand for more seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, the Astros will play on real grass for the first time  
since the earliest days of the Astrodome, whose opaque center-field 
glass prompted the invention of Astroturf. 
</P>
<P>
	The new home will be ready for opening day in 2000. Left behind  
will be the building where the Astros won division titles the last 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	They also were six outs from the World Series against  
Philadelphia in 1980 and lost to the New York Mets in the 1986 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the air-conditioned Astrodome, fans had to tolerate the  
mosquitoes and sapping heat of Colt Stadium. Now it's back to the 
elements again, with the option of closing the roof in unacceptable 
weather. In Houston, that could mean most of July, August and 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	The first major league game at the Astrodome was April 9, 1965 --  
Astros vs. Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mickey Mantle was the first batter and they told him to take  
the first pitch so they could keep the ball,'' recalled Ron Brand, 
then the Houston catcher. ``Mantle said `I'm too nervous to swing 
anyway.' I couldn't believe he would be nervous but it really was 
an exciting time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astrodome cost $31.5 million, a figure that couldn't meet  
some salary demands today. The Ballpark at Union Station, the 
downtown stadium's working title, will cost $265 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was the Astros' liaison during construction of the  
Astrodome, which opened the era of modern stadium design. He's also 
in charge of this move. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't seem like 35 years ago, but it was one of the most  
impressionable events in my life that I had the chance to be 
associated with it,'' Smith said. ``I was with that project from 
the time it was a hole in the ground until completion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astrodome's future depends on Houston businessman Bob  
McNair's efforts to land a franchise to replace the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair has approval for a new football stadium on the same  
property. If he gets a team, most of the events previously held in 
the Astrodome will move to the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
	That would relegate the Astrodome to conventions and trade  
shows. If McNair is unsuccessful, the Houston Livestock Show and 
Rodeo would consider renovating the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Mark McGwire's assault on the home run record, ex-Astros  
Jimmy Wynn and Doug Rader had the longest upper-deck shots at the 
Astrodome. When the stadium was renovated, Wynn got the original 
seat marking his home run. He now has it in his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was going out, I just didn't know how far until I  
got back to the dugout,'' Wynn said. ``My teammates pointed to 
exactly where it hit and I just stood there a few seconds and said, 
`Wow.'''

<HEADLINE> Kissinger, Ueberroth on IOC Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One helped broker peace in Vietnam and the  
Middle East. The other helped turn the Olympics from nearly broke 
into a virtual money machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the IOC hopes Henry Kissinger and Peter Ueberroth can  
help clean up its worst scandal and make sure it never recurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic sources said Tuesday that Kissinger, the former  
secretary of state, and Ueberroth, head organizer of the 1984 
Summer Games in Los Angeles, had been picked for a panel to 
restructure the International Olympic Committee in the wake of the 
Salt Lake bribery case. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not known if either accepted the appointments from IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch, but news that Kissinger was 
involved brought immediate praise from the IOC's harshest 
congressional critic, Sen. John McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is pleased to see the appointment of someone of Dr.  
Kissinger's stature,'' said Pia Pialorsi, a spokeswoman for the 
Arizona Republican whose Commerce Committee has scheduled hearings 
on the Olympic scandal next week. 
</P>
<P>
	She said McCain still hoped for quick reforms by the IOC ``to  
ensure transparency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said  
Samaranch also asked IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz to serve on 
the panel, IOC 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Hybl, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, was the  
first member announced earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger, Ueberroth and DeFrantz were traveling Tuesday and  
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, were closed for the  
day and communications director Franklin Servan-Schreiber was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC 2000 was set up last month as the committee's primary engine  
for change after the Salt Lake scandal, in which six members were 
expelled in a million-dollar gifts-for-votes scheme involving the 
Utah capital's successful quest for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission will have 20-24 members, half from the IOC and  
half ``leading personalities who understand sport,'' and 
essentially will come up with a new version of the Olympic Charter, 
the IOC's century-old bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
	It will study and make recommendations on selection of Olympic  
host cities; how IOC members are elected; term limits; structure 
and membership of the ruling executive board; and further roles for 
Olympic athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also will look at revenue sharing and the evolution of  
the games themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch wants the commission to meet in early June, with an  
interim report presented to the IOC general assembly later that 
month in Seoul, South Korea, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, as IOC president, will head the commission and  
appoint its members, two points attacked last month by critics, 
including McCain, who felt the panel needed more independence. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Kissinger a member, the IOC reform panel gains instant  
credibility because of his long record of statesmanship and 
diplomacy. Samaranch had mentioned Kissinger as the type of 
heavyweight he wanted on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Ueberroth also brings weight -- and an educated outsider's view --  
to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	After leading the Los Angeles Games to athletic success and a  
$225 million surplus that convinced cities and sponsors the 
Olympics were a good investment, Ueberroth served as baseball 
commissioner and now heads the Contrarian Group, a venture capital 
company based in southern California. He has been critical of the 
IOC and its president. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz was a bronze-medal rower at the 1976 Games who sued  
over the White House-led boycott of the 1980 Games in Moscow. She 
worked with Ueberroth in 1984, was appointed to the IOC in 1986 and 
now runs the foundation of amateur sports in Los Angeles, financed 
by seed money from the '84 surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl, a former Colorado prosecutor, heads El Pomar, one of the  
nation's largest charitable foundations. He has been USOC president 
since 1996 and headed the ethics investigation into the 1994 
scandal involving figure skating rivals Tonya Harding and Nancy 
Kerrigan.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Endorse Hate Crime Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is asking Congress to expand  
federal hate crime laws to include offenses based on sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also is directing that colleges be required to  
report hate crimes annually and endorse a public-private 
partnership designed to educate middle school students against 
intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership will involve AT&AMP;T, Court TV, Cable in the  
Classroom, the National Middle Schools Association and the 
Anti-Defamation League working with the Justice and Education 
departments to develop curricula to combat intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was announcing the initiatives today with religious,  
education and law enforcement leaders at a Roosevelt Room ceremony, 
White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is signing this directive to increase public  
awareness and information about hate crimes among young people and 
doing whatever he can in his power to advance this cause while we 
wait for Congress to act,'' said Bruce Reed, the White House 
director of public policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for the middle schools program grew out of a White  
House conference on hate crimes that generated a lot of anecdotal 
information about ethnic and racial insensitivities among school 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim, said a White House official who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, is to ``nip intolerance in the bud'' by educating 
children about its consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton will direct the Justice and Education  
departments to require that college campuses provide specific 
information about hate crimes in the campus crime statistics they 
provide to law enforcement each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The information will be used to generate hard data on how  
violent crimes relate to intolerance on college campuses, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's hate crimes legislation died in committee last year in  
the House and Senate. The initiative was reintroduced last month by 
a bipartisan group of lawmakers that include Sens. Edward M. 
Kennedy, D-Mass., and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Reps. John Conyers, 
D-Mich., and Connie Morella, R-Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, current law would be expanded so the Justice  
Department could prosecute crimes based on a person's sex, sexual 
orientation or disability. Now, the statute only covers crimes 
based on race, color, religion or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would make federal prosecution of hate crimes  
easier. Current law limits prosecution to situations where the 
victim is targeted for engaging in certain federally protected 
activities, such as serving on a jury, voting or attending public 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 states have hate crimes laws but only 21 cover  
sexual orientation, 22 cover gender and 21 cover disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors hope that outrage over recent highly publicized  
killings will fuel support for the measure this year. 
</P>
<P>
	One of two young men charged in the Wyoming slaying of gay  
college student Matthew Shepard pleaded guilty Monday. He was 
sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men have been charged with beating to death a gay textile  
worker, Billy Jack Gaither, in Alabama earlier this year and 
burning his body on a pile of tires. 
</P>
<P>
	John William King, a white supremacist, was sentenced to death  
in Texas for chaining a black man, James Byrd Jr., behind a pickup 
truck and dragging him to his death. Two other men wait trial in 
the case.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks for Hate-Law Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to ride the momentum of headlines from  
Kosovo, Laramie and Jasper, President Clinton asked Congress on 
Tuesday to extend federal hate crime laws to include offenses based 
on sexual orientation, gender or disability. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, Clinton said, is as vulnerable as Kosovo --  
``old, even primitive hatreds,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very humbling. We should remember that each of us almost  
wakes up every day with the scales of light and darkness in our own 
hearts, and we've got to keep them in proper balance. And we have 
to be, in the United States, absolutely resolute about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also ordered the Education Department to begin  
collecting data on hate crimes on college campuses. ``We have 
significant problems there and we need to shine a light on that,'' 
he said without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	An MTV: Music Television survey released Tuesday found that 91  
percent of 12 to 24-year-olds describe hate crimes as a ``very 
serious'' or ``somewhat serious'' national problem. Nearly two in 
10 young people said they know a victim of a gender-based hate 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, more than 8,000 hate crime incidents were reported in  
the United States in 1997. For 1998, the National Coalition of 
Anti-Violence Programs reported a 108-percent increase in 
gay-bashing violence that left victims hospitalized. Assaults and 
attempted assaults with firearms against gays and lesbians rose 71 
percent, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about whether people have a right, if they show  
up and work hard and obey the law and are good citizens, to pursue 
their lives in dignity free of fear, without fear of being 
abused,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Current hate crimes law bans only race-, ethnicity- and  
religion-based crimes. The Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999, 
which Clinton endorsed, would add three protected categories -- 
sexual orientation, gender and disability -- and make the 
prosecution of hate crimes easier by deleting the stipulation that 
the victim is targeted for engaging in certain federally protected 
activities, such as serving on a jury, voting or attending public 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 states have hate crimes laws but only 21 cover  
sexual orientation, 22 cover gender and 21 cover disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton endorsed a partnership among AT&AMP;T, Court TV, Cable in  
the Classroom, the National Middle Schools Association and the 
Anti-Defamation League working with the Justice and Education 
departments to develop middle-school curricula to combat 
intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert H. Knight of the Washington-based Family Research Council  
denounced it all as a ``homosexual agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot allow the law to designate less protection for some  
people than others,'' said Knight. He called the middle-school 
program an attempt at ``reeducating America's children away from 
traditional morality under the guise of 'tolerance.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's effort to revive the legislation, which went nowhere  
in the House and Senate last year, comes on the heels of several 
high-profile cases: 
</P>
<P>
	--Matthew Shepard, a gay college student pistol-whipped and  
strung up to die on a prairie fence in Laramie, Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	--James Byrd Jr., the black man killed as he was dragged by a  
chain behind the pickup truck of white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
	--Billy Jack Gaither, a gay textile worker in Alabama beaten to  
death then burned atop a pile of tires. 
</P>
<P>
	Such headlines improve the legislation's chances in Congress,  
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said. ``Unfortunately when 
you have incidents like we've had in our country over the last 
year, it sometimes tends to galvanize public interest and support 
for something like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rt. Rev. Jane Holmes Dixon, suffragan bishop of Washington  
who participated in the White House announcement, said Shepard's 
``crucifixion in the Wyoming winter'' made the legislation's 
necessity ``horrifying clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While we watch what is unfolding in Kosovo with ever  
increasing horror, we must not let those distant hate crimes 
distract us from the hate crimes here on our own soil,'' Dixon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The MTV survey, conducted last month by Penn, Schoen &AMP; Berland,  
questioned 750 people between the ages of 12 and 24 -- 60 percent 
students, 40 percent non-students. The poll claimed a margin of 
error of 3.6 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> 'Junior' Gotti Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Like father, like son -- John A.  
``Junior'' Gotti is headed for jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti, the 35-year-old son of America's best-known Mafioso,  
pleaded guilty Monday night to racketeering, bribery and other 
charges and will spend five to seven years in prison. Jury 
selection in his trial was to have begun today in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors proudly declared victory against the Gambino crime  
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us are naive enough to think you don't have to remain  
vigilant because there are obviously other Gambino members and 
associates out there,'' U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said. ``But in 
terms of what it does to the leadership and the power, I think it 
can't be overstated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti also was fined $1 million and must forfeit $1 million in  
cash and property that prosecutors say are proceeds from his 
criminal ventures. He could have been sentenced to 15 years in 
prison and fined millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti, who remains free on $10 million bail, said nothing as he  
exited the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing was scheduled for July 8. Prosecutors said the term  
will range between five years and ten months, and seven years and 
two months. Defense attorneys said they will not challenge the 
judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti was accused of succeeding his father, John J. Gotti, at  
the top of the Gambino family after the elder Gotti was sent to 
prison for life in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the charges -- robbery, loansharking, gambling and  
bribery -- stemmed from an alleged extortion scheme at the Manhattan 
topless club Scores. Thirty-nine other people have pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Gotti admitted to bribing a union official,  
conspiring with others to commit extortion, supervising illegal 
gambling activities and filing a false income tax return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I conspired with a group of individuals forming an  
association,'' Gotti told Judge Barrington Parker, though he did 
not mention the Gambino family. 
</P>
<P>
	He entered the plea after learning that federal prosecutors had  
planned to indict him on income tax and loansharking charges, 
defense attorney Gerald Shargel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Gotti) found himself in a no-win situation,'' Shargel said.  
``If he was convicted, he would be sentenced to time in jail. If he 
was acquitted, it would be like the Old West: Every prosecutor in 
the area would be gunning for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Gotti, known as the Teflon Don for avoiding conviction  
in three trials, was found guilty in 1992 in a racketeering case 
that alleged five murders -- including that of his predecessor, Paul 
Castellano -- and featured the Mafia's highest-ranking turncoat, 
Salvatore ``Sammy the Bull'' Gravano. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the entire indictment against ``Junior,'' there was no  
mention of murder. No cement shoes, no sleeping with the fishes, no 
kiss on the lips followed by a bullet to the head. There wasn't 
even any leg-breaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that kind of mob case,'' said Ronald Goldstock,  
former director of the state Organized Crime Task Force. ``You 
might not get those much anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So many Mafia leaders are in prison and so many mobsters are  
willing to cooperate that it's difficult now to carry out ``the 
kind of blatant criminal activity people associate with organized 
crime,'' Goldstock said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the younger Gotti's case is less glamorous, so is the  
defendant himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Junior,'' whose father also was called the Dapper Don for his  
fine suits and silvery hair, has gone to court in sneakers and 
jeans. Unlike his swaggering father, he rushes past the cameras and 
talks to reporters in half-sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gotti asked to be jailed during the trial so he  
wouldn't have to pay the $24,000 monthly cost of round-the-clock 
security guards that were a condition of his release on bail. He 
withdrew that request Monday because the judge ruled that he didn't 
have to pay for guards during the trial.

<HEADLINE> Portals Slow in Future Online Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Online retailers may be using Internet gateways now  
to increase their exposure on the Web, but they won't be able to 
rely on these relationships for huge sales growth in coming years, 
a new study has found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, released today by Internet research firm Jupiter  
Communications Co., said that retailers should expect electronic 
commerce from these entry points to the Internet, known as portals, 
to account for only 20 percent of online retail revenues by 2002, 
up slightly from a projected 18 percent in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the New York-based Jupiter estimates that online  
retail sales generated by portal sites will represent $2.4 billion 
out of the $13 billion in total sales, and $8.7 billion out of 
$43.7 billion in revenues in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Through portals such as Yahoo!, Excite and Lycos, consumers can  
search the Internet as well as find a wealth of online services 
such as free e-mail, news, chat and personalized functions like 
stock quotes, local weather and sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Since they have become such popular destination sites on the  
Web, portals have cut expensive, multiyear ``tenancy'' deals with a 
wide array of online merchants to market and refer shoppers to 
their sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Portals have also been fueling much of the Internet merger mania  
on Wall Street in recent months as online companies have been eager 
to align themselves with the powerful portals. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Jupiter questions the role these Internet entry points  
will play for online merchants in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``While they offer an effective means to drive traffic, primary  
portals do not help commerce players retain customers,'' said Marc 
Johnson, director of Jupiter's Digital Commerce Strategies research 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet retailers are locked in a fierce battle to obtain  
customers who will return to their site when they are shopping 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	To achieve this goal, Jupiter is encouraging retailers to expand  
their distribution and marketing efforts, including more 
advertising off-line and aligning with sites representing specific 
customers and consumer interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on interviews with 36 Internet retailing  
executives with portal agreements, along with Jupiter's own 
consumer research. It was released at the Jupiter Online Shopping 
Forum in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those online merchants surveyed, about 92 percent said portal  
deals help expose their sites to a wide audience, but more than 60 
percent noted that only one-third of the sales that result can be 
attributed to the portal deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 5 percent of the merchants surveyed said they were  
likely to renew their current portal agreements. That does not mean 
they will abandon the portals, but they will reevaluate their 
deals, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the study's findings, portal executives still believe  
that retailers won't be able to find a better way to market 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virtually anyone who has built a successful retail site has  
done it through a portal one way or another,'' said Bob Davis, 
president and chief executive of Lycos. ``I don't think there is an 
effective way or an affordable way to build visibility to your site 
without that portal relationship.''

<HEADLINE> Iverson, Brown Try To Make Amends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson insists it's no big deal.  
Larry Brown isn't happy with his star player, but doesn't expect 
things to change. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter who is right or wrong, it's easy to see who loses in  
the latest spat between Iverson and his coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia 76ers.  
</P>
<P>
	Once again, Iverson and Brown emerged from a meeting Monday  
saying nice things about each other, but giving no indication their 
rocky relationship will change. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearances aside, Iverson and Brown seem to have added to the  
rift that threatens to derail a young team on the rise. The script 
is all too familiar for Iverson, whose pursuit of recognition as 
the best player in the league has again been eclipsed by 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you throw my name in the mix with something negative, I  
mean it just explodes,'' said Iverson, who has a deep thigh bruise 
and hasn't played since exchanging words with Brown on Friday night 
against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what y'all need to sell papers. That's what y'all need  
for people to look at your show or whatever. Y'all need that 
energy. Y'all need that negativity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson did not practice and is not expected to play tonight  
against Milwaukee. He was on court for a brief shootaround at the 
end of the team's workout at a suburban college, then talked with 
Brown for 20 to 30 minutes before both emerged to discuss their 
latest attempt at a truce. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great meeting,'' Iverson said. ``And I don't think it  
was a meeting called for what went on with the last game. That's 
something that's been going on ever since coach Brown got here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the one issue on which Iverson and Brown agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I've taken Allen out since I've been here, I've had  
the same response,'' Brown said. ``And I understand. He just wants 
to play. He doesn't understand how it affects maybe his teammates 
or me. ... I don't think it's going to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also had words with Iverson's bodyguard after practice  
Monday. The coach kicked Terry Royster out of the locker room after 
the Cleveland game. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson did not play the opening 2:03 of the second quarter  
against the Cavaliers after going 0-for-7 in the first quarter. 
When Brown told Iverson to go back into the game, Iverson, 
according to courtside reporters, muttered, ``It's about time you 
put me back in,'' and used an obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Iverson denied he cursed Brown.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking at different things on TV and in the paper, and  
they're saying things that I didn't even say,'' Iverson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown wouldn't recount the exchange, but said there was a  
``second response'' from Iverson when the coach tried to put him 
back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know him, I know his response,'' Brown said. ``And it's not  
something I normally take offense with. I did at the time. I think 
I had a right to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson played for two weeks after hurting his right thigh in a  
collision with the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal on March 19. He told 
the trainer he couldn't play in the second half against Cleveland, 
and the 76ers lost 85-80 without him. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson skipped the team's one-game road trip to Toronto on  
Sunday, and the 76ers lost 97-82 -- their second straight loss and 
seventh in nine games as they plummet out of the playoff picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson said his leg stiffened when Brown sat him back down  
against the Cavaliers. Rick Mahorn denied a report that he and 
other 76ers players had to talk Iverson out of leaving the arena at 
halftime of the Cleveland game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nothing like that,'' Mahorn said. ``It was just us  
corralling the wagons together and saying, `We're all together for 
the long haul.' It's nothing where anybody's better than the other 
person. We all have to take care of our jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How long Brown and Iverson can coexist this way is the biggest  
question facing the team. Since Brown was hired last year, they've 
quarreled about playing time, coaching style and missed practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson signed a $70.9 million, six-year contract in January,  
proclaiming past differences with Brown over. 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously, they're not.  
</P>
<P>
	``If y'all think that Larry Brown and myself are not going to  
have any altercations, I mean that's crazy,'' Iverson said. 
``That's ridiculous.''

<HEADLINE> MLS Bans Enhancement Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major League Soccer banned anabolic steroids and  
human growth hormone today and expects to begin testing players by 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Doug Logan said the league added six categories to  
its list of banned substances, including erythropoietin (EPO), an 
endurance-boosting hormone that increases the blood's ability to 
carry oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	EPO is a favorite of some cyclists and was at the center of the  
Tour de France drug scandal last year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, scientifically reliable tests have not been perfected  
for some substances, such as EPO, but are expected to be available 
by next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because we cannot test for them, doesn't mean shouldn't  
be making statement that these substances should be banned,'' Logan 
said during a conference call. ``They violate the ethics of 
competitive sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MLS already tests every league and team employee, including  
players, once a year by urinalysis for 10 kinds of illegal drugs, 
including cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines and barbiturates. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's policy change added steroids, stimulants (other than  
caffeine or medications approved by the league), EPO, human growth 
hormone, chorionic gonadotrophin (another human growth hormone), 
and diuretics (used to mask drugs). 
</P>
<P>
	MLS operations manager William Ordower said the 3-year-old  
league has been considering adding such substances for a few years. 
However, the league decided to go forward after a recommendation of 
Dr. Ian Macdonald, who also advises the International Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making the announcement now to give our players a full  
season to change their habits if any did rely on it,'' Ordower 
said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Awards $26.5 Mil. to Smoker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A judge slashed a tobacco lawsuit award in  
half Tuesday, reducing from $51.5 million to $26.5 million the 
amount awarded to a former three-pack-a-day smoker with lung 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John Munter said the $50 million punitive award in  
Patricia Henley's case was excessive. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. Henley won $51.5 million from Philip Morris in  
February, it was the largest award ever in a tobacco liability 
lawsuit filed by an individual smoker. That was based on $1.5 
million in compensatory damages to cover medical expenses, pain and 
suffering, and $50 million in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other awards in similar cases have been overturned on  
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said a damage award of $25 million -- easily more than  
the $15 million Ms. Henley asked for -- is enough to punish Philip 
Morris for misleading the public about the dangers of smoking and 
for marketing cigarettes to teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Munter also denied the company's request for a new trial.  
</P>
<P>
	Harry Wartnick, a lawyer for Ms. Henley, noted that she has the  
option of rejecting the reduced award and retrying the case. But he 
said $26.5 million should be enough to ``get a message across to 
Philip Morris and to any other company that looks to market 
products that kill human beings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris attorney Michael York said the company planned to  
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of very significant and complicated legal  
issues that need to be resolved by an appellate court,'' York said. 
He declined to specify any issues or comment on the judge's 
criticism of Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	William Ohlemeyer, a lawyer for the company, had argued that  
Philip Morris wasn't responsible for Ms. Henley's decision to smoke 
and never claimed cigarettes were safe. He said there was no 
evidence she started smoking or continued to smoke because of 
Philip Morris ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henley, 52, of Los Angeles, said she became hooked on  
Marlboros at age 15 and smoked three packs a day until 1997, after 
she started suffering coughing fits and other health problems. She 
was diagnosed last year with inoperable lung cancer, which she says 
is now in remission after chemotherapy and radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Her suit was the first tried in California since the repeal of a  
1987 law that protected tobacco companies against suits by 
individual smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, an Oregon jury awarded $80.3 million to the family of  
a Portland man who died of lung cancer after smoking three packs of 
Marlboros a day for 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Three jury verdicts for smokers in other states have been  
overturned on appeal, and juries in other cases have ruled in 
tobacco companies' favor.

<HEADLINE> 2 Plead Guilty to Defrauding Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- A man and a woman from Boston have  
pleaded guilty in connection with accessing a computer to defraud 
Salomon Brothers Investor Fund, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardo L. Rhodes, 29, admitted tapping into a computer and  
stealing about $616,000 by activating 50 inactive shareholder 
accounts, and distributing checks from the accounts to several 
people between February 1996 and January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, who was employed as an investor services specialist for  
First Data Corporation of Westboro, gained access to the mainframe 
operated by the company, and used his personal password to activate 
the accounts, the U.S. Attorney's office said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, Rhodes and a codefendant, Charlene D. Hall, 30, pleaded  
guilty to charges of fraud, aiding and abetting and criminal 
forfeiture in U.S. District Court in Worcester. Hall was accused of 
cashing 77 of the fraudulent checks, totaling more than $441,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall cashed the checks -- ranging in amounts from $1,000 to  
$12,678 -- at various Boston check cashing outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	By October 1997, Hall was having trouble cashing the checks, and  
recruited Nikita M. Rose to assist in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Hall and Rose kept about $1,000 from each check, and turned  
over the rest of the money to Rhodes, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose -- who was accused of cashing more than $73,673 in  
unauthorized checks between October 1997 and January 1998 -- pleaded 
guilty to the charges in January. She is scheduled to be sentenced 
April 7.

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Gay Attack Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Russell Henderson stood before the sobbing  
parents of Matthew Shepard and apologized for kidnapping their son, 
lashing him to a fence and leaving him to die from a 
pistol-whipping on the cold prairie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what I did was wrong. I'm very sorry for what I did,''  
he said. ``You have my greatest sympathy for what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, a 21-year-old high school dropout, avoided a possible  
death sentence by pleading guilty Monday to kidnapping and felony 
murder in last fall's death of the gay college student. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's parents bitterly rejected the apology and so did Judge  
Jeffrey Donnell, who sentenced Henderson to two consecutive life 
terms. . Under Wyoming law, Henderson's only hope for release from 
prison is a pardon. 
</P>
<P>
	Another man, Aaron McKinney, still faces a murder trial in the  
slaying that prompted calls for legislative change nationally and 
in Wyoming, one of eight states without a hate crimes law. 
President Clinton called the beating an ``evil act'' and urged 
Congress to strengthen federal laws against such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's mother, Judy, wept during Monday's hearing, burying  
her head in her husband Dennis' chest. She steadied herself enough 
to stand at the podium to address Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times I don't know how you'd be worthy of any  
acknowledgment of your existence,'' she said, glaring at Henderson. 
``You murdered my son. ... None of us would be here today going 
through this agony if it wasn't for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Shepard: ``It takes someone quite unique to sit and watch  
someone else be beaten to death and do nothing about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's aunts and uncles, separated from the Shepards by a  
narrow aisle, also cried at times during the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson wiped a tear from his eye as his grandmother, Lucy  
Thompson, told the court the family ``will never give up on him 
because we know there is goodness within him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Henderson showed little emotion as he described the  
fatal beating Oct. 6, saying he reluctantly went along with 
McKinney's plan to entice Shepard out of a bar and into a pickup 
truck to rob him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I disagreed,'' Henderson told the court.  
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said he drove the truck to a remote area in the  
southern plains of Wyoming and followed McKinney's order to tie 
their victim to a fence so McKinney could to pistol-whip the 
5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matt looked really bad so I told him to stop hitting him, I  
think he's had enough,'' he said. Henderson said his friend turned 
on him and struck him in the face with the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, a University of Wyoming freshman, died five days later.  
</P>
<P>
	Donnell told Henderson the ``vile and senseless'' crime deserved  
the fullest punishment he could hand out. He said he didn't believe 
Henderson felt any remorse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my hope that Mr. Henderson will die in the Wyoming state  
penitentiary and the only time he leaves the Wyoming state 
penitentiary is when they bury him,'' added prosecutor Cal Rerucha. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Wyatt Skaggs denied that Shepard was targeted  
because he was gay. ``This crime has never been a hate crime,'' he 
said. ``They did this because he was believed to have some money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Renna, director of community relations for the Gay and  
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't do what they did to Matthew for a wallet and a pair  
of shoes,'' said Renna, who sat beside Shepard's family in court. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, 21, could face the death penalty when he is tried in  
August on first-degree murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's girlfriend is awaiting sentencing after pleading  
guilty to accessory after the fact to murder. McKinney's girlfriend 
goes on trial in May on an accessory charge.

<HEADLINE> Alloy Could Aid Semiconductors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	An alloy based on silicon carbide -- the gritty ingredient that  
makes sandpaper sandy -- and germanium could lead to faster 
semiconductor chips that can withstand higher temperatures, 
researchers at the University of Delaware said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Such chips could be used in car engines or other hot  
environments existing silicon chips can't tolerate, said James 
Kolodzey, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	The alloy also dissipates heat more readily, meaning chips made  
of the substance could handle higher power, opening the way for 
improvements in cellular phones, computers and other devices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very tough,'' Kolodzey said.  
</P>
<P>
	The research was presented Tuesday at a meeting of the Materials  
Research Society in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The chips are similar to those being developed by IBM, which use  
germanium and silicon, but are more heat resistant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new alloy conducted twice as much current, compared to pure  
silicon carbide, and can withstand temperatures of up to 617 
degrees, compared to about 257 degrees for silicon, said Gary 
Katulka, a University of Delaware doctoral candidate and research 
engineer at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory in Aberdeen, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The research is being sponsored by the U.S. Army and the U.S.  
Office of Naval Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Further testing is needed to make sure the alloy can  
consistently conduct electricity, but ``so far, our results have 
been very promising,'' Katulka said.

<HEADLINE> Ballpark Abandons High-Tech Grass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Forget about that special strain of grass  
developed for Bank One Ballpark. The grass is greener this spring 
at the park affectionately known as BOB. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, for the park's second season, the Arizona  
Diamondbacks have opted for a blend of bluegrass and rye grass, the 
same traditional turf that's used in ballparks across America. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year marked the first time anyone had tried to have a  
genuine grass field in a ballpark where the roof was closed at 
least half of the time. To make matters more difficult, the grass 
had to grow in a climate in which the summer temperature exceeded 
115 degrees when the roof was open. 
</P>
<P>
	The people who run the ballpark were in a constant balancing act  
of providing enough sun for the grass while trying to deal with 
wear and tear and keeping the roof closed early enough to make it 
comfortable for the fans by gametime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people understand the magnitude of what took  
place here last year,'' head groundskeeper Grant Trenbeath said. 
``This was the very first of its kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There also was the problem of getting the grass to grow in the  
early part of the baseball season, when temperatures are cooler. 
The special DeAnza strain selected for the ballpark after three 
years of research at the University of California at Riverside 
doesn't do well until the minimum temperature reaches at least 70 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	After rejecting a proposal to install underground heat beneath  
the field during the offseason, Diamondbacks officials decided to 
overseed the DeAnza with bluegrass, which does well in cool 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	But the planting at the West Coast Turf farm in Palm Desert,  
Calif., wasn't done until early December. The grass was extremely 
slow to germinate, and when it came time to put the sod in five 
weeks ago, it wasn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``It basically forced our hand to go into another direction,''  
Trenbeath said. 
</P>
<P>
	So 107,000 square feet of the rye-bluegrass blend was installed,  
a lush turf that's a much deeper green than last year's field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very fun grass,'' Trenbeath said. ``Most of my  
experience comes with this type of grass. Obviously, you can see 
the color and you can do a lot more stuff with it in terms of 
dressing it up and striping it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a combination of not enough light for right field and  
wear and tear behind the plate led to the necessity of patching the 
field with sod, patches that were clearly visible and not very 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	Since rye grass grows much more quickly than the DeAnza,  
Trenbeath said, worn spots can be re-seeded when the team is out of 
town and should be back in good shape by the time the Diamondbacks 
come home. 
</P>
<P>
	But ryegrass and bluegrass doesn't do well in extreme heat, so  
what happens in the notoriously hot Phoenix summer? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't necessarily care to come back in here and re-sod this  
in the middle of the summer, in the heat,'' Trenbeath said, ``but 
that I guess is a drop-dead possibility if something goes south. 
</P>
<P>
	``But given that we are in a fairly controlled environment,  
something we can kind of tweak our way around, I feel confident 
that's not going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it will be another balancing act. Trenbeath plans to close  
the roof and use the air conditioning to keep the heat down while 
making sure it's open often enough to provide sufficient light. He 
also said light watering could keep the surface temperatures lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, stadiums with retractable roofs are under  
construction in Seattle, Milwaukee, Detroit and Houston. All plan 
to have real grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Each has its own special climate considerations, but those in  
charge of getting the grass to grow are keeping a close eye on 
what's happening with BOB.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Claims MCI Discriminates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc. discriminates against  
customers by preventing them from making international calls from 
predominantly ethnic minority neighborhoods designated as ``high 
fraud'' areas, according to a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is redlining at its worst,'' said co-counsel Raymond  
Boucher, who filed the lawsuit Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior 
Court on behalf of Darren Haylock. 
</P>
<P>
	Haylock attempted to make a call last week from his mother's  
home in South Central Los Angeles to relatives in Belize after a 
family member died. MCI refused to let the call go through even 
after he provided his mother's maiden name and his Social Security 
number for identification, the lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
	The operator confirmed the information but told Haylock that  
South Central, a Los Angeles neighborhood with mostly black and 
Hispanic residents, was considered a ``high fraud'' area and 
blocked the call. Haylock eventually went to his home in the San 
Fernando Valley and was able to make the call, said co-counsel Paul 
Kiesel. 
</P>
<P>
	Haylock had joined MCI after reading about the telecommunication  
company's calling card offer that allows members to call anywhere 
in the United States and to more than 280 international locations. 
He was not told of the ``high fraud'' area policy, Kiesel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit accuses MCI of discrimination, deceptive practices,  
false advertising, unfair competition and unfair trade practices. 
It seeks a court order that would prohibit MCI from such practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also seeks class-action status, though Kiesel was  
unsure how many people may be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know if it happened to Darren Haylock, it happens to a lot  
of people like Darren Haylock as well,'' Kiesel said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for MCI WorldCom, the nation's second-largest  
long-distance phone company, said he had not seen a copy of the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having not yet seen it, I'm declining comment,'' said MCI  
spokesman Les Kumagai.

<HEADLINE> Bush Finds 'Different Intensity' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- After a month in what he calls the  
presidential ``bubble,'' Gov. George W. Bush is surprised by the 
scrutiny -- and this is a guy who's the son of a president and once 
ran a major league baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a hit with 200,000 fans when he waved the flag to start a  
stock car race in Fort Worth, then found a 30-year-old romance 
being discussed in gossip columns. 
</P>
<P>
	He gets 100 requests a day for personal appearances, even as his  
career-long position on abortion is under attack from all sides. 
</P>
<P>
	He raised $6 million in 3 1/2 weeks but was taken to task for being  
too slow to talk about air strikes on Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the biggest political stage there is, almost nothing Bush  
does these days is small or insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot easier to make news,'' Bush laughed when asked  
about changes he's experienced since announcing the formation of a 
presidential exploratory committee March 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, I've begun to recognize that every word now  
matters. People are analyzing every single nuance and every word,'' 
he said. ``I have to adjust my thinking. All of us have to 
recognize that there's a different intensity level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being governor of Texas -- the nation's second-largest state -- is  
a big deal. Being a candidate for president, and one the polls have 
named the front-runner for the Republican nomination, is much 
bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck McDonald, an Austin consultant who was an aide to former  
Gov. Ann Richards, knows about such transitions. 
</P>
<P>
	As state treasurer, Richards delivered a nationally televised  
speech to the 1988 Democratic National Convention. Overnight, her 
folksy wit and telegenic charisma vaulted her to national 
prominence. That ballooned even more when she defeated 
cowboy-oilman Clayton Williams in 1990 to become Texas' first woman 
governor in half a century. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how much you try to prepare for it, what you can't  
prepare for is the fact that nuances and inferences are read into 
every statement, every utterance, every action or inaction,'' 
McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
	A good example is the abortion issue.  
</P>
<P>
	The day after he unveiled his presidential committee, Bush  
described his position on abortion: He opposes it except in cases 
of rape, incest or where the mother's life is threatened. That's 
been his position since he first ran for governor, in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also said he would support a constitutional amendment to  
ban abortions but doesn't believe there's sufficient public support 
for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, a conservative Republican presidential hopeful,  
swiftly called Bush's stance on abortion vague. ``I don't see how a 
`compassionate conservative' can be ambiguous about protecting 
unborn children,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	An abortion rights group quickly launched television ads  
accusing Bush and fellow presidential hopeful Elizabeth Dole of 
camouflaging anti-abortion positions. Kate Michelman, director of 
the National Abortion Rights Action League, said the two were 
trying to ``hide their extreme views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald said such instant controversy is another element of  
being a national political figure. 
</P>
<P>
	``His position, which has been pretty steady in the state of  
Texas for six years now, all of a sudden was analyzed, dissected 
and criticized by voices from all sides. And nothing new had 
happened in any way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That experience was enlightening, Bush says.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised and somewhat bemused,'' Bush said. ``To think  
I make a statement that I've been saying for years and all of a 
sudden it turns into TV ads, months before anybody's paying 
attention to presidential politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the trouble in Kosovo escalated to U.S. and NATO air  
strikes, Bush was called upon for his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	He held a news conference a day after the attacks began, and a  
major Texas newspaper devoted the opening paragraphs of its article 
not to what he said, but to the fact that Bush waited until 24 
hours after other GOP hopefuls had already spoken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly, the fact that you didn't speak out on an issue is  
newsworthy,'' McDonald noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's friends and former business partners are being  
questioned, too. Former college classmates are being quoted in 
newspapers. The records of his old companies are being examined. 
There even were items printed about his engagement -- subsequently 
broken off -- to a Houston woman in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand politics,'' Bush said. ``I understand that there  
is a long road between today and whatever political fate may befall 
me.''

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers Shelve Injured O'Neal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday  
placed backup forward-center Jermaine O'Neal on the injured list 
and signed guard Brian Shaw to a 10-day contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, 33, suited up for Tuesday night's game against the  
Vancouver Grizzlies. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, 20, was found to have a bone spur in his left ankle  
following Saturday night's victory over Phoenix. The third-year 
player wore a walking cast on his left foot before Tuesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal was averaging 2.0 points and 2.7 rebounds in 27 games.  
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, a nine-year NBA veteran, has not played this season and  
has been bothered recently by tendinitis in his left knee. His only 
basketball job was as a volunteer coach at Contra Costa College in 
San Pablo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6 Shaw averaged a career-low 6.3 points for Golden  
State and Philadelphia last season. He was traded along with Joe 
Smith to the 76ers for Clarence Weatherspoon and Jim Jackson, who 
is now with Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw was the 24th pick in the 1988 draft by the Boston Celtics.  
His best year was in 1990-91, when he averaged 13.8 points and 7.6 
assists. He also played for Miami and Orlando, and spent one season 
in the Italian League. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll likely be the Blazers' third-string point guard, behind  
Damon Stoudamire and Greg Anthony. Last month Portland waived point 
guard John Crotty, who was then picked up by Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like they really need me to fix anything,'' Shaw said  
of the Blazers, who have the best record in the NBA. ``Right now, 
the biggest contribution I can make is my experience and knowledge 
of the game. I just want to be ready whenever my turn comes.''

<HEADLINE>  Airlift Begins for Kosovo Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- An airlift flew Kosovo Albanians  
outside the region, ferrying the first of tens of thousands of 
refugees to be evacuated to countries offering temporary shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 exhausted Kosovo refugees, many wearing  
mud-covered shoes, stumbled off planes in Turkey and Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the refugees, who flew from Macedonia late Monday,  
carried few belongings -- a piece of luggage or possessions thrown 
in plastic sacks. Some small children slept in the arms of their 
parents as they got off the aircraft in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has stressed that while the goal is for the refugees to  
return to their homes in Kosovo, the alliance wants to take 
pressure off neighboring states by providing temporary homes 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's government today offered temporary asylum to as many  
as 4,000 refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO accuses Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of  
deliberately trying to destabilize surrounding countries with a 
flood of refugees from Kosovo, where Yugoslav troops are accused of 
a systematic campaign of forced expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardest hit have been the already impoverished Albania, which  
has been flooded with 239,000 refugees, and Macedonia, where 
arrivals number about 120,000, with tens of thousands more waiting 
to cross. Macedonia has said no more than 20,000 can stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing that Kosovo Albanians may be dispersed far from their  
homeland, the Albanian government Monday protested plans to settle 
many of them in Western countries and agreed to accept more 
refugees who had sought shelter in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanian officials worry that refugees who leave the area might  
not return when the conflict is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Albania doesn't want to be part of the ethnic cleansing  
mechanism, which is forcing ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo,'' 
Information Minister Musa Ulqini said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO nations have offered to temporarily take in tens of  
thousands of the refugees, and after a series of delays, the 
airlift got under way Monday with the departure of the refugees to 
Turkey and Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the refugees, an old woman, died shortly after arriving  
in Turkey, the Anatolia news agency reported. It did not give her 
age. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey is promising to accept 20,000 more people fleeing the  
Yugoslav province. 
</P>
<P>
	A plane with 91 refugees landed before dawn today in Norway,  
Norwegian news agency NTB reported. They were the first of the 
6,000 refugees the country has agreed to take in. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing utter chaos if the refugees were allowed to flow in  
freely, Macedonian officials mobilized army troops and police 
patrolled the border to prevent refugees from sneaking in 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Macedonia cannot deal with the refugee problem without  
international assistance. We need help,'' said Deputy Prime 
Minister Radmilla Kiprjanova. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions remained dire at a makeshift camp at Blace, on the  
border with Kosovo. Tens of thousands are living in shelters of 
plastic and blankets in a muddy, fetid border area while they wait 
to enter Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands have been bused out of the camp in recent days, but  
their numbers swelled again after a train delivered several 
thousand more refugees to the border late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are too many people in that small concentrated area for  
safety and also for sanitation and health concerns,'' said Chris 
Thomas of the American Red Cross. ``We are getting enough food into 
them, but people have been there for four or five days, they want 
to leave immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Stankovac, a suburb of the Macedonian capital, Skopje,  
refugees were put up in military tents and received food and 
medical treatment from a team of Greek doctors. British and French 
troops worked feverishly to set up what could become a tent city of 
100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid was beginning to arrive, including dozens of flights from  
NATO countries and others bringing clothing, food, tents and 
medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan will ship tents to shelter 10,000 refugees, the government  
said today. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said the 1,000 
tents, each for 10 people, would be sent to Albania and Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as they coped with immediate problems, U.N. refugee  
authorities looked to the next crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	UNHCR spokeswoman Paula Ghedini said Yugoslav authorities were  
now sending trainloads of refugees to the border crossing at 
Jazince, southwest of the capital, creating the likelihood of 
another bottleneck like the one at Blace. 
</P>
<P>
	She said refugees at Jazince told of lines of up to 15 miles of  
people waiting to get in. ``What the arrivals indicate is that 
there may be 50,000 coming in coming days,'' Ghedini said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the unsanitary conditions, no large-scale outbreaks of  
disease have been reported among the refugees. But Ghedini said 
people were vulnerable to illness because of exhaustion, 
dehydration, lack of adequate shelter and the combination of cold 
nights and hot days. 
</P>
<P>
	The dozen refugees who have died at the Blace camp have been  
mainly infants or elderly, aid officials said.

<HEADLINE>  Airlift Begins for Kosovo Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- An airlift flew Kosovo Albanians  
outside the region, ferrying the first of tens of thousands of 
refugees to be evacuated to countries offering temporary shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 exhausted Kosovo refugees, many wearing  
mud-covered shoes, stumbled off planes in Turkey and Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the refugees, who flew from Macedonia late Monday,  
carried few belongings -- a piece of luggage or possessions thrown 
in plastic sacks. Some small children slept in the arms of their 
parents as they got off the aircraft in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has stressed that while the goal is for the refugees to  
return to their homes in Kosovo, the alliance wants to take 
pressure off neighboring states by providing temporary homes 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's government today offered temporary asylum to as many  
as 4,000 refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO accuses Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of  
deliberately trying to destabilize surrounding countries with a 
flood of refugees from Kosovo, where Yugoslav troops are accused of 
a systematic campaign of forced expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardest hit have been the already impoverished Albania, which  
has been flooded with 239,000 refugees, and Macedonia, where 
arrivals number about 120,000, with tens of thousands more waiting 
to cross. Macedonia has said no more than 20,000 can stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing that Kosovo Albanians may be dispersed far from their  
homeland, the Albanian government Monday protested plans to settle 
many of them in Western countries and agreed to accept more 
refugees who had sought shelter in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanian officials worry that refugees who leave the area might  
not return when the conflict is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Albania doesn't want to be part of the ethnic cleansing  
mechanism, which is forcing ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo,'' 
Information Minister Musa Ulqini said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO nations have offered to temporarily take in tens of  
thousands of the refugees, and after a series of delays, the 
airlift got under way Monday with the departure of the refugees to 
Turkey and Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the refugees, an old woman, died shortly after arriving  
in Turkey, the Anatolia news agency reported. It did not give her 
age. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey is promising to accept 20,000 more people fleeing the  
Yugoslav province. 
</P>
<P>
	A plane with 91 refugees landed before dawn today in Norway,  
Norwegian news agency NTB reported. They were the first of the 
6,000 refugees the country has agreed to take in. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing utter chaos if the refugees were allowed to flow in  
freely, Macedonian officials mobilized army troops and police 
patrolled the border to prevent refugees from sneaking in 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Macedonia cannot deal with the refugee problem without  
international assistance. We need help,'' said Deputy Prime 
Minister Radmilla Kiprjanova. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions remained dire at a makeshift camp at Blace, on the  
border with Kosovo. Tens of thousands are living in shelters of 
plastic and blankets in a muddy, fetid border area while they wait 
to enter Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands have been bused out of the camp in recent days, but  
their numbers swelled again after a train delivered several 
thousand more refugees to the border late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are too many people in that small concentrated area for  
safety and also for sanitation and health concerns,'' said Chris 
Thomas of the American Red Cross. ``We are getting enough food into 
them, but people have been there for four or five days, they want 
to leave immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Stankovac, a suburb of the Macedonian capital, Skopje,  
refugees were put up in military tents and received food and 
medical treatment from a team of Greek doctors. British and French 
troops worked feverishly to set up what could become a tent city of 
100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid was beginning to arrive, including dozens of flights from  
NATO countries and others bringing clothing, food, tents and 
medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan will ship tents to shelter 10,000 refugees, the government  
said today. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said the 1,000 
tents, each for 10 people, would be sent to Albania and Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as they coped with immediate problems, U.N. refugee  
authorities looked to the next crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	UNHCR spokeswoman Paula Ghedini said Yugoslav authorities were  
now sending trainloads of refugees to the border crossing at 
Jazince, southwest of the capital, creating the likelihood of 
another bottleneck like the one at Blace. 
</P>
<P>
	She said refugees at Jazince told of lines of up to 15 miles of  
people waiting to get in. ``What the arrivals indicate is that 
there may be 50,000 coming in coming days,'' Ghedini said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the unsanitary conditions, no large-scale outbreaks of  
disease have been reported among the refugees. But Ghedini said 
people were vulnerable to illness because of exhaustion, 
dehydration, lack of adequate shelter and the combination of cold 
nights and hot days. 
</P>
<P>
	The dozen refugees who have died at the Blace camp have been  
mainly infants or elderly, aid officials said.

</P>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- John Bibb, retired sports editor for The  
Tennessean, who once was nominated for Pulitzer Prize and covered 
36 straight Masters golf tournaments, died Sunday of cancer. He was 
72. 
</P>
<P>
	Bibb, a member of the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame and a  
two-time president of the Golf Writers Association of America, 
worked for The Tennessean from 1942 until his retirement in 1993. 
He was sports editor for the last 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bibb covered numerous U.S. Opens and PGA Championships, the  
British Open and Ryder Cup matches. He covered his first Masters in 
1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Bibb later crossed over into radio. He was a sports commentator  
on WSM's ``Waking Crew'' program and later joined the 
``Roundtable'' program, where he offered views on politics and 
other topics. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife of nearly 50 years, Betty Jean; a son  
and a granddaughter.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gary Blonston, chief of the Knight Ridder  
Washington bureau, whose journalism career spanned more than three 
decades, died Sunday of cancer. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Blonston served as reporter, editor and writing coach in his  
nearly 36 years in the field. He worked at The Miami Herald, the 
Detroit Free Press and the San Jose Mercury News before coming to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Blonston was a principal writer on two Pulitzer Prize-winning  
projects. One was during his time at the Free Press, where he came 
under gunfire while covering Detroit's 1967 riots. Blonston also 
worked on the Mercury News' reporting of the 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, Blonston found himself in the middle of rioting  
protesters and police officers outside the Democratic National 
Convention. Coughing from tear gas, he dictated his story to an 
editor on deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Blonston also freelanced for newspapers and magazines, on topics  
ranging from politics to prehistoric art. During a 1967 strike at 
the Free Press -- when Blonston was working at Chrysler Corp. -- he 
wrote a book on the history of the Plymouth. In 1996, he published 
``William Morris,'' a book about a famed glass blower. 
</P>
<P>
	Blonston began his newspaper career with The Miami Herald in  
1964, moving to the Free Press two years later. He moved to San 
Jose in 1987, then to Knight Ridder's Washington bureau. He became 
bureau chief in August 1995, supervising a staff of 60 reporters 
and editors. 
</P>
<P>
	Blonston is survived by his wife, Susan Goldberg, a deputy  
managing editor at USA Today; two children from a previous 
marriage; and a sister.

</P>
<P>
	PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Corwin Dwight Denney, an aerospace  
engineer who initially flight-tested his own products, died April 1 
of pneumonia, following a battle with cancer. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Denney began manufacturing aerospace components and flight-test  
equipment in 1947 when he founded American Helicopter Co. He was 
the company's lone test pilot until he was joined by several World 
War II veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, renamed Mid-Continent Manufacturing, was soon  
commissioned by the federal government to create complex aircraft 
structures and nondestructive test materials. That money enabled 
Denney to merge with tiny Pasadena-based Automation Instruments in 
1952 to form Automation Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	He orchestrated a score of mergers during his three decades as  
president, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of 
Automation Industries, which he sold to General Cable in 1978 for 
$106 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1962, he branched off into oil drilling, forming the  
independent San Antonio-based Venus Oil Co. He later invested in 
the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, helping to restore it 
to profitability before selling his share in 1985 for $33 million.

Summit Banks in the Twin Cities and the Tropicana Hotel and Casino, 
a Las Vegas complex with a history of ties to organized crime, died 
Friday. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not available.  
</P>
<P>
	The former businessman and real estate magnate spent 40 months  
in federal prison in the mid-1980s after being convicted of 
participating in a financial scam involving the Tropicana and his 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Gustafson sold the Tropicana in 1979, but was under  
investigation as recently as the mid-1990s for allegedly trying to 
hide millions of dollars in proceeds from the sale of the casino. 
He pleaded guilty to bankruptcy fraud in 1995.

<P>
	Roux was close to a number of French politicians, most notably  
Pompidou, whom he advised during a time of enormous growth in 
France's industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Roux worked for a series of government ministries during the  
1950s and then moved to private business, where he fought for lower 
corporate taxes and greater independence for France's corporate 
sector.

</P>
<P>
	Wynn pitched from 1939 to 1963, winning 20 games or more for the  
Cleveland Indians four times and once for the Chicago White Sox in 
the 1950s.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucille Lortel, who earned the title ``Queen of  
off-Broadway'' for bringing innovative new actors, playwrights and 
productions to the American stage, died Sunday. She was 98. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lortel, whose career in theater spanned more than 70 years,  
produced or co-produced about 500 plays, five of which were 
nominated for Tony Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lortel, born Louise Wadler, began her own acting career in  
the 1920s and made her Broadway debut in 1925 with a small role in 
George Bernard Shaw's ``Caesar and Cleopatra,'' starring Helen 
Hayes and Lionel Atwill. 
</P>
<P>
	She quit performing in 1939 to please her husband, Louis  
Schweitzer, a chemical engineer who made a fortune manufacturing 
cigarette papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of boredom, she began staging readings in a barn at their  
estate in Westport, Conn. In 1947, she was asked by the actor 
Canada Lee and playwright Philip Huston to help find a place and 
audience for a staged reading of a new play, ``The Painted Wagon,'' 
and the still-thriving White Barn Theater was born. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, her husband gave her the Theatre de Lys -- now called  
the Lucille Lortel Theater -- in Greenwich Village as a 24th 
anniversary gift. Its first production was a hugely popular 
adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's and Kurt Weill's ``Threepenny 
Opera'' that made off-Broadway famous. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lortel's eye for and confidence in young talent boosted the  
careers of countless actors, composers, designers, directors and 
playwrights in international theater. She established numerous 
funds and fellowships to further the arts.

<HEADLINE> 'Tombstone' Fund Takes Grave Turn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The next time you are tempted to invest in a  
mutual fund with a clever-sounding gimmick, visualize a tombstone. 
</P>
<P>
	That scary association may serve in a general way to remind you  
of the perils inherent in any fund that sacrifices diversification 
for a portfolio organized around a single theme. More specifically, 
it may call to mind a real-life fund that was far and away the 
worst-performing stock fund in the first quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In the January-March period, the Houston-based Pauze Tombstone  
Fund, which describes itself as ``the first-of-its kind death care 
industry mutual fund,'' posted a negative return of 50.65 percent, 
according to the research firm of Lipper Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Its loss outstripped by more than 20 percentage points the next  
worst performer, the ProFunds Ultra Short OTC Fund, whose specialty 
of betting against the market suffered as market indicators were 
reaching new highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past 12 months, the Tombstone Fund dropped 54.30  
percent, according to Lipper, to rank as the third-worst performer 
in the fund universe -- behind the Lexington Troika Russia Fund, 
which felt the full weight of the economic collapse in Russia, and 
the maverick American Heritage Fund, which has been amassing a 
horrendous record for years now. American Heritage's five-year 
return, according to Lipper, is minus 72.28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The premise behind the Pauze Tombstone Fund may strike you as a  
decent-sounding idea. Launched in May 1997 by Pauze Swanson Capital 
Management Co. in Houston, the fund is built around the firm's 
index of stocks in the businesses of funeral services, cemetery 
services and funeral and cemetery support goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm's promotional materials made a persuasive-sounding  
case: ``Death-care stocks'' had posted years of strong performance 
since the '80s; industry consolidation, still in its early stages, 
held out the promise of a continuing brisk pace of mergers and 
takeovers; foreign growth prospects seemed bright, and the U.S. 
population continued to age. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the heading of ``Compelling Demographic Factors,'' the  
fund's literature cited projections that the number of deaths in 
this country would rise from 2.2 million in 1990 to 4.1 million by 
2040. 
</P>
<P>
	So what has gone wrong lately? Well, shares of the biggest  
funeral services company, Service Corp. International, have tumbled 
in response to an unexpected earnings decline, and other companies 
in this relatively small field have sounded echoes of the same kind 
of problems. From a 12-month high of about $47, SCI shares recently 
hovered just above $13, and the company's president has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, deaths are not occurring at quite the expected rate.  
And when people do die, survivors seem to have become more choosy 
and price-conscious than they used to be about death services. 
</P>
<P>
	All this may prove to be just a temporary spell of trouble in  
the business. Quite a few analysts argue that Wall Street has 
overreacted to the recent negative news, and it's entirely possible 
that death-service stocks are bargain-priced now. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, it's not as though legions of investors suffered  
from the Tombstone Fund's woes. According to Lipper, the fund's 
total assets at last word were only about $500,000. That's tiny by 
any standard, in a world where stock fund assets in the aggregate 
exceed $3 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	But none of those points overshadows the big problem with a fund  
like Pauze Tombstone. It is just one of a growing breed of niche 
funds organized in recent years, focusing on fields ranging from 
golf and auto racing to the Internet and other technology 
specialties. 
</P>
<P>
	These funds naturally appeal to people who like investments that  
come with a story. But unlike most general purpose stock funds, 
they lack the cushion of diversification. If the script around 
which they are organized takes an unexpected plot twist of any 
kind, as happened to Pauze Tombstone, they can find themselves with 
no place to hide.

<HEADLINE> Dollars Sold Off in Money Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Traders sold off the dollar and bought major  
European currencies Tuesday as Yugoslavia announced a unilateral 
cease-fire in its battle against Kosovo rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also fell against the yen, dragged along as traders  
bought the currencies of important economies near Yugoslavia. The 
British pound was at 18-month lows against the dollar until the 
announcement helped it recoup most of its loss. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0848, up  
from $1.0708 late Monday. The dollar also was quoted at 120.62 
Japanese yen, down from 121.83 yen. The British pound was quoted at 
$1.5911, down from $1.6000 late Monday but higher than its low 
Tuesday of $1.5851. 
</P>
<P>
	The cease-fire was announced hours after the most intensive  
night of NATO air raids across Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav government 
called the cease-fire a ``gesture of goodwill'' in advance of 
Sunday's Orthodox Easter. However, the action was rejected as a 
sham by Western leaders and the bombings were to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, considered a safe-haven currency during times of  
turmoil, had been rising against the euro since the bombings began 
on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a pretty quiet day until we got those reports from  
Yugoslavia announcing the cease-fire,'' said Henry Willmore, a 
senior economist at Barclays Capital. ``It's definitely an 
indication that the foreign exchange market has taken the euro down 
on concerns about conflicts in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willmore said the euro also rose because of a late afternoon  
news report that France's central banker, who also sits on the 
European Central Bank's board, was warning against a weaker euro. 
The new currency, representing 11 countries tethered by the 
European Central Bank, has mostly fallen since its January launch. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's policy-making committee meets this week and  
the French warning could make it reluctant to lower interest rates 
to spur the lagging European economies. Typically, lower interest 
rates make returns on a country's or a region's currency and assets 
less appealing to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4729 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4895, and 1.5016 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5020. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8031 
German marks, down from 1.8265; 6.0459 French francs, down from 
6.1275; and 1,785.71 Italian lire, down from 1,808.32.

<HEADLINE> Kazak Currency Plummets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) -- The Kazak currency nosedived Monday in  
the wake of the government's decision to allow it to trade freely, 
and residents of the former Soviet republic rushed to buy foreign 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The tenge, which had long held steady at about 88 to the dollar,  
fell to 100 on the state-controlled currency market Monday. The 
government and the central bank decided Sunday to stop supporting 
the currency because it was depleting the Central Asian nation's 
foreign currency reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency exchange offices quickly closed their doors Monday  
after a wave of panic dollar buying, and the black market rate 
plunged to 200 tenge to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people rushed to the banks, trying to withdraw their tenge  
deposits and convert them to hard currency. There were long lines 
at many bank offices, but all of them were giving cash without 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The government tried to quell the panic by promising to convert  
all bank savings into hard currency if depositors agree to freeze 
their accounts for nine months. The state-controlled media have run 
reports about black market dealers trading in fake dollar bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail prices on most staples remained virtually unchanged, but  
many vendors suspended wholesale operations, waiting for the 
currency to stabilize. 
</P>
<P>
	The government hopes the tenge will recover quickly thanks to a  
new rule obliging exporters to sell 50 percent of their hard 
currency earnings on the currency market. 
</P>
<P>
	Exporters hailed the government's decision to stop supporting  
the currency, saying the artificially high tenge rate was hurting 
their business. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazakstan's economy has suffered since the global financial  
crisis hit Russia, its northern neighbor and largest trade partner, 
last August. About 40 percent of Kazakstan's trade is with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 7 million of Kazakstan's 16 million people live in  
poverty, and unemployment is widespread. Increasing numbers of 
businesses are going bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazakstan is heavily dependent on the sale of oil for much of  
its state revenue. With world oil prices low, the government has 
already had to revise budget projections for 1999.

<HEADLINE> Russian Inflation Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian inflation was down to 2.8 percent last  
month, the lowest level since a financial crisis hit last August, 
but other indicators released today painted a gloomy economic 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is looking to the International Monetary Fund to help  
revive its economy, and an IMF team was to arrive today to assess 
the country's suitability for a new loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides have agreed in principle on a loan, but the amount  
is unclear. Russian officials have said they are hoping for $8 
billion, but the IMF has refrained from giving any figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Statistics Committee said the 2.8 percent inflation  
last month was the best performance since prices began jumping in 
the wake of an economic upheaval eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has not printed large sums of money to pay its  
debts, as some economists feared, and this has helped limit 
inflation in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, prices have gone up 16 percent in the first three months  
of this year after soaring 84 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also is having difficulties collecting taxes for  
the budget, a chronic problem that has left the state unable to pay 
salaries, pensions and other debts on time. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's budget revenues were $1.3 billion in March,  
while expenditures were $1.5 billion, the Ministry of Finance said. 
Both numbers were well below the target figures and were extremely 
small for a country of Russia's size. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Russian currency hit a new low of 25.11 rubles to  
the U.S. dollar, managing a tiny improvement today to 25.10, as set 
by the Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruble has resumed its slide in recent weeks, and the  
government has been running low on the hard currency reserves it 
traditionally uses to defend the Russian currency. 
</P>
<P>
	With its hard currency supply dwindling, Russia has acknowledged  
it won't be able to pay back more than half of the $17.5 billion in 
foreign loans that fall due this year.

<HEADLINE> QB George Adjusting to New Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Jeff George isn't just taking a $4.6  
million pay cut to join the Minnesota Vikings. He's adjusting to a 
role he said he's never had in football: second string. 
</P>
<P>
	George signed a one-year, $400,000 contract with the Vikings on  
Tuesday. He became available when the Oakland Raiders opted out of 
his contract and signed Rich Gannon as their starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	As George discussed the Vikings and his prospects for the coming  
season on Tuesday, he downplayed the pay cut and reduced role. He 
will have no problem being No. 2 behind Randall Cunningham, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The future is bright whether I'm here or not,'' he said.  
``Whatever I'm asked to do is what I'm going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George said he is anxious to line up behind the Vikings'  
offensive line and throw to Randy Moss, Cris Carter and Jake Reed. 
Moss and Carter made the Pro Bowl last year, along with guard 
Randall McDaniel, tackle Todd Steussie and center Jeff Christy. 
</P>
<P>
	George, who threw for 3,917 yards and 29 touchdowns as recently  
as two years ago before an injury sidelined him in the season's 
fifth week last year, said he jumped at the chance to join the 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money never played a part in it. I would've played for free  
here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	George said he was excited about playing for offensive  
coordinator Ray Sherman, who was an assistant at Purdue, where 
George started his college career before transferring to Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings brought in the nine-year veteran, who was the first  
overall pick in the 1990 draft by the Indianapolis Colts, 
overlooking his reputation of being difficult to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Falcons released George in 1996 after he got in a  
nationally televised shouting match with coach June Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	George said he's still the same person who argued with Jones,  
but more mature. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to come in here and cause trouble,'' George  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Jones, who now coaches at Hawaii, has only positive things  
to say about George. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff is, I think, probably a very misunderstood guy,'' Jones  
told the Star Tribune. ``I didn't have any problems with him other 
than that situation, and that problem was a contract problem. I 
don't think it was anything else that started that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George said he doesn't expect to have difficulty adjusting to  
his new teammates. Most of the Vikings are scattered throughout the 
country and won't meet their new quarterback until mini-camp begins 
April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	George has never taken a team past the first round of the  
playoffs. His best postseason performance came in 1995, when he 
threw for 366 yards and two touchdowns in the Falcons' 37-20 loss 
to the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. But he thinks the 
Vikings have the best chance to turn his reputation from that of a 
talented veteran known for disagreeing with his coaches into a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't win a championship, you're a nobody,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the one-year deal, George said he plans a long stay in  
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be a Viking for the rest of my career,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rockies Put Walker on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Reigning NL batting champion Larry Walker was  
placed on the 15-day disabled list today by the Colorado Rockies, a 
week after he strained a rib cage muscle hitting a batting practice 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was retroactive to March 29, and Walker said he hopes  
to be back by next Tuesday, meaning he'll miss the first eight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to do it and still don't want to, but it's  
probably the smartest thing to do,'' Walker said before Tuesday's 
game against the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker was hurt one week earlier prior to an exhibition game. He  
worked out in San Diego on Monday, which was an off day after 
Sunday night's game against San Diego in Monterrey, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't right,'' Walker said Tuesday. ``It's a little more  
tender today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker sat out Sunday night's game, missing his first opening  
day start since 1989, when he began the year in Triple-A. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker won the NL batting title last year with a .363 average,  
an encore to winning the league MVP award in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies purchased the contract of outfielder Mike Kelly from  
Triple-A Colorado Springs. Kelly was signed as a free agent last 
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Susan McDougal Trial Winding Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In her month-long trial, Susan McDougal  
got what she wanted: a judge, a jury and her lawyer in the room 
while she answered questions in Kenneth Starr's Whitewater 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	They were questions that she refused to answer in 1996 and again  
last year when Starr, the independent counsel, hauled her before 
grand juries to no avail. Instead she spent 18 months in jail for 
civil contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after closing arguments on Wednesday, jurors will consider  
Mrs. McDougal's defense that she feared being charged with perjury 
unless she gave Starr a story that she says he wanted to hear -- 
that the Clintons engaged in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, who with her late husband was a partner with Bill  
and Hillary Clinton in the Whitewater land deal, is charged with 
criminal contempt and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final round of testimony Monday, Starr's office tried to  
show that it did everything possible to address her fears about 
giving grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Jahn, a former Starr prosecutor, said Mrs. McDougal was told  
in 1996 that if there came a point where there was a question about 
whether she'd committed perjury, the matter would be turned over to 
an independent prosecutor -- and not pursued by the Starr team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jahn denied prosecutors ever promised her relief from other  
legal problems if she cooperated or told her ex-husband -- as she 
claimed -- that she could ``write her own ticket'' if she said she 
had a sexual affair with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Jahn acknowledged, however, that a state prosecutor in  
California had indicated an embezzlement case against Mrs. McDougal 
might be settled by plea bargain. She still refused to cooperate 
with Starr and Mrs. McDougal later was acquitted on the 
embezzlement charge. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, Mrs. McDougal's defense got a boost when Judge  
George Howard Jr., allowed, despite strong protests from 
prosecutors, testimony from a Virginia woman who also claimed she 
had been mistreated by Starr prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Susan and I have been relentlessly pursued by the Office of  
Independent Counsel,'' testified Julie Hiatt Steele, who claimed 
she had been indicted because she refused to give false testimony 
against Clinton. Steele faces a trial next month on an indictment 
obtained by Starr's staff that she obstructed justice and lied to a 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal used her trial to dramatically press her attack on  
Starr whom she accused of waging a ``personal vendetta'' against 
her. ``It will be an all-out fight,'' she predicted as the trial 
opened March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	When she took the stand two weeks into the trial, McDougal said  
she never discussed a fraudulent $300,000 loan with Bill Clinton -- 
that has been the center of the Whitewater investigation -- and that 
she did not believe Clinton had said ``anything untruthful'' when 
he testified at her 1996 trial involving the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing he said was untrue to me,'' said McDougal from the  
stand, for the first time addressing questions she for 2 1/2 years had 
refused to address for Starr's prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal contempt and obstruction case centers on Mrs.  
McDougal's state of mind when she refused to cooperate with Starr, 
her defense lawyers argued, because she believed her own words 
would be used against her by Starr's prosecutors even if she told 
the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	A career federal prosecutor, Jahn insisted Monday that the Starr  
prosecutors only wanted Mrs. McDougal to tell the ``total and 
complete truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what Mrs. McDougal claims, added Associate Independent  
Counsel Mark Barrett, the government has only to show that she 
disobeyed a court order to answer the grand jury questions.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Sale To Be Decided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After months of juggling finances and weeks of  
intense lobbying, Howard Milstein was to find out today whether he 
would achieve his goal of owning the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Or whether he would become the first prospective buyer rejected  
by NFL owners in a bid for an established franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	While it's been notoriously difficult to project the votes of  
the 31 owners on anything from instant replay to expansion, it 
appeared Tuesday night that Milstein and bid partner Daniel Snyder 
did not have the support of the 24 owners needed to purchase the 
Redskins for a record $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's special meeting was arranged after Milstein requested a  
postponement during last month's sessions in Phoenix. In Arizona, 
it become apparent he did not have enough votes and would need to 
spend more time lobbying individual owners. 
</P>
<P>
	One league source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The  
Associated Press that Milstein had no more than seven to 10 votes 
in Phoenix and is still ``far short'' of the three-fourths 
required. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote could hinge on a recommendation from commissioner Paul  
Tagliabue and the league's financial committee, which will meet 
before the vote. The eight-member committee was split 3-3 with two 
abstentions in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee chairman Bob Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots,  
has been one of the bid's few solid supporters. But committee 
members Tom Benson of New Orleans and Pat Bowlen of Denver are 
adamantly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some owners, such as Baltimore's Art Modell, expressed concern  
that the Redskins would be left in limbo if the bid is rejected. It 
could take several months to come up with a new prospective buyer 
if the league asks for another round of bidding, and possibly 
several years to resolve a court battle if Milstein sues. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the objections by some owners:  
</P>
<P>
	--While Milstein is worth an estimated $500 million, most of it  
is tied up in real estate, making his part of the bid heavily 
leveraged without the ready cash to back it up. His father recently 
agreed to supply $125 million to support the bid, but some league 
officials reportedly consider that money a loan that helps the 
financing arrangement only marginally. 
</P>
<P>
	--Milstein's part-ownership of the NHL's Islanders, which he  
bought with a partner just 14 months ago, has been ugly and 
litigious. Milstein wanted a new arena and threatened to cancel 
games because he felt the old one was unsafe. There are lawsuits 
pending between Milstein and New York's Nassau County. 
</P>
<P>
	--Milstein, according to several sources, solicited politicians  
in the nation's capital to lobby owners on his behalf. Sources say 
several owners considered it a high-handed impropriety when they 
received calls from congressmen from other parts of the country 
asking about the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	--Several owners have expressed a preference for Cooke's son,  
team president John Kent Cooke, to own the team. John Kent Cooke 
was outbid by Milstein and Snyder in an auction conducted by the 
trustees of his father's estate -- in accordance with his father's 
will after his death on April 6, 1997 -- but sources say some owners 
are eager to make the point they alone can choose who joins their 
exclusive club. 
</P>
<P>
	If Milstein is rejected and the trustees reopen the bidding, the  
favorite to win the second round would be Snyder. The 
Washington-area communications executive has the money in the bank 
and has come through the NFL process unscathed. Snyder could team 
with a losing bidder from the first round, such as Phoenix 
developer Sam Grossman, to mount a formidable bid. 
</P>
<P>
	But all that becomes moot if a defeated Milstein goes to court  
and ties up the process, although Milstein told the owners in 
Phoenix he would not sue. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the sale is approved, John Kent Cooke will continue to  
run the team, retaining coach Norv Turner and general manager 
Charley Casserly. 
</P>
<P>
	Several free agents said they were wary of signing with the  
Redskins because of the uncertainty, and the players under contract 
want the matter resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things that has gone on too long,'' center  
Cory Raymer said Tuesday. ``And it's become a pain in the butt.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Estrogen May Improve Memory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Post-menopausal women undergoing estrogen  
treatment may get the added bonus of an improved memory, say 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The study at the Yale University School of Medicine of 46  
post-menopausal women found that estrogen increased activity in 
regions of the brain associated with memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the study did not find memories had improved,  
researchers said that estrogen may stimulate the brain to make the 
type of neural connections typically seen in younger people. 
</P>
<P>
	They believe that the increased brain activity should mean an  
accompanying improvement in memory function. 
</P>
<P>
	``It suggests that the neural circuitry in memory for mature  
individuals ... can be changed'' by estrogen, said Dr. Sally E. 
Shaywitz, one of the study's authors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very hopeful sign,'' said Shaywitz, whose study was  
being published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Production of estrogen, the female hormone, drops sharply after  
women reach menopause. Previous research has found that estrogen 
protects against heart disease, fights brittle bones, decreases the 
risk of colon cancer and may even help women live longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies have also suggested that estrogen may reduce the risk of  
Alzheimer's disease. The ability to establish new connections in 
the brain is what is lost with the onset of Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the study said the research was  
significant as another demonstration that estrogens have positive 
effects on certain aspects of mental function. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this study suggests is that what estrogen can do is  
rewire the central nervous system,'' said Dr. Stanley Birge, a 
professor of geriatrics and gerontology at the Washington 
University School of Medicine in St. Louis. ``Perhaps even in the 
70- or 80-year-old individual we have the potential'' for such 
regeneration. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrogen replacement therapy, however, also carries risks.  
Studies show it can increase the risk of breast cancer and 
endometrial cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaywitz said estrogen ``is not some magic pill,'' and further  
study is needed on its benefits and potential side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging to  
measure brain activity as the women conducted tasks involving 
verbal and visual memory. The women -- who ranged in age from 33 to 
61 -- were treated with either estrogen or a placebo in a random 
trial from 1996 through 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers cautioned that while they observed increased brain  
activity in women given estrogen, there was no subsequent 
improvement in verbal and nonverbal memory tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaywitz said the lack of quantifiable evidence pointing to  
improved memory function was probably because the tasks were simple 
and almost all were performed correctly. If a study participant was 
asked something she did not know, the MRI would measure her effort 
rather than her memory function, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one step ... but this a good step in that it does show  
a physiological change in areas of the brain related to memory,'' 
said Dr. Rodrigo Kuljis, a neurologist at the University of Miami 
School of Medicine and the Veteran's Medical Center in Miami who 
was not involved in the study.

<HEADLINE> Racing Dad, Daughter in Wheelchairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Race car driver Al Unser Jr. knows the  
wheelchair he's in is temporary. He's hoping that will be the case 
for his 12-year-old daughter, Cody. 
</P>
<P>
	While Unser recovers from injuries suffered in a race in Florida  
last month, his daughter is battling transverse-myelitis, a 
disorder that has left her paralyzed from the chest down. The 
problem occurs when nerve impulse transmission up and down the 
spinal cord is blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	Dad and daughter are both using wheelchairs these days to get  
around the Unser household and also getting in some quality time 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's teaching me wheelies,'' Cody said. ``I'm teaching him how  
to get around in the house better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cody, a sixth-grader, was stricken while playing basketball in  
February. She spent more than three weeks at the Barrow 
Neurological Institute in Phoenix before returning home. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser fractured both bones in his right ankle and sprained his  
left knee in the accident March 21 at Homestead, Fla., in the first 
race of the season. He expects to be back in a race car by the end 
of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook for his daughter, who is undergoing treatment at  
Carrie Tingley Hospital in Albuquerque, is more uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's looking really healthy,'' Unser said. ``She's really  
upbeat about everything and that's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball remains a passion for Cody and the family has set up  
a miniature goal in the driveway of their Albuquerque home. Cody, 
her dad and 16-year-old brother, Albert, have been playing 
wheelchair basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the same,'' Cody said. ``What I miss the most is  
playing basketball with my sixth-grade friends.''

<HEADLINE> Della Reese Helps CBS Win the Week / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The next time actress Della Reese seeks a raise  
from CBS, she may want to keep a copy of last week's Nielsen Media 
Research ratings for ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Secret Path,'' a CBS Sunday night movie that starred Reese  
and Ossie Davis, was the second most-watched show of the week, 
Nielsen said Tuesday. Tied for third place was ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' also starring Reese. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, involved in a tight race with NBC for season dominance, had  
a 9.0 rating and 16 share to win the week. NBC was second with an 
8.4 rating and 15 share, though it led among 18- to 49-year-olds, 
the audience advertisers covet. ABC had a 7.1 rating and 12 share 
and Fox had a 5.5 rating and 9 share. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's NCAA basketball championship game between Connecticut  
and Duke was the week's most-watched program. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a lackluster week, ABC was pleased that its two newest  
comedies, ``The Norm Show'' and ``It's Like, You Know,'' managed 
the unusual feat of getting higher ratings during their second 
showings than on their premieres a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox's new comedy, ``Futurama,'' also did well, though it dropped  
off from its premiere. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's first major television interview since his  
impeachment trial, with Dan Rather on ``60 Minutes II,'' had an 
average audience of 12 million people. That was approximately one 
quarter the audience for Monica Lewinsky's interview with Barbara 
Walters nearly a month earlier. However, CBS had less than 24 hours 
notice that Clinton would give the interview, so there was little 
time to promote it, and most of the talk was about matters other 
than the sex scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.7 rating and 5  
share, UPN had a 1.9 rating and 3 share and Pax TV had a 0.8 rating 
and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' eked out a victory in the evening news  
race with an 8.1 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' 
had an 8.0 rating and 17 share and the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 
6.8 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of March 29-April 4, the top 10 shows, their  
networks and ratings were the ``NCAA Basketball Championship:

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures prices were mixed early today on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and soybean futures 
advanced. 
</P>

	Corn and soybean futures edged higher but market participants  
said prices remained under pressure from expectations for 
beneficial planting weather in the Midwest and active harvesting of 
competing South American crops. 
</P>

wheat crop conditions report. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1/2 cent to $2.89 1/4 a bushel; May corn  
rose 3/4 cent to $2.19 1/2 a bushel; May oats rose 1/2 cent to $1.11 1/2 a 
bushel; May soybeans rose 3/4 cent to $4.82 3/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 43.84 at 9,963.49 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Gillette Corp. provided the latest sobering  
influence for a giddy stock market Tuesday, sending prices lower 
with a warning that it will fall short of analysts' expectations 
for first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette's announcement deflated the rally that sent the Dow  
Jones industrial average to a new record Monday. The Dow fell 43.84 
points Tuesday to close at 9,963.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators were mostly lower, although the Dow  
sustained the sharpest losses. Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst 
at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, said Gillette's bad news illustrated 
the recent split between the fortunes of the blue-chip companies 
and the Internet upstarts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a two-tiered market,'' he said. ``It has been for  
quite some time, and as long as the Gillettes, the Cokes, keep 
coming out with warnings, it will remain so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the blue chips propelled the Dow past 10,000 for the first  
time in recent weeks, the market has appeared extremely vulnerable 
at the first sign of weakness from the corporate giants. Tuesday, 
after Gillette said weakness in its Latin American business will 
cause it to miss analysts' expectations by 1 cent per share, its 
stock fell 7 3/4 to 50. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology companies that lifted the market Monday appeared  
ready to hold on to their gains Tuesday, as the Nasdaq composite 
index, dominated by high-tech issues, outperformed the rest of the 
market for most of the session. By late afternoon, though, the 
Nasdaq slipped back to close just 3.11 higher at 2,563.17, a new 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Microsystems rose 10 9/16 to 140 9/16 after the company told  
investors of new efforts to improve its compatibility with 
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! traded higher for much of the day as investors continued  
to anticipate its earnings report, due Wednesday after the close of 
trading. The Internet company's stock rose 39 3/16 Monday, and 
gained as much as 25 Tuesday until profit-takers sold it back down. 
Yahoo! fell 5 1/16 to 214 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications companies were mixed. MCI WorldCom fell 2 7/8 to  
89 5/8 amid reports it is negotiating to buy Nextel Communications in 
an attempt to break into the $33 billion U.S. wireless telephone 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Lucent Technologies soared 5 9/16 to 64 1/2 in very heavy  
trading. Analysts cited the company's strong foundation and a sound 
outlook for the telecom industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Market watchers continued to fret about the narrow range of  
companies that have flourished in the current market. Declining 
issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the New York 
Stock Exchange, with 1,789 down, 1,193 up and 594 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The advance/decline line is seriously negative today, and  
that's disturbing,'' said Hyman. ``If this market doesn't broaden 
out, we'll be in line for a much more serious correction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 969.40 million shares, well ahead of  
Monday's pace. The NYSE composite index fell 2.31 to 612.32, and 
the American Stock Exchange composite index fell 6.03 to 715.21. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, which also set a record Monday,  
slipped 3.23 to 1,317.89. The Russell 2000 index of smaller 
companies fell 1.21 to 401.08. 
</P>
<P>
	The market appeared unaffected by the Conference Board's report  
that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose for the fifth 
straight month in February.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 32.46 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mixed Tuesday as an earnings  
warning from Gillette put the brakes on Monday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 32.46 at 9,974.87. The index shifted between positive and 
negative territory for much of the session, falling as much as 
69.35 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was the brightest  
spot in the market, rising 18.48 to 2,578.54. Yahoo! provided the 
boost as traders sent its shares higher in advance of its earning 
report, due Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts believe the Web search engine company will surpass  
a First Call consensus estimate of 8 cents per share. Its stock was 
up 3 1/2 at 222 5/8 after rising 39 3/16 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow rose 174.82 Monday to close at 10,007.33, a new record  
that marked the index's second finish above 10,000. The Nasdaq and 
S&AMP;P 500 indexes also set new records, sustained by a rally in 
Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Some traders attributed today's market dip to investors hoping  
to lock in profits from Monday's big jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette, which said first-quarter profits will probably not  
meet Wall Street analysts' expectations, fell 8 1/8 today to 49 5/8. The 
company's announcement sobered traders who had bid stocks higher 
Monday on expectations of strong first-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM rose today as the company unveiled a new version of its Web  
server, which allows companies to provide faster service on the 
Internet. IBM was up 1 1/4 at 185 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 625.8 million shares, 
ahead of Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 1.01 at 1,322.13. The  
NYSE composite index was down 1.73 at 612.90, and the American 
Stock Exchange composite index was down 2.96 at 718.28.

<HEADLINE> Allied Planes Target Yugoslav Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEKSINAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Allied warplanes blasted fuel  
depots, oil refineries, roads and bridges in the most intensive 
night of air raids across Yugoslavia, and Serb officials said today 
that a NATO attack on a coal mining town killed five civilians and 
injured dozens. 
</P>
<P>
	A NATO spokesman said there was evidence one of its weapons  
accidentally struck short of its target in this central Serbian 
town -- a military facility housing an artillery brigade. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugee airlift has begun, meanwhile, for the first of at  
least 110,000 ethnic Albanians who have fled Yugoslav forces in 
Kosovo and taken shelter in cold, primitive conditions in northern 
Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400,000 ethnic Albanians have now left Kosovo, where  
at least 2,000 people have been killed over the past 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials say 1.1 million of the 1.8 million ethnic  
Albanians in prewar Kosovo are now displaced -- made refugees, lost 
their homes and possessions to marauding Serb forces and fled to 
neighboring Balkan countries. 
</P>
<P>
	A tent city for refugees has sprung up in Kukes, northern  
Albania, and bread was trucked in from Tirana, Albania's capital. 
Television footage showed crowds, including children, fighting over 
loaves of bread. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials reported about 65,000 refugees trapped for days  
without shelter in the no man's land near Blace, Macedonia, on the 
frontier with Yugoslavia. Thousands more were anxiously waiting 
over the border in Kosovo to get out. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest airstrikes in the NATO air campaign that began March  
24 were aimed at cutting the Yugoslav military's lines of supply 
and transport -- roads, bridges, airports and command centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Targets in a heavy wave of attacks late Monday and early today  
included military barracks, fuel dumps and a power station. The 
bombings included a midmorning strike today in the Kosovo capital, 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	But it appeared that NATO's airstrike on Aleksinac went awry.  
</P>
<P>
	NATO said today during an allied briefing that its weapons had  
targeted a nearby military post but there was ``evidence of damage 
600 meters just short of the target.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Air Commodore David Wilby said it was ``possible'' one of  
the weapons ``fell short'' due to a guidance system fault, incoming 
fire or another cause and that ``any unintended damage'' is ``very 
much regretted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British Defense Secretary George Robertson said accidents happen  
in war and that ``despite all our efforts such casualties will 
inevitably occur in a campaign of this size and complexity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government harshly condemned the NATO strike on  
Aleksinac, a mining town of about 17,000 people 100 miles southeast 
of Belgrade, comparing it to Nazi atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	In Aleksinac, two bodies, along with pools of blood and human  
body parts, could be seen in the wreckage of the apartment 
building. Bricks and roof tiles were strewn about, some hundreds of 
feet from the blast. Local officials feared some people were 
trapped in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies signaled that the air campaign, stepped up sharply in  
the past several days with better weather conditions, was about to 
become even more intense. 
</P>
<P>
	Brig. Gen. Xavier Delcourt, deputy operations chiefs for the  
French armed forces, said NATO would carry out ``massive strikes'' 
on Yugoslavia today and Wednesday, ``greater than anything done so 
far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, voiced new  
defiance in the face of the NATO campaign to dislodge his forces 
from the separatist ethnic Albanian province in southern Serbia and 
to get him to agree to a peace deal offering autonomy to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavs are ``ready to defend their country,'' his office said  
in a statement today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo crisis has sparked the largest refugee exodus Europe  
has seen in a half-century. 
</P>
<P>
	An airlift of refugees to NATO nations and other countries began  
late Monday to Turkey and Norway, but so far it has made only a 
tiny dent in mass of refugees, some living in desperate conditions 
in crude encampments. 
</P>
<P>
	In Geneva, U.N. refugee chief Sadako Ogata said today that the  
forced deportation of Kosovar Albanians represents ``unprecedented 
violations of the most elementary rights of an entire civilian 
population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Security Council on Monday expressed ``deepest concern  
at the grave humanitarian situation'' created by the mass exodus 
from Kosovo, but steered clear of blaming any party for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbia has blamed the NATO campaign for the refugee exodus, and  
bitterly denounced the allied attacks on its heartland. Fresh 
criticism also came today from China, which accused NATO of causing 
``major civilian casualties'' by bombing nonmilitary targets. 
</P>
<P>
	In Aleksinac, the state-run Tanjug news agency quoted civil  
defense commander Jovan Zlatic as saying rescue squads were trying 
to retrieve survivors from beneath the rubble of the wrecked 
apartment building. In a nearby neighborhood, wrecked cars were 
still smoldering hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number of casualties from the NATO attack in central  
Serbia couldn't be independently confirmed, but an Associated Press 
photographer at the scene saw two victims who had died in a 
residential area where several homes were flattened. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian state-run TV showed a local clinic badly damaged and  
shop windows shattered in the center of the town. A local Red Cross 
worker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that of the 30 
wounded, five were in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb television said NATO also struck a fuel depot south of the  
Hungarian border and a railway bridge over the Danube River. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug said several missiles blasted a barracks today in  
Prizren, Kosovo's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO missiles hit a communications relay station near Pristina,  
and blasted targets on the main road from Kosovo to the Serb 
heartland, Tanjug reported. The runway at Pristina's airport was 
also hit, the independent Beta news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong detonations late Monday in the northern city of Novi Sad  
sent an orange fireball into the sky, Serbian television showed. 
Tanjug said the power station at the city oil refinery had been 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Beta said missiles had struck the airport at Nis, headquarters  
of the army corps responsible for military operations in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Japan Criticizes U.S. Trade Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's farm minister said Tuesday that the  
possible invocation of a section of a controversial U.S. trade law 
could damage ties between Washington and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoichi Nakagawa, who heads the Ministry of Agriculture,  
Forestry and Fisheries, said the punitive Super 301 provision goes 
against the spirit of the World Trade Organization, according to a 
ministry spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the U.S. is trying to implement it, it is bad for  
U.S.-Japan relations,'' the spokesman, speaking on customary 
condition of anonymity, quoted Nakagawa as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Nakagawa's comments come after the United States released its  
annual report on foreign trade barriers on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Washington would urge Tokyo to implement further  
deregulation measures in the telecommunications, housing, medical 
services and pharmaceuticals sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese media reports have interpreted that as an indication  
the Clinton administration is threatening to invoke Super 301 if no 
progress is made on insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Kaoru Yosano, Japan's trade minister, criticized the  
report, saying it was ``not necessarily based on international 
rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Japanese officials are scheduled to hold working-level  
talks on Japan's insurance market next week in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Gore Makes Changes to His Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore, the presidential candidate most  
closely associated with technology savvy, launched his campaign 
into cyberspace -- and nearly stumbled over the nettlesome problem 
of Internet privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign rushed Tuesday to remove from its new Web site  
questions asking children for their names, e-mail addresses and zip 
codes -- a practice soon to be outlawed on some Internet sites by 
legislation Congress approved last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign stripped the questions from the ``Just for Kids''  
section of its Web site less than one hour before the pages were 
published Tuesday on the Internet, after The Associated Press 
raised questions about them during a preview for news 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	A new privacy law, signed by the President Clinton last year,  
generally prohibits asking children such questions on commercial 
Web sites unless companies first obtain a parent's permission. 
</P>
<P>
	The law takes effect in 2001, although federal regulators -- who  
have yet to determine how they will enforce the ban -- indicated 
Tuesday it won't cover campaign Internet sites. 
</P>
<P>
	As originally designed, Gore's Web site offered children the  
opportunity to receive campaign materials electronically if they 
submitted their first and last name, e-mail address and zip code. 
They also could send Gore questions via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The site also included a link to a privacy statement -- rare  
among the Web pages of any of the presidential candidates -- with 
specific suggestions for children, such as warning them not to give 
out personal information without a parent's permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign officials maintain that their original version would  
not have violated the new privacy law, but they decided to remove 
the questions anyway -- except for asking children their first name. 
</P>
<P>
	Kids can still electronically send questions to Gore, who  
promised to reply to one or two each day on the Web. But the 
campaign added a warning to ``PLEASE ask your parents if it is OK 
to give us the following information before you submit questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign manager, Craig Smith, said he ordered the  
changes after talking with lawyers and considering his own feelings 
as a father. Smith's children helped work on Gore's ``Just for 
Kids'' pages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that the vice president's office set a good  
example, so I commend them for making the changes,'' said Kathryn 
Montgomery, president of the Washington-based Center for Media 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said Tuesday it doesn't consider a campaign Web site to  
be commercial, and thus subject to the new law. But some privacy 
groups suggested the law might apply to any site with a ``.com'' 
Web address, such as Gore's. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore recently drew ridicule when he said in an interview that he  
helped create the Internet, a remark he later blamed on being 
tired. He has been a strong supporter of federal spending to boost 
technology.

<HEADLINE> Xerox Names Thoman As CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- G. Richard Thoman, a former IBM executive  
credited with tough cost-cutting moves during the computer maker's 
turnaround, was named chief executive officer at Xerox Corp. today. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoman, 54, who joined Xerox in 1997 as president and chief  
operating officer, replaces Paul A. Allaire, 60, who will stay on 
as chairman for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoman's election by the Xerox board of directors was not a  
surprise. He had been the heir apparent since being hired as the 
No. 2 executive at Xerox in June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoman started at IBM in 1994, running its personal computer  
business, and was promoted to finance chief in 1995. His 
cost-slashing measures eliminated thousands of jobs and helped 
revive the company. 
</P>
<P>
	At Xerox, Thoman has been instrumental in the company's push to  
sell its digital products in low-end retail outlets such as Staples 
and Office Max. He has also promoted a more aggressive marketing 
strategy. In the past year, the company's advertising budget has 
doubled from about $100 million to $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the right guy to take Xerox into the next stage,'' said  
Keith Kmetz, an industry analyst with International Data Corp. of 
Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``His legacy will be maintaining and driving Xerox into more of  
an organization in the digital document world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allaire, who became CEO in 1990 and chairman the following year,  
is credited with transforming Xerox from a copier company into a 
high-tech digital company. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox has struggled to reduce costs as it shifts from old-style  
copiers that operate with lenses and light bulbs to multipurpose 
digital models that can be upgraded to print, scan and fax 
documents when connected to personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is in the midst of cutting 9,000 jobs, or just under  
10 percent of its worldwide work force, as it tries to step up its 
presence in the rapidly growing market for lower-priced digital 
copiers and printers used in the home and small office markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the company unveiled 90 new products, including a  
family of digital copiers. Digital products made up 53 percent of 
the company's $5.05 billion revenue in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to CEO, Thoman will retain the title of president.  
</P>
<P>
	Before joining IBM, Thoman worked at Nabisco International,  
American Express, the consulting firm McKinsey and Co., and Exxon 
Corp.

<HEADLINE> Ford Sets March Sales Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- It was a record-breaking March for Ford Motor  
Co., as the No. 2 automaker's pickups and sport utility vehicles 
attracted thousands more buyers to its dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford reported Tuesday that its U.S. sales were up 14 percent  
last month compared with March 1998, based on the daily sales rate. 
Ford broke a long list of company records, led by its strongest 
monthly sales of light trucks ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's report came after last week's largely upbeat sales  
figures from DaimlerChrysler AG and most major foreign automakers. 
General Motors Corp., the No. 1 automaker, was expected to report 
slightly higher March sales today. 
</P>
<P>
	March sales of F-series pickups, the nation's top-selling  
vehicle for 17 years, were the highest for any car or truck in any 
month since June 1978. Ford sold 85,686 of the full-size pickups 
last month, more than many models achieve over an entire year. The 
June '78 record was 90,370 F-series trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's car sales, excluding its Jaguar unit, were up nearly 6  
percent while its light truck sales increased 19 percent to set a 
record for any month. SUV sales were up 11 percent while total 
pickup sales were up 28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The news was especially good for Ford because pickups and SUVs  
carry the highest profit margins. Much of the big increase in 
F-series sales was due to robust demand for the new F-250 and F-350 
Super Duty trucks built at Ford's Louisville, Ky., truck plant, 
which has been running full-tilt with three shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're crying all the way to the bank,'' said analyst David  
Healy of Burnham Securities Inc. ``The models that are the most 
profitable for them have the biggest year-over-year increase in 
sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford announced Tuesday that it was increasing its second-quarter  
production by 20,000 trucks and 10,000 cars to meet the strong 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Explorer and Expedition SUVs also set March sales records,  
while the new Mercury Cougar and the Escort ZX2 coupes had their 
best sales months yet. Ford's minivan sales were up 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Rewey, Ford vice president of marketing and sales, said a  
stable economy marked by high consumer confidence, income growth, 
low inflation and interest rates was behind the robust demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Wall Street and Main Street respond favorably to  
consistency and stability,'' Rewey said. ``We believe that stable 
fiscal and monetary policy have played a key role in the duration 
of this expansion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Healy said he does not see any drop in the high demand in the  
short term. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anything in the picture that's going to slow this  
down unless gasoline prices keep going up 30 cents a gallon every 
week,'' he said. ``At this point, the gasoline thing is just a 
minor irritant to people who want to buy an Expedition or an 
Excursion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jaguar's sales were down 17 percent last month.

<HEADLINE> Nagano Residents Sue IOC for $7M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Three residents of Nagano sued the IOC and its  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch today, demanding the return of 
nearly $7 million in taxpayer money used in the campaign to get 
last year's Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the plaintiffs, former assemblyman Kaoru Iwata, said the  
lawsuit is ``the only way to impeach the injustice'' since the IOC 
and Samaranch will not punish nine IOC members suspected by the 
Japanese Olympic Committee of violating IOC rules by receiving 
``excessive'' entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese bidders have said they wined and dined visiting IOC  
officials, entertaining some with geisha. 
</P>
<P>
	Iwata said Samaranch was given a painting and a sword worth  
$8,000 by the Nagano bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has said it has the painting at its headquarters in  
Lausanne, Switzerland, but denies having received the sword. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no limit on the value of gifts to Samaranch because he  
accepts them on behalf of the IOC and does not vote in the 
selection of host cities. IOC officials are limited to gifts under 
$150. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC marketing director Michael Payne said in Lausanne he was  
``slightly surprised'' to hear of the suit, given the amount of 
financial support that the IOC gave the organizing committee during 
the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan spent $16.7 million on its campaign to win the right to  
host the games. Nagano state and local governments put up $6.9 
million of that total, while the rest came from private or 
corporate contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs argue that the IOC should not have allowed its  
members to accept the excessive entertainment knowing that much of 
the money used to pay for it had come from taxpayers. The 
plaintiffs want to the IOC to return the amount taxpayers 
contributed. 
</P>
<P>
	Iwata's group has already sued Nagano prefecture governor, the  
chairman of the Japan Olympic Committee and Nagano's mayor to force 
them to further specify how the money was spent. 
</P>
<P>
	JOC secretary general Yushiro Yagi, who led an investigation  
into Nagano's bid, said in February that the nine might have broken 
IOC rules while visiting Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagi refused to identify the nine or detail their conduct,  
although he said at that time that he would report it to IOC 
headquarters in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC last month rejected Quebec City's demand for  
compensation to cover the cost of its failed bid for the 2002 
Winter Games. The city requested $8 million in compensation last 
month after an IOC investigation determined that some of its 
members received improper gifts from organizers of the successful 
bid by Salt Lake City.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Recalls Rescue in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The pilot of the U.S. stealth fighter  
downed in Yugoslavia last month said he started thinking about 
surviving behind enemy lines as soon as he began parachuting to 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I was fairly deep into Serbian territory,'' he said.  
``I had guessed my position was within 20 miles of Belgrade -- not a 
happy thought, considering the risk in a combat search and rescue 
that deep into Serbian territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot bailed out of the F-117A Nighthawk during a night  
mission over Yugoslavia on March 27 and was rescued by U.S. forces 
within six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The military has not identified him, but excerpts of an Air  
Force interview with him were published in today's Albuquerque 
Journal. The only F-117A unit is the 49th Fighter Wing at Holloman 
Air Force Base near Alamogordo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has not announced what brought down the fighter.  
The pilot described the experience of ejecting from the fighter as 
``violent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	```Am I going to know when it's time to get out?' is the  
question on every fighter pilot's mind,'' he said. ``The one 
fragment of this whole event I can't remember is pulling the 
(ejection seat) handles. God took my hands and pulled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The F-117A went down near Budjenovci, 35 miles northwest of the  
Yugoslav capital, Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot said he was in radio contact with NATO forces as he  
descended, looking for landmarks and hiding places. He landed in a 
freshly plowed field 50 yards from a road and rail intersection. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, who suffered only cuts and bruises in the jump, said  
he immediately buried a life raft and other survival equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	He hid in a shallow culvert about 200 yards from where he had  
landed. Over the next several hours, he saw flashing headlights, 
heard barking dogs and felt anxiety. At one point, a search dog 
came within 30 feet of him. 
</P>
<P>
	He hoped, but did not know, that a rescue operation was under  
way. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the downed guy, it's very unsettling to not know what's  
going on,'' he said. ``You're thinking, `Do they know I'm here? Do 
they know my location? Where are the assets and who is involved? 
What's the plan? Are they going to try to do this tonight?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot remained in radio contact with friendly forces but  
said he had to minimize transmissions for fear of being monitored 
by Yugoslav forces. 
</P>
<P>
	About six hours after the crash, helicopter-borne rescuers from  
the Air Force's 16th Special Operations Group picked him up. 
</P>
<P>
	The distinctive boomerang-shaped F-117A, which has a 43-foot  
wingspan, is armed with laser-guided bombs and equipped with 
sophisticated navigation and attack systems. Stealth technology 
uses curved or angular surfaces to reduce radar reflection. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-117A had never before gone down in combat.

<HEADLINE> 'Xena' Episode Yanked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An episode of ``Xena: Warrior Princess'' has  
been yanked from worldwide syndication after criticism from Hindu 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Renaissance Pictures, the show's producer, apologized Monday for  
offending members of the Hindu community and said it had no plans 
for further episodes involving Hindu deities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly had no intention of offending anyone,'' the  
studio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Hindu protesters said they were frustrated when  
studio executives wouldn't meet with them to hear their concerns 
about the show's portrayal of Lord Krishna and Hanuman. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the deities in the action-adventure series, which stars  
Lucy Lawless as Xena, was an affront to those who worship them, 
said Tusta Krishnadas of the World Vaishnava Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode first aired in February.  
</P>
<P>
	If a decision is made to re-air the episode, changes would be  
made with guidance from Sunil Aghi, president of the Indo-Americans 
Political Foundation, Renaissance said.

<HEADLINE> Court: Tribes Can Harvest Shellfish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- Private property owners and commercial  
shellfish growers were stunned by a U.S. Supreme Court action 
allowing Washington tribes to harvest shellfish on private beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials, shellfish growers and private property owners  
contended the American Indians' 19th century treaties give them no 
legal claim to shellfish on private property. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high court on Monday rejected without comment an appeal  
of a ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld 
the tribes' shellfish rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our members are devastated,'' said Bill Dewey, a spokesman for  
the Puget Sound Shellfish Growers Association. ``This is an 
incredible burden for the growers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial shellfish growers contend the ruling could threaten  
their livelihoods and ``will cripple or destroy the growers'' by 
allowing tribal members to enter their property. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal leaders said the ruling does not mean American Indians  
will be indiscriminately tramping private beaches to dig clams, 
mussels and other shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long process before you can go on a beach and  
harvest,'' said Doug Williams, a spokesman for the Northwest Indian 
Fisheries Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``There must be a biological assessment of the area, sampling  
and testing, and a written notice. In fact, as far as I know, there 
has been only one harvest off of a private landowner's beach'' 
since the case began with a 1994 ruling on tribal shellfish rights 
in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the 17 Indian tribes noted that the 9th U.S. Circuit  
ruling allows tribes to harvest only shellfish that would exist 
naturally, without the growers' help. 
</P>
<P>
	Dewey doesn't see it that way.  
</P>
<P>
	``The burden is on the grower to prove'' which shellfish are  
naturally occurring and which are not ``for every bed,'' he said. 
``This is an incredible burden for the growers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under treaties signed in 1855, the tribes gave up most of their  
land in then-Washington Territory in exchange for reservations, 
money and the right to continue fishing in traditional fishing 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of court rulings during the 1970s defined what areas  
are traditional Indian fishing grounds, and affirmed the tribes' 
right to take up to half of the salmon and other fish. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie said shellfish are  
also covered by the 1970s rulings. The 9th Circuit upheld most of 
Rafeedie's ruling and allowed the Indians to harvest shellfish on 
some private cultivated beds.

<HEADLINE> Actress Lucille Lortel Dies at 98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucille Lortel, who earned the title ``Queen of  
off-Broadway'' for bringing innovative new actors, playwrights and 
productions to the American stage, died Sunday. She was 98. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lortel, whose career in theater spanned more than 70 years,  
produced or co-produced about 500 plays, five of which were 
nominated for Tony Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lortel, born Louise Wadler, began her own acting career in  
the 1920s and made her Broadway debut in 1925 with a small role in 
George Bernard Shaw's ``Caesar and Cleopatra,'' starring Helen 
Hayes and Lionel Atwill. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1947, she was asked by the actor Canada Lee and playwright  
Philip Huston to help find a place and audience for a staged 
reading of a new play, ``The Painted Wagon,'' and the 
still-thriving White Barn Theater was born in Westport, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, her husband gave her the Theatre de Lys -- now called  
the Lucille Lortel Theater -- in Greenwich Village as a 24th 
anniversary gift. Its first production was a hugely popular 
adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's and Kurt Weill's ``Threepenny 
Opera'' that made off-Broadway famous. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lortel's eye for and confidence in young talent boosted the  
careers of countless actors, composers, designers, directors and 
playwrights. She established numerous funds and fellowships to 
further the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you love the theater, you must be innovative,'' she once  
said. ``You must try new ideas and new faces. The costs are lower 
off-Broadway, so you can afford to take a chance, and you must take 
a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White Barn, Ms. Lortel nurtured performers such as Eva  
Marie Saint and Zero Mostel and staged plays by Edward Albee, 
Samuel Beckett and Sean O'Casey. Peter Falk and George Peppard also 
performed there. 
</P>
<P>
	When Marc Blitzstein's adaptation of ``Threepenny Opera'' became  
a success at the Theatre de Lys, ultimately running for seven 
years, Ms. Lortel became frustrated: She wanted to stage more plays 
at the theater. 
</P>
<P>
	She persuaded the American National Theater and Academy to back  
an experimental matinee series, which began in 1956 with a verse 
adaptation of Alan Paton's novel ``Cry the Beloved Country'' and 
ran for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The series featured a dramatization of Langston Hughes poems  
called ``Shakespeare in Harlem''; adaptations of poetic works by 
Robert Frost and Archibald MacLeish; and performances of rarely 
seen plays by William Inge and Tennessee Williams. It presented 
actors such as Richard Burton and Helen Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1964, Ms. Lortel oversaw the first U.S. production of a play  
by South African playwright Athol Fugard. ``Blood Knot'' starred 
James Earl Jones and J.D. Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lortel's productions of ``A Walk in the Woods,'' by Lee  
Blessing; ``Angels Fall,'' by Lanford Wilson; ``As Is,'' by William 
Hoffman; ``Blood Knot;'' and ``Sarafina!'' another South African 
import, were nominated for Tonys but didn't win. They all were 
produced on Broadway or moved there. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lortel was inducted into the Theater Hall of Fame in 1990. A  
tribute to her career is on permanent display at the archives of 
the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Penalty Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's a perennial political rite: Lawmakers  
demand elimination of the Social Security earnings test, a penalty 
that forces the youngest among older Americans to choose between a 
government check and work. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, as President Clinton and Republican congressional  
leaders try to work out how to spend government surpluses, it might 
finally be wiped off the books. 
</P>
<P>
	``The line between retirement and working is blurring'' because  
Americans are living longer, said Social Security Commissioner 
Kenneth S. Apfel. ``People should be able to continue to work and 
continue to receive a Social Security benefit to keep contributing 
to the work force and to themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said relief from the earnings test should be part of  
a larger package that would use expected government surpluses to 
help avert a Social Security cash shortfall expected in 2034. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they reach no overall deal on Social Security, however,  
relief from the earnings test is a tempting political plum that 
affects the nation's most avid voters -- senior citizens. 
Republicans used a proposal to ease its impact in the ``Contract 
With America'' that helped them win control of Congress in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., is making eliminating  
the penalty a priority, and some say a repeal could find its way 
into a tax relief package Democrats would also be eager to support 
before the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we will get something passed this year on this issue,  
whether it is a stand-alone or as part of overall reform,'' said 
Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Available surpluses could help grease the skids: the cost to  
Social Security of eliminating the earnings test is expected to be 
negligible in the long run, but because it would mean some people 
would collect benefits earlier, it could cost as much as $15 
billion over the first five years, before diminishing. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings test currently affects 870,000 working Americans  
between the ages of 65 and 69 who earn more than Social Security 
allows and therefore get a smaller benefit or none at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a job, many of these older people face the prospect of  
trying to live on a fixed income near the poverty level. Yet they 
lose $1 of benefits for every $3 they earn above $15,500 a year. 
That limit is scheduled to rise to $30,000 a year by 2002 because 
of congressional action four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings test is even stricter for people who want to  
collect some benefits under an early retirement option offered to 
those age 62 to 64. They lose $1 for every $2 earned above $9,600 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, most proposals to ease the penalty would not provide  
relief for these early retirees, and Clinton has not said whether 
he would support that. 
</P>
<P>
	In reality, Social Security benefits withheld under the earnings  
test are not lost -- just delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	After people retire fully -- or once they reach age 70, when the  
penalty no longer applies -- their monthly benefits are adjusted 
upward to compensate for the losses. 
</P>
<P>
	That can create a positive side effect, says former  
congressional economist Wendell Primus: People who continue working 
lock in higher Social Security benefits for later, when they or a 
surviving spouse will need them most. 
</P>
<P>
	But the main reasoning behind the earnings test dates back to  
Social Security's start during the Great Depression, Primus said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had high unemployment,'' said Primus. ``They wanted some  
of these older workers to leave the work force to make room, so you 
couldn't get Social Security if you were working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, discouraging older people from working is no longer  
desirable. Unlike in the 1930s, unemployment today is low and 
businesses will have to cope with a dwindling work force as the 
huge baby boom generation nears the traditional retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're finally waking up to the fact that we've got this aging  
population and we need to find ways to keep people in the work 
force,'' said Andrea Wooten, president of Green Thumb Inc., a 
nonprofit organization that helps people over age 55 find and keep 
meaningful work. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, many people feel punished by the earnings test. Not  
everyone lives long enough to collect the system's delayed 
compensation. And wealthier retirees who collect income from 
investments rather than work aren't affected.

Spanish-speaking households in the United States, the company 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The service offers the same features available through Prodigy

<P>
	Prodigy, based in White Plains, hopes to ``break down the  
language barriers that have kept many Spanish-speaking Americans 
away from the Internet,'' said David C. Trachtenberg, president and 
chief operating officer of Prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
	The service will be supported with Spanish-language advertising,  
news and links to other Hispanic Web sites and services. Visitors 
can also search the Internet with Spanish language search engines. 
</P>
<P>
	The service, costing $19.95 monthly, will be promoted in  
commercials beginning today on Spanish-language television stations 
in Miami and Chicago, The Wall Street Journal reported today. The 
marketing campaign will be expanded to eight other U.S. cities, the 
newspaper said.

	Other companies offer Spanish-language content online, but focus  
mainly on subscribers outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online Inc., based in Dulles, Va., announced in December  
a joint venture with a Venezuelan company to develop local online 
services written in Spanish and Portuguese and geared to residents 
of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. AOL said it would also be able to 
provide the online content to its subscribers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Star Media, a New York-based Internet company, is also a

<HEADLINE> Hockey Champs Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORONO, Maine (AP) -- The University of Maine hockey team returned  
home today with the NCAA championship, completing a three-year 
turnaround in which the program rebounded from scandal and 
disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of fans turned out at Alfond Arena for a 90-minute  
rally to honor the Black Bears, who flew home late Sunday night 
from Anaheim, Calif., after two overtime victories in the Frozen 
Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine advanced to the final with a 2-1 win over Boston College,  
then beat New Hampshire 3-2 Saturday night in the championship 
game. Marcus Gustafsson scored the winning goal off his own rebound 
at 10:50 of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was especially sweet for Gustafsson and fellow  
seniors Steve Kariya, David Cullen, Bobby Stewart and Jason 
Vitorino, all of whom remained at Maine even after sanctions for 
NCAA rules violations led some teammates to transfer elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was barred from the NCAA tournament for two years,  
scholarships were cut and coach Shawn Walsh was suspended for a 
year, casting doubt on the future of a program that had brought 
home its first national championship in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Speakers at the rally praised the five seniors for hanging in  
and providing the leadership that led to the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	``They worked hard, they took care of business, and now they're  
number one,'' university president Peter Hoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Suzanne Tyler singled out Walsh for turning  
adversity into success. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a guy who takes chicken parts and makes chicken  
salad,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the preliminary remarks, Walsh introduced his players,  
each of whom addressed the crowd. The biggest cheers were reserved 
for the seniors and goalie Alfie Michaud, who made 46 saves in the 
final game and was the last to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said the team will visit the White House, as it did after  
its 1993 national title. The championship banner will be hung at 
Alfond Arena in October, when Maine plays host to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh displayed his optimism for the coming season as he  
introduced some of the transfer students and current reserves who 
will be called upon to play big roles next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh noted that no team has won consecutive NCAA championships  
in more than 25 years, but added, ``I'll be honest with you. I like 
our chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Black Bears were led to their 1993 championship by freshman  
Paul Kariya, the Hobey Baker Award winner who went on to star with 
the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. This year, playing on the home ice of 
Kariya's NHL team, Maine was led by his younger brother Steve, a 
Hobey Baker finalist. 
</P>
<P>
	A third Kariya, Martin, has made a verbal commitment to enroll  
at Maine in the fall.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Declares Kosovo Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav leadership today  
declared a unilateral cease-fire in its battle against Kosovo 
rebels to mark Orthodox Easter, hours after the most intensive 
night of NATO air raids across Yugoslavia. Western officials said 
the bombings would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the cease-fire would continue past the  
holiday Sunday, but NATO and U.S. officials had been expecting a 
cease-fire offer. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said half-measures would not end the NATO air  
campaign that began March 24, and British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair's office responded that the Yugoslav declaration ``doesn't go 
nearly far enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The British statement said Yugoslav President Slobodan  
``Milosevic knows what he has to do and this falls way short of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration was clearly aimed at staving off further NATO  
attacks and at presenting the Milosevic government as interested in 
resolving the crisis without capitulating to the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic said he hoped NATO would  
respond by stopping the bombing. ``If NATO continues to bombard 
Serbia after today's decision, it would be very clear ... NATO is 
against peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reciting the terms spelled out by Clinton, National Security  
Council spokesman David Leavy said, ``NATO operations will continue 
until these conditions are met.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the crisis in Kosovo today in Washington shortly  
before the Yugoslav offer, Clinton laid out terms that he said 
Milosevic must accept to end the allies' airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Milosevic could end it now by withdrawing his military  
police and paramilitary forces,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, he said Milosevic must accept the deployment of an  
international security force ``to protect not only the Kosovar 
Albanians, most, not all of whom are Muslims, but also the Serbians 
minority in Kosovo. Everybody. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not for anybody's hate crimes,'' Clinton said. ``And by  
making it possible for all the refugees to return. And to move 
toward a political framework based on the (Rambouillet peace) 
accords reached in France.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement broadcast on Belgrade television, the government  
said the move was taken in advance of Sunday's Orthodox Easter as a 
``gesture of goodwill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To honor the biggest Christian holiday, Easter, all actions of  
the army and police will stop in Kosovo against the terrorist 
organization KLA starting April 6 at 8 p.m. (3 p.m. EDT),'' the 
government statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement pledged the government would work for the return  
of ethnic Albanian refugees together with U.N. institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also offered to forge a ``temporary agreement''  
with moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, which it said 
would be the basis for a ``final agreement'' on Kosovo ``within 
Serbia and Yugoslavia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In this way all the acute issues in Kosovo would be solved,  
peace stabilized, return of refugees enabled, self-rule established 
and equality of all citizens promoted,'' the statement added. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement came after allied warplanes blasted fuel depots,  
oil refineries, roads and bridges across Yugoslavia, and Serb 
officials said that a NATO attack on a coal mining town killed five 
civilians and injured dozens. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, a NATO spokesman said there was evidence  
one of its weapons accidentally struck short of its target in 
Aleksinac, a central Serbian town -- a military facility housing an 
artillery brigade. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said during an allied briefing that there was ``evidence of  
damage 600 meters just short of the target.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Air Commodore David Wilby said it was ``possible that one  
of our weapons fell short of the target'' due to a guidance system 
fault, incoming fire or another cause and that ``any unintended 
damage to civilian property or loss of life is very much 
regretted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government harshly condemned the NATO strike on the  
mining town of about 17,000 people 100 miles southeast of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	In Aleksinac, two bodies, along with pools of blood and human  
body parts, could be seen in the wreckage of the apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugee airlift has begun, meanwhile, for the first of at  
least 110,000 ethnic Albanians who have fled Yugoslav forces in 
Kosovo and taken shelter in cold, primitive conditions in northern 
Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400,000 ethnic Albanians have now left Kosovo, where  
at least 2,000 people have been killed over the past 13 months. For 
two straight days, officials said 40,000 people have left Kosovo, 
with more than half of them crossing into Albania, perhaps Europe's 
poorest country. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say nearly a quarter-million refugees now are in  
Albania. A comparable number, if the influx was to the United 
States and not Albania, ``would mean over 20 million extra 
people,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials say 1.1 million of the 1.8 million ethnic  
Albanians in prewar Kosovo are now displaced -- made refugees, lost 
their homes and possessions to marauding Serb forces and fled to 
neighboring Balkan countries. 
</P>
<P>
	A tent city for refugees has sprung up in Kukes, northern  
Albania, and bread was trucked in from Tirana, Albania's capital, 
to feed the hungry. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials reported about 65,000 refugees trapped for days  
without shelter in the no man's land near Blace, Macedonia, on the 
frontier with Yugoslavia. Thousands more were anxiously waiting 
over the border in Kosovo to get out. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest airstrikes in the NATO air campaign were aimed at  
cutting the Yugoslav military's lines of supply and transport -- 
roads, bridges, airports and command centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Targets in a heavy wave of attacks late Monday and early today  
included military barracks, fuel dumps and a power station. The 
bombings included a midmorning strike today in the Kosovo capital, 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies signaled that the air campaign, stepped up sharply in  
the past several days with better weather conditions, was about to 
become even more intense. 
</P>
<P>
	Brig. Gen. Xavier Delcourt, deputy operations chiefs for the  
French armed forces, said NATO would carry out ``massive strikes'' 
on Yugoslavia today and Wednesday, ``greater than anything done so 
far.''

<HEADLINE> Church Learns About Investing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- The Rev. Larry O'Dell sowed $1,281 and  
reaped five times as much. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of Lent, O'Dell handed out cash to members of his  
congregation and, citing a parable in the Bible, asked them to use 
their talents to invest the money and then donate their earnings to 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
	On Easter Sunday, the collection plates at Christ United  
Methodist Church contained $5,610.63, with more money still coming 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dell had dispensed the seed money in crisp, new bills -- fives  
for adults and twos for children -- and gave the congregation 40 
days to invest it. It came back as a combination of cash and 
checks, with a note explaining how each member of the congregation 
used his or her talents. 
</P>
<P>
	``One man makes duck calls. He used his money to make a handmade  
duck call. I think it brought in $50. A lot of people made pies and 
peanut brittle,'' O'Dell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The students in an adult Sunday school class pooled their $5s  
and put together a cookbook. Children held car washes or raked 
lawns. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the whole point -- to find out what they could do,''  
O'Dell said. ``Some people said this helped find out who they 
are.''

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Charging $3 Minimum Fee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. is extending a $3 minimum monthly  
charge to all of its long-distance customers, even if they don't 
make any long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The minimum charge starts in July for AT&AMP;T customers not  
currently signed up for one of the company's calling plans. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, which has 70 million long-distance customers, introduced  
the policy last August, charging the $3 to plan subscribers and new 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 million AT&AMP;T customers make less than $3 a month in  
calls. AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest telecommunications company, said 
it needs the money to cover the $300 million a year it costs to 
service infrequent callers. 
</P>
<P>
	Minimum charges, until now, had been more limited.  
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, the second largest long-distance company, also has  
a $3 monthly minimum for customers who don't use its promotional 
calling plans, but doesn't charge the fee to its remaining 
customers, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 3 Sprint, conversely, only charges a minimum fee to those  
who sign up for promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T said it would waive the fee for some low-income customers.  
But consumer groups said charges are hurting those customers least 
able to afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T's new minimum charge is the latest example of  
telecommunications deregulation run amok, driving up prices for 
millions of consumers,'' said Gene Kimmelman, of the 
Washington-based Consumers Union, in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimmelman noted that other fees, ranging from $2-3 a month,  
already were instituted in the wake of telecommunications 
deregulation in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T stock rose more than 3 percent, advancing $2.68 3/4 to  
$80.12 1/2, in Tuesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Seles, Davenport on US Fed Cup Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Removing the Fed Cup series between the  
United States and Croatia from Eastern Europe took the participants 
out of possible danger. It also allowed U.S. captain Billie Jean 
King to choose Monica Seles. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterfinal originally was scheduled for Zagreb, Croatia.  
But NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia raised questions about 
safety. For a time, there was talk of switching the site to 
Hamburg, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even consider her if we were in one of those two  
places,'' King said during a conference call Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The matches were moved to Raleigh, N.C., and that allowed King  
to have Seles join Lindsay Davenport, Chanda Rubin and Lisa Raymond 
for the matches at Raleigh Racquet Club on April 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles was born in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, where explosions were  
heard during Monday's round of air strikes and which was without 
water after weekend raids. King has talked with Seles about the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been very upset,'' King said. ``It is just very  
difficult for her and I am sure for the Croatians as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was six years ago this month that Seles was stabbed in the  
back during a match in Hamburg, Germany, by an obsessed fan of 
Steffi Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her if we are going to play in Croatia or they are  
going to move it to Germany, I don't expect you to go at all,'' 
King said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of made the decision for her so she didn't have to get  
uptight about it because I know deep down she always wants to play 
Fed Cup when she can,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Tennis Federation's Fed Cup committee said it  
considered neutral sites for the series, then decided on the United 
States for the Croatia match. It narrowed its choice to the 
southeastern United States because a number of players will be in a 
tournament at Amelia Island, Fla., the preceding week. 
</P>
<P>
	A nine-time Grand Slam winner, Seles is ranked fourth in the  
world after reaching the semifinals of the 1999 Australian Open and 
the doubles finals in the Lipton Championship with Mary Joe 
Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles played in the 1998 Fed Cup semifinals against Spain and  
was a member of the 1996 Fed Cup championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	King said she expects the Raleigh crowd to act less like a staid  
tennis crowd and more like fans who pack college basketball and 
stock car racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just too bad that we do have to play in the United States  
because of what is going on over there,'' King said. ``At least we 
are going to feel safe here. That is very important for both teams.

<HEADLINE> Gore Makes Changes to His Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore moved his campaign onto  
the Internet, but only after stripping his Web site of questions 
asking children for their names, e-mail addresses and zip codes -- a 
practice that Congress last year decided to outlaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign removed questions in the ``Just for Kids''  
section of its Web site less than one hour before it was published 
Tuesday on the Internet, after The Associated Press raised 
questions about them during a preview for news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	A privacy law signed by the President Clinton last year  
generally prohibits such questions to children on commercial Web 
sites unless companies first obtain a parent's permission. The new 
law, however, doesn't take effect until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday it doesn't consider a  
campaign Web site to be commercial and subject to the new law. But 
privacy groups suggested the law might apply to any site with a 
``.com'' Web address such as Gore's. 
</P>
<P>
	As originally designed, Gore's Internet site offered children  
the opportunity to receive campaign materials electronically if 
they submitted their first and last name, e-mail address and zip 
code. They also could send Gore questions via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The front page of his web site also included a link to a privacy  
statement with tips for protecting children, such as getting 
parents' permission before giving out personal information. 
</P>
<P>
	While contending that the questions didn't violate the new  
privacy law, Gore's campaign officials decided anyway to remove 
them all, except for asking children their first name. 
</P>
<P>
	Kids can still electronically send questions to Gore, who  
promised to reply to one or two each day on the Web. The campaign 
also added a warning for kids to ``PLEASE ask your parents if it is 
OK to give us the following information before you submit 
questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign manager, Craig Smith, said he ordered the  
changes after talking with lawyers and considering his own feelings 
as a father. Smith's own children helped work on Gore's ``Just for 
Kids'' pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been a strong supporter of consumer privacy on the  
Internet. In a speech last spring, he described children as ``the 
most vulnerable and sometimes the most willing to innocently 
disclose information when they are online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign Web site gaffe occurred as an important national  
privacy conference was opening here. Gore has repeatedly warned 
Internet companies they will face tough new privacy laws unless 
they can adequately protect consumer privacy online. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that the vice president's office set a good  
example, so I commend them for making the changes,'' said Kathryn 
Montgomery, president of the Washington-based Center for Media 
Education. The group lobbied the White House last year on behalf of 
the children's privacy law. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was prompted by an FTC study last year of 1,400 Web  
sites showing that the vast majority fail to tell visitors how they 
use personal information they collect. 
</P>
<P>
	At one site it didn't identify, the FTC said, children were  
asked to give their name, address, e-mail address, age and whether 
they ever received gifts of stocks, cash, savings bonds or 
certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
	Some sites included cartoon characters asking children for  
e-mail addresses. Others use games, contests and offers of free 
merchandise to entice children to give information about themselves 
and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore recently drew ridicule when he said in an interview that he  
helped create the Internet, a remark he later blamed on being 
tired. He has been a strong supporter of federal spending to boost 
technology.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Turn Lower; Dow Down 39.96 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned lower Tuesday as an earnings  
warning from Gillette put the brakes on Monday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 39.96 at 9,967.37. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed after trading lower through  
much of the morning. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 1.51 at 
1,322.63, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 
7.73 at 2,567.79. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Dow rose 174.82 points to close at 10,007.33, a  
new record that marked the index's second finish above 10,000. The 
Nasdaq and S&AMP;P 500 indexes also set new records, sustained by a 
rally in Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette, which said first-quarter profits will probably not  
meet Wall Street analysts' expectations, fell 6 13/16 today to 50 
15/16. The company's announcement sobered traders who had bid 
stocks higher Monday on expectations of strong first-quarter 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette's news also hurt other consumer products companies.  
Procter &AMP; Gamble, a component of the Dow, fell 1 1/2 to 99 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM rose today as the company unveiled a new version of its Web  
server, which allows companies to provide faster service on the 
Internet. IBM was up 1 3/16 at 185 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! was providing the Nasdaq Stock Market a boost today as  
traders sent its shares higher in advance of its earning report, 
due Wednesday. Many analysts believe the Web search engine company 
will surpass a First Call consensus estimate of 8 cents per share. 
Its shares were up 12 1/8 at 231 1/4 after rising 39 3/16 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers today by an 11-to-8  
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 341.5 
million shares, slightly ahead of Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was off 1.98 at 612.65, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.64 at 717.60.

<HEADLINE> Rodman, Actress Say Marriage is Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's back to the single life for Dennis  
Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	The eccentric basketball star and his actress wife, Carmen  
Electra, have decided to get a divorce after less than five months 
of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carmen Electra and Dennis Rodman have announced that they have  
mutually agreed to end their ... marriage under amicable 
circumstances,'' publicist Matt Labov said Tuesday, speaking for 
both parties. ``Divorce papers were filed today in Los Angeles on 
behalf of Miss Electra. Miss Electra and Mr. Rodman are and will 
remain friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, 37, and Electra, 26, were wed in Las Vegas on Nov. 14  
after what was reported to be an all-night bender. Nine days later, 
Rodman claimed he was of unsound mind when he recited his vows and 
filed for an annulment. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the actress, whose real name is Tara Patrick, was with  
Rodman at Planet Hollywood in nearby Beverly Hills in February when 
he announced he was going to join the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	During that news conference, Rodman said he and his wife were  
happily married, but living in separate homes, and Electra later 
attended several games to watch her husband play. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on March 13, Rodman received permission to leave the Lakers  
to resolve personal issues, and missed four games before rejoining 
the team in Orlando on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time NBA rebounding champion, who has helped teams win  
five NBA championships, insisted the eight-day break had nothing to 
do with drinking, gambling, smoking or marital problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman later stated it was Electra who encouraged him to return.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was an instant hit with fans when he joined the team,  
helping the Lakers win nine straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the team's play since he returned has been  
inconsistent. One of the lowest points came Saturday night when 
Rodman was ejected after picking up two technical fouls with 2:04 
remaining in an 81-76 loss to visiting Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman then grabbed 17 rebounds Monday night in a 117-104  
victory over Denver. Tuesday night, Rodman had 12 rebounds but did 
not score in a 106-93 loss to Utah.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Survivors Pick Up Pieces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON, La. (AP) -- They pulled out pictures, children's toys,  
old bowling trophies -- mementos of lives ripped apart by nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors of the tornado that tore through up to 300 buildings  
in northwest Louisiana began Monday trying to salvage the small, 
irreplaceable items strewn through the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't save much,'' William Hunter, 72, said of his trailer  
that was left in hundreds of pieces. ``We are just looking for 
things like pictures, family things. That's what really matters 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Hay Meadow Trailer Park, James Dyal had stacked up a  
few wet snapshots, a crumpled blouse, a box of Christmas ornaments 
-- all the things he could find of his mother, Betty, one of the six 
who died when the twister hit Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much of anything left,'' Dyal said. ``I'd like to  
find some more pictures, some of her things that we could keep, but 
it's soaked and scattered all over the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen people remained hospitalized Monday; eight were in  
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the misery, 4 to 6 inches of rain fell Sunday night,  
further soaking the remnants worth salvaging that the tornado had 
tossed into the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Sticky red mud sucked at workers' shoes. Grassy areas became  
mini-marshes as standing water turned the ground mushy, causing 
anyone crossing it to sink into the muck. 
</P>
<P>
	``My couch looked O.K. yesterday, but this new rain has ruined  
it,'' said Mildred Pryor, 46. ``I got a couple of antiques, things 
that my mother gave me. If that's all I can save, that's the most 
important things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Foster was here Monday to survey damage from the  
half-mile wide tornado that swept across a seven-mile stretch of 
Caddo Parish and 12 miles of Bossier Parish, both about 20 miles 
northwest of Shreveport. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Guard brought in front loaders, bulldozers, back  
hoes, dump trucks and troops to help with the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary estimates show $2 million to $4 million in damage to  
200 to 300 buildings, according to the Caddo-Bossier Office of 
Emergency Preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster has approved a state declaration of disaster and was  
expected to seek a federal disaster declaration, making residents 
eligible for financial assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to get much out of this mess,'' said Alvin  
Perryman, 60. ``But that's O.K. I don't have anywhere to take it.''

<HEADLINE> Health To Determine Elway's Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Having missed four games with various injuries  
last year, John Elway's health is playing a big factor as he tries 
to decide whether to retire or return for a 17th NFL season with 
the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is whether I can do it physically or not,''  
Elway said Tuesday while attending a news conference for golf's 
Celebrity Players Tour. ``I'm always going to want to play 
football, but the big question is whether I can do it physically, 
and that is what I go back and forth with all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been a football player all of my life and I'll die a  
football player, but at sometime you've got to start listening to 
your body. That's what I'm struggling with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, 38, said he has not set a deadline for his decision.  
Reports had said he would decide by April 5 -- Denver's first day of 
offseason conditioning -- or the April 17 NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where that came from,'' he said. ``I'm hoping it  
just pops in my head and when it does I'll tell you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway announced his decision to return for a 16th season last  
June. Injuries to his hamstring, back and ribs kept him out of four 
games and parts of two others in the first half of the season. But 
he was able to lead the Broncos to their second straight Super Bowl 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	The lure of a third championship has caused Elway to consider  
another encore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still enjoying the last (Super Bowl),'' he said. ``I'm  
enjoying my kids and enjoying a little bit of life, and I'm going 
to continue to do that for a while. I always believe the longer I'm 
going to take, the better off I'm going to be, and chances are the 
right decision I'm going to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway has little left to prove. He and Dan Marino are the only  
quarterbacks in NFL history to throw for 50,000 yards, and both are 
sure to be first-ballot selections for the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thinking about it all the time,'' Elway said. ``It goes  
back and forth all the time. I don't feel pressured to make the 
decision other than I feel bad that my teammates have to answer 
questions about it all the time.''

<HEADLINE> Wizards Fire Coach Bickerstaff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the underachieving Washington Wizards  
struggling to become a .500 team, general manager Wes Unseld 
decided ``it was just not working'' and fired his coach before the 
season was completely lost. 
</P>
<P>
	That happened two years ago. It also happened Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Unseld sent old friend Bernie Bickerstaff on his way with much  
the same words he used to dismiss Bickerstaff's predecessor, Jim 
Lynam. When Bickerstaff took over at the All-Star break in 1997, 
the team rallied to its first playoff appearance in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Unseld needs someone new to provide that same kind of spark  
to the 1999 Wizards, now 13-19 after back-to-back losses to Toronto 
and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just wasn't happening,'' Unseld said. ``And it didn't seem  
to change. With 18 games left and a chance to still be in this 
thing, I decided to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Jim Brovelli takes over as interim coach, but Unseld  
made it clear he has some candidates in mind and will start 
contacting them to try to fill the position before season's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can get the individual I am looking for, I will do that  
immediately, if possible,'' Unseld said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brovelli, 57, was 1-1 in his NBA head coaching debut earlier  
this season when Bickerstaff was out with the flu. He would not say 
whether he's interested in keeping the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it harder, because it's Bernie,'' said Brovelli, who  
worked with Bickerstaff at San Diego State and with the Denver 
Nuggets. ``He gave me the first opportunity to coach in the league. 
I'm going to miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards, who play host to the New Jersey Nets tonight,  
probably need to finish at least 13-5 to have a shot at the 
playoffs. Their backcourt of Mitch Richmond and Rod Strickland is 
one of the best and Juwan Howard is a top forward, but they lack a 
quality center and have shown a tendency to fall apart in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players said Bickerstaff's uptight demeanor made the  
atmosphere too tense, leading to nine losses in games they've led 
after the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, it did get tight a little bit,'' swingman  
Calbert Cheaney said. ``You tend not to play the way you're capable 
of playing when you're tight. In the fourth quarter, when it's time 
to make some buckets and try to win the game and you're tight, you 
can't win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff sometimes left players baffled with his novel player  
rotations. Several times this season he would play a starter for 
five minutes or so, then bench him the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys weren't very relaxed in their roles and weren't  
sure exactly what was expected of them on a nightly basis,'' guard 
Tim Legler said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the losses mounted, Bickerstaff admitted he wasn't able to  
coax his players into producing the hustle and desire necessary for 
a fourth-quarter victory. He also said his team simply wasn't as 
talented as some of the opponents, which didn't sit well with his 
players or Unseld. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a player, you don't like to read that,'' Legler said,  
``that your coach says you're not as good as another team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff's comment that ``Miami is a better team than we  
are'' after Sunday's 90-79 loss to the Heat might have clinched 
Unseld's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The personnel we have should be in the playoffs,'' Unseld  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff was in his 10th season as an NBA coach. His record  
was 338-348, including 77-71 with the Wizards. He began his 
coaching career in Washington in 1973, serving as an assistant 
until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Unseld, who played for Washington in the 1970s, lured  
Bickerstaff from his job as general manager of the Denver Nuggets 
in 1997 season. The Wizards made the playoffs that year, but were 
eliminated on the final day last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff's best showing as a coach was in 1987, when he led  
Seattle to the Western Conference finals, one of three postseason 
appearances with the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff's dismissal is the NBA's fourth coaching change this  
season, following Del Harris (Lakers), Dave Cowens (Charlotte) and 
John Calipari (New Jersey).

<HEADLINE> Missing Kentucky Derby Trophy Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- More than two decades after his 1961  
Kentucky Derby trophy was stolen from his home, jockey John Sellers 
may soon get his treasure back. 
</P>
<P>
	The engraved sterling silver trophy that Sellers won aboard  
Carry Back was among a dozen trophies stolen when his Monrovia, 
Calif., home was burglarized in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers, 62, now living in Hallandale, Fla., was stunned to  
learn from a friend last week that his cherished trophy was up for 
sale on the Internet auction site eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd see any of them again,'' Sellers said in  
The Trentonian newspaper Tuesday. ``I was absolutely shocked. I 
couldn't believe it. I had just assumed that all my trophies were 
melted down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trophy was offered for sale with a $4,500 reserve by Sue and  
Lou Novello of Sudbury, Mass. Novello told the newspaper she 
obtained the trophy legally at a California auction, but planned to 
return it to Sellers after she notified her brother and business 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most unbelievable story I have ever heard,'' she  
wrote in an e-mail quoted by The Trentonian. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers said if he gets his Derby trophy back, he plans to give  
it to his son, John Jr. Sellers also won the 1961 Preakness aboard 
Carry Back and the 1965 Belmont Stakes on Hail to All.

<HEADLINE> Magician Buried Alive in Trick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A 25-year-old magician was buried alive Monday  
in a see-through coffin where he vowed to remain for a week in a 
stunt first dreamed up by legendary escape artist Harry Houdini. 
</P>
<P>
	Magician David Blaine said he prepared for the stunt by learning  
to put himself into a deep trancelike state. He said he also spent 
four days a week living in a coffin in his living room. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a trick. It's not an escape. It's not an illusion,''  
Blaine said. ``It's kind of like a test of one's own will.'' He 
said he would use the time to explore his mind. ``I'm going to 
learn a lot about myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houdini died in 1926 before he could perform the stunt.  
</P>
<P>
	Blaine, a goateed magician known for his levitating and  
sleight-of-hand tricks, has a network television special scheduled 
for next Monday -- the day he is scheduled to be dug up from 6 feet 
under. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the coffin, Blaine will have no food and 3 to 4  
tablespoons of water a day. Fresh air will be pumped in. Blaine 
said he fasted for six days before being buried, and a plastic 
container and tube will take care of the remaining necessities of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll have 6 inches of head room and 2 inches on each side. On  
top of the coffin sits a three-ton water-filled tank. Visitors can 
look through the tank's water to get a glimpse of Blaine lying in 
his coffin. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a panic button in case of an emergency, a crane to  
quickly remove the water tank, and round-the-clock medical 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's crazy,'' said Holly Reich, who was among the  
throng near the Hudson River watching the ``burial'' -- which was 
strange even by New York standards. ``I mean, how morose is this? 
Yet I can't seem to turn away.''

<HEADLINE> Report Urges Cancer-Care Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eight million Americans require some form of  
cancer care each year, but too many are not getting the best 
treatment, says a report issued Tuesday that suggests creation of a 
national system to assess the quality of cancer care. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all shocked at how little information is available on  
that topic,'' said Dr. Joseph Simone of the University of Utah, 
co-author of the National Cancer Policy Board report. 
</P>
<P>
	Until there is a system to help patients assess whether they're  
getting optimal care, the report offered some general advice: 
</P>
<P>
	--There are no data on whether most cancer patients should go to  
a high-volume cancer center instead of a smaller hospital near 
home. But for complicated and high-risk surgeries, such as for 
pancreatic cancer or the removal of the esophagus or pelvic organs, 
and for complicated chemotherapy regimens, patients should seek out 
hospitals that perform the highest numbers of such procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Post-surgical mortality for those complex cases can be two to  
three times higher at hospitals that treat only a few such patients 
a year. Yet the National Cancer Policy Board report found that 
between one-quarter and one-half of surgeries for pancreatic 
cancer, one of the disease's deadliest forms, are performed at 
inexperienced hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	--All patients should find oncologists experienced in their  
particular form and stage of cancer. A woman with Stage III breast 
cancer, for instance, should specifically ask how many Stage III 
breast cancer patients the doctor has treated. 
</P>
<P>
	--Patients should be given all treatment options before planning  
a clear approach to therapy. A single doctor should then coordinate 
and interpret the care patients will need from multiple physicians. 
It's typical to get radiation at one site, tests at another, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Cancer Policy Board was created by the Institute of  
Medicine and the National Research Council, independent 
organizations that advise the government. Tuesday's report lays out 
the problem, and the board will meet later this year to plan 
solutions with agencies like the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a complex and probably formidable task, but we intend  
to pursue this with vigor,'' said Simone. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the difficulty? Cancer consists of 100 different diseases  
requiring different treatments depending on their stage of 
progression. But programs that count cancer incidence and deaths 
often don't record the patient's disease stage or type of 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``So if a patient has a bad outcome, is it just bad luck or is  
it because they got inappropriate care?'' Simone asked. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no way to ensure that doctors implement the latest  
cancer guidelines. Physicians sometimes even order too few cancer 
screening tests, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Take breast cancer, where early detection and treatment is  
well-known to be lifesaving. More is known about the quality of 
breast cancer care than any other cancer, the report said, yet 
studies show some doctors don't push patients to get regular 
mammograms, perform inadequate biopsies and underuse radiation or 
chemotherapy after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem may be financial: 7 percent of newly  
diagnosed cancer patients lack insurance, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem is poor pain treatment, especially in terminal  
patients. Doctors need to be better educated in pain management, 
Simone said, realizing that ``the vast majority of patients need 
not suffer.''

<HEADLINE> US Finds Stainless Steel Is Dumped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is one step away from  
slapping punitive tariffs on a type of stainless steel from Japan, 
Spain and four other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has found those countries illegally  
price stainless round wire in the United States. It will impose 
tariffs of up to 36 percent if an independent agency finds that the 
pricing practices hurt or could injure American producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission is expected to rule by  
mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased,'' said George Kurisky, chairman of the  
U.S. Stainless Wire Action Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department ruling Monday represents the latest in a  
string of victories for the U.S. steel industry, which has yet to 
lose a key ruling in trade complaints filed to combat low-priced 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Those successes, however, have made it more difficult for  
domestic producers to put foreign steel products under quotas or 
impose stronger sanctions to fend off imports blamed for thousands 
of layoffs and bankruptcies at some U.S. companies. Administration 
officials cite the favorable rulings as evidence the normal 
administrative process works. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, 10 U.S. manufacturers sought tariffs after accusing  
Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Spain and Taiwan of dumping 
round wire in the U.S. market at prices below production costs or 
home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Stainless steel round wire is used to produce springs, wire rope  
and fasteners in construction and other applications. It represents 
a small portion of the overall steel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	A crucial decision covering the most common steel product,  
hot-rolled carbon steel, is due this month. The Commerce Department 
already has found evidence of dumping by Japan, Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and Brazil face steel tariffs in the hot-rolled case,  
while Russia has agreed to curb exports to avoid similar tariffs. A 
U.S. comment period for implementing the Russian agreement closed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On stainless round wire, tariffs proposed by the Commerce  
Department ranged from 3 percent for exports from South Korea to 36 
percent for shipments made by Spain's main producer. Japanese round 
wire could be subject to tariffs of up to 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stainless steel round wire is a $300 million-a-year domestic  
industry, and imports add another $100 million, industry officials 
said. Shipments from the six countries under Commerce Department 
scrutiny account for one-third of all imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The government already has imposed tariffs on stainless wire  
rod, the precursor to round wire, and has found six countries 
guilty of dumping stainless plates in coils, which could lead to 
more tariffs if injury is proven. Other complaints are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases acted on Monday were filed by ACS Industries Inc. of  
Woonsocket, R.I.; Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. of Dunkirk, N.Y.; 
Branford Wire &AMP; Manufacturing Co. of Mountain Home, N.C.; Carpenter 
Technology Corp. of Reading, Pa.; Handy &AMP; Herman Specialty Wire 
Group of Cockeysville, Md.; Industrial Alloys Inc. of Pomona, 
Calif.; Loos &AMP; Co. Inc. of Pomfret, Conn.; Sandvik Steel Co. of 
Clarks Summit, Pa.; Sumiden Wire Products Corp. of Stockton, 
Calif.; and Techalloy Co. Inc. of Mahwah, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Recalls Butane Lighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is recalling about 1  
million Ozark Trail butane utility lighters because some had 
cracked fuel cylinders that can allow butane to leak and ignite, 
the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-inch long lighters, which have a black plastic handle and  
a red trigger, can continue to burn after the trigger is released. 
The lighters sometimes flare or produce an unsteady flame, 
according to the CPSC. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart of Bentonville, Ark., has received two reports of these  
lighters leaking fuel, which ignited and singed the user's facial 
and arm hair. There have been no reports of serious injuries or 
property damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The lighters have model number HH-133 written on the packaging.  
They were sold in Wal-Mart stores nationwide from August 1997 
through March 1999 for $2. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should stop using the recalled lighters immediately  
and return them to Wal-Mart for a refund. Consumers can also call 
the company for more information at 1-800-WAL-MART between 8 a.m. 
and 10 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. Saturday and 
2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Sunday, EDT.

<HEADLINE> Cabela Catalog Firm Goes Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Dick Cabela started a small business from his  
kitchen table 38 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, that business has grown into one of the nation's largest  
catalog retailers, with an estimated $420 million in mail-order and 
Internet sales of outdoor sporting goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabela's, based in the western Nebraska town of Sidney, ships  
more than 60 million seasonal and specialty catalogs annually to 
all 50 states and 120 countries. It even has its own 30-minute fall 
outdoor show on Saturday mornings on ESPN, ``Cabela's Sportsman's 
Quest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It started out to be just a hobby,'' said Cabela's wife, Mary,  
who helped get the business started from the family kitchen in 
1961. ``I remember Dick went to Chicago to buy furniture with his 
dad. When he came home we celebrated with 25 orders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The son of a hardware and furniture store owner, Cabela had  
traveled to a trade show in Chicago to buy furniture for his 
family's store in Chappell. He spotted some Japanese fishing lures 
-- and he got hooked on the idea of starting his own business. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were awfully cheap -- 1 1/2 cents apiece,'' recalled the  
62-year-old Cabela, who is chairman of Cabela's. ``We bought 20 
gross, about 120 bucks. We got to selling 'em. It was just one of 
those kind of dumb things you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One classified ad in a Casper, Wyo., newspaper promising 12  
hand-tied flies for $1 got only one bite. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he began offering five hand-tied flies free -- with 25 cents  
for postage and handling. First-class stamps then cost 6 cents, so 
the Cabelas made 11 cents on every sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``That ad really clicked,'' Cabela said. ``We ran the ads in  
Field and Stream, those kind of magazines. Some would tape 25 
pennies in their replies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pouring those pennies back into the enterprise, the Cabelas  
began collecting more Japanese imported fishing gear, primarily 
fishing rods and tackle. By 1962, a small shed in their backyard in 
Chappell became Cabela's first warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, mimeographed sheets mailed to customers became small  
catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Owned by the family, Cabela's declines to release financial  
data. But trade magazine Catalog Age of Stamford, Conn., put 
Cabela's catalog and Internet sales at about $420 million in 1997, 
ranking it 29th in the country for companies that make print 
catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabela's was one of just 46 U.S. companies that had $250 million  
or more in revenue from catalog and Internet transactions out of 
more than 8,000 companies issuing print catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're pretty big,'' Catalog Age editorial director Laura  
Beaudry said of Cabela's. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sells a wide variety of clothing and gear for  
outdoor sports such as fishing, hunting, camping and boating. Some 
of the items are designed and manufactured to Cabela's 
specifications; others are made by brand-name companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabela says running his own business came naturally to him.  
</P>
<P>
	``You grow up in a family like that, a family of merchants, that  
is what you do,'' he said. ``I never thought I would do anything 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cabela grew up in a close-knit family of two girls and four boys  
in the high plains of western Nebraska. He and his brothers and 
sisters hunted rabbits in the backyard on the edge of Chappell. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabela still enjoys that hobby. He and his wife have hunted  
around the world and stock their stores with full-mounted 
elephants, lions, leopards and varieties of antelope. 
</P>
<P>
	During the early days of his business, Cabela worked at the  
furniture store during the day, while his wife, who grew up in 
Casper, Wyo., cared for their growing family. They have nine 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	At night, the couple packed merchandise and prepared ads at the  
kitchen table until 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very, very busy years, but they also were a lot of  
fun,'' said Mrs. Cabela, 61. ``Building a company is fun, 
especially when you work together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cabela's younger brother, Jim, joined the enterprise in 1963. He  
is now the company president and works with the merchants, while 
Dick works with marketing and finance. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years after those mimeographed sheets first turned into a  
small catalog, Dick Cabela began working full-time at his 
mail-order company. He moved the business to an old American Legion 
Hall in Chappell and included a small retail display. In 1968, he 
moved the business and his family 25 miles west to the larger town 
of Sidney, where it was easier to find employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabela's is now a major employer in Sidney, a town of 6,000,  
with more than 700 people working at its headquarters and store. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a visible force here in Sidney,'' said Mayor Suzanne  
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1 million visitors come each year to the Sidney flagship  
store, making it one of Nebraska's top attractions -- complete with 
a 27-foot-tall replica mountain covered with 40 lifelike game 
trophies and a waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
	People from all over the country camp overnight in the parking  
lot -- which has a special area for recreational vehicles and 
trailers with water-service hookups -- to shop the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabela's four retail stores in Nebraska, Minnesota and Wisconsin  
are extravagant tributes to the great outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
	The 150,000-square-foot store in Owatonna, Minn., includes  
mounted African wildlife, a 35-foot-high mountain with North 
American game trophies and huge aquariums stocked with native 
Minnesota fish. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to make our stores sort of like a natural history  
museum,'' Cabela said. ``It makes us more like a tourist attraction 
than just a plain store.''

<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Governor. Presidential hopeful. Now  
baseball play-by-play guy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush squeezed into the broadcasting booth Monday  
at The Ballpark to share a little color at the Texas Rangers' 
season opener against the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a former co-owner of the American League baseball team who  
is considering a Republican run for president, watched the team he 
once helped guide fall in an 11-5 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I follow the Rangers pretty closely,'' Bush said.  
</P>
<P>
	By the fourth inning, the governor has slipped into the Rangers'  
TV booth and joined announcers Bill Jones and Tom Grieve. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the booth hoping Texas would bounce back from a 8-0  
deficit. ``Particularly if I'm not at the mike,'' Bush quipped.

<HEADLINE> Magic Announces Music Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Magic Johnson's fast break into the  
music arena may have been just too quick. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release last week, the former Los Angeles Lakers star  
announced his new venture, Magic Johnson Music Management. One of 
its first signings was the soul R&AMP;B group Boyz II Men. 
</P>
<P>
	That was news to Nathan Morris, one of the founders of the  
Grammy-winning group from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris countered with his own news release, saying Boyz II Men  
``have not and will not be signing a management deal with Magic 
Johnson Management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The band was sticking with the manager it had -- Quadree El-Amin  
of Southpaw Entertainment, Morris said. The original news release 
said El-Amin was joining MJM. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were shocked and upset to recently learn that the members  
of Boyz II Men had not been counseled and were not aware of their 
current management's intentions, and hope that we have not caused 
them any problems or embarrassment,'' MJM director Phil Robinson 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left for El-Amin were not returned Monday.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sharply Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology issues propelled the stock market  
sharply higher Tuesday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average 
back above 10,000, as the outlook for interest rates improved. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally also sent the Nasdaq composite index into record  
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was up 178.16 at 10,010.67,  
trading above its high close of 10,006.78, set last Monday. The 
markets were closed on Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq index was up 49.41 at 2,542.78, beating its record  
close of 2,510.09 reached Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher.  
</P>
<P>
	Traders had their first chance to react to Friday's Labor  
Department report that just 46,000 new jobs were created in 
February, the smallest increase in three years. The news calmed 
investor fears that the economy was growing too fast and that the 
Federal Reserve might raise interest rates to slow it down. The 
report also said the unemployment rate fell to a 29-year low of 4.2 
percent as wages rose less than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks once again set the tone for trading.  
</P>
<P>
	Among Dow stocks, IBM was up 5 1/8 to 182 1/8 and Hewlett-Packard rose  
4 to 71 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! shot up 28 1/4 to 208 as traders anticipated a strong  
earnings report from the Internet company on Wednesday. Computer 
maker Dell was up 2 3/4 at 43 15/16, Sun Microsystems gained 4 1/16 to 
130 1/4, and Microsoft was up 2 3/16 at 94 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Online trading companies also traded higher after a Credit  
Suisse First Boston analyst issued positive comments about the 
sector. E-Trade Group rose 8 1/4 to 69 1/8. Charles Schwab rose 5 3/4 to 
100. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 24.01 at 1,317.73.  
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 472.2 million shares, 
down from Thursday's 480.9 million.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Salaries Up 19 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The biggest escalation in seven years pushed  
baseball's average salary above $1.7 million on opening day, 
according to a study by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore outfielder Albert Belle was the highest-paid player on  
opening day for the third straight season, earning $11,949,794. 
Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez was second at $11 million, followed 
by Los Angeles pitcher Kevin Brown ($10,714,286) and Atlanta 
pitcher Greg Maddux ($10.6 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire, last season's star with a record 70 homers, was  
11th at $8,333,333. Sammy Sosa, who chased McGwire all summer long 
and finished with 66 homers, was tied for ninth at $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series champion New York Yankees opened with  
baseball's highest payroll ever, $85.1 million -- an average of 
$3.04 million per player. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles was second at $79.2 million, followed by Baltimore  
($78.5 million), Texas ($74.9 million), Atlanta ($73.5 million) and 
Cleveland ($68.9 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona moved up from 21st at $31.6 million at the end of last  
season to seventh at $65.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end were three teams below $20 million: Montreal  
was last at $17.3 million, Florida was 29th at $18.8 million and 
Minnesota was 28th at $19.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The average salary of $1,720,050, easily a record, was up 19.3  
percent over last year's opening-day average of $1,441,406, 
according to the AP study, which examined the contracts of 830 
players on opening-day rosters and the disabled list. It was nearly 
five times the 4.2 percent rise prior to last season and the 
largest increase since a 21.7 percent rise prior to the 1992 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	With an increase of 16.3 percent next year, the average would  
top $2 million for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, the NBA's average is about $2.8 million this  
season, the NHL's is $1.17 million (using a mixture of U.S. and 
Canadian dollars), and the NFL's is $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been going through all those over the past few months,  
but I want to see the final numbers before I make any judgments,'' 
commissioner Bud Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	An indication of why small and middle markets no longer can  
compete can be seen at the top of the salary scale. The number of 
players earning $8 million or higher more than doubled from 10 to 
23, while the total at $9 million or more tripled from three to 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of players at $1 million or more rose from 317 to 348  
and the percentage of millionaires in the majors rose from 37.7 
percent to 41.9. The number at $2 million or higher rose from 216 
to 254, and $4 million players shot up from 98 to 128. The $5 
million club swelled from 63 to 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles and the New York Mets each had the most millionaires  
at 18, with Baltimore, Boston and the New York Yankees at 17. 
Florida had the fewest with four, the Chicago White Sox had five, 
and Kansas City, Minnesota and Montreal had six each. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap between the top and bottom decreased somewhat this year.  
The Yankees' payroll was 5 1/2 times that of Montreal; last year, when 
Baltimore had the highest payroll, the Orioles' spent 7 1/2 times more 
than the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	Total payroll rose from $1.21 billion to $1.43 billion. The  
median salary -- the point at which an equal number of players are 
above and below -- rose from $500,000 to a record $700,000. It 
dropped to $275,000 in 1995 following the end of the 7 1/2-month 
strike before resuming its rise. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 68 players at the $200,000 minimum, which is higher  
than the average prior to 1982. Last year, there were 66 at the 
minimum -- then $170,000 -- on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	In reality, the amount the Yankees are spending on players this  
year is more than $91.4 million because their payroll doesn't 
include the $2.5 million salary of Darryl Strawberry, who is on a 
minor league roster; $2.5 million they are paying toward the salary 
of Oakland pitcher Kenny Rogers; $500,000 they are paying Minnesota 
as part of last year's Chuck Knoblauch trade; $800,000 they are 
paying released infielder Dale Sveum; plus money they are paying 
Arizona as part of last month's Darren Holmes trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The listed salary includes a player's 1999 salary plus a  
prorated share of any signing bonus or guaranteed income not 
attributed to a specific year. Contract figures were obtained by 
the AP from various player and management sources. 
</P>
<P>
	A different method of calculation is used by baseball to  
determine the luxury tax. That method, which uses the average 
annual value of contracts and is based on 40-man rosters, has the 
Dodgers with the highest payroll, followed by the Orioles and 
Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger Asked To Be on IOC Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and  
former Los Angeles Olympics chief Peter Ueberroth have been picked 
for a panel to restructure the IOC in the wake of its worst 
scandal, Olympic sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch  
chose Kissinger and Ueberroth among four Americans for IOC 2000, 
created to help clean up after the Salt Lake City bribery case, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also tapped by Samaranch was IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz,  
said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment of U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl to  
the commission was announced last month. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not known if Kissinger, Ueberroth or DeFrantz had  
accepted their appointments. All were traveling Tuesday and 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Such prominent individuals could help convince critics from  
corporate suites to Capitol Hill that the IOC is serious about 
changing its privileged ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger's appointment brought immediate praise from the IOC's  
harshest congressional critic, Sen. John McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is pleased to see the appointment of someone of Dr.  
Kissinger's stature,'' said Pia Pialorsi, a spokeswoman for the 
Arizona Republican whose Commerce Committee has scheduled hearings 
on the Olympic scandal next week.

<HEADLINE> Feds Hire Law Firm for Tobacco Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is getting some outside  
help in preparing a federal tobacco lawsuit from a Minneapolis law 
firm that helped Minnesota obtain a $6.6 billion settlement from 
the industry last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm of Robins, Kaplan, Miller &AMP; Ciresi will advise and  
assist Justice Department lawyers through June 30 at the 
substantially reduced rate of $75 per hour plus travel costs and 
expenses, Acting Assistant Attorney General David W. Ogden, head of 
the department's tobacco litigation task force, announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In this year's State of the Union speech, President Clinton  
announced that the government had decided to sue the industry to 
recover money paid by federal health-insurance programs for 
treatment of tobacco-related illnesses. The Justice Department has 
requested $20 million from Congress in the fiscal year beginning 
next Oct. 1 to pay for 40 government lawyers to work on the case 
and for $5 million for expert witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract with the Minneapolis law firm runs through June 30  
and sets a maximum payment of $81,760 through that date. The 
government said it could be extended if both parties agree. 
</P>
<P>
	The department emphasized the contract specifies only consulting  
services and does not contemplate any contingent fee payment to the 
law firm based on potential payments the industry might either 
agree or be ordered to make. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least for the foreseeable future, the litigation team  
itself will consist exclusively of Justice Department attorneys,'' 
Ogden said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the law firm was not immediately able to say  
how many lawyers the firm intends to devote to advising the 
government and what the firm's normal hourly rate for such business 
would be. Large firms often charge business clients several hundred 
dollars an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Robins, Kaplan, Miller &AMP; Ciresi represented the state of  
Minnesota and Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Minnesota in their lawsuit 
against the tobacco industry. As a result of the lawsuit and near 
the end of the trial, the tobacco industry agreed May 8, 1998, to 
pay $6.6 billion to Minnesota's citizens and to submit to cigarette 
marketing and advertising curbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robins, Kaplan, Miller &AMP; Ciresi is widely recognized for its  
success in the Minnesota litigation against the tobacco industry 
and for its expertise in this area of litigation,'' Ogden said. 
``They have devoted thousands of hours to uncovering and learning 
the facts relating to tobacco litigation. Their extraordinary 
experience in this area will be very valuable to the department's 
tobacco litigation team as we prepare a plan to recover federal 
health care expenditures from the tobacco industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Department officials said they were particularly interested in  
tapping the law firm's knowledge of the 200,000 pages of industry 
documents that were disclosed during the discovery process of the 
Minnesota lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior department official, requesting anonymity, has said the  
government's lawsuit or lawsuits will be tort claims against the 
tobacco companies, possibly alleging fraud, negligence or breach of 
a special duty to provide the government all information on health 
effects of their product. Torts is the legal name for injuries 
against people or properties.

	Yugoslavia Declares Cease-Fire  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav leadership today  
declared a unilateral cease-fire in their battle against rebels in 
Kosovo to mark Orthodox Easter, hours after the most intensive 
night of NATO air raids across Yugoslavia. Western officials 
quickly rejected the offer. It was unclear if the cease-fire would 
continue past the holiday Sunday, but NATO and U.S. officials had 
been expecting a cease-fire offering. President Clinton said 
Yugoslav President Milosevic could end the airstrikes by 
withdrawing his forces from Kosovo, accepting terms of a peace 
accord and allowing hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians to 
return home. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. To Aid Refugees  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is expected to  
announce that it will accept up to 20,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees 
and house them at the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
Today, 1,200 Marines aboard ships in the Aegean Sea began moving 
ashore at a Greek port and will establish a refugee camp for 
displaced Kosovars near the Macedonian village of Cegrane, a U.S. 
defense official said. The official said the Marines soon will be 
providing food, water, medical services and shelter to thousands of 
refugees.

	Clinton Wants Hate-Law Expansion  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Decrying ``the persistence of old, even  
primitive hatreds,'' President Clinton today asked Congress to 
expand federal hate crime laws to include offenses based on sexual 
orientation. The president also directed the departments of 
Education and Justice to collect and periodically publish data on 
hate crimes at colleges, including crime statistics as well as 
surveys on students' racial attitudes. Clinton said Americans 
should resist destructive, biased attitudes because they imperil 
the country's future.

	CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Two Libyan suspects in the 1988  
Pan Am jet bombing were arraigned by Scottish authorities at a 
deserted U.S. airbase today. Suspected former intelligence agents 
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah were 
fingerprinted, photographed and gave DNA samples one day after 
Libya surrendered them for trial. The two men were then arraigned 
on charges contained in a 1991 U.S.-British indictment accusing 
them of planting the bomb that ripped apart Flight 103 over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988. The attack killed 270 
people.

	Report Eyes Cancer Care System  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Too many Americans with cancer are not getting  
the best care, largely because there's no way to know where to turn 
for the best treatment, said a report today that recommended a 
national system to assess quality cancer care. ``We were all 
shocked at how little information is available on that topic,'' 
said Dr. Joseph Simone of the University of Utah, co-author of the 
National Cancer Policy Board report. The report offered patients 
some advice until a systematic way can be developed to assess 
quality care.

it had taken on a musty odor. Police say the dancers at an Erie

<HEADLINE> Concealed Gun Issue Losing in Mo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri voters decided Tuesday  
whether to lift a concealed-weapons ban dating to the days of Jesse 
James. 
</P>
<P>
	With 15 percent of the vote counted, the secretary of state's  
office said Proposition B was failing 53 percent to 47 percent, 
with 138,135 ``no'' votes and 124,940 voting `yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote marked the first time a state has put the question of  
concealed weapons to the voters. Thirty-one other states allow 
citizens to carry concealed guns, but those measures were enacted 
by legislators. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition B resulted from failed yearly attempts by pro-gun  
lawmakers to pass a concealed-weapons law against a threatened veto 
by Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association almost singlehandedly bankrolled  
the campaign for Proposition B -- providing more than $3.7 million, 
well over 95 percent of the money behind the measure -- in what was 
viewed as an important test of gun sentiment in the heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since this is the first time it's ever been put to a vote,  
both sides on this issue are going to learn a tremendous amount,'' 
said Fred Myers, a leader of the Proposition B campaign. ``This 
will be a race that political scientists and pundits will mull for 
years, because it's breaking such new ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said allowing law-abiding people to pack guns would  
keep the criminals guessing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The honest people of this state need to be able to defend  
themselves while going from their homes to their businesses,'' Greg 
Jeffrey, a spokesman for the Proposition B campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The other side received just one-fourth the funding but had help  
from Hillary Rodham Clinton, who recorded a telemarketing message 
targeted at women. The first lady said Proposition B is ``just too 
dangerous for Missouri families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch was among the law  
enforcement officers who feared the measure would court trouble: 
``We don't want to be going back to the old Wild West days with 
everyone wearing a gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James, the Wild West's most notorious outlaw, was a native of  
Kearney. Missouri banned concealed weapons in a crackdown on 
gunslinging in 1875, seven years before James was shot to death in 
St. Joseph, Mo., by a member of his gang. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Proposition B, state residents will need a second permit  
to carry a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Applicants will have to undergo criminal and mental health  
background checks, take at least 12 hours of state-approved 
training and have no violent offenses on their records for at least 
five years.

<HEADLINE> New Patriots' Stadium Cost Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- State officials have tacked on another $6  
million to the estimated cost of the New England Patriots football 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	They claim the expenses were expected and have been worked into  
the project's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody understood all along that the cost was going  
to be about the $380 million figure, not the $374 million,'' said 
Marc Ryan, the governor's budget chief. ``This project is not going 
up in cost by any means. This is just recognizing those last few 
costs that were out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state's Finance Advisory Committee, composed of Gov. John G.  
Rowland, the state comptroller, state treasurer and legislative 
leaders, agreed Friday to take an additional $2 million in state 
surplus money for the stadium project. 
</P>
<P>
	About $600,000 of that money will be used for the stadium's  
environmental impact study, a state-mandated comprehensive 
investigation that began in February to determine the stadium's 
potential social, economic and environmental effect on Hartford. 
The balance, about $1.4 million, will pay legal fees incurred by 
the state in drafting the stadium legislation and negotiating the 
stadium development and relocation agreement with the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending is in addition to the $374 million the legislature  
authorized in December to pay for a stadium on Hartford's 
riverfront. It joins another $5.5 million in state budget surplus 
that has been set aside through the next two years to pay for 
stadium ``soft costs,'' such as legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	No one will know the value of the final bill until the  
68,000-seat stadium opens in 2002. Ryan said the state has 
earmarked $107.5 million in surplus, to go along with $274 million 
in state bonds, to finance the project. 
</P>
<P>
	The state will be protected from construction-specific cost  
increases, he said, because the Patriots must pay any cost overruns 
past $280 million in the actual construction of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Other costs associated with the project include $55 million for  
environmental cleanup work and infrastructure improvements such as 
relocation of sewer and water lines; $24 million for inflation; and 
$15 million for a new training facility for the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	Between mid-November and early February, the state incurred more  
than $800,000 in legal fees from two law firms working on those 
projects.

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- George Jones returned to the hospital on  
Tuesday so doctors could monitor an irregular heartbeat.

<P>
	Jones, 67, spent two weeks at Vanderbilt University Medical  
Center after nearly dying March 6 when he smashed his vehicle into

<HEADLINE> McDougal Trial Coming To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The federal judge presiding over the  
trial of Whitewater figure Susan McDougal is poised to instruct the 
jury that she, not special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, is the only 
one on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	That reminder, drafted on Tuesday, may come as a surprise to  
jurors who have listened to a full month of attacks on Starr by 
Mrs. McDougal and her lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office, the jury has been told time and time again, was  
out to ``get'' President Clinton and his wife and wanted Mrs. 
McDougal to falsely implicate them in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. said Tuesday, however,  
that in deciding the criminal contempt charges, jurors cannot 
consider evidence that prosecutors wanted something other than Mrs. 
McDougal's truthful testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury may consider her accusations against Starr only on the  
companion obstruction of justice charge, the judge added. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury instructions, which the judge reduced to writing on  
Tuesday, were to be delivered after closing arguments, which were 
beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were pleased overall'' with the instructions, Associate  
Independent Counsel Mark Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, the Clintons' former business partner in the  
Whitewater real estate venture, was indicted after she refused on 
two occasions to answer grand jury questions about the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett said the prosecution was able to block a defense request  
for an instruction that jurors could acquit Mrs. McDougal of 
criminal contempt if she proved she had ``just cause'' to refuse to 
answer the grand jury questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Harris, Mrs. McDougal's fiance and co-counsel for the  
defense, had a matter-of-fact response. ``Some of them we got. Some 
of them we didn't,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris pointed out that, according to the jury instructions,  
jurors will have to find that Mrs. McDougal ``willfully'' refused 
to answer the questions to find her guilty of criminal contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have heard evidence that the defendant believed that  
certain prosecutors wanted something other than her truthful 
testimony,'' Howard wrote in his instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This evidence should be considered by you only when  
considering ... the obstruction of justice charge,'' the judge 
wrote. ``You are not to consider this evidence when considering'' 
the contempt charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Another instruction says ``the law does not recognize as a  
defense to these charges that the defendant was motivated to commit 
her acts by sincere moral, political or religious convictions.''

<HEADLINE> Safety Panel May Fine Navy Builder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Federal safety regulators are accusing a  
major shipbuilder for the Navy of hundreds of workplace safety 
violations, the most serious involving inadequate measures to 
protect workers from falls. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale Industries Inc. could face $537,000 in fines for the  
437 violations alleged Monday by the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to contest the citations, saying it was the  
target of a biased investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	OSHA acted after complaints by the Metal Trades Council of the  
AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past six years, Avondale has refused to recognize a  
collective bargaining election held by the Metal Trades Council. 
The company is challenging the results of that election in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The citations were issued by OSHA following a six-month  
investigation at Avondale's yard, one of Louisiana's largest 
employers with about 6,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The most serious allegations involved federal standards for  
scaffolding, guard rails, inadequate fall protection devices, 
openings in the decks of ships and inadequate training for 
employees in the use of fall protection equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Labor Secretary Charles Jeffress said that of the  
seven deaths at Avondale since 1990, three involved falls. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale attorney Horace A. ``Topper'' Thompson said OSHA's team  
leader on the inspection ``had the same agenda'' as the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Union spokeswoman Lane Windham said Avondale ``will duck and  
dodge and drag their feet whenever they are held accountable for 
how they treat their workers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to pay this fine immediately and make their yard  
safer today,'' Windham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Windham called on the Navy to put pressure on Avondale to  
upgrade its safety.

<HEADLINE> Isaac Stern Gives Violin Classes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- Violinist Isaac Stern, making his first  
visit to Germany, opened a seminar Tuesday for young musicians at 
the Cologne music school. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern, who is Jewish, had vowed never to visit Germany out of  
respect to the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he changed his mind because he felt it was time to see  
the country of Bach, Beethoven and Mendelssohn, which he's been 
doing by traveling around Germany since he arrived a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The virtuoso also wanted to see and hear how young German  
musicians are absorbing their musical heritage, as well as to pass 
on his own experience by teaching a nine-day seminar for 28 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Prominent in Stern's thoughts was the connection between art and  
politics, not only because of his feelings about Germany's history 
but also because of the war in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to teach them that they, as musicians, must live and  
play at the same time,'' he said of his seminar. ``Our 
responsibility is to continue the search for beauty and humanity. 
That is what survives.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Richardson To Stay at DePaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Quentin Richardson says the NBA can wait.  
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, Conference USA's player of the year as a freshman,  
is returning to DePaul for at least one more season. 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates are relieved, his coach is pleased, the family  
that was mostly responsible for his decision is at peace, and 
Richardson is now a happy 18-year-old who can still some day make a 
big payday in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was basically a decision on whether I needed to be able to  
take care of my family,'' a smiling Richardson said at a news 
conference Monday. ``I asked them were we hurting that bad? My 
father, my sister and my step mom all said, `No, they would be 
fine, it could wait.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's father, Lee, has worked as a motorman with the  
Chicago Transit Authority for 32 years. At age 56 he wasn't ready 
to retire and he wanted his son to work on his education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always told him I wanted him to stay in school,'' Lee  
Richardson said. ``He has always told me that he wanted me to 
retire, but I told him `Hey, I'll be all right.' If he left it up 
to me, I'd want him to do all four. All four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DePaul coach Pat Kennedy and Richardson's sister, Rochelle,  
talked with several NBA general managers and scouts, seeking input 
to gauge where Richardson might be taken if he declared for the 
draft this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson was projected as a middle to late first-round pick  
where he could probably get a salary of about $900,000. Most 
advised staying in school to work on his game and improve his draft 
positioning. That could, in turn, bring a larger contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to give him the chance to sit down and weigh out  
whether he was really prepared to do this. We wanted him to be at 
the top of his game when he does it,'' Rochelle Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a financial hardship. We just wanted to do what is  
best for him, as well as academically and as a business decision. 
It was not a good idea to let him get out and get locked into a 
contract and not get the (playing) time that would be advantageous 
to his future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's decision will certainly help DePaul as it tries to  
rebuild a national reputation. His return should mean more 
victories, more fans in the stands and more publicity that will aid 
recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy had a rooting interest in Richardson returning, but made  
sure he obtained all the information and then let his young star 
make the decision. He wasn't told of Richardson's decision until 
right before it was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's maybe even bigger than when he said he was first coming  
here,'' said Kennedy, who landed Richardson as a recruit right 
after it appeared he was headed to Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, at 6-foot-5, played mostly small forward last season  
and will need to move his game to the perimeter as an off-guard, 
where he would probably play in the NBA. He averaged 18.9 points 
and 10.5 rebounds, using his jumping quickness, long arms and 
uncanny sense of timing to scrap on the boards with bigger players. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, chosen the nation's top freshman last year by the  
U.S. Basketball Writers Association, The Sporting News and 
Basketball News, will acquire an insurance policy against injury 
this season, his sister said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most disappointing aspect of Richardson's first season at  
DePaul was the Blue Demons' failure to make the NCAA tournament. 
Led by fellow freshmen and Chicago prep stars Bobby Simmons and 
Lance Williams, DePaul had to settle for the NIT, where a 
first-round win over Northwestern was the school's first victory in 
the postseason since 1990. The Blue Demons (18-13) were eliminated 
in the second round by eventual NIT champ California. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who attended the news conference, was glad to have his  
friend and teammate back for another season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was playing with me, telling me he was coming back and then  
telling me he was going. Now we have a chance to have a great 
team,'' Williams said.

<HEADLINE> News Corp. Expands Cable Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Adding to a burgeoning U.S. media empire, Rupert  
Murdoch's News Corp. is paying $1.4 billion to take full control of 
two cable television channels, Fox Sports Net and the entertainment 
channel FX. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian magnate's deal with Liberty Media Group, a  
company controlled by AT&AMP;T Corp. and headed by cable magnate John 
Malone, will also increase News Corp.'s indirect ownership of two 
New York sports teams, basketball's Knicks and hockey's Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the accord announced late Monday, News Corp.  
will pay $1.4 billion in stock to buy out nearly all of Liberty's 
50 percent interest in Fox/Liberty Networks, a joint venture the 
two companies formed three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would give Liberty an 8 percent stake in News Corp.,  
making it the company's second-largest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fox Sports Net was created as a challenger to Walt Disney  
Co.'s ESPN channel and reaches more than 62 million households 
across the United States. FX is seen in 39 million U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This deal will enable us to leverage more fully the Fox brand  
across our cable and broadcast properties while giving us added 
flexibility over our sports and entertainment channels,'' Murdoch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp. will also take over the joint venture's 40 percent  
interest in Rainbow Programming, a unit of Cablevision that 
controls the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers and part of the 
Madison Square Garden arena where they play. News Corp. is also the 
owner of baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Media, based in Englewood, Colo., will retain its 50  
percent interest in International Sports Programming Partners, the 
international sports programming venture it formed with Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street saw the deal, which had been rumored for several  
days, as positive for both companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``They couldn't grow it under a two-headed ownership,'' said  
David Goldsmith, an analyst at Buckingham Research Group. ``News 
Corp. wants the programming to grow, sometimes at the expense of 
earnings, while Liberty wants the value of the assets to grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen said it was an added  
plus for News Corp. to bring in John Malone as an investor. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Liberty  
Media shares jumped $3.12 1/2, or 5.6 percent, to $59. News Corp.'s 
U.S.-listed shares rose 18 3/4 cents to $34. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp., based in Sydney, Australia, is one of the world's  
largest media companies. Its U.S. holdings also include the Fox 
Television Network, the Twentieth Century Fox movie studio, and the 
book publisher HarperCollins. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Media is one of nation's biggest providers of cable  
television programming, with interests in BET, CNN and Court TV. 
Liberty chairman Malone is the former head of Tele-Communications 
Inc., the cable giant recently acquired by AT&AMP;T.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Results for Baseball's Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	How baseball's big stars did Monday on opening day:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Mark McGwire. Hit home run No. 1, renewing his bid to make  
even more history. Coming off his record-breaking season of 70, he 
connected in the fifth inning for his 458th career homer in St. 
Louis' 10-8 loss to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ken Griffey Jr. Hit his seventh opening-day home run, one  
behind Frank Robinson's record, in an 8-2 loss to Chicago. The 
Seattle star did it at the Kingdome, soon after career homer king 
Hank Aaron threw out the first ball. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Roger Clemens. Made his debut for the World Series champion  
New York Yankees, staying in the game after an early rain delay at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Albert Belle. Hit a three-run homer and an RBI single in his  
Baltimore debut, a 10-7 win over Tampa Bay. The crowd of 46,733 at 
Camden Yards gave him a standing ovation, and the surly slugger 
responded with a curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cal Ripken. Forced to leave the Orioles' game in the third  
inning because of a stiff lower back and was listed as day-to-day. 
Last year, he voluntarily ended his record streak of 2,632 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Kevin Brown. Baseball's first $100 million man allowed three  
home runs in his Dodgers debut, but Los Angeles beat Arizona 8-6 in 
11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Randy Johnson. The Big Unit struck out nine in his first game  
since signing a $52.4 million contract with Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Raul Mondesi. The top performance of the day -- hit a tying,  
three-run homer with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, 
then hit a two-run homer in the 11th that lifted Los Angeles over 
Arizona 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Wade Boggs. Got two hits for Tampa Bay, moving him within 76  
of the 3,000 milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Barry Bonds. Set an NL record with his 290th career  
intentional walk, breaking Hank Aaron's record in San Francisco's 
11-8 victory over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Juan Gonzalez. Broke up Brian Moehler's no-hit bid by singling  
with one out in the seventh inning as Detroit defeated Texas 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Pedro Martinez. Struck out nine and was the winning pitcher as  
Boston beat Kansas City 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tom Glavine. The NL Cy Young winner took the loss as Curt  
Schilling and the Philadelphia Phillies beat Atlanta 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Alex Fernandez. Pitching for the first time since wrecking his  
shoulder in the 1997 NL championship series, he led Florida over 
the New York Mets 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Penalty Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The year that Bonnie Bachman turned 65 and  
became eligible to collect Social Security benefits, she faced a 
dilemma: 
</P>
<P>
	She wanted to keep her job as public relations coordinator for  
the Cheyenne, Wyo., Best Western Hitching Post Inn. The salary 
meant Bachman, recently widowed, could maintain something close to 
her old standard of living and pad savings for when she's no longer 
able to work. But it also meant forfeiting her long-anticipated 
Social Security check. 
</P>
<P>
	The choice was frustrating, but not difficult.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I weren't working, it would be a real hardship,'' said  
Bachman, now 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers perennially call for the elimination of the penalty --  
known as the earnings test -- that forces the youngest among senior 
citizens to choose between Social Security benefits and income from 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, support from President Clinton and the coming  
government surpluses are improving the chances the earnings test 
might be wiped off the books. 
</P>
<P>
	Because people are living and staying healthy longer, ``the line  
between retirement and working is blurring,'' said Social Security 
Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel. ``People should be able to continue 
to work and continue to receive a Social Security benefit to keep 
contributing to the work force and to themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., also has made the issue a  
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings test currently affects 870,000 working Americans  
between the ages of 65 and 69 who, like Bachman, earn more than 
Social Security allows and therefore get a smaller benefit or none 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a job, many of these older people face the prospect of  
trying to live on a fixed income near the poverty level. Yet they 
lose $1 of benefits for every $3 they earn above $15,500 a year. 
That limit is scheduled to rise to $30,000 a year by 2002 because 
of congressional action four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings test is even stricter for people who want to  
collect some benefits under an early retirement option offered to 
those ages 62 to 64. They lose $1 for every $2 earned above $9,600 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, most proposals to ease the penalty would not provide  
relief for these early retirees, and Clinton has not said whether 
he would support that. 
</P>
<P>
	In reality, Social Security benefits withheld under the earnings  
test are not lost -- just delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	After people do retire fully -- or once they reach age 70, when  
the penalty no longer applies -- their monthly benefits are adjusted 
upward to compensate for the losses. 
</P>
<P>
	That can create a positive side effect, says former  
congressional economist Wendell Primus: People who continue working 
lock in higher Social Security benefits for later, when they or a 
surviving spouse will need them most. 
</P>
<P>
	But the main reasoning behind the earnings test dates back to  
Social Security's start during the Great Depression, Primus said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had high unemployment,'' said Primus. ``They wanted some  
of these older workers to leave the work force to make room, so you 
couldn't get Social Security if you were working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But today, many people feel punished by the earnings test. Not  
everyone lives long enough to collect the system's delayed 
compensation. And wealthier retirees who collect income from 
investments, rather than work, aren't affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, discouraging older people from working is no longer  
desirable. Unlike in the 1930s, unemployment today is low and 
businesses will have to cope with a dwindling work force as the 
huge baby boom generation nears the traditional retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're finally waking up to the fact that we've got this aging  
population and we need to find ways to keep people in the work 
force,'' said Andrea Wooten, president of Green Thumb Inc., a 
nonprofit that helps people over age 55 find and keep meaningful 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason the time may be ripe for change is the government  
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost to Social Security of eliminating the earnings test is  
expected to be negligible in the long run, but could cost as much 
as $15 billion over the first five years, before diminishing. 
That's because some people would collect benefits upfront that 
previously were withheld until they were older. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said the earnings test relief should be part of a  
larger package that would use surpluses to help avert a Social 
Security cash shortfall expected in 2034. 
</P>
<P>
	However, earnings test relief is a political plum, affecting the  
nation's most avid voters -- senior citizens. Republicans used it in 
the ``Contract With America'' that helped them win control of 
Congress in 1994, and it could find its way into a tax relief 
package Democrats would also be eager to support before the 2000 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we will get something passed this year on this issue  
whether it is a stand-alone or as part of overall reform,'' said 
Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, a sponsor of legislation.

<HEADLINE> Tech Company's Nude Ad Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Some women are calling a high-tech  
company's advertisement displaying a nude woman sexist and a 
transportation agency has banned the ad from bus shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3Com Corp. ad features a photograph of a naked woman curled  
up in a fetal position while holding a Palm V hand-held electronic 
personal organizer. The ad, which shows no private body parts, is 
on 20 billboards and dozens of bus shelters in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar ads are running in Newsweek and Conde Nast Traveler  
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It stereotypes the role of women as the object of desire, not  
just in selling liquor or pantyhose but computers,'' said Sylvia 
Paull of GraceNet, a group of San Francisco Bay area women who work 
in technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority refused to put  
the ads on bus shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt our overall ridership would not respond positively to  
its artistic intent,'' spokeswoman Doreen Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with Santa Clara-based 3Com argued the ads are  
tasteful, although more typical of tobacco and alcohol companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you wanted to be sexist, you'd have her like those images  
in car ads, slithering across the hoods,'' said David Hunter, of 
Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding, the firm that created the ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads have become popular fodder for parody on the Internet.  
One Web designer posted four salacious photographs of women holding 
the new Palm V under the title ``Simply Porn.'' He posted the mock 
ads next to a copy of 3Com's ad, which the company later ordered 
him to remove.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Prosecutors, Deputies on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- Three former Illinois prosecutors and four  
sheriff's deputies went on trial Tuesday on charges they railroaded 
an innocent man for the rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven defendants lied and fabricated evidence against  
Rolando Cruz, who spent nearly a decade on death row, special 
prosecutor William Kunkle told the jury in his opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sorry history of this prosecution is a history of  
intentional misdeeds, a history of official misconduct, a history 
of perjury and lies,'' Kunkle said. ``Maybe, the tangled web 
finally gave way of its own nasty weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts said they cannot recall another trial in which  
prosecutors were charged with crimes for how they handled a case. 
</P>
<P>
	All seven defendants are charged with conspiracy to obstruct  
justice and conspiracy to commit official misconduct. The sheriff's 
deputies face additional charges, including perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	Juries twice convicted Cruz of killing of Jeanine Nicarico, who  
was abducted from her home in the Chicago suburb of Naperville 
while sick from school in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities pressed on despite evidence that another man might  
have been the killer, despite repeated losses in appeals courts and 
despite a campaign by religious leaders, law school deans and 
journalists who were convinced Cruz was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, during Cruz's third trial in 1995, came a stunning  
turnabout. 
</P>
<P>
	A supervisor in the sheriff's department recanted his previous  
testimony and cast doubt on a cornerstone of the prosecution -- that 
Cruz had revealed incriminating details to detectives in a 1983 
statement describing a ``vision'' or ``dream'' he had about the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz was found innocent and charges against co-defendant  
Alejandro Hernandez were dropped shortly after. 
</P>
<P>
	On trial are three former DuPage County prosecutors: Thomas  
Knight, now in private practice; Patrick King, now a federal 
prosecutor; and Robert Kilander, now a DuPage County judge. Also 
indicted were sheriff's Detectives Thomas Vosburgh and Dennis 
Kurzawa, and Lts. James Montesano and Robert Winkler. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants intend to attack Cruz as a liar who really was  
involved in the crime, and the case may well turn on how believable 
and sympathetic Cruz seems when he takes the stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz was a small-time criminal who started out as an informant  
in the Nicarico killing but gradually became a suspect. Terry 
Gillespie, an attorney for one of the cops, said Cruz tried to 
obstruct the investigation just because he didn't like police. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence will show that man is not a victim of anything,  
unless he's a victim of his own diabolical scheme,'' Gillespie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense contends it's unbelievable that seven men, some of  
whom did not know each other well or like each other much, would 
engineer a decade-plus conspiracy that spanned three 
administrations in the state's attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense attorneys are also concerned about recent media  
coverage of several murder convicts found to be innocent in 
Illinois.

<HEADLINE> Rodman, Actress Say Marriage is Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eccentric basketball rebounding star Dennis  
Rodman and his actress wife Carmen Electra have called their 
marriage quits -- again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carmen Electra and Dennis Rodman have announced that they have  
mutually agreed to end their 6-month-old marriage under amicable 
circumstances. Divorce papers were filed today in Los Angeles on 
behalf of Miss Electra. Miss Electra and Mr. Rodman are and will 
remain friends,'' publicist Matt Labov said Tuesday, speaking for 
both. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, 37, and Electra, 26, were married in Las Vegas on Nov.  
14 after what was reported to be an all-night bender. Nine days 
later, Rodman cried fraud and filed for an annulment, saying he was 
of unsound mind when he recited his vows. 
</P>
<P>
	Electra, whose real name is Tara Patrick, was with Rodman at  
Planet Hollywood in February when he announced he would be joining 
the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	During that news conference, Rodman said he and his wife were  
happily married, but living in separate homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Electra attended several games to watch her husband play.  
</P>
<P>
	Then on March 13, Rodman, 37, received permission to leave the  
Lakers to resolve personal issues. He rejoined the team in Orlando 
on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time rebounding champion, who has helped teams win  
five NBA championships, insisted the eight-day break had nothing to 
do with drinking, gambling, smoking or marital problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman later stated it was Electra who encouraged him to return.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was an instant hit with fans when he joined the team,  
helping the Lakers win nine straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the team has performed erratically since Rodman  
returned from his leave of absence. One of the lowest points came 
Saturday night when Rodman was ejected after picking up two 
technical fouls in the final minutes of an 81-76 loss to visiting 
Golden State.

<HEADLINE> US Finds Stainless Steel Is Dumped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is one step away from  
slapping punitive tariffs on a type of stainless steel from Japan, 
Spain and four other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has found those countries illegally  
price stainless round wire in the United States. It will impose 
tariffs of up to 36 percent if an independent agency finds that the 
pricing practices hurt or could injure American producers.

<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission is expected to rule by

	``We are very pleased,'' said George Kurisky, chairman of the  
U.S. Stainless Wire Action Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department ruling Monday represents the latest in a  
string of victories for the U.S. steel industry, which has yet to 
lose a key ruling in trade complaints filed to combat low-priced 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Those successes, however, have made it more difficult for  
domestic producers to put foreign steel products under quotas or 
impose stronger sanctions to fend off imports blamed for thousands 
of layoffs and bankruptcies at some U.S. companies. Administration 
officials cite the favorable rulings as evidence the normal 
administrative process works. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, 10 U.S. manufacturers sought tariffs after accusing  
Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Spain and Taiwan of dumping 
round wire in the U.S. market at prices below production costs or 
home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Stainless steel round wire is used to produce springs, wire rope  
and fasteners in construction and other applications. It represents 
a small portion of the overall steel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	A crucial decision covering the most common steel product,  
hot-rolled carbon steel, is due this month. The Commerce Department 
already has found evidence of dumping by Japan, Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and Brazil face steel tariffs in the hot-rolled case,  
while Russia has agreed to curb exports to avoid similar tariffs. A 
U.S. comment period for implementing the Russian agreement closed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On stainless round wire, tariffs proposed by the Commerce  
Department ranged from 3 percent for exports from South Korea to 36 
percent for shipments made by Spain's main producer. Japanese round 
wire could be subject to tariffs of up to 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stainless steel round wire is a $300 million-a-year domestic  
industry, and imports add another $100 million, industry officials 
said. Shipments from the six countries under Commerce Department 
scrutiny account for one-third of all imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The government already has imposed tariffs on stainless wire  
rod, the precursor to round wire, and has found six countries 
guilty of dumping stainless plates in coils, which could lead to 
more tariffs if injury is proven. Other complaints are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases acted on Monday were filed by ACS Industries Inc. of  
Woonsocket, R.I.; Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. of Dunkirk, N.Y.; 
Branford Wire &AMP; Manufacturing Co. of Mountain Home, N.C.; Carpenter 
Technology Corp. of Reading, Pa.; Handy &AMP; Herman Specialty Wire 
Group of Cockeysville, Md.; Industrial Alloys Inc. of Pomona, 
Calif.; Loos &AMP; Co. Inc. of Pomfret, Conn.; Sandvik Steel Co. of 
Clarks Summit, Pa.; Sumiden Wire Products Corp. of Stockton, 
Calif.; and Techalloy Co. Inc. of Mahwah, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Airstrikes Said Rattling Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two weeks of NATO airstrikes have ``rattled''  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and hurt morale among his 
armed forces, which are struggling with fuel and ammunition 
shortages and bombed out command centers, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb air defenses remain a threat to NATO aircraft, however, and  
widely scattered tanks and troops accused of leading an ethnic 
cleansing campaign against ethic Albanians in Kosovo are still 
proving difficult to strike despite a stepped up allied air 
campaign that was taking advantage of clear skies today to hit more 
targets, U.S. officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have evidence of units that had to go into holding  
operations or holding patterns because of shortages of, 
specifically, gas and ammo,'' said Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson, 
director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He 
acknowledged few troops or tanks have been struck, mostly because 
they're hiding in mountainous terrain or are too close to innocent 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson cited ``anecdotal reports that morale is declining'' in  
the Serb military following this past week's most devastating U.S. 
cruise missile and bomb strikes on army and police headquarters, 
command centers and fuel and ammunition depots throughout 
Yugoslavia and an intelligence training facility outside Belgrade. 
Wilson didn't offer any estimates of Serb military casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign that Milosevic is feeling the effects of NATO  
airstrikes that began March 24, he announced a unilateral 
cease-fire Tuesday and offered to allow ethnic Albanians back into 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	After pushing about half the 2 million Kosovo population out of  
the Serbian province since February 1998 -- more than 400,000 ethnic 
Albanians in the past two weeks -- Milosevic may feel he has changed 
the situation on the ground to his advantage. Previously, Kosovo 
was about 10 percent Serbian. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration and other NATO nations quickly  
rejected the cease-fire offer, calling it a sham and insisting that 
Milosevic pull back his forces, allow refugees to return home under 
NATO protection and accept a peace plan giving ethnic Albanians 
self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``This offer may be one sign that he is rattled,'' Pentagon  
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. ``But we are going to continue to 
rattle him until he makes an offer that meets our conditions, and 
he's far away from that right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intensified NATO airstrikes have led to increased reports of  
civilian casualties. In the worst case so far, an allied bomb went 
astray Monday night and hit apartment buildings in the mining town 
of Aleksinac, about 100 miles south of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb television reported at least 12 civilians killed. The  
Pentagon said a laser-guided bomb from a U.S. plane ``fell short'' 
of its target, a nearby military post housing a Serb artillery 
brigade, possibly because cloud cover interfered with the guidance 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will work hard to hold civilian casualties to a minimum,''  
Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has agreed to house as many as 20,000 ethnic  
Albanian refugees temporarily at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo 
Bay, Cuba, to ease the Balkan refugee crisis. Other Europeans 
countries are taking in some 100,000 -- but only until they can 
return to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen was visiting NATO headquarters  
in Brussels, Belgium, today to consult with authorities there on 
the latest Kosovo developments. He was accompanied by members of 
Congress, including Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Carl Levin, 
D-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and NATO foreign ministers  
will meet in Brussels early next week to assess the offensive 
against the Serbs and reaffirm their determination to forge a 
settlement for Kosovo, State Department spokesman James Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	This may be followed by a meeting either of the six Contact  
Group nations -- Russia, the United States, France, Italy, Germany 
and Britain -- that framed a proposed political settlement for 
Kosovo that was rejected by Milosevic, or of the G-8 nations, which 
would also include Russia, Canada and Japan, a senior U.S. official 
told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia supports restoring autonomy to the ethnic Albanians in  
Kosovo that Milosevic stripped away in 1989, but has deplored the 
NATO airstrikes and suspended cooperation with the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to mend fences Tuesday, Vice President Al Gore telephoned  
Russian Prime Minister Yvgeny Primakov. It was first time the two 
had spoken since Primakov turned his plane around last month en 
route to Washington to protest the start of the air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore told reporters on Air Force Two on a trip to California  
that he spoke with Primakov for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to limit damage to the U.S.-Russian  
relationship,'' Gore said. ``He and I have a very good personal 
relationship. The call was businesslike.''

<HEADLINE> WNBA Nears Contract Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Another labor dispute could delay the start of  
another basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA has given its players until Saturday to reach a  
contract agreement with the league. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center of the disagreement is salaries, just as it was  
when the NBA locked out its players for six months, including 
nearly half the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The union wants a minimum salary of $45,000 for the three-month  
summer season. The WNBA is proposing $20,000, according to the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole purpose of having a women's professional basketball  
league in the United States is because women are tired of going 
overseas,'' Coquese Washington, a guard for the New York Liberty 
and also a lawyer, told USA Today. ``We want to make a career out 
of something we are very good at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WNBA president Val Ackerman said the league offered a 30 percent  
increase in player salaries, year-round health, dental and 
maternity benefits and offseason career programs. The league said 
the compensation package is worth $60,000 a player. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides also are at odds over the number of players from  
the defunct American Basketball League that should be allowed in 
the league. The WNBA wants 52 of the 90 eligible players and wants 
to expand rosters to accommodate them. The union wants 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman told USA Today the WNBA doesn't believe there should be  
restrictions on the number of ABL players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will all go into the (April 27) draft together,''  
Ackerman said. ``Our plan is to allocate an additional player to 
(expansion) Minnesota and Orlando so that they'll end up with two 
allocated players, like everyone else did to start their rosters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA has a tryout camp April 15-17 in Chicago. That camp  
could be jeopardized by the stalemated negotiations.

<HEADLINE>  Williams Impresses NFL Types </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Ricky Williams put on a good show for  
representatives of several NFL team today, and the thing they were 
most impressed with was his waistline. 
</P>
<P>
	With his dreadlocks tied back in pigtails, the Heisman Trophy  
winner from Texas went though a 2-hour workout at UC San Diego for 
scouts, coaches and general managers. He ran three 40-yard dashes, 
did some agility drills, pass-catching drills and then, with dozens 
of UC San Diego students looking on, benched pressed 225 pounds 22 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	The big moment came when he stepped on the scales. Back in  
mid-February during the NFL scouting combine, where he did 
interviews with teams but skipped the drills, he weighed 244 
pounds. On Tuesday, he was down to 224. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just worked really hard,'' said Williams, who went to high  
school in San Diego. ``We had to concentrate so much on losing the 
weight that maybe it took away from speed work, but I mean, I think 
the main thing was getting my weight down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the NCAA career rushing leader with 6,279 yards, made  
an impression with the two coaches whose teams have the first two 
picks in the draft April 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he did today was allow a lot of scouts, general managers  
and head coaches to rest easy tonight,'' said Chris Palmer of the 
expansion Cleveland Browns, who hold the first pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``The No. 1 thing was that he has dropped the weight,'' said  
Andy Reid of the Philadelphia Eagles. ``That's always a concern, 
somebody's up 20 pounds from a normal playing weight. You've just 
got to (come and) see. We understood that he had been on the 
banquet circuit. But he lost it and he looked sharp. That showed me 
a little something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being on the rubber-chicken circuit was tough ``only because  
you're not working out,'' Williams said. ``Eating wasn't that bad, 
it's just that you're traveling so much that it's really hard to 
take time to work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his diet, ``I just kind of made up stuff,'' Williams  
said. ``I got by. It changed almost every day. I had to work 
extremely hard. It wasn't just strictly diet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest thing he gave up?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, all sweets. Doughnuts, cheesecake. That's about it. Just  
sweets. Right now I'm going to a doughnut shop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Williams was timed anywhere from 4.6 seconds to 4.72  
running against the wind in the 40, and anywhere from 4.43 to 4.52 
in two heats with the wind. Two other college players who were 
being timed suffered hamstring injuries on the cold, blustery day. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in the crowd of 200 watching the workout were  
Cleveland general manager Dwight Clark, Indianapolis GM Bill Polian 
and coach Jim Mora, New Orleans Saints GM Bill Kuharich and 
Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is so well regarded that Saints coach Mike Ditka said  
he would trade all six 1999 draft picks and additional future picks 
to move up in the first round and get him. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuharich said the Saints haven't had any discussions yet with  
other teams, ``but that will be part of the package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch, Oregon quarterback  
Akili Smith and Williams are the three players the Browns are 
considering. Clark said there is no clear-cut favorite. The Browns 
are scheduled to work out Couch in Lexington, Ky., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Browns officials will sit down this week and discus  
the pros and cons of the three, and also entertain any trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams would like to go to Cleveland as the first pick.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great organization,'' he said. ``They have the best  
fans in the NFL. I just see myself fitting in in Cleveland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and his agent, Leland Hardy, are scheduled to visit six  
teams in three days -- St. Louis and New Orleans on Wednesday, 
Washington and Philadelphia on Thursday and Cleveland and 
Indianapolis on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Cattle Raisers Set Up Hotline / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Got a beef with the beef industry? You might want  
to keep it to yourself unless you want a visit from a new Texas 
beef task force. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association is setting  
up a hotline for people in the beef industry to call if they hear 
anyone disparaging their products. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Hosford, spokesman for the Fort Worth-based association,  
said the hotline and a related task force will focus mostly on the 
news media that air or print such comments from beef critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we hear XYZ radio station carrying something about the beef  
industry, procedures and products that is derogatory, unfounded and 
untrue, with this task force we will send someone over there to 
re-educate, so the next time they talk they'll be talking from the 
right side of the ballpark,'' Hosford said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotline was inspired by a billboard posted briefly in  
Amarillo last month that stated ``Jesus was a vegetarian.'' The 
animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals had 
planned to leave the sign up for 30 days, but the billboard company 
took it down after four days because the message sparked so much 
controversy in the heart of beef country. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Friedrich, PETA's vegetarian campaign coordinator, said he  
was not surprised Texas beef leaders have taken this approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, they are running scared,'' Friedrich said. ``All the  
propaganda in the world can't sanitize their product. Eating 
animals is catastrophic for the environment. We all know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hosford said cattle raisers have no intention of infringing on  
anyone's right to free speech, and he knows some critics might 
continue to slam the beef industry even after a visit from the task 
force. He said the task force will use scientific data from 
university studies to make its point. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't force our agenda on anyone. We're not going to try to  
do that,'' Hosford said. ``We're just trying to inform people to 
make sure they have the correct facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes a year after a federal jury in Amarillo  
ruled talk show maven Oprah Winfrey did not defame the beef 
industry when a guest on her show in April 1996 said there was a 
risk U.S. beef could spread mad cow disease. 
</P>

	LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) -- Chili still is one of New Mexico's  
biggest crops, but more and more of the spicy stuff processed in 
the state is being grown by farmers in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture officials report the volume of Mexican chili going  
through the ports of entry at Columbus and Santa Teresa has 
increased dramatically in recent years. In 1993, a total of 3,143 
tons of Mexican chili went through the ports of entry and by last 
year, the total had jumped to 47,360 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the competition from Mexico involves the production of  
jalapenos and certain red chilis such as paprika and cayenne. 
</P>
<P>
	According to state and federal agriculture officials, the volume  
of Mexican jalapenos that passed through the Columbus port in 1998 
-- 15,985 tons -- exceeded the total grown in all of New Mexico in 
1997 -- 11,050 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	The volume of New Mexico-grown jalapenos processed in the state  
in 1997 was less than half the 1993 amount, a decline to 10,200 
tons from 21,800 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers in Mesilla Valley said all production of jalapenos,  
paprika and cayenne could move south of the border in as little as 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If current conditions continue, the picture is not good for  
chili,'' said New Mexico State University horticulturist Richard 
Phillips, director of the Chili Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force is looking into whether mechanical harvesting of  
chili would be a profitable alternative to hand-picking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mechanization is going to be the only solution,'' said Lou  
Biad, part-owner of a Las Cruces-based paprika processing company. 
``I don't know how far off we are from that.''

	Rain showers stretched from Michigan to Georgia on Tuesday while  
a storm hit Nevada with heavy snow. 
</P>
<P>
	A storm system from the Great Lakes to the Tennessee Valley  
moved east through the day. The storm brought snow to northeastern 
Minnesota and rain showers in a band running from northern Michigan 
through Georgia. Wind gusts of up to 45 mph were reported in 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Precipitation amounts with the system were generally light, with  
heavier amounts reported in northern Mississippi and Alabama, where 
some areas reported up to two inches of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure was building in the central part of the country,  
bringing mostly fair skies to the region. 
</P>
<P>
	In the West, a storm system moving out of California into the  
central and southern Rockies produced rain in Southern California, 
with snow showers at higher elevations. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nevada, more than two feet of snow fell around Lake Tahoe,  
while the valleys of western Nevada saw accumulations ranging from 
three to six inches. Snow showers in association with the storm 
were also reported in southern Idaho and northern Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	By midafternoon, temperatures around the continental United  
States ranged from 86 in Punta Gorda, Fla., to 10 in Flagstaff, 
Ariz. The highest heat index was 90 in Key West, Fla., and the 
lowest wind chill was zero in Worthington, Minn.

<HEADLINE> Yahoo Stock Jumps 22 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet exuberance hit the stock market again  
today as shares of the popular Web site Yahoo! Inc. -- and two 
Internet companies it plans to buy -- all soared more than 20 
percent on rumors that Yahoo! would beat predictions for its 
quarterly profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like this week, Internet stocks are everybody's  
favorite again,'' said Jim Balderston, industry analyst for Zona 
Research Inc., Redwood City, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!'s stock rose $39.37 1/2, or nearly 22 percent, to close at  
$219.12 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. GeoCities Inc. gained $26.43 3/4, 
or almost 23 percent, to close at $143.56 1/4. Broadcast.com Inc., 
rose $27, or 21 percent, to $157. GeoCities provides Internet pages 
where individuals can post material. Broadcast.com is the biggest 
provider of radio and television programming on the Web. Both 
companies will soon become part of Yahoo!'s expanding empire. 
</P>
<P>
	Their rise was part of a broader market surge by technology  
stocks that pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to a new high 
of 10,007.33 and boosted the Nasdaq by 66.69 points to 2,560.06. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said those numbers may have been buoyed by excitement  
over Yahoo!, one of the few Internet companies that actually makes 
a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that they're generating black ink instead of red ink  
has got to make some of these investors feel less queasy'' about 
the sky-high prices for Internet stocks, Balderston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Clara, Calif.-based Yahoo! is scheduled to report results  
after the market closes Wednesday for the quarter ended March 31. 
The company earned $4.3 million, or 8 cents per share, in the same 
quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The consensus among analysts surveyed by the research firm First  
Call Corp. is for the company to earn 8 cents per share. However, 
the ``whisper'' number -- the rumored predictions that circulate 
shortly before earnings announcements -- was at 10 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Oakes said Yahoo!'s revenue,  
expected to be $80 million, could beat that figure by $10 million -- 
or 12.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! has consistently beaten analysts expectations in recent  
quarters, said Chuck Hill, director of research for First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakes said that has more to do with the company than the  
analysts covering it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of what companies do now is set expectations so they can  
be sure they beat expectations,'' Oakes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Yahoo! announced a deal to deliver its content and  
services to hand-held computers and devices for viewing the Web on 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal with Online Anywhere, Yahoo! will provide e-mail,  
personal calendars, weather and stock quotes. Online Anywhere's 
technology automatically formats the information to fit whatever 
device the subscriber is using, be it a large-screen television or 
a pocket-size, hand-held computer. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year ended Dec. 31, Yahoo! earned $25.6 million, or 23  
cents per share, reversing a loss of $25.5 million, or 29 cents per 
share, in 1997. Revenue jumped to $203.3 million from $70.5 
million.

<HEADLINE> Duval Dominates Masters Practice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- David Duval didn't even bring his golf clubs  
to Augusta National and he still managed to dominate the first day 
of practice for the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	While Duval did nothing but have a little lunch in the clubhouse  
and formally register for the first major of the season, player 
after player walked off the 18th green Monday with the hottest 
player in the game on their minds. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the changes made to toughen up the golf course came in  
second to talk about the streak Duval finds himself on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish he would play a little less, so maybe I might win  
one,'' Justin Leonard said. ``What he's done is incredible. If 
there was somebody whose respect he didn't have before this year, I 
think he's gained it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of his last two tournaments and four already in the  
young year, Duval is a favorite not only in the Las Vegas sports 
books (5-1), but also among his peers to do what he agrees is 
necessary to validate his career -- win his first major. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since Tom Watson in 1980 and Johnny Miller six years prior  
to that has a golfer dominated on the PGA Tour like Duval has in 
the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't won a major yet,'' Fred Couples said. ``But he's won  
11 of the last 34 times he's played. That's borderline ridiculous. 
I don't know of anyone else who's done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, who never plays on the Monday of a tournament, arrived  
with little fanfare on the back of a golf cart to take in the scene 
and have a bite to eat before getting down to business Tuesday with 
his tournament preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	He enters the week fresh off wins at The Players Championship  
and the BellSouth Classic, just two hours down the road in Atlanta. 
He also enters with the added confidence of having played well 
enough last year to miss a playoff only when Mark O'Meara knocked 
in a 20-footer for birdie on the last hole to win his first major. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine he's going to suffer any kind of letdown,''  
said Mark Calcavecchia. ``It's got to be a pretty good way to come 
into this tournament, winning two in a row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, Duval agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's helpful to win the week before you go  
somewhere,'' Duval said. ``It makes you realize that what you're 
doing, you're doing right. And I know I can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's streak not only shoved Tiger Woods out of the favorite's  
role, it also overshadowed the changes made to the golf course 
inspired by the runaway win by Woods two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Two new tee boxes have lengthened the course and a heftier cut  
of rough might make it more difficult to stop the ball on Augusta's 
slick greens if players miss the generally forgiving fairways. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes will be most evident on the par-5 15th, where  
fairway mounds that many times funneled balls further down the 
fairway have virtually been eliminated and 20 mature pine trees 
planted in their place. Six more pine trees frame the green, 
replacing a mound to the right of the green. 
</P>
<P>
	On 17, the tee was moved back 25 yards, bringing back into play  
the pine tree that President Eisenhower wanted to have cut down 
after it caught one too many of his drives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more the length, the more of an advantage to the long  
hitters,'' Steve Stricker said. ``No. 17 is a perfect example.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That could favor Woods, of course, who overpowered the course  
two years ago, shooting 18 under and winning by 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods was in contention at The Players Championship before  
fading, and took last week off to prepare for the only major he has 
won. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it is not Woods any longer who inspires fear from his  
fellow competitors. Taking that spot is Duval, who shot four rounds 
in the 60s to win in Atlanta and made it look easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see his name on the scoreboard and it's like, `OK now,  
here he comes,'' Fred Funk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's performance is even more remarkable in that he appears  
to be capable of carrying it on for a long period of time. He's 
talked about feeling peaceful, and very much in control of himself 
behind those wraparound shades. 
</P>
<P>
	The thought of winning his first major at the age of 27, though,  
could cause his heart to skip a beat or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited,'' Duval said. ``It's a big week and I'm looking  
forward to it.''

<HEADLINE> Court Affirms Ruling for USTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A federal appeals court today refused to  
reinstate a $1.95 million award against the United States Trotting 
Association, which was sued by the maker of a sulky that was banned 
by the association. 
</P>
<P>
	Rules adopted by the USTA in 1993 to standardize the two-wheeled  
buggy used in harness racing banned the Cheetah Super Sulky made by 
Super Sulky Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	When the maker went out of business, it sued the association and  
won a jury award of $650,000 in damages, which was tripled to $1.95 
million in antitrust cases. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Akron, Ohio, set aside the award, and the 6th  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheetah-style sulkies manufactured by several makers differed  
from traditional styling in that they connected the buggy to the 
horse with an hourglass shape instead of straight shafts. The maker 
claimed they created a narrower and more aerodynamic form, leading 
to faster times. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some horsemen objected for a variety of reasons, and  
the USTA's survey of sulky drivers showed a majority of them 
favored making the conventional-style sulky the standard, according 
to court records.

<HEADLINE> Couples Wants Redemption at Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Augusta National gives. And it takes away.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, it gave Fred Couples one of the biggest breaks any  
Masters competitor has ever received. In 1998, it pounced on 
Couples' mistake and made him pay the price of a blown Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Couples thought he was going to be the winner last year after  
leading for 66 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened has only irritated me for a year and it's still  
climbing,'' Couples said. ``But there's nothing I've ever done that 
I can't get over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couples hooked a drive into the pine trees to the left of Rae's  
Creek on the par-5, No. 13, a tempting 485-yard dogleg. 
</P>
<P>
	Couples found disaster after he chipped a wedge back to the  
fairway. Pulling out a 6-iron, he pushed his third shot and it 
found Rae's Creek in front of the green. He stared at the 
disappearing ball in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	The flustered Couples finished with a double-bogey 7 on what's  
considered the easiest hole of the three-hole Amen Corner swing. He 
still makes no excuses for what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt the pressure,'' he said. ``I didn't make a good enough  
swing and it cost me the tournament. Maybe I should have taken more 
time. I felt a little rushed. It's bothered me awhile. I just hope 
I get another shot at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse gave Mark O'Meara just enough room to win the  
tournament with birdies on the last two holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Couples was under par in every round (69-70-71-70), but finished  
tied for second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I should have won,'' Couples said. ``Sometimes  
fate intervenes at Augusta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like that Sunday in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
	Couples' tee shot hit into the slope on the treacherous 155-yard  
No. 12. Somehow the ball defied gravity and clung to a blade of 
grass short of the water. Couples got it up-and-down for par and 
cruised to his first and only major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-dozen other balls trickled into the water that day in the  
general area where Couples hit his ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally you forget the good breaks you get and remember the  
bad one like I got last year,'' Couples said. ``But I'll never 
forget the break I got in 1992.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couples, who has been in the top 10 six times at Augusta  
National, has a perfect game for the course. He's a long driver, 
hits good irons and can putt fast greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I can win,'' said Couples, who was fourth in The  
Players Championship two weeks ago. ``Length is a huge deal here 
and this is my favorite course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes he comes to his 67th hole on Sunday in front and with a  
chance to tame the testy 13th. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be in that position again, standing there with a  
3-wood in my hand trying to hit the fairway,'' Couples said. ``To 
win the Masters twice would be a big deal. I let one get away last 
year.''

<HEADLINE> Nets' Williams Out of Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- All-Star center Jayson Williams of  
the New Jersey Nets was released from a hospital Tuesday after 
surgery for a season-ending broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams has already started rehabilitation work, but is wearing  
a brace and will not be able to put weight on his right leg for 
eight to 10 weeks, Nets spokesman John Mertz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had been expected to leave the Hospital for Special  
Surgery in New York City on Monday, three days after he had an 
operation to insert a plate and five screws in his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Russell Warren, the surgeon, said there was too much  
swelling, according to Sal DiFazio, Williams' agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Team doctors had X-rays taken Tuesday to check on the stability  
of bone taken from Williams's hip that was grafted onto the leg and 
held in place with the plate and screws, DiFazio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams broke the leg in a collision with teammate Stephon  
Marbury late in the fourth quarter of the Nets' 90-85 win over the 
Atlanta Hawks on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets officially put Williams on the injured list Tuesday and  
activated forward Scott Burrell, who went on the injured list with 
a sprained right ankle on March 23.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Mixed; Corn, Soybeans Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures finished mixed Tuesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and soybean futures moved lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans fell sharply on reports three American pork producers  
planned to import cheaper Brazilian soybean meal as animal feed in 
coming months. Analysts derided the reports as economically 
unfeasible, but the widespread talk shook the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans have been pressured for the past few weeks amid fears a  
bumper Brazilian crop, offered at prices more attractive to 
importers, would take business away from American exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures fell amid signs that the recent rains and mild  
temperatures across Midwestern planting regions had aided early 
planting and increased the likelihood of a bumper crop. On Monday, 
the U.S. Agriculture Department said spring planting was slightly 
ahead of normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures remained under pressure amid expectations  
inventories will rise sharply later this year with the harvest of a 
winter wheat crop that's currently in excellent condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1/4 cent to $2.89 a bushel; May corn  
fell 2 1/2 cents to $2.16 1/4 a bushel; May oats fell 6 cents to $1.05 a 
bushel; May soybeans fell 4 1/4 cents to $4.77 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were mostly lower on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while lean hogs finished mixed and pork bellies advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose 0.08 cent to 65.30 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell 0.03 cent to 73.97 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose 0.80 cent to 54.90 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose 1.02 
cents to 53.32 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Mazda, Mitsubishi Negotiating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese automakers Mazda Motor Co. and Mitsubishi  
Motor Co. are in negotiations to establish a broad business and 
technological alliance, a newspaper reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks have already resulted in a basic agreement for Mazda  
to supply commercial vans to Mitsubishi on an original equipment 
manufacturing basis, the Nihon Keizai business daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies plan to gradually expand the alliance -- their  
first with each other -- with the possibility of a future alliance 
involving Ford Motor Co., Mazda's largest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Mitsubishi would halt production of commercial  
versions of its slumping Delica van model, and instead procure 
Mazda's Bongo vans for sale under the Delica name, the Nihon Keizai 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are considering the possibility of Mazda procuring  
minicars from Mitsubishi, thus replacing Suzuki Motor Corp. as its 
supplier of minicars, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two firms are also discussing an arrangement under which  
Mitsubishi would supply Mazda with its fuel-efficient 
gasoline-direct-injection engines and related technology, the paper 
said.

<HEADLINE> Auto Workers Charged in Drug Sting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARREN, Mich. (AP) -- Drug charges have been brought against 11  
DaimlerChrysler AG workers following a 16-month undercover 
investigation at their auto plant. 
</P>
<P>
	A forklift operator, William Sturkin, was charged with  
possession with intent to deliver cocaine and heroin at the Dodge 
City truck assembly plant, where he has worked for more than 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturkin, 45, of Detroit, complained of heart problems Sunday in  
the Warren police lockup and was transported to St. John Macomb 
Hospital Center for treatment of an irregular heartbeat. He was 
arraigned Monday at his hospital bed and ordered held on $200,000 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested 10 others last week on lesser charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Authorities launched the probe in late 1997, when workers  
complained to management about drug dealing at the plant. 
Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp. merged in November. 
</P>
<P>
	After conferring with police and the Macomb County prosecutor's  
office, the automaker hired a private detective to work undercover 
in the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Cpl. Mark Fontaine said the undercover employee  
purchased marijuana from Sturkin. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the investigation, police also seized 77 rocks of  
crack cocaine valued at $10-$20 each, 65 packs of heroin worth 
about $650 on the street, and 29, $10 packets of powder cocaine, 
Fontaine said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said more arrests were possible.

	HOME-BASED WORKERS: The image that many people have of  
home-based workers is that of women who manage to fit their 
occupation around raising their children and doing the housework. 
But Ohio State University found in a study of 899 home-based 
workers in nine states that nearly 59 percent were men involved in 
traditional fields such as sales or construction. Three-quarters of 
the respondents were self-employed, and the average age of all the 
home-based workers was 44. Kathryn Stafford, a professor at Ohio 
State's College of Human Ecology, said the home-based workers made 
a big contribution to local economies, buying from local suppliers 
and selling most of their products or services to local customers.

	INTERNET STOCKS: While Internet company stocks including Yahoo!,  
America Online and Amazon.com have surged higher lately, they're 
appealing mostly to a narrow segment of the investing public, finds 
PaineWebber and the Gallup Organization in a survey of more than 
1,000 investors. The survey found that just 15 percent of the 
investors queried own or have owned Internet stocks. PaineWebber 
also reported that Internet stock investors tended to be younger 
than the general investing population. Mark Sutton, president of 
PaineWebber's private client business, said Internet stocks may 
appeal to younger investors ``because they are most likely to be 
using those companies' services.'' Moreover, younger investors, who 
don't need their money for imminent retirement or children's 
college tuition, are more likely to buy stocks like Internet issues 
that are considered somewhat risky.

	HOW SOON DO I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN?: The spring means  
the start of home-repair season, and millions of do-it-yourselfers 
will be wondering as they paint and hammer away how long the fruits 
of their labors will last. HouseMaster, a home inspection company, 
put together a list of a home's common features and their life 
spans. For instance, the paint job should last four to seven years. 
The bathroom sink you installed should make it for 10 years or 
more. If you're replacing your own roof, asphalt shingles will last 
15 to 18 years, about the same as a wood roof. But if you install a 
tile roof, chances are you'll be off the hook for replacements once 
the new one's on -- tiles are expected to last 40 years or more.

<HEADLINE> Susan McDougal Trial Winding Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- In her month-long trial, Susan McDougal  
got what she wanted: a judge, a jury and her lawyer in the room 
while she answered questions in Kenneth Starr's Whitewater 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	They were questions that she refused to answer in 1996 and again  
last year when Starr, the independent counsel, hauled her before 
grand juries to no avail. Instead she spent 18 months in jail for 
civil contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after closing arguments on Wednesday, jurors will consider  
Mrs. McDougal's defense that she feared being charged with perjury 
unless she gave Starr a story that she says he wanted to hear -- 
that the Clintons engaged in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, who with her late husband was a partner with Bill  
and Hillary Clinton in the Whitewater land deal, is charged with 
criminal contempt and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final round of testimony Monday, Starr's office tried to  
show that it did everything possible to address her fears about 
giving grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Jahn, a former Starr prosecutor, said Mrs. McDougal was told  
in 1996 that if there came a point where there was a question about 
whether she'd committed perjury, the matter would be turned over to 
an independent prosecutor -- and not pursued by the Starr team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jahn denied prosecutors ever promised her relief from other  
legal problems if she cooperated or told her ex-husband -- as she 
claimed -- that she could ``write her own ticket'' if she said she 
had a sexual affair with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Jahn acknowledged, however, that a state prosecutor in  
California had indicated an embezzlement case against Mrs. McDougal 
might be settled by plea bargain. She still refused to cooperate 
with Starr and Mrs. McDougal later was acquitted on the 
embezzlement charge. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, Mrs. McDougal's defense got a boost when Judge  
George Howard Jr., allowed, despite strong protests from 
prosecutors, testimony from a Virginia woman who also claimed she 
had been mistreated by Starr prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Susan and I have been relentlessly pursued by the Office of  
Independent Counsel,'' testified Julie Hiatt Steele, who claimed 
she had been indicted because she refused to give false testimony 
against Clinton. Steele faces a trial next month on an indictment 
obtained by Starr's staff that she obstructed justice and lied to a 
grand jury.

	Mrs. McDougal used her trial to dramatically press her attack on  
Starr whom she accused of waging a ``personal vendetta'' against 
her. ``It will be an all-out fight,'' she predicted as the trial 
opened March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	When she took the stand two weeks into the trial, McDougal said  
she never discussed a fraudulent $300,000 loan with Bill Clinton -- 
that has been the center of the Whitewater investigation -- and that 
she did not believe Clinton had said ``anything untruthful'' when 
he testified at her 1996 trial involving the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing he said was untrue to me,'' said McDougal from the  
stand, for the first time addressing questions she for 2 1/2 years had 
refused to address for Starr's prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal contempt and obstruction case centers on Mrs.  
McDougal's state of mind when she refused to cooperate with Starr, 
her defense lawyers argued, because she believed her own words 
would be used against her by Starr's prosecutors even if she told 
the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	A career federal prosecutor, Jahn insisted Monday that the Starr  
prosecutors only wanted Mrs. McDougal to tell the ``total and 
complete truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what Mrs. McDougal claims, added Associate Independent  
Counsel Mark Barrett, the government has only to show that she 
disobeyed a court order to answer the grand jury questions.

<HEADLINE> Few Law Govern Use of Videotape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q. Everywhere I go in public these days, it seems I see a camera  
perched somewhere above, filming my every move. What happens to 
this videotape? 

</P>
<P>
	A. You're not imagining it.  
</P>
<P>
	From banks and ATMs to grocery stores and mini-marts to  
elevators and toll booths, video monitoring is everywhere. And the 
people and organizations who initiate such taping rarely warn you 
that it's happening. 
</P>
<P>
	Few laws explicitly govern the use or abuse of videotape,  
according to Robert Ellis Smith, publisher of the monthly 
newsletter Privacy Journal, based in Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	He says videotape with sound can occasionally fall under illegal  
wiretapping laws, and some jurisdictions have anti-eavesdropping 
laws. But much of what's filmed is simply silent security video. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early days of taping, security videos were simply endless  
loops that recorded over themselves automatically, Smith says. Now, 
many machines preserve their footage, and its fate varies. 
</P>
<P>
	``What becomes of those tapes? It's not known,'' Smith says.  
``Whether a divorce lawyer or someone else can get hold of those 
tapes, it's unclear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These days, much filming is done as a matter of routine. And, as  
the cameras reach beyond security, audiences are growing wider. 
Some cameras even allow Internet users to see what people are doing 
someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
	``People go about their business now without thinking twice  
about it, and I think that's regrettable,'' Smith says. ``They 
don't seem concerned about the videotaping of themselves in various 
public places. I don't think they even focus at all on what's 
happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He believes the people responsible for the taping ``ought to  
articulate their reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You're entitled to privacy protection -- who you're holding  
hands with, what newspaper you may be reading,'' Smith says. 
``Articulating in advance the reason for surveillance should force 
you to stop the surveillance when the reason has disappeared.''

<HEADLINE>  Allied Planes Target Yugoslav Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEKSINAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Allied planes targeted  
transportation links and communication sites today across 
Yugoslavia, and local officials said a NATO attack on a coal mining 
town in central Serbia killed five civilians and injured at least 
30 others. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number of casualties couldn't be independently  
confirmed, but an Associated Press photographer at the scene saw 
two victims who had died in a residential area where several homes 
were flattened. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and army officials blamed the casualties on a series of  
missile attacks in Aleksinac, a town of 17,000 that is 100 miles 
southeast of Belgrade. More bodies were believed to be buried in 
the rubble, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two bodies, along with pools of blood and body parts, were  
in the wreckage of a block of apartments. Bricks, wooden boards and 
roof tiles were strewn about, some thrown up to 200 yards from the 
blast. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, NATO said the strike had apparently been aimed at a  
military target in the area but had no details. A spokesman at NATO 
headquarters, Maj. Dan Baggio, stressed that military planners did 
their best to ``minimize the possibility of collateral damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the incident was being investigated.  
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Tanjug news agency quoted local civil defense  
commander Jovan Zlatic as saying rescue squads were trying to 
retrieve survivors from beneath the rubble. In another 
neighborhood, wrecked cars smoldered hours after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian state-run TV showed a local clinic badly damaged and an  
emergency unit smashed. Shop windows were shattered in the center 
of the town. A local Red Cross worker, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said that of the 30 wounded, five were in serious 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The airstrikes late Monday and early today aimed to cut the  
Yugoslav military's lines of supply and transport -- roads, bridges, 
airports, fuel depots and command centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb television said NATO struck a fuel depot south of the  
Hungarian border and a railway bridge over the Danube River. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug news agency said several missiles blasted a barracks  
today in Prizren, Kosovo's second-largest city. It was the fourth 
attack there since NATO launched the air campaign on March 24 to 
dislodge government forces from the province in southern Serbia, 
where majority ethnic Albanians have been fighting for 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO missiles hit a communications relay station near Kosovo's  
provincial capital, Pristina, and blasted targets on the main road 
from Kosovo to the Serb heartland, Tanjug reported. The runway at 
Pristina's airport was also hit, the independent Beta news agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong detonations late Monday in the northern city of Novi Sad  
sent an orange fireball into the night sky, Serbian state 
television showed. Tanjug said the power station at the city oil 
refinery had been hit, causing ``enormous damage'' to oil 
installations, depots and a major pipeline in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire also caused the emission of poisonous fumes, forcing  
about 300 from a nearby settlement to flee, Tanjug said. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian TV said two NATO planes were shot down during their  
attack on the Novi Sad area Monday night. But NATO spokesman Lt. 
Col. Michael Kaemmerer denied the report, saying all planes had 
returned to their bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Beta also said missiles had struck the airport at Nis,  
headquarters of the army corps responsible for military operations 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Three powerful explosions were also heard northeast of Belgrade  
near Pancevo early today, Tanjug said. 
</P>
<P>
	In central Serbia, Tanjug said a TV relay tower was downed near  
Kragujevac, interrupting the reception of TV and radio programs. 
Two powerful explosions were also heard near the central city of 
Kraljevo, Beta reported. The town crisis center said a nearby 
barracks was targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton promised an ``undiminished,  
unceasing and unrelenting'' air campaign, saying it would no longer 
be enough for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to just stop 
the killing in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plan is to persist until we prevail,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Milder weather was little comfort for the tens of thousands of  
refugees who continued to pour out of Kosovo. The U.N. refugee 
agency said the number of ethnic Albanians reaching neighboring 
countries had risen to nearly 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half have taken shelter in Albania, one of Europe's  
poorest countries. Albania offered Monday to take more refugees 
from Macedonia to prevent Western nations from dispersing them to 
countries far from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Macedonia, conditions remained dire at a makeshift refugee  
camp at the border town of Blace, where thousands were living in 
shelters of plastic and blankets in a muddy, fetid border area. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are too many people in that small concentrated area for  
safety and also for sanitation and health concerns,'' said Chris 
Thomas of the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Monday, 239,000 refugees had arrived in Albania, 120,000  
in Macedonia and 35,000 in Montenegro, the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees said. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief flights carrying 200 tons of food and other emergency  
supplies were scheduled to fly into Albania and Macedonia, NATO 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It announced plans by many member-states to temporarily take in  
110,000 refugees to ease the pressure on Yugoslavia's neighbors. 
Airlifts began Monday to Turkey and Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, NATO Air Commodore David Wilby said Monday  
the alliance would take advantage of better weather over Kosovo to 
accelerate its attacks on Serb and Yugoslav forces accused of 
systematically expelling ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will focus our attention on fielded forces in Kosovo,''  
Wilby said. ``We will disrupt Serbian military operations on the 
ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has agreed to send 24 Apache helicopters, 2,600  
troops and a missile launching system to Albania to give NATO the 
ability to directly attack Serb troops and tanks in Kosovo, where 
more than 2,000 people have died over the past 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Deploying low-flying attack helicopters and support troops in  
Albania would mark a substantial escalation of the NATO campaign to 
try to force Milosevic to agree to a U.S.-backed peace deal and an 
autonomy pact with the Kosovo Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Human Rights Watch reported Monday that Baton Haxhiu, editor in  
chief of Koha Ditore, the Albanian-language newspaper in Pristina, 
was alive and well. NATO officials earlier said he had been 
reported executed.

<HEADLINE> Actress Lucille Lortel Dies at 98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucille Lortel, who earned the title ``Queen of  
off-Broadway'' for bringing innovative new actors, playwrights and 
productions to the American stage, died Sunday. She was 98. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lortel, whose career in theater spanned more than 70 years,  
produced or co-produced about 500 plays, five of which were 
nominated for Tony Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lortel, born Louise Wadler, began her own acting career in  
the 1920s and made her Broadway debut in 1925 with a small role in 
George Bernard Shaw's ``Caesar and Cleopatra,'' starring Helen 
Hayes and Lionel Atwill. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1947, she was asked by the actor Canada Lee and playwright  
Philip Huston to help find a place and audience for a staged 
reading of a new play, ``The Painted Wagon,'' and the 
still-thriving White Barn Theater was born in Westport, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, her husband gave her the Theatre de Lys -- now called  
the Lucille Lortel Theater -- in Greenwich Village as a 24th 
anniversary gift. Its first production was a hugely popular 
adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's and Kurt Weill's ``Threepenny 
Opera'' that made off-Broadway famous. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lortel's eye for and confidence in young talent boosted the  
careers of countless actors, composers, designers, directors and 
playwrights. She established numerous funds and fellowships to 
further the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you love the theater, you must be innovative,'' she once  
said. ``You must try new ideas and new faces. The costs are lower 
off-Broadway, so you can afford to take a chance, and you must take 
a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White Barn, Ms. Lortel nurtured performers such as Eva  
Marie Saint and Zero Mostel and staged plays by Edward Albee, 
Samuel Beckett and Sean O'Casey. Peter Falk and George Peppard also 
performed there. 
</P>
<P>
	When Marc Blitzstein's adaptation of ``Threepenny Opera'' became  
a success at the Theatre de Lys, ultimately running for seven 
years, Ms. Lortel became frustrated: She wanted to stage more plays 
at the theater. 
</P>
<P>
	She persuaded the American National Theater and Academy to back  
an experimental matinee series, which began in 1956 with a verse 
adaptation of Alan Paton's novel ``Cry the Beloved Country'' and 
ran for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The series featured a dramatization of Langston Hughes poems  
called ``Shakespeare in Harlem''; adaptations of poetic works by 
Robert Frost and Archibald MacLeish; and performances of rarely 
seen plays by William Inge and Tennessee Williams. It presented 
actors such as Richard Burton and Helen Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1964, Ms. Lortel oversaw the first U.S. production of a play  
by South African playwright Athol Fugard. ``Blood Knot'' starred 
James Earl Jones and J.D. Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lortel's productions of ``A Walk in the Woods,'' by Lee  
Blessing; ``Angels Fall,'' by Lanford Wilson; ``As Is,'' by William 
Hoffman; ``Blood Knot;'' and ``Sarafina!'' another South African 
import, were nominated for Tonys but didn't win. They all were 
produced on Broadway or moved there. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lortel was inducted into the Theater Hall of Fame in 1990. A  
tribute to her career is on permanent display at the archives of 
the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Matrix'' became the highest-earning  
film to open during an Easter weekend, helping jump-start Keanu 
Reeves' career as an action star and yanking the industry out of 
its post-''Titanic'' funk. 
</P>
<P>
	The surreal sci-fi film snapped the record for an April debut by  
earning $27.8 million at North American theaters, industry figures 
showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Matrix'' easily beat the two closest movies. The  
teen-oriented ``10 Things I Hate About You'' finished second with 
$8.3 million and the Steve Martin-Goldie Hawn comedy ``The 
Out-Of-Towners'' finishing third with $8.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Matrix'' helped propel the box office to only its second  
weekend this year with a higher overall gross than the year before, 
when ``Titanic'' was sailing strong. 
</P>
<P>
	It also provided a lift to Reeves, whose career had been  
foundering since he appeared opposite Sandra Bullock in the popular 
action movie ``Speed'' in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Once considered for summer release, ``The Matrix'' was slotted  
for April by Warner Bros., putting it safely away from the ``Star 
Wars'' juggernaut on May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we approached the opening, we were strongly skewed toward  
males,'' said Warner Bros. distribution head Dan Fellman. ``As the 
weekend progressed, more and more females came to the movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the romantic comedy ``Forces of Nature'' with Ben  
Affleck and Ms. Bullock, finished in fifth place with $6.2 million, 
while Ron Howard's ``EDtv'' plummeted 47 percent in its second week 
to finish sixth with $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Still enjoying a warm Oscar glow, best-picture winner  
``Shakespeare in Love'' had $3.1 million for seventh, and 
foreign-language winner ``Life is Beautiful'' had $2.7 million for 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandwiched between the Oscar winners was the low-budget animated  
kid's movie ``Doug's 1st Movie'' in eighth with $3.1 million. ``The 
Mod Squad'' tumbled 58 percent in the second week to 10th place 
with $2.6 million.

<HEADLINE>  3 Well-Preserved Inca Mummies Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Archeologists have discovered three  
well-preserved Inca mummies high in the Andes Mountains, the 
National Geographic Society said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The three, relics of an Inca sacrificial ritual, were found  
beneath 5 feet of rock and earth on a burial platform atop 
Argentina's Mount Llullaillaco. The bodies of two girls and a boy 
may have been frozen since being placed there some 500 years ago, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Archeologist Johan Reinhard said in a statement that CT scans on  
the mummies showed all internal organs intact and blood appeared to 
still be present in the heart and lungs, as if the three had died 
only recently. 
</P>
<P>
	No cause of death was immediately evident, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The expedition included U.S., Argentine and Peruvian scientists  
and was supported by a grant from National Geographic. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said the burial platform held offerings to the  
Inca gods, including 35 gold, silver and shell statues, bundles or 
ornate textiles, moccasins and pottery, some of it still containing 
food. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the female mummies appeared to have been struck by  
lightning, the researchers said, while the others were undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
	The Inca empire once stretched 2,500 miles from present day  
Colombia to central Chile. It collapsed in 1532 with the Spanish 
conquest.

<HEADLINE> Doctors: Farrakhan Is Cancer Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Doctors say Farrakhan cancer-free    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan is  
recovering well from surgery and is free of cancer, his doctors 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is absolutely no evidence of cancer in his body,'' said  
Abdul Alim Muhammad, health minister for the Nation of Islam. ``I 
would go out on that limb to say the minister is cured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Alfred Goldson, radiology oncology head at Howard University  
Hospital where Farrakhan is being treated, agreed that all tests 
show Farrakhan to be free of cancer that was first diagnosed eight 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan's score on a prostate specific antigen test was 0.1 --  
a level shown by men who are free of cancer, Muhammad said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nation of Islam leader was rushed to the hospital last week  
and had surgery to correct an inflammation caused by the cancer 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad said the surgery took 35 minutes and that Farrakhan was  
awake and alert less than an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad said the news conference was scheduled to ``correct  
some of the distortions and outright fabrications'' relating to 
Farrakhan's cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some published reports painted Farrakhan's condition as grave  
and said Nation of Islam officials were extremely worried about his 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in high spirits. He looks good and he's eating well. He  
has a full head of hair,'' Muhammad said. ``I want to try and deal 
with all the rumors that have been out there. He's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan could be discharged from the hospital this week,  
Muhammad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nation of Islam officials said Farrakhan would continue his  
three-month sabbatical and would use his experience to spread the 
word that prostate cancer is more common and aggressive in black 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	``The minister wants to do all that he can to make sure our  
people know the value of early detection,'' said Leonard F. 
Muhammad, Farrakhan's chief of staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among U.S.  
men and the second-deadliest, behind lung cancer. This year, 
184,500 U.S. men will be diagnosed with the disease and more than 
39,200 will die from it, the American Cancer Society estimates.

<HEADLINE>  US Won't Match Yugoslav Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With NATO airstrikes pummeling Yugoslavia,  
President Clinton said today that President Slobodan Milosevic 
``could end it now'' by withdrawing his forces from Kosovo, 
accepting terms of a peace accord and allowing hundreds of 
thousands of ethnic Albanians to return to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration refused to match Yugoslavia's promise of a  
unilateral cease-fire in Kosovo to mark Orthodox Easter. Reciting 
the terms spelled out by Clinton, National Security Council 
spokesman David Leavy said, ``NATO operations will continue until 
these conditions are met.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also was expected to announce that it would  
accept up to 20,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees and house them at the 
U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to say again, the United States would never choose  
force as anything other than a last option,'' the president said in 
a Roosevelt Room ceremony where he urged Congress to expand federal 
hate-crime laws to include offenses based on sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Briefly addressing the crisis in Kosovo, Clinton laid out terms  
that he said Milosevic must accept to end the allies' airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Milosevic could end it now by withdrawing his military  
police and paramilitary forces,'' Clinton said. Further, he said 
Milosevic must accept the deployment of an international security 
force ``to protect not only the Kosovar Albanians, most, not all of 
whom are Muslims, but also the Serbians minority in Kosovo. 
Everybody. We're not for anybody's hate crimes. And by making it 
possible for all the refugees to return. And to move toward a 
political framework based on the accords reached in France.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States continued to express opposition to sending  
American ground troops to Kosovo. ``I can tell you once again that 
he has no intention of introducing ground troops,'' press secretary 
Joe Lockhart said. ``If people are confused, they should not be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is sending 2,600 troops into Albania to  
support attack helicopters, but none are destined for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, 1,200 Marines aboard ships in the Aegean Sea began moving  
ashore at a Greek port and will establish a refugee camp for 
displaced Kosovars near the Macedonian village of Cegrane, a U.S. 
defense official said. The official, speaking anonymously, said the 
Marines received their orders Monday and soon will be providing 
food, water, medical services and shelter to thousands of refugees. 
The Marines are from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which has 
been in the Aegean for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe a sustained air campaign can accomplish the  
objectives we have laid out,'' Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Clinton was contemplating sending ground troops to the  
Serbian province, Albright said ``the president has no plans or 
intention for ground forces'' as part of a combat force in Kosovo. 
The administration, however, has committed troops for a NATO 
peacekeeping force, if a peace is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Albright and the foreign ministers of Britain,  
France, Germany, Italy and Russia agreed to meet in Brussels, 
Belgium, within a few days to assess the NATO campaign and reaffirm 
their determination to forge a settlement for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration gave no sign of backing away from its  
demands on Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``A commitment to cease killing and a Kosovo denied its freedom  
and devoid of its people is not acceptable,'' Clinton said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at Brookings Institution, Albright said: ``We are going  
to continue in this intensive air campaign and we will do so until 
all the Serb forces are out'' of Kosovo, hundreds of thousands of 
ethnic Albanian refugees are returned to their homes and Milosevic 
consents to a peace plan that would station a NATO peacekeeping 
force in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration demands that the ethnic Albanians be allowed  
to return goes beyond NATO's original goal of keeping more from 
being forced out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Today at NATO headquarters in Brussels, U.S. Army Gen. Henry  
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held an unannounced 
meeting with his counterparts from several allied countries to 
discuss the air campaign, Pentagon officials said. The officials 
would not discuss details of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright ticked off the U.S. demands in a speech Monday night  
honoring Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, who is president of the 
war-crimes tribunal for Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said Milosevic must pull military, police and  
paramilitary forces out of Kosovo, return all refugees to their 
homes, accept the deployment of an international security force in 
the province and create a democratic political framework in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Strongly hinting that Milosevic would be held accountable for  
war crimes, Albright said: ``There can be no question that war 
crimes and crimes against humanity are being committed in Kosovo. 
Nor can there be doubt that the orders to carry out these acts are 
coming from the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With an estimated 800 people an hour fleeing the Serbian  
province, which is part of Yugoslavia, the State Department now 
estimates close to 400,000 more ethnic Albanians have been routed, 
often by Serb troops -- or even Serb neighbors -- since the NATO 
attack began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called for private donations to Kosovar refugees and  
offered haven for up to 20,000 at the outset. Pentagon officials 
said a refugee camp likely would be set up at the U.S. base at 
Guantanamo, Cuba, which the United States considers U.S. territory 
and has been used to care for Haitian and Cuban refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Other NATO countries are offering to take in up to 80,000 more.  
</P>
<P>
	Moved by Milosevic's campaign from the original goal of simply  
stopping ethnic repression in Kosovo, the Clinton administration 
insists the Yugoslav leader will not be permitted to succeed; that 
the resettlement is only temporary and the refugees will go home 
again. Officials also deny the sustained NATO bombardment was 
having the unintended result of helping Milosevic achieve his goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Appealing directly to Americans to help the victims of  
Milosevic's ``expulsion policy,'' Clinton announced a toll-free 
number, 1-800-USAID-RELIEF, that people can call to donate money to 
nongovernmental relief efforts for ethnic Albanians expelled from 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing all we can, we need more help,'' Clinton said. He  
said $150 million in U.S. government funds has been committed to 
humanitarian relief in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Iverson Returns from Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Answer is back.  
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson, trying to shake a bruised thigh and a feud with  
76ers coach Larry Brown, scored 27 points in 46 minutes tonight as 
Philadelphia beat the Milwaukee Bucks 95-87. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson, the NBA's leading scorer, had not played since  
exchanging words with Brown on the sideline Friday night against 
Cleveland. He had played with a severely bruised right thigh since 
a collision with the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal on March 19 before 
getting benched against the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson did not play the opening 2:03 of the second quarter of  
an 85-80 loss to Cleveland after going 0-for-7 in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	When Brown told Iverson to go back into the game, Iverson,  
according to courtside reporters, muttered, ``It's about time you 
put me back in,'' and used an obscenity. Brown sent him back to the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Iverson denied he cursed Brown, but the coach  
disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``You all heard it,'' Brown said. ``My team heard it. The guy I  
substituted for heard it. But again, it was over. It was one little 
thing, and it was over at halftime. Now we've got to get him back 
healthy playing as well as he was playing before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown and Iverson came out of their latest spat agreeing on two  
things: They will have more disagreements, and Iverson sat out the 
second half against the Cavs and Sunday's game in Toronto because 
he was injured -- not because of their feud. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he intended to play Iverson in the second half Friday  
night, but Iverson told him his leg stiffened and he couldn't play. 
</P>
<P>
	To anyone who questioned whether he was sitting out to get back  
at his coach, Iverson said, ``They're out of their mind I don't 
even worry about those people, because they probably don't know a 
damn thing about basketball anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute with Brown was the latest in a long list for  
Iverson, nicknamed ``The Answer'' for a shoe that is named after 
him. The two quarreled last season over playing time, coaching 
style, missed practices and lateness. 
</P>
<P>
	They renewed their feud on March 11, when Iverson missed  
practice without an excuse. Brown let the team decide how to handle 
it, and followed their recommendation not to fine Iverson. 
</P>
<P>
	On another front, Brown and Iverson's bodyguard, Terry Royster,  
made up after Brown had kicked Royster out of the locker room 
following the Cleveland game. The two talked after practice Monday 
and settled their differences.

<HEADLINE> E. Coli Blamed in Minn. Beef Recall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Authorities are investigating an outbreak of  
illness from E. coli-contaminated ground beef after at least six 
guests became ill at a Maine ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking into whether or not other states may be involved  
as well,'' said Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the federal Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak has been linked to meat recalled from Rochester  
Meats Inc. in Rochester, Minn., the Agriculture Department said 
Monday. Beth Gaston, spokeswoman for the food safety and inspection 
office, said scientists found ``genetic fingerprints'' linking a 
strain of E. coli ``in samples of the meat from Rochester Meats to 
the patients in Maine who have become ill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On USDA orders, Rochester Meats Inc., of Rochester, Minn., which  
supplies meat for restaurants and institutions, recalled 170,780 
pounds of product last week. That's the equivalent of one day's 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said Monday they were unaware of any link  
between their product and illnesses. ``USDA has not confirmed that 
with us,'' said Rochester Meats spokeswoman Joanne Randen. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled products include frozen ground-beef patties, ground  
chuck patties, chopped beefsteak, beef patties, meat for chili, 
beef patty mix and pure beef bulk. 
</P>
<P>
	The meat was produced Dec. 1 and sold in 10-, 15- and 20-pound  
packages. They are marked with the Julian code 8335 and 
Establishment 8999 in the inspection mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine officials had a tally of seven E. coli illnesses, but USDA  
has not confirmed the seventh was a genetic match to the Rochester 
Meats outbreak, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The people became ill while visiting the Sunday River Ski Resort  
in Bethel, Maine, said Dr. Kathleen Gensheimer, state 
epidemiologist for the Maine Department of Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The first illness was reported Feb. 11, and three people were  
hospitalized, Gensheimer said. Everybody in the group, which 
included four children, has recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible that other people became ill but treated  
themselves instead of seeking medical attention, Gensheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 cases in the United  
States every year of infections attributed to E. coli 0157:H7, the 
strain in the Maine case, according to the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingested by humans, E. coli bacteria can cause serious illness  
and sometimes death, especially in children and the elderly. 
Symptoms include chills and bloody diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident is the second outbreak in the country related to  
contaminated meat in recent months. Bil Mar Foods in Zeeland, 
Mich., recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and deli meats in 
December because of possible contamination with listeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen deaths and six miscarriages and stillbirths have been  
linked to the Bil Mar recall.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Hot Since Deadline Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Since picking up four players hours before the  
March 23 trading deadline, Detroit has been unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
	That can only mean trouble for the rest of the NHL -- the Red  
Wings were pretty good to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
	Good, but not great.  
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings, winners of the last two Stanley Cup  
championships, had losing streaks of three, four and five games. 
But since acquiring Chris Chelios, Wendell Clark, Ulf Samuelsson 
and goalie Bill Ranford at the trade deadline, the team has won 
seven straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has really revived everybody,'' said goalie Chris Osgood,  
who has won five of those seven games, one of them his third 
shutout of the season. ``We're a totally different team the last 
two weeks. We're excited again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the newcomers appear to have added was a bit of nastiness.  
That was on display early in Monday night's 3-2 win over the 
Anaheim Mighty Ducks when Darren McCarty drew two minutes for 
roughing just 35 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty, who had missed the 10 previous games with an injury,  
has never been a wallflower. But until the new guys showed up, the 
Red Wings couldn't afford to use him as an enforcer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've proved in the past that you have to use the regular  
season to set things up for the playoffs,'' McCarty said. ``Right 
now, we're gearing ourselves up for the postseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings are attempting to become the first team to win  
three consecutive Stanley Cups since the New York Islanders won 
four straight (1980-83) 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit (41-30-6) is the No. 3 team in the Western Conference  
with almost no chance of overhauling first-place Dallas. That means 
the Red Wings probably will draw Anaheim or St. Louis in the first 
round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mighty Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg wouldn't mind if it was his  
team. He respects Detroit, but Hartsburg thinks maybe too much is 
being made of the Red Wings' recent acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's a bit of a slap at the other guys who were  
here,'' Hartsburg said. ``They were a pretty good hockey team 
before the trades. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, if we come back here for the playoffs, maybe we'll have  
learned something about how it's going to be. They've been on a 
roll, no question about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been almost storybook stuff since the new players  
arrived. Clark has scored four goals, including the winner against 
Philadelphia on March 28. Chelios, who has been paired on defense 
with Nicklas Lidstrom, has played almost 25 minutes a game. And he 
added a goal in the Red Wings' 6-1 victory over Tampa Bay on March 
26. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranford, 5-18-3 for the season, has won both his starts since  
coming to Detroit as Osgood's backup. Samuelsson, recovering from a 
broken foot, is expected to be ready for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can never tell, but the guys have helped out,'' said  
Detroit coach Scotty Bowman, who is shooting for an NHL-best ninth 
Stanley Cup. ``It's given us a chance to play different guys, where 
we might not have had that luxury before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big trades don't always work. Sometimes the new guys don't fit  
in. Yet Detroit's four newcomers were made welcome at once. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are not just average guys,'' Detroit forward Martin  
Lapointe said. ``They are world-class players. They adapt to 
pressure well. They would fit in well on any team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lapointe noted that Clark, Chelios and Ranford all earned the  
respect of the others on the very first day by working hard in 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should see Billy in practice,'' Lapointe said. ``You can't  
measure that.''

<HEADLINE> Gotti Plea Is Latest Mob Mess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Gotti family's reign atop the Gambino crime  
family provides an apt metaphor for the mob's past and future: It 
started with a bang on a city street and finished with a whimper in 
a suburban courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	John ``Junior'' Gotti's surprise guilty plea Monday in  
Westchester County was another big blow to New York's five Mafia 
families, where age and incessant prosecution are taking a 
devastating toll against the once-mighty mob. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti, who pleaded guilty to racketeering, bribery, extortion  
and other charges, is the highest-profile mobster to take a fall 
lately. But the son of the jailed-for-life ``Dapper Don'' is hardly 
the only one. 
</P>
<P>
	Another top Gambino family leader, John ``Jackie Nose'' D'Amico,  
also pleaded guilty in the case. In January 1998, top Gambino aide 
Nicholas ``Little Nick'' Corozzo -- once considered next in line for 
family leadership -- was sentenced to nearly six years in jail for 
running a Florida loansharking operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DeFede, the acting boss of the Luchese family, pleaded  
guilty in December to an extortion scheme in New York City's 
Garment District. Colombo boss Andrew Russo was found guilty of 
obstruction of justice three months ago. And Dominic ``Quiet Dom'' 
Cirillo, who succeeded Vincent ``Chin'' Gigante atop the Genovese 
family, had his reign cut short by a heart attack last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to be the boss of a family, you have to pay the  
price,'' ex-FBI mob investigator Bruce Mouw said earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gottis represent much of what's gone wrong with the mob,  
experts say. Even if John Sr. runs the family from prison, much of 
its lucrative business is gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Gotti ascended to power after the Dec. 16, 1985, hit  
on his predecessor, ``Big Paul'' Castellano, outside the Sparks 
Steak House in Manhattan. Castellano mixed mob business with 
legitimate interests, signaling a change in the traditional mob 
methodology. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gotti was a stone gangster, and a charismatic one. His  
ascension signaled a return to the old, violent ways. His public 
persona -- $2,000 suits, hand-painted ties, expensive tastes -- made 
him America's best-known gangster since Al Capone. 
</P>
<P>
	It also ensured his downfall, as he quickly became the FBI's No.  
1 target. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Gotti's 1992 murder and racketeering conviction, he  
installed his son as head of the family, with veteran Gambino 
leaders assigned to assist him. But the family's influence dwindled 
under Junior. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gotti case was typical of today's mob prosecution, with made  
men once sworn to omerta -- the oath of silence -- lining up as 
government witnesses. The elder Gotti had his Sammy Gravano; the 
younger Gotti faced implication from ex-Luchese acting boss 
Alphonse ``Little Al'' D'Arco and mobsters Dominic ``Fat Dom'' 
Borghese and Willie Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the mob's veteran leadership lifers -- men like the elder  
Gotti, Gigante, Gravano, Carmine ``The Snake'' Persico, Cirillo -- 
are aging, imprisoned or working for the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Its generation of replacements, mobsters and mob experts have  
agreed, is inexperienced, unskilled and undisciplined -- more 
interested in making mayhem than money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best and the brightest are not taking leadership roles,''  
says Ronald Goldstock, former head of the state Organized Crime 
Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The bosses aren't getting any younger, either. The reputed head  
of the Bonanno family, Joseph Massino, is 55, making him the 
youngest of the alleged bosses of the five families. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the mob's younger generation other than young Gotti have  
attracted much government attention -- another sign of its 
diminished capacity. One, Genovese family street boss Liborio 
``Barney'' Bellomo, 40, is currently in the second year of a 
10-year sentence for extortion and murder conspiracy.

<HEADLINE> Sears Settles Battery Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. will pay $985,000  
and extend free replacement warranties on some of its car batteries 
to settle allegations it passed off used batteries as new. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears, which did not admit fault, also agreed to add five months  
to the free-replacement warrantees it offered on Exide batteries it 
sold before April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many instances, customers who thought they were buying new  
batteries were in fact buying batteries Sears had previously used 
to test care electrical systems or batteries that had been returned 
to Sears by other customers,'' Attorney General Robert Butterworth 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears denies the allegations. The store had problems with the  
quality of Exide batteries a few years ago that were resolved, said 
Sears spokesman David Albritton. 
</P>
<P>
	Exide Corp. is the target of an investigation by the attorney  
general for allegedly selling defective, used and mislabeled auto 
batteries in Florida, as well as misleading investors and 
improperly crediting customer accounts.

<HEADLINE> Kazak Currency Continues Nosedive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) -- The Kazak currency dipped to nearly  
half of last week's value in hectic trading Tuesday, although 
ordinary citizens seemed to heed the government's appeals and 
refrain from rushing to convert their savings into dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazakstan's government decided Sunday to stop buying up the  
national currency, the tenge, to bolster its price, because the 
policy was depleting the Central Asian nation's hard currency 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was seen as signaling that damage in Kazakstan was  
beginning to mount from the economic crisis in neighboring Russia, 
its largest trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
	The tenge, which had held steady at about 88 to the dollar for  
months, has been dropping since the announcement. It dipped to 150 
to the dollar when trading opened Tuesday, but the government 
announced at the end of the day that the average rate in Tuesday's 
trading was 138 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazakstan's Central Bank chairman Kadyrzhan Damitov said even  
that rate was unrealistically low and that the drop was driven by 
traders' nervousness and panic selling. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinary Kazaks seemed calmer, and a rush of withdrawals from  
the nation's main bank ebbed Tuesday, National Savings Bank chief 
Karim Masimov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people in this former Soviet republic had rushed to the  
bank Monday to take out their tenge deposits and convert them to 
dollars. Panic dollar buying on Monday drove the tenge's black 
market rate to 200 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The government tried to quell the panic by promising to convert  
all bank savings into hard currency at a highly favorable rate if 
depositors agreed to freeze their accounts for nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	But the International Monetary Fund envoy to Kazakstan, Paul  
Ross, urged the government to renege on that promise Tuesday, and 
said Kazak depositors should pay the price for their misplaced 
trust in the national currency. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Almaty, Ross also urged the government  
not to freeze consumer energy prices as many impoverished Kazaks 
have demanded, saying that would hurt producers and the overall 
economy.

<HEADLINE> Nagano Residents Sue IOC for $7M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Three residents of Nagano sued the IOC and its  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch today, demanding the return of 
nearly $7 million in taxpayer money used in the campaign to get 
last year's Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the plaintiffs, former assemblyman Kaoru Iwata, said the  
lawsuit is ``the only way to impeach the injustice'' since the IOC 
and Samaranch will not punish nine IOC members suspected by the 
Japanese Olympic Committee of violating IOC rules by receiving 
``excessive'' entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese bidders have said they wined and dined visiting IOC  
officials, entertaining some with geisha. 
</P>
<P>
	Iwata said Samaranch was given a painting and a sword worth  
$8,000 by the Nagano bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has said it has the painting at its headquarters in  
Lausanne, Switzerland, but denies having received the sword. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no limit on the value of gifts to Samaranch because he  
accepts them on behalf of the IOC and does not vote in the 
selection of host cities. IOC officials are limited to gifts under 
$150. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC marketing director Michael Payne said in Lausanne he was  
``slightly surprised'' to hear of the suit, given the amount of 
financial support that the IOC gave the organizing committee during 
the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan spent $16.7 million on its campaign to win the right to  
host the games. Nagano state and local governments put up $6.9 
million of that total, while the rest came from private or 
corporate contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs argue that the IOC should not have allowed its  
members to accept the excessive entertainment knowing that much of 
the money used to pay for it had come from taxpayers. The 
plaintiffs want to the IOC to return the amount taxpayers 
contributed. 
</P>
<P>
	Iwata's group has already sued Nagano prefecture governor, the  
chairman of the Japan Olympic Committee and Nagano's mayor to force 
them to further specify how the money was spent. 
</P>
<P>
	JOC secretary general Yushiro Yagi, who led an investigation  
into Nagano's bid, said in February that the nine might have broken 
IOC rules while visiting Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagi refused to identify the nine or detail their conduct,  
although he said at that time that he would report it to IOC 
headquarters in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC last month rejected Quebec City's demand for  
compensation to cover the cost of its failed bid for the 2002 
Winter Games. The city requested $8 million in compensation last 
month after an IOC investigation determined that some of its 
members received improper gifts from organizers of the successful 
bid by Salt Lake City.

<HEADLINE> Surgery Sidelines Marlins' Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins outfielder Cliff Floyd will be  
sidelined a little longer than expected with his latest injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd underwent surgery today to repair torn cartilage in his  
left knee, and is expected to miss another 2-4 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, 26, went on the disabled list for the fourth time in his  
career March 30 because of the knee injury, which was initially 
diagnosed as a sprain. Swelling persisted, and the tear was 
discovered Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins are counting on Floyd to anchor their lineup. He  
avoided injuries last year, hitting .282 with 22 home runs and 90 
RBIs, and was rewarded in January with a four-year, $19 million 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Preston Wilson will fill in for Floyd in left field.  
</P>
<P>
	``He put up big numbers last year,'' Wilson said. ``No one  
person can fill what he can do. Everybody who's out there is going 
to have to pull together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, 24, spent most of last season at Triple-A Charlotte  
after being acquired in a trade with the New York Mets. Manager 
John Boles said Wilson has the potential to eventually hit 30 
homers and steal 30 bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can cry and moan about Cliff not being in the lineup, but  
there's always a bright side,'' Boles said. ``We had been trying to 
trade for Preston, and now we've got him, so let's play him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd will be on crutches for two or three days before he begins  
rehabilitation.

<HEADLINE> Law Enforcers Put on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- Seven current and former law enforcement  
officials committed ``intentional misdeeds'' in their investigation 
of a 1983 murder case, a special prosecutor told jurors today. 
</P>
<P>
	Special state's attorney William Kunkle said a ``long and  
tortured history'' of wrongdoing by police and prosecutors led to a 
death sentence for Rolando Cruz, who spent years behind bars before 
being freed when a key witness changed his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sorry history of this prosecution is a history of  
intentional misdeeds, a history of official misconduct and lies,'' 
Kunkle said in his opening statement as the trial for the seven got 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
	The three former DuPage County prosecutors -- one of them now a  
judge -- and four sheriff's deputies are accused of lying, creating 
evidence and conspiring to railroad Cruz for the 1983 rape and 
bludgeoning death of 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico. She was home 
sick from school when she was taken from her parents' house in the 
southwest Chicago suburb of Naperville. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jeanine's parents, Pat and Tom Nicarico, sitting in a rear  
row out of the jury's sight, Kunkle said that much of the evidence 
at the trial would come ``from the mouths of these very 
defendants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to hear from Rolando Cruz and you're going to  
have to evaluate his testimony,'' said Kunkle, who was appointed to 
avoid a conflict of interest for the state's attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Kunkle acknowledged that the murder and rape of Jeanine was a  
heinous act, but warned jurors not to concentrate on that. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no worse crime, but that isn't the issue,'' Kunkle  
said. ``The issue in this case is the deeds and the methods used to 
convict Rolando Cruz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys argue their clients are the real victims of  
overzealous prosecution and suggest that Cruz was indeed a killer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kunkle's entire case is premised on the concept that Rolando  
Cruz was innocent and wrongfully convicted of Jeanine Nicarico's 
murder and therefore this jury should feel sorry for Rolando and 
decide these men did something wrong,'' Terry Ekl, attorney for 
ex-prosecutor Thomas Knight, said before trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demonstrating that Rolando Cruz actually beat a murder that he  
had participated in will eliminate any possibility that this jury 
will somehow feel sorry for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz was a small-time troublemaker and burglary suspect from  
neighboring Aurora when he enticed cops with tidbits -- true and 
false -- about the crime before he was charged. He did not testify 
before juries that convicted him in 1985 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz will try to convince 12 jurors that he did not give  
detectives a now-infamous statement about a ``vision'' or ``dream'' 
that allegedly included incriminating details about the crime. The 
statement became a cornerstone of the prosecution, but Kunkle 
contends it was concocted by desperate prosecutors and detectives 
who mistakenly believed they had the right man. 
</P>
<P>
	The detectives never wrote a report about the statement, and it  
was not revealed to defense attorneys until the eve of the first 
trial for Cruz and fellow defendant Alejandro Hernandez, who was 
also twice convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz was acquitted in 1995 in a third trial at which a sheriff's  
department supervisor reversed his previous testimony, casting 
doubt on the legitimacy of the vision statement. Charges against 
Hernandez were later dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Knight, now in private practice, the defendants are two  
other former DuPage County assistant state's attorneys: Patrick 
King, now an assistant U.S. attorney; and Robert Kilander, now a 
DuPage County circuit judge; and four sheriff's department 
officers: detectives Thomas Vosburgh and Dennis Kurzawa and Lts. 
James Montesano and Robert Winkler. 
</P>
<P>
	All are charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice and  
conspiracy to commit official misconduct. The police face 
additional charges, including perjury.

<HEADLINE>  Airstrikes Complicate China Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the  
United States comes at a time of particularly tense relations 
between Beijing and Washington, including a stark dispute over the 
bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	China has called for an immediate halt to the NATO airstrikes.  
And Chinese leaders even considered postponing Zhu's six-city, 
nine-day visit that was beginning on Tuesday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Zhu still hopes to close a deal with the Clinton  
administration to allow Beijing to join the World Trade 
Organization, which regulates international trade, after 13 years 
of trying. 
</P>
<P>
	In advance of his coming to Washington on Thursday, U.S. and  
Chinese trade negotiators worked furiously to try to strike a deal 
that could be announced during the visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu also will visit Denver, Chicago, New York and Boston,  
courting the political and business elite at each stop. He may 
observe financial markets, possibly the New York Stock Exchange and 
the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	China hopes to attract the foreign investment needed to help its  
slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	While in Washington, Zhu was to dine with Clinton on Thursday  
evening, hold meetings with officials of the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund and meet on Friday with a handful of 
lawmakers back early from the two-week congressional recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that they will understand better the importance of  
China-U.S. relations,'' said Yu Shuning, a spokesman for the 
Chinese Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism in Congress of China's human rights record is  
bipartisan and widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the tensions are concerns -- particularly among  
Republicans who see it as a good 2000 campaign issue -- over alleged 
Chinese nuclear espionage, Pentagon reports of a missile buildup 
against Taiwan and alleged Chinese campaign contributions to 
Clinton's 1996 re-election campagin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese, in turn, resent a U.S. initiative to provide a  
missile-defense shield for Japan and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	China also strongly opposes U.S. sponsorship at the annual U.N.  
Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva of a resolution 
condemning Beijing's human rights record -- a step taken by the 
administration only after extensive prodding from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent Communist Party-ordered crackdown on dissidents who  
formed an opposition party helped solidify anti-China sentiment in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, it will not be an easy task,'' Zhu told reporters  
in advance of his trip. ``But I will go anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, in an interview published in Tuesday's editions of the Wall  
Street Journal, Zhu asserted that the administration had recently 
backed away from closing a deal on trade ``due to pressure from 
Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is still in its spring recess -- probably sparing Zhu  
the harshest of criticism of China's human-rights record while he 
is here. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to work with the premier, we want to advance our  
national interests to work with China where we can on areas of 
interest,'' said James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman. He 
cited recent developments in North Korea, India and Pakistan's 
nuclear programs and international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	As to China's membership in the WTO, Rubin said: ``If the  
Chinese meet the objective criteria, we would like to see a 
situation where our exporters can get access to the Chinese 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China has been trying to join the WTO, and its predecessor, the  
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only are the meetings being eclipsed by the bombing campaign  
in Yugoslavia, but the NATO airstrikes have soured the atmosphere 
for the visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders have condemned the bombings as a violation of  
the U.N. charter and interference in a sovereign country's affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	China's state-run media have been unrestrained in their  
criticism. The Yancheng Evening News, a popular newspaper published 
in southern China, even doctored a picture of Clinton to make him 
look like Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Communist Party line from Beijing comparing the  
United States to Nazi Germany makes it difficult to accept that the 
People's Republic of China is doing everything possible to smooth 
over relations,'' said Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Cox, chairman of a special bipartisan congressional  
committee that concluded that China has benefited militarily from 
20 years of espionage and U.S. satellite exports, said he's glad 
Zhu didn't postpone his visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world is sufficiently complex that you cannot require  
everyone else to wait on hold while you attend to one specific 
problem in Kosovo,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's determination to go ahead with the visit demonstrates the  
importance Beijing gives to smooth relations with Washington. Zhu 
would like to try to revive the amicability that President Clinton 
and China's President Jiang Zemin shared nine months ago in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu Xiaoming, deputy chief of mission at the Chinese Embassy,  
conceded that ``the climate and the atmosphere right now is not 
that good.'' But he suggested that was even more reason for the 
meetings to take place. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov canceled  
his visit to the White House at the last minute as NATO airstrikes 
got under way March 24.

<HEADLINE> Greek Soccer Team Goes to Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- In a show of solidarity with Yugoslavians  
facing daily air strikes, a top Greek soccer team intends to play 
an exhibition game in Belgrade on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've won many titles on the field, this will be a  
humanitarian title,'' said Dimitris Melissanidis, the president of 
AEK Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	AEK Athens was to leave Greece on Tuesday for its game against  
Partizan in the Yugoslavian capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs welcomed the initiative but they reportedly failed to  
give the Greek team any safety guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
	``What guarantees can we require in a war region?'' Melissanidis  
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greek delegation, composed of 16 volunteer players, club  
officials and politicians, was to spend Tuesday night in Budapest, 
Hungary. They will set off by bus Wednesday, arriving in Belgrade 
shortly before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, which will last one hour, is to be played during the  
Orthodox Holy week in connection with an Easter break in the Greek 
soccer schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Greeks have strongly objected to NATO air strikes against fellow  
Christian Orthodox Serbs, with whom they have friendly relations, 
and have held almost daily street protests around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from gate receipts and television coverage will be  
donated to Yugoslav humanitarian organizations.

<HEADLINE> Russia Decries Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, sounding out  
world leaders' support for declaring a Palestinian state next 
month, heard a firm ``not now'' from Russia on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin greeted Arafat with a bear hug at the  
start of their Kremlin meeting, and said Moscow would continue to 
support the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Russia told Arafat not to declare an independent  
Palestinian state on May 4, when an interim autonomy agreement with 
Israel expires. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been developing better ties with Israel in recent  
years, and has sought not to offend either Israelis or Palestinians 
in the complex Middle East peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat reiterated the Palestinians' right to go their own way  
and declare a state on May 4 in the areas now under Palestinian 
self-rule, or continue negotiations with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't made a final decision yet on the May 4 problem, and  
we are continuing consultations,'' Arafat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said the Palestinians'  
right to create a state was ``indisputable,'' but urged Arafat to 
avoid rushing the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes Palestinian  
statehood and has threatened to counter such a unilateral 
declaration by annexing parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip still 
under Israeli control. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, at a press conference  
after talks with Arafat, proposed that Israel and Palestinians 
extend the five-year interim autonomy period laid out in the peace 
agreements to allow more time for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is officially a co-sponsor of the Mideast peace process,  
which was launched in 1991. But the United States has played a far 
greater role. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat was expected to pay a brief visit to Ukraine later  
Tuesday to hold talks with President Leonid Kuchma.

<HEADLINE> MCI Wants To Enter Wireless Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc. is in negotiations to buy  
Nextel Communications Inc. in another attempt to break into the $33 
billion U.S. wireless telephone business, according to a person 
familiar with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The discussions are still in the early stages and no deal is  
expected for at least a week, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom is the nation's No. 2 provider of long-distance  
calling service, but the only major telephone company without a 
stake in the lucrative and rapidly growing market for wireless 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, MCI WorldCom backed out of a bidding war for  
AirTouch Communications, much to the relief of shareholders who 
were concerned about paying a hefty price -- Vodafone's winning bid 
was worth $56 billion -- so soon after WorldCom's costly purchase of 
MCI Communications last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, however, many of MCI WorldCom's major investors  
support a deal with Nextel even though that would mean taking on 
Nextel's hefty $7 billion debt burden. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can keep (the debt) in mind, but I don't think that  
should prevent them from acquiring Nextel,'' said Max Katcher, 
portfolio manager of the Ameritor Funds, which own 21,000 shares of 
MCI Worldcom. ``They cannot afford to stay out of'' the wireless 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Ebbers, chief executive of MCI WorldCom, has said he  
doesn't want to issue a lot of new stock to acquire another company 
because it would reduce MCI WorldCom's earnings per share -- a key 
measure of a company's value for investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But while that was a big factor in MCI WorldCom's decision to  
withdraw a reported $55 billion bid for AirTouch, it wouldn't be as 
big a consideration in making an offer for Nextel, which has a 
market value of $11.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about a MCI WorldCom-Nextel deal has swirled around  
Wall Street since the AirTouch bidding war ended. News that the 
companies were in ``substantive discussions'' was first reported 
Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal, which said people involved in 
the talks put the odds of a deal at no more than 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pressure on MCI WorldCom is mounting. The number of  
wireless customers in the United States jumped 25 percent last year 
to 69.2 million, according to the Cellular Telecommunications 
Industry Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Nextel, which controls 4 percent of that market, is the last  
major independent wireless phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a great deal of room for expansion there,'' said  
Katcher of Ameritor. Any earnings dilution ``will be overcome with 
improved earnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom's stock fell $2.93 3/4 a share to $89.56 1/4 in Tuesday's  
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market as some investors bailed out, 
but the decline was nothing like the two-day 10 percent drop in 
January that accompanied the bidding war for AirTouch. 
</P>
<P>
	Nextel's stock, which has risen 20 percent over the last two  
weeks on takeover rumors, fell 43 3/4 cents to $39.18 3/4 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	As CEO, Ebbers has built a telecom giant in just three years and  
earned a reputation as a savvy dealmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to see him over paying, and I don't think he  
will,'' said Catherine Jackson, a managing director for Trainer 
Wortham Co., a money management firm that owns 600,000 shares of 
MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who also owns shares of AT&AMP;T and Qwest, said that of  
those three companies, ``I like MCI WorldCom the best -- but there's 
a hole and the hole is wireless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom could try to build its own wireless network, buying  
companies like Omnipoint Corp. and a handful of other technology 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T has taken that route. The No. 1 long-distance company,  
which spent $11.5 billion to acquire McCaw Cellular Communications 
in 1994, spent $1 billion last year and plans to shell out another 
$2 billion this year to expand its network and entice customers 
with its nationwide one-rate wireless plan. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom could also buy one of the Baby Bells, which all  
have extensive wireless operations. But a deal like that would 
likely take years to clear regulatory hurdles -- precious time in a 
fast-growing industry like wireless. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever MCI WorldCom does, investors know they have to do  
something. 
</P>
<P>
	In the future, Jackson said, ``we are all going to be walking  
around New York City or Montana with these wireless devices, and 
MCI WorldCom has got to be there.''

<HEADLINE> Animal Group Claims Lab Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- An animal rights group claimed responsibility  
for ransacking 12 University of Minnesota labs, taking dozens of 
research animals and causing an estimated $1 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Animal Liberation Front said the group  
smashed computers, tipped over lab equipment and wrecked 
microscopes early Monday to protest the use of animals in 
scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said in a communique that 27 pigeons, 48 mice, 36 rats  
and five salamanders were taken out of the labs. The university 
initially estimated that about 75 animals were taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ALF is taking action immediately to free these animals  
from their exploitation,'' group spokesman Kevin Kjonaas said. He 
said the group had found homes for the animals. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials said the damage will seriously impede  
research on Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Researcher Dr. Walter Low said the damage set back the  
Alzheimer's research alone by two years. One of the pieces of 
equipment damaged was an incubator containing brain cells from a 
patients participating in a research project. 
</P>
<P>
	``You begin to have an impact on a patient who's donated their  
cells for us to develop a vaccine, and we no longer have that 
vaccine to offer to that patient,'' Low said. ``That patient has no 
other hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University Police Chief Joy Rikala said investigators are not  
ruling out the possibility that the vandals had inside help. Rikala 
said none of the freed animals are infectious or pose a health 
threat.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Rally / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A late surge in telecommunications shares sent  
Japan's main stock index to its highest close in more than eight 
months today. The U.S. dollar retreated against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 144.93  
points, or 0.89 percent, to end the day at 16,479.71 -- its highest 
close since July 21. On Monday, the average finished up 44.59 
points, or 0.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.06 yen in late trading, down 0.30 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
121.83 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo stock exchange, shares recovered from morning  
losses triggered by profit-taking, as buying of telecoms issues by 
foreign investors in the last half-hour of trading boosted the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was heavy buying in the information technology sector''  
such as Sony and NTT, said Yoshio Watanabe, a manager at the 
futures section of Toyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party might be  
considering an $83 billion supplementary budget this fiscal year 
also fueled the last-minute rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 15.44 points, or 1.18 percent, to 1,322.61. 
The TOPIX closed up 3.00 points, or 0.23 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 568.10 million shares changed hands on the First  
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 558.74 million on 
Monday. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 725 to 474, while 129 
issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar tumbled as Japanese exporters,  
hedging against future weakness in the dollar, sold the U.S. 
currency to repatriate funds quickly and avoid losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite today's dip, the dollar is expected to be supported by  
the continuing turmoil in Yugoslavia, where NATO forces have 
intensified their bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency is often seen as a haven for investors during  
times of international crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.75 yen and 121.82 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.19 yen, down  
from 130.61 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.795 percent from Monday's finish of 1.740 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.04 yen from 100.51 yen.

<HEADLINE> Study: Estrogen May Improve Memory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Post-menopausal women undergoing estrogen  
treatment may also be improving their memories, researchers 
reported today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The study at the Yale University School of Medicine of 46  
post-menopausal women found that estrogen increased activity in 
regions of the brain associated with memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the study did not find memories had improved,  
researchers said estrogen may stimulate the brain to make the type 
of neural connections typically seen in younger people. They 
believe that the increased brain activity should mean an 
accompanying improvement in memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It suggests that the neural circuitry in memory for mature  
individuals ... can be changed'' by estrogen, said Dr. Sally 
Shaywitz, one of the study's authors. ``It is a very hopeful 
sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Production of estrogen, a female hormone, drops sharply after  
women reach menopause. Previous research has found that estrogen 
protects against heart disease, fights brittle bones, decreases the 
risk of colon cancer and may help women live longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies have also suggested that estrogen may reduce the risk of  
Alzheimer's disease. The ability to establish new connections in 
the brain is what is lost with the onset of Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the study said the research was  
significant as another demonstration that estrogens have positive 
effects on certain aspects of mental function. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this study suggests is that what estrogen can do is  
rewire the central nervous system,'' said Dr. Stanley Birge, a 
professor of geriatrics and gerontology at the Washington 
University School of Medicine in St. Louis. ``Perhaps even in the 
70- or 80-year-old individual we have the potential'' for such 
regeneration. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrogen replacement therapy, however, also carries risks.  
Studies show it can increase the risk of breast cancer and 
endometrial cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaywitz said estrogen ``is not some magic pill,'' and further  
study is needed on its benefits and potential side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging to  
measure brain activity as the women conducted tasks involving 
verbal and visual memory. The women -- who ranged in age from 33 to 
61 -- were treated with either estrogen or a placebo in a random 
trial from 1996 through 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers cautioned that while they observed increased brain  
activity in women given estrogen, there was no subsequent 
improvement in verbal and nonverbal memory tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaywitz said the lack of quantifiable evidence pointing to  
improved memory function was probably because the tasks were simple 
and almost all were performed correctly. If a participant was asked 
something she did not know, the MRI would measure her effort rather 
than her memory function, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one step ... but this a good step in that it does show  
a physiological change in areas of the brain related to memory,'' 
said Dr. Rodrigo Kuljis, a neurologist at the University of Miami 
School of Medicine who was not involved in the study.

</P>
<P>
	ALEKSINAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Allied warplanes blasted fuel  
depots, oil refineries, roads and bridges in the most intensive 
night of air raids across Yugoslavia. The refugee airlift has 
begun, meanwhile, for the first of at least 110,000 ethnic 
Albanians who have fled Yugoslav forces in Kosovo for Albania, 
Macedonia and Montenegro. More than 400,000 ethnic Albanians have 
left the embattled Serbian province since the NATO air campaign 
began nearly two weeks ago.

<P>
	ALEKSINAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Pools of blood, two corpses and  
parts of dismembered bodies lay in the wreckage of a large 
apartment building today in this central Serbian town after an 
overnight air strike. Yugoslav authorities said five people were 
killed and at least 30 injured when NATO missiles hit a residential 
neighborhood last night in this coal mining community of 17,000 
people about 100 miles southeast of Belgrade. Journalists permitted 
to visit the area today saw a destroyed apartment building. Some 
bricks, wooden boards and roof tiles were tossed more than 500 feet 
from the site. Three two-story homes were also flattened.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Votes on Concealed Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri voters decided Tuesday in a  
close contest whether to lift a concealed-weapons ban dating to the 
days of Jesse James. 
</P>
<P>
	With 67 percent of the vote counted, a slight majority of voters  
favored Proposition B, which would lift the ban. The secretary of 
state's office said the partial tally had 418,634 voting for the 
proposition and 413,296 voting against. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote marked the first time a state has put the question of  
concealed weapons to the voters. Thirty-one other states allow 
citizens to carry concealed guns, but those measures were enacted 
by legislators. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition B resulted from failed yearly attempts by pro-gun  
lawmakers to pass a concealed-weapons law against a threatened veto 
by Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association almost singlehandedly bankrolled  
the campaign for Proposition B -- providing more than $3.7 million, 
well over 95 percent of the money behind the measure -- in what was 
viewed as an important test of gun sentiment in the heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since this is the first time it's ever been put to a vote,  
both sides on this issue are going to learn a tremendous amount,'' 
said Fred Myers, a leader of the Proposition B campaign. ``This 
will be a race that political scientists and pundits will mull for 
years, because it's breaking such new ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said allowing law-abiding people to pack guns would  
keep the criminals guessing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The honest people of this state need to be able to defend  
themselves while going from their homes to their businesses,'' Greg 
Jeffrey, a spokesman for the Proposition B campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The other side received just one-fourth the funding but had help  
from Hillary Rodham Clinton, who recorded a telemarketing message 
targeted at women. The first lady said Proposition B is ``just too 
dangerous for Missouri families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch was among the law  
enforcement officers who feared the measure would court trouble: 
``We don't want to be going back to the old Wild West days with 
everyone wearing a gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James, the Wild West's most notorious outlaw, was a native of  
Kearney. Missouri banned concealed weapons in a crackdown on 
gunslinging in 1875, seven years before James was shot to death in 
St. Joseph, Mo., by a member of his gang. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Proposition B, state residents will need a second permit  
to carry a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Applicants will have to undergo criminal and mental health  
background checks, take at least 12 hours of state-approved 
training and have no violent offenses on their records for at least 
five years.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mariano Palacios Alcocer, who abruptly  
resigned as head of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary 
Party last month, was named the new labor secretary Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He switches places with Jose Antonio Gonzalez Fernandez, who had  
stepped down from the labor post on March 18 to seek the party's 
presidency, which he won. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez Fernandez, who was said to be President Ernesto  
Zedillo's pick to head the party, easily won election to the post 
after the only other candidate dropped out, alleging the race was 
unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	Zedillo also announced Tuesday that Arturo Warman would resign  
as secretary of agrarian reform to become the president's social 
development coordinator, Notimex said.

	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- The governor of Brazil's third-richest  
state indicated Tuesday that he will not lift the moratorium on 
debt payments to the federal government he declared three months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Minas Gerais state Gov. Itamar Franco, a former Brazilian  
president, sent world markets tumbling in January by announcing a 
90-day moratorium on $11 billion in debt, claiming the state was 
broke. The move forced the federal government to devalue its 
currency to stop a run on cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Franco's successor as  
president and formerly his finance minister, responded by 
suspending millions of dollars in federal funds for Minas Gerais. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Franco seemed intent to continue the moratorium.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the federal government that owes Minas Gerais,'' Franco  
was quoted as saying by the Estado news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gov. Newton Cardoso later said the state will not resume  
payments to the federal government without an inventory of how much 
each side owes the other.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the former  
president who left Mexico in disgrace after the 1994 peso collapse, 
wants to one day return home from self-imposed exile, his son said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has expressed his desire to return to our country when it  
would be prudent and when the conditions for it exist,'' Carlos 
Emiliano Salinas Occelli was quoted in Mexico City newspapers 
Tuesday as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Salinas said his father continues to live in Dublin,  
Ireland, despite rumors he has moved to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Salinas de Gortari, president from 1988 to 1984, was scandalized  
by the arrest of his older brother, Raul, on charges of corruption 
and of masterminding the 1994 assassination of a political rival.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- After the secret police detained his  
son, a key opposition leader charged President Hugo Chavez on 
Tuesday with persecuting political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are living with a government of persecution, of  
intimidation,'' Lewis Perez, secretary general of Democratic 
Action, told reporters. He called on Venezuelans to ``fight against 
the current regime to maintain democracy and liberty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former army paratrooper who led a failed 1992 coup attempt,  
Chavez became president in February. His detractors fear he will 
rule with an iron fist. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Perez, 24, was detained Monday night by secret police who  
said they were investigating allegations of arms trafficking. He 
was still being held Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesus Urdaneta, head of the secret police, said authorities were  
conducting a normal investigation based on suspicions that Perez 
broke the law. Urdaneta met Tuesday afternoon with Chavez at 
Miraflores presidential palace.

<HEADLINE> Rigors of High-Tech Draw Israelis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- An economic crunch drove a group of  
once-cloistered ultra-Orthodox Jewish rabbinical students into the 
uncertainties of cyberspace. Delight in its intellectual rigors is 
keeping them there. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many among Israel's rigidly Orthodox have always traded  
with the secular world, young men studying Jewish law have been 
fiercely protected by their communities from possible exposure to 
the profane. 
</P>
<P>
	But a recent lack of funds for seminary studies has forced some  
rabbinical students to seek employment, and they've turned to 
computer programming. 
</P>
<P>
	During one recent class, about 20 men -- black skullcaps in  
place, faces graced with long beards -- stared intently at 
flickering computer screens while an instructor read out a list of 
basic computer terms. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only a month into the course tailored for the former  
seminarians, but they were already enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan Rapaport, a New York-born father of three, said studying  
the Torah most of his life made computers easy -- and fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``It expanded my analytical capability and memory,'' the  
29-year-old said of his study of Jewish law. ``It enables me to get 
into this and see it as a piece of cake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instructors for the Jerusalem College of Technology course,  
sponsored by the Netherlands-based Baan Co., said their students' 
eagerness was exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
	``You give them some exercises and they say, `Give us more, give  
us more,''' said Meir Komer, the program director. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-hour-a-week, nine-month course was launched in Jerusalem  
by the institute and Baan's JBE software subsidiary, which will 
employ most of the graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	JBE already employs about 70 ultra-Orthodox graduated from  
courses elsewhere in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have more motivation than you would have in (other)  
students,'' said Komer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultra-Orthodox leaders in Israel, anxious to replace the  
European centers of Jewish learning destroyed by the Holocaust, 
long encouraged large numbers of their followers to remain in 
seminaries, or ``yeshivas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, such study was subsidized by the state, and students  
received living stipends. But with the community burgeoning -- and 
Israeli governments less willing to provide funds -- rabbis are now 
encouraging their followers to get 9-to-5 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The catch: finding employers that can accommodate the stringent  
needs of the ultra-Orthodox, such as near total separation of the 
sexes. 
</P>
<P>
	JBE's general manager, Avi Korengot, said meeting those  
conditions make economic sense. There is a shortage of computer 
programmers in Israel, a growing high-tech center, and 
ultra-Orthodox seminarians provide a natural resource. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know how to learn, and they are a stable work force,''  
Korengot said, referring to their tendency to stay with the same 
company for the long term. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the students still worry about the stigma of working in  
the secular world. 
</P>
<P>
	One arriving student, depositing his black felt hat on a pile of  
textbooks, asked not to be identified, explaining that he was ``a 
little bit afraid'' of what his religious community and neighbors 
would think. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed some courage to do this,'' he said, worried about how  
friends and acquaintances would react should they discover he faces 
daily exposure to such unfettered secular areas as the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are afraid to go out of the fold,'' Komer, the program  
director, said.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Radiation Suit Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A judge has approved a tentative $5 million  
settlement of a lawsuit charging that cancer patients were 
unknowingly subjected to military-sponsored radiation experiments 
in the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
	The families that filed the class-action lawsuit claimed  
high-dose radiation hastened the deaths and increased the suffering 
of patients, in effect making them casualties of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed five years ago, alleged that terminally ill  
cancer patients treated at Cincinnati General Hospital between 1960 
and 1971 were given full-body and partial-body doses of radiation 
so researchers could measure its effects. The facility is now known 
as University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants, including doctors, the federal government and the  
hospital, argued that they attempted to ease suffering and that 
patients died because they already were terminally ill with various 
forms of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of the patients survives; she was 10 when she received  
radiation treatment for bone cancer in 1969. Many of the 90 
patients died soon after receiving radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Sandra Beckwith said Monday that she would  
hold a hearing May 4 to make the settlement final, barring any 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the families would get about $50,000 each, said Robert  
Newman, attorney for about 50 plaintiffs. ``I think everybody 
around the table is pleased and happy it is over,'' he said. A 
probate court would determine how to distribute the money. 
Attorneys have asked for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers acknowledged that the Defense Department paid  
$651,000 for the test results so it could learn about the effects 
of radiation exposure. They maintained that they thought radiation 
-- still used in treating some cancers -- would be beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed settlement also would require a memorial plaque at  
the University of Cincinnati campus and an apology from the federal 
government.

<HEADLINE> Platinum Prices Fall Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Platinum futures prices fell sharply Tuesday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange amid a perception that South African production 
is rising and would offset a four-month delay in shipments of the 
metal from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, corn and soybeans retreated, while pork  
futures advanced a second day. 
</P>
<P>
	Platinum tumbled as the U.S. dollar strengthened against South  
Africa's rand. Since platinum is sold for dollars, there is an 
incentive to a producer with a weaker local currency to step up 
sales when the dollar is rising. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders reasoned that the weaker rand was likely to encourage  
greater selling from the world's largest platinum producer, putting 
additional supplies on a market where there currently appears to be 
no shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	While Russian delays in shipments of palladium have caused some  
market tightness, particularly from automotive and electronics 
manufacturers in Japan, delays in platinum shipments have not 
resulted in shortages. That's because South Africa produces about 
70 percent of the world's platinum supply, while Russia accounts 
for about 75 percent of the world's palladium supply and only about 
20 percent of the platinum supply. 
</P>
<P>
	South African miners also have boosted production recently amid  
good demand from jewelers and automobile companies that use the 
metal for catalytic converters that control pollution emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Platinum for July delivery fell $5.90, or by 1.6 percent, to  
$356.20 a troy ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade amid reports  
three American pork producers in North and South Carolina planned 
to import cheaper Brazilian soybean meal as animal feed in coming 
months. Analysts derided the reports as economically unfeasible, 
but the widespread talk shook the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans have been pressured for the past few weeks amid fears a  
bumper Brazilian crop, offered at prices more attractive to 
importers, would take business away from American exporters. And 
with U.S. farmers this spring planting record acreage to soybeans, 
investors fear the outlook will get worse before it gets better. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures fell on a belief that recent rains and mild  
temperatures across Midwestern planting regions had aided early 
planting and increased the likelihood of a bumper crop. The U.S. 
Agriculture Department a day earlier said spring planting was 
slightly ahead of normal. 
</P>
<P>
	May corn fell 2 1/2 cents to $2.16 1/4 a bushel; May soybeans fell 4 1/4  
cents to $4.77 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures moved sharply higher in near-term contract months  
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid continued concern about 
supplies going into the summer grilling season. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices jumped for the second day amid expectations the Clinton  
administration soon will begin buying meat and livestock for 
donation to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has pledged 50,000 tons of pork to aid  
cash-strapped Russia in a move that also was meant to help 
producers slash large surpluses that grew over the winter. But the 
purchase now is likely to come at a time when supplies are 
tightest. 
</P>
<P>
	June lean hogs rose 0.80 cent to 54.90 cents a pound; July pork  
bellies rose 1.02 cents to 53.32 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Garnishees McLain's Pension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The government has garnisheed the pension of  
former Detroit Tigers' pitcher Denny McLain to give to a pension 
fund he was convicted of embezzling from. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denny McLain used his status as a local baseball celebrity to  
illegally obtain money from the Peet Packing Co. retirement income 
plan for his own purposes. It seems only right that McLain's 
pension money from his time as a major league baseball player be 
returned to the victims of his greed,'' U.S. Attorney Saul A. Green 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McLain and Roger Smigiel, former co-owners of Chesaning's Peet  
Packing Co., were convicted in 1996 of stealing more than $2.5 
million from the company's pension fund and then laundering the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	McLain and Smigiel bought Peet Packing in January 1994 and  
quickly took the money from the company's $12 million pension fund, 
according to trial testimony. The Chesaning company went bankrupt 
in June 1995, and more than 200 workers lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Green said that during the hearing to have McLain's pension  
garnisheed, his office discovered the McLain's wife, Sharon, had 
obtained a divorce by default. Under terms of the settlement, 
essentially all the assets went to Ms. McLain and all the debts to 
McLain, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Green said that on March 31, U.S. District Judge Patrick Duggan  
ordered all of McLain's pension be awarded to the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals last week upheld  
embezzlement charges against McLain and Smigiel. 
</P>
<P>
	McLain, the major leagues' last 30-game winner, also faces trial  
on federal charges that he took part in a scheme involving 
fraudulent phone cards. Prosecutors allege John A. ``Junior'' 
Gotti, son of the imprisoned boss of the Gambino crime family, also 
took part in the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	McLain, 54, pitched for the Detroit Tigers from 1963 to 1970,  
winning 31 games as the Tigers won the World Series title in 1968. 
His last major league season was 1972, when he was 28.

<HEADLINE> French Banks Reject Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The boards of French banks Societe Generale and  
Paribas voted today to reject a $37 billion hostile takeover bid by 
Banque Nationale de Paris, reiterating their confidence in plans 
for their own merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The dual rejections confirmed the banks' opposition to BNP's  
proposal, leaving the battle's outcome to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale and Paribas were completing a $17.2 billion  
friendly merger when BNP made its bid for both banks on March 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale issued a statement Tuesday saying the premium  
offered by BNP would ``either be very small, or even negative,'' 
making it unattractive for its shareholders. In addition, it said 
that BNP's plan for a three-way merger would be ``neither as great, 
nor as certain'' as the benefits of a Societe Generale-Paribas 
link-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-way merger proposed by BNP would create a $1 trillion,  
world-leading banking group. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggle comes as European banks have been joining forces to  
better compete in a market transformed by the region's new common 
currency, the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale and Paribas have repeatedly pledged to fight  
the takeover attempt by BNP. In particular, Societe Generale said 
the significant overlap between its own and BNP's retail banking 
operations would automatically result in a drop in revenues if the 
three banks were to merge.

<HEADLINE>  Richardson To Stay at DePaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Quentin Richardson says the NBA can wait.  
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, Conference USA's player of the year as a freshman,  
is returning to DePaul for at least one more season. 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates are relieved, his coach is pleased, the family  
that was mostly responsible for his decision is at peace, and 
Richardson is now a happy 18-year-old who can still some day make a 
big payday in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was basically a decision on whether I needed to be able to  
take care of my family,'' a smiling Richardson said at a news 
conference Monday. ``I asked them were we hurting that bad? My 
father, my sister and my step mom all said, `No, they would be 
fine, it could wait.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's father, Lee, has worked as a motorman with the  
Chicago Transit Authority for 32 years. At age 56 he wasn't ready 
to retire and he wanted his son to work on his education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always told him I wanted him to stay in school,'' Lee  
Richardson said. ``He has always told me that he wanted me to 
retire, but I told him `Hey, I'll be all right.' If he left it up 
to me, I'd want him to do all four. All four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DePaul coach Pat Kennedy and Richardson's sister, Rochelle,  
talked with several NBA general managers and scouts, seeking input 
to gauge where Richardson might be taken if he declared for the 
draft this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson was projected as a middle to late first-round pick  
where he could probably get a salary of about $900,000. Most 
advised staying in school to work on his game and improve his draft 
positioning. That could, in turn, bring a larger contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to give him the chance to sit down and weigh out  
whether he was really prepared to do this. We wanted him to be at 
the top of his game when he does it,'' Rochelle Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a financial hardship. We just wanted to do what is  
best for him, as well as academically and as a business decision. 
It was not a good idea to let him get out and get locked into a 
contract and not get the (playing) time that would be advantageous 
to his future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's decision will certainly help DePaul as it tries to  
rebuild a national reputation. His return should mean more 
victories, more fans in the stands and more publicity that will aid 
recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy had a rooting interest in Richardson returning, but made  
sure he obtained all the information and then let his young star 
make the decision. He wasn't told of Richardson's decision until 
right before it was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's maybe even bigger than when he said he was first coming  
here,'' said Kennedy, who landed Richardson as a recruit right 
after it appeared he was headed to Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, at 6-foot-5, played mostly small forward last season  
and will need to move his game to the perimeter as an off-guard, 
where he would probably play in the NBA. He averaged 18.9 points 
and 10.5 rebounds, using his jumping quickness, long arms and 
uncanny sense of timing to scrap on the boards with bigger players. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, chosen the nation's top freshman last year by the  
U.S. Basketball Writers Association, The Sporting News and 
Basketball News, will acquire an insurance policy against injury 
this season, his sister said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most disappointing aspect of Richardson's first season at  
DePaul was the Blue Demons' failure to make the NCAA tournament. 
Led by fellow freshmen and Chicago prep stars Bobby Simmons and 
Lance Williams, DePaul had to settle for the NIT, where a 
first-round win over Northwestern was the school's first victory in 
the postseason since 1990. The Blue Demons (18-13) were eliminated 
in the second round by eventual NIT champ California. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who attended the news conference, was glad to have his  
friend and teammate back for another season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was playing with me, telling me he was coming back and then  
telling me he was going. Now we have a chance to have a great 
team,'' Williams said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 43.84 at 9,963.49 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as an earnings  
warning from Gillette put the brakes on Monday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  
was down 43.84 at 9,963.49. The index shifted between positive and 
negative territory for much of the session, rising as much as 23 
points in choppy trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was the brightest  
spot in the market for much of the session before giving up most of 
its gains in the last hour of trading. Sun Microsystems rose 10 
9/16 to 140 9/16 after the company told investors of new efforts to 
improve its compatibility with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Some traders attributed today's market dip to investors hoping  
to lock in profits from Monday's big jump. The Dow rose 174.82 
Monday to close at 10,007.33, a new record that marked the index's 
second finish above 10,000. The Nasdaq and S&AMP;P 500 indexes also set 
new records, sustained by a rally in Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the impetus to sell came from Gillette, which said  
first-quarter profits will probably not meet Wall Street analysts' 
expectations. Gillette fell 7 13/16 today to 49 15/16. The 
company's announcement sobered traders who had bid stocks higher 
Monday on expectations of strong first-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,789 down, 1,193 up and 594 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 785.88 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
694.42 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.31 to 612.32, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.71 to 763.27. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.21 to 401.08.

<HEADLINE> Judge Judy, Hubby May Compete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Imagine their arguments at the dining room  
table. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Judy Sheindlin may soon face some competition from her  
husband. George Sheindlin, like his wife a retired New York City 
judge, is talking to producers of ``People's Court'' about taking 
over as arbiter, an executive with the syndicated TV show's 
distributors who asked not to be identified said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Left in the cold could be current ``People's Court'' jurist  
Edward Koch, who appointed both Sheindlins to the bench when he was 
New York City mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judge Judy'' has dominated the newly hot court show genre. Its  
ratings are up 76 percent over last season, and the no-nonsense 
former judge is a star. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the ratings for ``People's Court'' haven't changed  
over the past year and two new TV judges, Joe Brown and Mills Lane, 
have passed Koch in average audience size, said Marc Berman, a 
television analyst for the media buying firm Seltel. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience for ``Judge Judy'' is two and a half times that of  
``People's Court,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Signing up Mr. Judge Judy could entice curious viewers who  
wonder what sort of man would live with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a bad thing, because the show needs some  
attention,'' Berman said. ``I don't think he will beat Judy in the 
long run, but it will bring people in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People's Court'' has discussed having Sheindlin appear in at  
least half of the shows during the TV season that begins in 
September, said the executive from Warner Bros. Television, the 
show's distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Judy sent word through a spokeswoman that she didn't want  
to talk about potentially competing with her husband.

<HEADLINE> Record Low Support for Casual Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wendy Shalit's new book is raising eyebrows  
for the shocking message it promotes: sexual modesty. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 23-year-old writer, who lashes out against random  
college hookups and sexual encounters, may not be a generational 
anomaly. A comprehensive survey of college freshmen -- taken 
annually since 1966 -- finds record low support for casual sex among 
the 1998 entering class. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the only area where young adults are taking decidedly  
different turns on issues than previous generations of college 
students. On law and order, abortion and even their goals in life, 
the differences are sometimes wide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their parents are the ones who sort of believed in this  
liberation through promiscuity and experience,'' said Shalit, whose 
book, ``A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue,'' came 
out in January. But some kids today are ``embracing the codes of 
conduct that their own parents rejected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not a surprise to some college students, who agree that young  
adults are looking for a return to religious or more traditional 
moral values after the legacy left by the decadent 1980s and the 
baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have members who are more conservative than their  
parents,'' says Chris Gillott, chairman of Pennsylvania State 
University's Young Americans for Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillott says some of his peers go home and ``come out of the  
conservative closet'' to their families, igniting heated 
discussions on topics from Social Security to affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	A few examples:  
</P>
<P>
	--Only 40 percent of freshmen agree that it's OK for two people  
who like each other to have sex, even if they have only known each 
other a short while. That's down from 42 percent in 1997, and an 
all-time high of 52 percent in 1987, according to the study by the 
Higher Education Research Institute at the University of 
California, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1970, 56 percent of the freshmen surveyed showed strong  
opposition to capital punishment. By 1998, less than a quarter of 
them believed the death penalty should be abolished. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 73 percent of freshmen said there is too much concern for  
criminals -- an almost 50 percent increase since the early 1970s 
when only about half of those surveyed felt that way. 
</P>
<P>
	--Only half of this year's freshmen backed efforts to keep  
abortion legal -- a record low figure after six years on the 
decline. Support for laws protecting abortion peaked in 1990 at 65 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have pro-choice students on our campus who still say they  
would never have an abortion,'' says Ryan Gruber, a senior at the 
University of Wisconsin, Madison, who used to head the school's 
college Republicans. ``Even if they don't want to push their 
message on others, there is less tolerance on a personal level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even views on the grand scheme of things can shift considerably  
in a few generations. Nearly three-quarters of the Class of 2002 
consider being well-off financially among their highest objectives. 
</P>
<P>
	Their parents had different goals when they were freshmen: in  
the late 1960s, more than 80 percent wanted to develop ``a 
meaningful philosophy of life.'' Today, only 40 percent of incoming 
college students find that objective compelling. 
</P>
<P>
	A record low 26 percent of freshmen believe that ``keeping up to  
date with political affairs'' is a very important or essential life 
goal. In 1966, interest in politics was at its height, with a 
record 58 percent of freshmen considering important in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	But some say these results don't necessarily signify apathy  
among today's students. Instead, activism and civic-mindedness may 
turn up in different forms, like volunteering and community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``These activities are political in the sense that they are  
trying to change the system we have,'' says Kendra Fox-Davis, a 
1998 UCLA college graduate who now is vice president of the U.S. 
Student Association in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	She added that while students today may not be as likely to  
demonstrate or march in protest like their parents, young adults 
are active on a host of issues from decreasing tuition to raising 
attention to sweatshop labor conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 freshmen norms are based on the responses of 275,811  
students at 469 of the nation's two and four year colleges and 
universities. UCLA's research institute has conducted the survey 
annually since 1966.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced in Valentine Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	XENIA, Ohio (AP) -- A 68-year-old man who served as his own  
lawyer was given the death sentence he wanted for killing a couple 
at a Valentine's Day dance last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Thomas Rose accepted the jury's March 23 recommendation  
and on Tuesday sentenced James Taylor Sr. to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was accused of fatally shooting Ronald Rihm, 51, and  
Rihm's wife, Carolyn, 57, during a dance at an Eagles lodge in 
Fairborn in February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Taylor went to the dance to kill his estranged  
wife, Patricia, 63, who had left Taylor and moved in with the 
Rihms. She was not shot, but the Rihms were killed and another man, 
James Tipton, was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said he went to the dance to kill himself in front of his  
estranged wife, but the gun went off accidentally when Rihm bumped 
his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury convicted Taylor of aggravated murder, attempted  
aggravated murder and attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, a retired electrician with a 10th-grade education,  
repeatedly rejected the judge's suggestions that he use two 
court-appointed attorneys during the trial. Taylor relented and 
used their assistance during the penalty phase. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement prior to sentencing, Taylor proclaimed his  
innocence and said he did not get a fair trial. He said some 
witnesses lied and that he wasn't allowed to call some of his own 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been wrongly accused. I've been wrongly convicted,''  
Taylor said in a booming voice. ``You can put me to death, but 
that's all you can do after I'm dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His comments angered Lenora Rihm, Ronald Rihm's mother. She  
welcomed the death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't mind being there. I would watch him die,'' said  
Rihm. ``I would like to stand right over top of him and keep poking 
something in him and say, `How does it feel? How does it feel? 
You're on your way to death.'''

<HEADLINE> Shark Suspended for Racial Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The NHL suspended San Jose Sharks defenseman  
Bryan Marchment for one game Tuesday because of ``an offensive 
comment'' to a Vancouver Canucks player. 
</P>
<P>
	Marchment served the suspension Tuesday night, sitting out the  
Sharks' game against the Phoenix Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
	During the second period of a 5-2 victory over the Canucks on  
Saturday in San Jose, Marchment called Donald Brashears, who is 
black, a ``monkey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Marchment has admitted making the remark,'' NHL hockey  
operations director Colin Campbell said. ``While we accept that 
there was no inappropriate intent on Mr. Marchment's part, we 
cannot excuse the conduct.''

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Gay Attack Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Russell Henderson stood before the sobbing  
parents of Matthew Shepard and apologized for kidnapping their son, 
lashing him to a fence and leaving him to die from a 
pistol-whipping on the cold prairie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what I did was wrong. I'm very sorry for what I did,''  
he said. ``You have my greatest sympathy for what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, a 21-year-old high school dropout, avoided a possible  
death sentence by pleading guilty Monday to kidnapping and felony 
murder in last fall's death of the gay college student. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's parents bitterly rejected the apology and so did Judge  
Jeffrey Donnell, who sentenced Henderson to two consecutive life 
terms. Under Wyoming law, Henderson's only hope for release from 
prison is a pardon. 
</P>
<P>
	Another man, Aaron McKinney, still faces a murder trial in the  
slaying that prompted calls for legislative change nationally and 
in Wyoming, one of eight states without a hate crimes law. 
President Clinton called the beating an ``evil act'' and urged 
Congress to strengthen federal laws against such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's mother, Judy, wept during Monday's hearing, burying  
her head in her husband Dennis' chest. She steadied herself enough 
to stand at the podium to address Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times I don't know how you'd be worthy of any  
acknowledgment of your existence,'' she said, glaring at Henderson. 
``You murdered my son. ... None of us would be here today going 
through this agony if it wasn't for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Shepard: ``It takes someone quite unique to sit and watch  
someone else be beaten to death and do nothing about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's aunts and uncles, separated from the Shepards by a  
narrow aisle, also cried at times during the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson wiped a tear from his eye as his grandmother, Lucy  
Thompson, told the court the family ``will never give up on him 
because we know there is goodness within him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Henderson showed little emotion as he described the  
fatal beating Oct. 6, saying he reluctantly went along with 
McKinney's plan to entice Shepard out of a bar and into a pickup 
truck to rob him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I disagreed,'' Henderson told the court.  
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said he drove the truck to a remote area in the  
southern plains of Wyoming and followed McKinney's order to tie 
their victim to a fence so McKinney could to pistol-whip the 
5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matt looked really bad so I told him to stop hitting him, I  
think he's had enough,'' he said. Henderson said his friend turned 
on him and struck him in the face with the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, a University of Wyoming freshman, died five days later.  
</P>
<P>
	Donnell told Henderson the ``vile and senseless'' crime deserved  
the fullest punishment he could hand out. He said he didn't believe 
Henderson felt any remorse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my hope that Mr. Henderson will die in the Wyoming state  
penitentiary and the only time he leaves the Wyoming state 
penitentiary is when they bury him,'' added prosecutor Cal Rerucha. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Wyatt Skaggs denied that Shepard was targeted  
because he was gay. ``This crime has never been a hate crime,'' he 
said. ``They did this because he was believed to have some money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Renna, director of community relations for the Gay and  
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't do what they did to Matthew for a wallet and a pair  
of shoes,'' said Renna, who sat beside Shepard's family in court. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, 21, could face the death penalty when he is tried in  
August on first-degree murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's girlfriend is awaiting sentencing after pleading  
guilty to accessory after the fact to murder. McKinney's girlfriend 
goes on trial in May on an accessory charge.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Rocket Launch Delayed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- For the second night in a row,  
Boeing delayed the launch of its new Delta III rocket Tuesday, this 
time because of technical trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing must wait until next week to try again because other  
rockets need to be launched from Cape Canaveral Air Station. 
Monday's try was thwarted by the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocket holds a communication satellite that will serve Asia  
and the Pacific region. 
</P>
<P>
	The countdown was halted Tuesday at the 25-second mark when a  
valve became stuck and an unrelated red alarm went off. Alarms also 
had gone off minutes earlier. Launch controllers solved all those 
problems, but then a radar-tracking station went down and the team 
ran out of time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta III's inaugural flight last August ended in an  
explosion shortly after liftoff.

<HEADLINE> Lindros Up and Walking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Doctors removed a tube from Eric  
Lindros' chest today, but when the Philadelphia Flyers captain can 
return home remains a day-to-day issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to see how everything goes now with the tube out, make  
sure that he's comfortable and make sure that things remain 
stable,'' team physician Dr. Gary Dorshimer said after speaking 
with doctors at Baptist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The team had been hoping to bring Lindros, the Flyers' star  
center and one of the top scorers in the NHL, home Tuesday night or 
Wednesday. But Dorshimer said traveling depends on how Lindros 
heals over the next day or so. 
</P>
<P>
	``He obviously has some relief of his pain with that tube being  
out,'' Dorshimer said. ``He had a decent night's sleep, and he's 
planning to do a little more walking around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors were worried that Lindros' right lung might collapse  
again when the tube keeping it inflated was removed. But Dorshimer 
said the X-rays look good. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros woke up in pain Friday morning after a 2-1 victory over  
the Nashville Predators Thursday night. At least three pints of 
blood had seeped into his chest cavity, apparently causing his 
right lung to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	How Lindros feels over the next day or two will determine how  
quickly he can return to Philadelphia. Dorshimer said doctors will 
have to study his progress to determine any further treatment once 
he returns home.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Toughens Yugoslavia Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is intensifying its  
campaign to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end his 
assault in Kosovo and permit hundreds of thousands of refugees to 
go home again. But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said today 
that American ground troops would not be sent into the Balkans 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe a sustained air campaign can accomplish the  
objectives we have laid out,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if President Clinton was contemplating sending ground  
troops to the Serbian province, Albright said ``the president has 
no plans or intention for ground forces'' as part of a combat force 
in Kosovo. The administration, however, has committed troops for a 
NATO peacekeeping force, if a peace is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is offering Kosovo refugees temporary  
shelter, as it toughens terms for a settlement to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``A commitment to cease killing and a Kosovo denied its freedom  
and devoid of its people is not acceptable,'' Clinton said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at Brookings Institution, Albright said: ``We are going  
to continue in this intensive air campaign and we will do so until 
all the Serb forces are out'' of Kosovo, hundreds of thousands of 
ethnic Albanian refugees are returned to their homes and Milosevic 
consents to a peace plan that would station a NATO peacekeeping 
force in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration demands that the ethnic Albanians be allowed  
to return goes beyond NATO's original goal of keeping more from 
being forced out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Today at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, U.S. Army Gen.  
Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held an 
unannounced meeting with his counterparts from several allied 
countries to discuss the air campaign, Pentagon officials said. The 
officials would not discuss details of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, strike aircraft from the carrier USS Theodore  
Roosevelt, which arrived in the Adriatic Sea on Monday, began 
flying missions against Yugoslavia, Navy spokesman Cmdr. Brian 
Cullen said. 
</P>
<P>
	In her remarks, Albright said the NATO summit to be held here  
later in the month would prepare the alliance to ``field forces 
designed and equipped for 21 century missions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have forces, not just among a few countries but  
throughout NATO that are versatile, flexible and mobile,'' she 
said. ``Our benchmark is clear. We must be as good in dealing with 
new threats as we are in dealing with old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strongly hinting that Milosevic would be held accountable for  
war crimes, Albright said Monday: ``There can be no question that 
war crimes and crimes against humanity are being committed in 
Kosovo. Nor can there be doubt that the orders to carry out these 
acts are coming from the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With an estimated 800 people an hour fleeing the Serbian  
province, which is part of Yugoslavia, the State Department now 
estimates close to 400,000 more ethnic Albanians have been routed, 
often by Serb troops -- or even Serb neighbors -- since the NATO 
attack began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called for private donations to Kosovar refugees and  
offered haven for up to 20,000 at the outset. Pentagon officials 
said a refugee camp likely would be set up at the U.S. base at 
Guantanamo, Cuba, which the United States considers U.S. territory 
and has been used to care for Haitian and Cuban refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Other NATO countries are offering to take in up to 80,000 more.  
</P>
<P>
	Moved by Milosevic's campaign from the original goal of simply  
stopping ethnic repression in Kosovo, the Clinton administration 
insists the Yugoslav leader will not be permitted to succeed; that 
the resettlement is only temporary and the refugees will go home 
again. Officials also deny the sustained NATO bombardment was 
having the unintended result of helping Milosevic achieve his goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Appealing directly to Americans to help the victims of  
Milosevic's ``expulsion policy,'' Clinton announced a toll-free 
number, 1-800-USAID-RELIEF, that people can call to donate money to 
nongovernmental relief efforts for ethnic Albanians expelled from 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing all we can, we need more help,'' Clinton said. He  
said $150 million in U.S. government funds has been committed to 
humanitarian relief in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Clinton had some of his harshest words yet for  
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we are up against a dictator who has shown time and  
again that he would rather rule over rubble than not rule at all, 
someone who recognizes no limits on his behavior except those 
imposed by others,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, spokesman Kenneth Bacon echoed U.S. resistance  
to any hollow peace offering by the Yugoslav leader without a safe 
return of the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic may think he's finished'' at that point, Bacon said  
of any unilateral cease-fire by Milosevic. ``We will not be 
finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previewing a planned bolstering of NATO's air power, Defense  
Secretary William Cohen said Apache attack helicopters would target 
Serb military and police forces that are now ``open and 
vulnerable'' in Kosovo. The helicopters probably will not be ready 
for action for more than a week, however, officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A late surge in telecommunications shares sent  
Japan's main stock index to its highest close in more than eight 
months today. The U.S. dollar retreated against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 144.93  
points, or 0.89 percent, to end the day at 16,479.71 -- its highest 
close since July 21. On Monday, the average finished up 44.59 
points, or 0.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.06 yen in late trading, down 0.30 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
121.83 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo stock exchange, shares recovered from morning  
losses triggered by profit-taking, as buying of telecoms issues by 
foreign investors in the last half-hour of trading boosted the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was heavy buying in the information technology sector''  
such as Sony and NTT, said Yoshio Watanabe, a manager at the 
futures section of Toyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party might be  
considering an $83 billion supplementary budget this fiscal year 
also fueled the last-minute rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 15.44 points, or 1.18 percent, to 1,322.61. 
The TOPIX closed up 3.00 points, or 0.23 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 568.10 million shares changed hands on the First  
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 558.74 million on 
Monday. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 725 to 474, while 129 
issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar tumbled as Japanese exporters,  
hedging against future weakness in the dollar, sold the U.S. 
currency to repatriate funds quickly and avoid losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite today's dip, the dollar is expected to be supported by  
the continuing turmoil in Yugoslavia, where NATO forces have 
intensified their bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency is often seen as a haven for investors during  
times of international crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.75 yen and 121.82 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.19 yen, down  
from 130.61 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.795 percent from Monday's finish of 1.740 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.04 yen from 100.51 yen.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Hires Consultant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department hired a Minneapolis law  
firm Tuesday as a consultant for its impending lawsuit against the 
tobacco industry. The firm helped Minnesota reach a $6.6 billion 
settlement with the industry last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm of Robins, Kaplan, Miller &AMP; Ciresi agreed to advise and  
assist Justice Department lawyers through June 30 at the 
substantially reduced rate of $75 per hour plus travel costs and 
expenses, according to Acting Assistant Attorney General David W. 
Ogden, who heads the department's tobacco litigation task force. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton announced in this year's State of the Union  
speech that the government had decided to sue the industry to 
recover money paid by federal health-insurance programs for 
treatment of tobacco-related illnesses. The Justice Department has 
requested $20 million from Congress in the fiscal year beginning 
next Oct. 1 to pay for 40 government lawyers to work on the case 
and for $5 million for expert witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract with the Minneapolis law firm runs through June 30  
and sets a maximum payment of $81,760 through that date. The 
government said it could be extended if both parties agree. 
</P>
<P>
	The department emphasized that contract specifies only  
consulting services and does not contemplate any contingent fee 
payment to the law firm based on potential payments the industry 
might either agree or be ordered to make. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least for the foreseeable future, the litigation team  
itself will consist exclusively of Justice Department attorneys,'' 
Ogden said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the law firm was not immediately able to say  
how many lawyers the firm intends to devote to advising the 
government and what the firm's normal hourly rate for such business 
would be. Large firms often charge business clients several hundred 
dollars an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Robins, Kaplan, Miller &AMP; Ciresi represented the state of  
Minnesota and Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Minnesota in their lawsuit 
against the tobacco industry. As a result of the lawsuit and near 
the end of the trial, the tobacco industry agreed May 8, 1998, to 
pay $6.6 billion to Minnesota's citizens and to submit to cigarette 
marketing and advertising curbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robins, Kaplan, Miller &AMP; Ciresi is widely recognized for its  
success in the Minnesota litigation against the tobacco industry 
and for its expertise in this area of litigation,'' Ogden said. 
``They have devoted thousands of hours to uncovering and learning 
the facts relating to tobacco litigation. Their extraordinary 
experience in this area will be very valuable to the department's 
tobacco litigation team as we prepare a plan to recover federal 
health care expenditures from the tobacco industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Department officials said they were particularly interested in  
tapping the law firm's knowledge of the 200,000 pages of industry 
documents that were disclosed during the discovery process of the 
Minnesota lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> UN Peace Conference Set for May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With the war-ridden century nearing an  
end, more than 1,000 international organizations, a dozen 
governments and the U.N. General Assembly are backing a global 
conference in May to create a more peaceful 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	Over 3,000 participants are expected at the meeting in the  
Netherlands which will be addressed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan, Queen Noor of Jordan, South Africa's first lady Graca Machel 
and four Nobel Peace Prize winners, organizers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time, representatives of peace, women's,  
environmental, disarmament and human rights movements will work 
with governments toward a common goal: achieving a culture of peace 
for the 21st century,'' said U.S. peace activist Cora Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference, from May 11-15, is called The Hague Appeal for  
Peace and will be held at the site of the first Hague appeal 
convened by the czar of Russia 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hague Appeal was supposed to be the last U.N. world  
conference of the 20th century -- following those on the 
environment, human rights, social development, population and 
women, said Bill Pace, the appeal's secretary-general. But by the 
mid-1990s, he said, it was clear that conference fatigue coupled 
with an international financial crisis was setting in. 
</P>
<P>
	So a group of international organizations working on a global  
peace initiative decided to organize a conference, with the hope 
that governments and the United Nations would support it, Pace 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference will look at implementation of the 1997 land-mine  
treaty, progress of the International Criminal Court, new proposals 
to peacefully resolve conflicts, the elimination of child soldiers 
and promotion of an international curriculum for schools based on 
the study of peace -- not war, Pace said.

<HEADLINE> NFL May Reject Sale of Redskins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Two years and one day after the death of Jack  
Kent Cooke, NFL owners appear ready to reject the proposed sale of 
the Washington Redskins, a decision that could leave the franchise 
in limbo for months and perhaps years. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about Howard Milstein's finances, his contentious  
stewardship of the New York Islanders and a perceived high-handed 
lobbying approach have many owners leaning toward a veto of the 
$800 million bid, the most offered for a U.S. sports franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four of the 31 owners must approve the sale Wednesday at  
a special meeting arranged after Milstein requested a postponement 
last month in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	One league source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The  
Associated Press the group had no more than seven to 10 votes in 
Phoenix and they are still ``far short'' of the three-fourths 
required. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote could hinge on a recommendation from commissioner Paul  
Tagliabue and the league's financial committee, which will meet 
before the vote. The eight-member committee was split 3-3 with two 
abstentions in Phoenix. Committee chairman New England owner Bob 
Kraft has been one of the bid's few solid supporters, but committee 
members Tom Benson of New Orleans and Pat Bowlen of Denver are 
adamantly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the objections by some owners:  
</P>
<P>
	--While Milstein is worth an estimated $500 million, most of it  
is tied up in real estate, making his part of the bid heavily 
leveraged without the ready cash to back it up. His father recently 
agreed to supply $125 million to support the bid, but some league 
officials reportedly consider that money a loan that helps the 
financing arrangement only marginally. 
</P>
<P>
	--Milstein's part-ownership of the NHL's Islanders, which he  
bought with a partner just 14 months ago, has been ugly and 
litigious. Milstein wanted a new arena and threatened to cancel 
games because he felt the old one was unsafe. There are lawsuits 
pending between Milstein and New York's Nassau County. 
</P>
<P>
	--Milstein, according to several sources, solicited politicians  
in the nation's capital to lobby owners on his behalf. Sources say 
several owners considered it an impropriety when they received 
calls from congressmen from other parts of the country asking about 
the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	--Several owners have expressed a preference for Cooke's son,  
team president John Kent Cooke, to own the team. John Kent Cooke 
was outbid by Milstein and Daniel Snyder in an auction conducted by 
the trustees of his father's estate -- in accordance with his 
father's will after his death on April 6, 1997 -- but sources say 
some owners are eager to make the point that they alone can choose 
who joins their exclusive club. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which begs the question: If the owners say no, what  
happens next? 
</P>
<P>
	No one is saying for sure -- ``We'll cross that bridge if we have  
to,'' league spokesman Greg Aiello said -- but the league probably 
will tell the trustees to hold another auction and come back with 
another bid in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The favorite to win a second round of bidding would be Snyder, a  
Washington-area communications executive who has the money in the 
bank and who has come through the NFL process unscathed. Snyder 
could team with a losing bidder from the first round, such as 
Phoenix developer Sam Grossman, to mount a formidable bid. 
</P>
<P>
	But all that becomes moot if Milstein loses and decides to sue,  
halting the sale process with a course of action that could take 
years to play out. Milstein was asked by the owners in Phoenix if 
he would sue. His initial response was that he had not thought 
about it, but he later said he would not. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the sale is approved, John Kent Cooke will continue to  
run the team, retaining coach Norv Turner and general manager 
Charley Casserly. 
</P>
<P>
	Several free agents said they were wary of signing with the  
Redskins because of the uncertainty, and the players under contract 
want the matter resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things that has gone on too long,'' center  
Cory Raymer said Tuesday. ``And it's become a pain in the butt.''

<HEADLINE> Hawks' Ellis Out for Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- LaPhonso Ellis of the Atlanta Hawks will miss the  
rest of the season because of a sports hernia that will require 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis, on the injured list since March 14, originally was  
diagnosed with back spasms, but because he was showing no 
improvement and the pain had not subsided, team trainers took him 
to a back specialist who in turn sent Ellis to a hernia specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	The hernia is high on the left side and the Hawks said Tuesday  
the specialist thinks the injury may have been the byproduct of hip 
surgery a few years ago when some bone was removed, possibly 
weakening his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis, in his first year with the Hawks after six seasons with  
Denver, had started 20 games before being sidelined. He was 
averaging 10.2 points and 5.4 rebounds per game. He was signed as a 
free agent to a two-year contract.

<HEADLINE> Couples Wants Redemption at Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Fred Couples received one of the luckiest  
breaks in Masters history in 1992 and one of its cruelest twists 
last year. It can be that way at Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	Couples discovered how harsh Amen Corner can be in 1998. He was  
the leader and apparent winner-to-be after three rounds of 
rock-solid golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened has only irritated me for a year and it's still  
climbing,'' Couples said today. ``But there's nothing I've ever 
done that I can't get over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couples was the leader for 66 holes until he hooked a drive into  
the pine trees to left of the creek on the par-5, No. 13, a 
tempting 485-yard dogleg that can yield eagles or disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	For Couples, it was doomsday after he chipped a wedge back to  
the fairway. Pulling out a 6-iron, he pushed his third shot and it 
found Rae's Creek in front of the green. He stared at the 
disappearing ball in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	The flustered Couples finished with a double-bogey 7 on what's  
considered the easiest hole of the three-hole Amen Corner swing. He 
still makes no excuses for what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt the pressure,'' he said. ``I didn't make a good enough  
swing and it cost me the tournament. Maybe I should have taken more 
time. I felt a little rushed. It's bothered me awhile. I just hope 
I get another shot at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse gave Mark O'Meara just enough room to win the  
tournament with birdies on the last two holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Couples was under par in every round (69-70-71-70) but finished  
tied for second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I should have won,'' Couples said. ``Sometimes  
fate intervenes at Augusta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like that Sunday in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
	Couples' tee shot hit into the slope on the treacherous 155-yard  
No. 12. Somehow the ball defied gravity and clung to a blade of 
grass short of the water. Couples got it up-and-down for par and 
cruised to his first and only major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-dozen other balls trickled into the water that day in the  
general area where Couples hit his ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally you forget the good breaks you get and remember the  
bad one like I got last year,'' Couples said. ``But I'll never 
forget the break I got in 1992.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couples, who has been in the top 10 six times at Augusta  
National, has a perfect game for the course. He's a long driver, 
hits good irons and can putt fast greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I can win,'' said Couples, who was fourth in The  
Players Championship two weeks ago. ``Length is a huge deal here 
and this is my favorite course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes he comes to his 67th hole on Sunday in front and with a  
chance to tame the testy 13th. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be in that position again, standing there with a  
3-wood in my hand trying to hit the fairway,'' Couples said. ``To 
win the Masters twice would be a big deal. I let one get away last 
year.''

<HEADLINE> Report Eyes Cancer Care System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Too many Americans with cancer are not getting  
the best care, largely because there's no way to know where to turn 
for the best treatment, said a report today that recommended a 
national system to assess quality cancer care. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all shocked at how little information is available on  
that topic,'' said Dr. Joseph Simone of the University of Utah, 
co-author of the National Cancer Policy Board report. 
</P>
<P>
	Until a systematic way can be developed to assess quality care,  
the report offered patients some advice: 
</P>
<P>
	--There are no data on whether most cancer patients should go to  
a high-volume cancer center instead of a smaller hospital near 
home. But for complicated and high-risk surgeries, such as for 
pancreatic cancer or the removal of the esophagus or pelvic organs, 
and for complicated chemotherapy regimens, patients should seek out 
hospitals that perform the highest numbers of such procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Post-surgical mortality for those complex cases can be two to  
three times higher at hospitals that treat only a few such patients 
a year. Yet the report found that between one-quarter and one-half 
of surgeries for pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest forms, are 
performed at inexperienced hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	--All patients should find oncologists experienced in their  
particular form and stage of cancer. A woman with Stage III breast 
cancer, for instance, should specifically ask how many Stage III 
breast cancer patients the doctor has treated. 
</P>
<P>
	--Patients should be given all treatment options before planning  
a clear approach to therapy. A single doctor should then coordinate 
and interpret the care patients will need from multiple physicians. 
It's typical to get radiation at one site, tests at another, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Cancer Policy Board was created by the Institute of  
Medicine and the National Research Council, independent 
organizations that advise the government. Today's report lays out 
the problem, and the board will meet later this year to plan 
solutions with agencies like the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a complex and probably formidable task, but we intend  
to pursue this with vigor,'' said Simone. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the difficulty? Cancer consists of 100 different diseases  
requiring different treatments depending on their stage of 
development. Programs that count cancer incidence and deaths often 
don't record the patient's disease stage or type of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``So if a patient has a bad outcome, is it just bad luck or is  
it because they got inappropriate care?'' Simone asked. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no way to ensure that doctors implement the latest  
cancer guidelines. Physicians sometimes even order too few cancer 
screening tests, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Take breast cancer, where early detection and treatment is  
well-known to be lifesaving. More is known about the quality of 
breast cancer care than any other cancer, the report said, yet 
studies show some doctors don't push patients to get regular 
mammograms, perform inadequate biopsies and underuse radiation or 
chemotherapy after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem may be financial: 7 percent of newly  
diagnosed cancer patients lack insurance, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem is poor pain treatment, especially in terminal  
patients. Doctors need to be better educated in pain management, 
Simon said, realizing that ``the vast majority of patients need not 
suffer.''

<HEADLINE> MLS Bans Enhancement Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major League Soccer banned anabolic steroids and  
human growth hormone today and expects to begin testing players by 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Doug Logan said the league added six categories to  
its list of banned substances, including erythropoietin (EPO), an 
endurance-boosting hormone that increases the blood's ability to 
carry oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	EPO is a favorite of some cyclists and was at the center of the  
Tour de France drug scandal last year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, scientifically reliable tests have not been perfected  
for some substances, such as EPO, but are expected to be available 
by next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because we cannot test for them, doesn't mean shouldn't  
be making statement that these substances should be banned,'' Logan 
said during a conference call. ``They violate the ethics of 
competitive sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MLS already tests every league and team employee, including  
players, once a year by urinalysis for 10 kinds of illegal drugs, 
including cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines and barbiturates. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's policy change added steroids, stimulants (other than  
caffeine or medications approved by the league), EPO, human growth 
hormone, chorionic gonadotrophin (another human growth hormone), 
and diuretics (used to mask drugs). 
</P>
<P>
	MLS operations manager William Ordower said the 3-year-old  
league has been considering adding such substances for a few years. 
However, the league decided to go forward after a recommendation of 
Dr. Ian Macdonald, who also advises the International Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making the announcement now to give our players a full  
season to change their habits if any did rely on it,'' Ordower 
said.

<HEADLINE> Donors Can Rent Kennedy Summer Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HYANNIS PORT, Mass. (AP) -- For $100,000, Democratic Party donors  
will be able to spend a Camelot weekend at the storied Kennedy 
family compound in Hyannis Port where Jack, Bobby and Teddy used to 
play touch football. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Democrats have happily given money to visit Kennedy  
homes and help out the latest Kennedy running for office. 
</P>
<P>
	But the $100,000-a-head retreat on Cape Cod, scheduled for  
September, marks the first time the home will be used for a major, 
national campaign contribution drive. Guests will have to find a 
hotel room somewhere down the road to sleep in, however. 
</P>
<P>
	It's part of a fund-raising drive led by Rep. Patrick Kennedy,  
D-R.I., to retake the House. Kennedy, 31, the youngest son of Sen. 
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., is head of the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of irresistible, if you can afford it, to get a peek  
into how the royal family lives and plays,'' said Dan Payne, a 
Boston political consultant. ``For some people, an affiliation with 
the Kennedys is sort of a life goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Kennedy was appointed to head the Democratic  
Congressional Campaign Committee in the fall after throwing a 
clambake at the Hyannis Port compound. The event was believed to 
have raised at least $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	During this election cycle, the committee hopes to raise $50  
million by offering retreats in posh places to wealthy donors and 
dinners with top Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the idea demonstrates the need to change the  
nation's campaign finance system. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we have a system that's democracy for rent, I certainly  
can't be surprised when I see the Hyannis Port compound for rent, 
too,'' said Meredith McGehee, spokeswoman for the clean-government 
organization Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Smith, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional  
Committee, said Democrats want to reform campaign finance laws but 
cannot do so without a majority in Congress.

<HEADLINE> Hardaway Scoring More in New Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Penny Hardaway resisted the temptation to tell everybody he was  
right all along. There was nothing wrong with his offensive game 
that a change in position wouldn't solve. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time All-Star, sensitive to criticism that he hasn't  
been scoring enough, offers the Orlando Magic's Eastern 
Conference-leading record as evidence he's been doing a lot of good 
things this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But with leading scorer Nick Anderson sidelined by a hamstring  
injury the past week, Hardaway was averaging 26 points per game -- 
10 above his season average -- going into Tuesday night's game 
against the Knicks in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason, he and coach Chuck Daly agreed, is that with  
Anderson out the team needs Hardaway to fill a role that he's 
probably been better suited for all along. 
</P>
<P>
	A point guard for most of his NBA career, Hardaway's scoring  
picks up dramatically when he's not expected to set up the offense 
and create opportunities for teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's played his best basketball since I've been here,'' Daly  
said after Hardaway keyed a late run Monday night that carried the 
Magic to a 106-99 victory over the Boston Celtics. ``He plays 
better off the ball. He's happier there, and that's what he wants 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Hardaway insists he doesn't have a problem playing the  
point, he wants people to understand that his statistics will 
suffer. If it's gaudy numbers they want, then give him the ball 
coming off screens and in other situations where he can get more 
open shots. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a role he was prepared to accept before injuries limited  
him to 19 games last season. He returned to point guard this year 
because of the re-emergence of Anderson, who's been the Magic's 
most consistent scorer since February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the point, I tried to put my ego to the side and go out  
there and get everybody involved and get a victory. But nobody sees 
it that way,'' Hardaway said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want me to go out and score 30, score 25, like they've  
seen me in the past. But I'm not the same, and we don't have the 
same team. We have more guys who can really score. If you get 
everybody involved, you win almost every game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway's primary responsibility on offense for three seasons  
was to get the ball to Shaquille O'Neal. When Shaq left for the Los 
Angeles Lakers in 1996, the Magic became more dependent on their 
playmaker's scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	But injuries have slowed the two-time all-NBA selection much of  
the past two seasons and, at times, he's seemed reluctant to assert 
himself on offense. Even his teammates would like to see Hardaway 
be more aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to understand this is an unselfish guy,'' said  
Darrell Armstrong, who has been starting as point guard with 
Anderson injured. ``When Shaq was here, he gave shots up. He didn't 
really care about posting up. All he cared about was winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just in his nature to be unselfish. When he doesn't  
score, he does a lot of things to help this team. He rebounds, he 
gets assists, plays defense. He does it all. It's not all about 
scoring. You can score a lot of points and play a bad game 
sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway couldn't have said it better himself.  
</P>
<P>
	So, what happens when Anderson returns? Does Hardaway make back  
to the point? Or how about Anderson moving to small forward? 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't speak for the coach,'' said Hardaway.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not our job,'' he said. ``It's the coaches job. And  
whatever he says, that's the way it's going to be.''

<HEADLINE> France Bank Takeover Bid Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The boards of French banks Societe Generale and  
Paribas voted Tuesday to reject a $37 billion hostile takeover bid 
by Banque Nationale de Paris, reiterating their confidence in plans 
for their own merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The dual rejections confirmed the banks' opposition to BNP's  
proposal, leaving the battle's outcome to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale and Paribas were completing a $17.2 billion  
friendly merger when BNP made its bid for both banks on March 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale issued a statement Tuesday saying the premium  
offered by BNP would ``either be very small, or even negative,'' 
making it unattractive for its shareholders. In addition, it said 
that BNP's plan for a three-way merger would be ``neither as great, 
nor as certain'' as the benefits of a Societe Generale-Paribas 
link-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-way merger proposed by BNP would create a $1 trillion,  
world-leading banking group. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggle comes as European banks have been joining forces to  
better compete in a market transformed by the region's new common 
currency, the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale and Paribas have repeatedly pledged to fight  
the takeover attempt by BNP. In particular, Societe Generale said 
the significant overlap between its own and BNP's retail banking 
operations would automatically result in a drop in revenues if the 
three banks were to merge.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Pitcher Arrested for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles today began their own  
examination into reliever Doug Johns' arrest on drunken driving and 
marijuana possession charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Johns, 31, was stopped by an officer around 10:50 p.m. EDT  
Monday after running a red light, according to police spokesman 
Robert Weinhold. A search of Johns' vehicle revealed a bag 
containing what police believe was marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Johns was fingerprinted and held at the Central Booking and  
Intake Center until shortly before 4 a.m. Tuesday, when he was 
released on his own recognizance, according to a corrections 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The organization has no comment at this time except that we're  
in a fact-gathering mode regarding the situation,'' Orioles 
spokesman John Maroon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johns joined the Orioles in June 1997 after six seasons with the  
Oakland Athletics. Last season he went 3-3 with a 4.57 ERA in 31 
games, including 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander did not play in the Orioles' season opener  
Monday afternoon against Tampa Bay.

<HEADLINE> Five Bodies Found in Missouri Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Police today arrested a man suspected of  
killing at least one of the five men whose decomposing bodies were 
found in his rented house. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies, which all appeared to be male, had been in the house  
for some time, said police Capt. Jerry Gallagher. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all decomposed pretty badly,'' Gallagher said Monday.  
``It's not pretty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they did not know when the killings occurred and  
would not say how the victims died. Gallagher said the air 
conditioning was running when police arrived Monday, making it 
harder to determine how long the bodies had been decomposing. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Beach, 56, was arrested this morning at a hotel parking lot  
in the city's Westport district, several blocks away from the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	Beach was charged with first-degree murder in the death of  
Kenneth Gulley, 45, of Independence. Arraignment was likely on 
Wednesday, police spokesman Russ Dykstra said. Police wouldn't 
comment on a motive. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Gulley, police identified two other victims as  
Mark Nelson, 28, of Kansas City, and Christopher Conrad, 27, of 
Overland Park, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were seeking relatives of a fourth victim to confirm his  
identity. Dykstra said identification of the last body was hampered 
by its decomposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the bodies were found on the main floor and two in the  
basement of the one-story home. 
</P>
<P>
	One neighbor said the house had been occupied for about 14 years  
by two men, a father and stepson, both limousine drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Rich, 25, said he heard gunshots ``sometime last week''  
from his house across the street and had not seen anyone at the 
home for the past few days. He didn't report the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a real laid-back, nice neighborhood. I'm not sure if I  
want to stay here now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Weapons Question Put To Mo. Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- To conceal or not to conceal.  
</P>
<P>
	Although 31 states allow citizens to carry concealed weapons,  
Missouri today became the first state to put the question before 
voters. The practice has been banned here since 1875, when outlaw 
Jesse James was still at large. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers said Proposition B deserved support so law-abiding  
citizens could keep criminals guessing about whether attempted 
robberies, rapes, assaults or carjackings might be met with 
bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The honest people of this state need to be able to defend  
themselves while going from their homes to their businesses,'' Greg 
Jeffrey, spokesman for Missourians Against Crime, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the plan's training requirements (12 hours  
minimum), its wording (sheriffs ``shall'' issue permits to 
qualified applicants) and its backers (including about $3.8 million 
from the National Rifle Association) were adequate reasons to 
reject it. 
</P>
<P>
	Supportive campaign cash flowed so freely that ``the NRA should  
change its initials to ATM,'' said Gwen Fitzgerald, spokeswoman for 
the principal opposition group, the Committee for Safe Schools and 
Workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaigns included NRA president Charlton Heston as well as  
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who urged voters to vote no because the 
proposal was ``just too dangerous for Missouri families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Missourians weren't expected to turn out in large numbers.  
Secretary of State Bekki Cook forecast that just one in four 
eligible Missourians would vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Destry Garibaldi, 31, said he was ``a big-time `Yes' vote,''  
because ``it's a constitutional right to have arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``So why shouldn't I be able to conceal it?'' Garibaldi asked.  
</P>
<P>
	His fiancee, Lisa Pashia, 21, disagreed -- and was voting ``No.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the constitutional right,'' she said. ``But it  
scares me to think I might accidentally cut someone off with my two 
girls in the car and they fire at me in road rage. It's scary.''

<HEADLINE> Refugee Issues Not New to Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As President Clinton steps up the U.S.  
response to the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo, his own history with 
the touchy issue of political refugees is likely to be a factor in 
his decision making. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has blamed his re-election loss in the 1980 Arkansas  
governor's race in part on riots among Cuban exiles who ended up at 
a federal facility in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	As president in 1994, he had 14,000 Haitian refugees housed at  
the U.S. military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- a location that 
limited domestic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	But he caused consternation in Florida that same year by his  
handling of a mass exodus of Cuban refugees touched off by Cuba's 
Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro, like Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is doing now  
by forcibly removing ethnic Albanians from Kosovo province, had 
found a way to make citizens he didn't like someone else's problem 
-- particularly a U.S. president. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20,000 Kosovo refugees that the United States has agreed to  
shelter temporarily likely will be sent to Guantanamo too, although 
Clinton administration officials delayed a final decision Monday 
while they sought assurances that European countries were fully 
engaged in the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials still were grappling with the logistics  
of transporting and sheltering 20,000 people half a world away on 
Monday. While they have been quick to lend a hand to people struck 
by natural disasters -- soldiers and millions in aid were dispatched 
to Central America after Hurricane Mitch struck last year -- the 
current crisis poses unique challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is different because you don't know what the end date  
is,'' said a White House official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. ``But you want to make sure people are surviving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were concerns now, as in times past, about how to  
adequately provide for the refugees while they are in the care of 
the United States. But concern for the plight of the Kosovar 
Albanians was outweighing other considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials decided to accept the refugees to alleviate the  
bottleneck of people flowing from Kosovo to Albania, Macedonia and 
the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro -- an estimated 400,000 people, 
mostly ethnic Albanians -- since the U.S.-led NATO bombing of 
Yugoslavia began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said U.S. policymakers  
expected that the Kosovo refugees eventually would be repatriated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe these refugees want to return to their homes,''  
Rubin said. ``This is a temporary arrangement designed to deal with 
an emergency problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government sent thousands of Cuban refugees to Fort  
Chaffee, Ark., in 1980 in the wake of the Mariel boatlift. Clinton 
got assurances from the Carter administration that no more would be 
sent after a riot left dozens injured, but a month later the 
administration sent refugees harbored in four other states on to 
Fort Chaffee. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's opponent, Republican Frank White, used public  
sentiment over the riots against Clinton, accusing him of failing 
to be tough enough with Carter to move the refugees. Clinton told 
USA Today in 1987 that the incident ``did play some role'' in his 
defeat. He subsequently regained the governors' office. 
</P>
<P>
	When thousands of Haitians began fleeing the island in rickety  
boats in 1994, Clinton ordered the Coast Guard to transport them to 
the Marine facility at Guantanamo until political stability was 
restored in Haiti. While many Haitians ultimately were allowed to 
come to the mainland, thousands had to be returned to Haiti 
forcibly. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton on Monday appealed directly to the American public for  
cash donations to the relief effort and announced ``Operation 
Sustain Hope,'' an interagency initiative for the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced a toll-free 1-800 telephone number that people  
can call to donate money for ethnic Albanians expelled from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The president asked for donations to nongovernmental groups in  
the area trying to stanch the humanitarian crisis. He directed 
potential donors to a toll-free number: 1-800-USAID-RELIEF. 
Officials said more lines would be installed in the coming days to 
cope with a flood of calls that jammed circuits.

<HEADLINE> Rocky Marciano Highlighted in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rocky Marciano and linguine were the most  
popular items at a restaurant in Little Italy today. 
</P>
<P>
	May will be ``Rocky Marciano Month'' on Showtime, the cable-TV  
network, which will debut ``Rocky Marciano,'' its film about the 
heavyweight champion of the 1950s who retired with his title and 
unbeaten record intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Former middleweight champion Jake LaMotta was on hand to talk  
about the film, which will make its debut May 15. 
</P>
<P>
	LaMotta said one of Marciano's most memorable fights was his  
eighth-round knockout of Joe Louis in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Louis' last fight, and I hated to see what happened to  
him,'' said LaMotta. ``He was one of my favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``He must have been Marciano's, too, because afterwards, Rock  
cried in the dressing room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he ever gave Marciano advice, LaMotta responded,  
``Yeah, I told him to save his money. He must have listened to me 
because he buried his money in tin cans and nobody ever never found 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What happened to his money has been part of the lore about  
Marciano, who was killed in a plane crash 30 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Belle Hits Ringing Blast for O's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- He's much larger than life, standing far above  
the expressway traffic with a huge black bat in his hands and a 
grin across his face. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is Albert smiling?'' the billboard reads. ``Because it's  
364 to left center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle, the Baltimore Orioles' poster boy for the 1999  
season, didn't plant his first homer in those beckoning Camden 
Yards seats in left center. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Belle marked his first formal day with the Orioles by  
launching an opposite-field drive over the 25-foot scoreboard in 
right field. 
</P>
<P>
	It was hardly the most distant shot of his career, but the home  
run was immense in importance. The three-run homer, which gave the 
Orioles the lead for good Monday in a 10-7 victory over Tampa Bay, 
set off a celebration by the sellout crowd that caused the 
ordinarily sullen slugger to take an impromptu curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
	He also managed to produce a genuine smile or two.  
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what the Orioles were hoping for when they signed  
Belle to a five-year, $65 million contract in December. Team 
officials knew the risk of thrusting him into a town that likes its 
heroes wholesome (i.e. Johnny Unitas and Cal Ripken), but the 
Orioles also figured the fans would love the guy if he hit the 
cover off the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	At least for one day, it was smiles all around.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody on the team benefits with Albert in the lineup,''  
said Brady Anderson, who also homered. ``When you have a proven RBI 
and home run hitter at cleanup, it affects everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three players in front of Belle -- Anderson, Mike Bordick and  
Will Clark -- all did their part by getting on base. Belle then 
showed why he's had at least 100 RBIs in each of the last seven 
seasons, going deep with two runners on and later adding an RBI 
single. 
</P>
<P>
	With Belle leading the way, the Orioles proved they could win  
when Mike Mussina has an off day and when their bullpen sputters. 
Baltimore was resilient without Cal Ripken and relentless against 
everyone the Devil Rays shoved onto the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, baseball's Iron Man, was lifted for a pinch hitter in  
the third inning because of a stiff lower back. If he hadn't 
willingly ended his record consecutive games streak at 2,632 last 
year, the injury would have been front-page news. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still worth noting, however, because he was treated in a  
hospital Monday and might have to go on the disabled list for the 
first time in his 18-year career. The third baseman is questionable 
for Wednesday night against the Devil Rays at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's day to day,'' Orioles spokesman John Maroon said Tuesday.  
``Our training staff will monitor the situation and base their 
decision on how he feels today and tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was plagued by lower back pain during the 1997 season and  
once was in such agony he considered ending his streak by sitting 
out a game in July. But his back loosened up during warmups and he 
finished the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken's replacement Monday, Willis Otanez, went 0-for-3. But  
the Orioles produced 13 hits and won on a day when the ace of the 
staff gave up four runs in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the whole season is done, you look back and say there are  
a couple I should have won and I didn't and there are a couple I 
should have lost and I didn't. This probably was one of the 
latter,'' Mussina said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson contributed heavily with a 3-for-4 performance. After  
opening last season in a 4-for-63 funk, he's now one hit from 
matching his total through May 11 of last year.

<HEADLINE> La. Tech Assistant Takes Purdue Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Kristy Sims-Curry didn't need much  
convincing to become the women's basketball coach at Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	As an assistant at Louisiana Tech, she saw the Boilermakers  
three times in the past two seasons, including this year's NCAA 
women's semifinals. The day after Purdue beat the Lady Techsters, 
and the day before the Boilermakers beat Duke for the championship, 
Sims-Curry was offered the job being vacated by Carolyn Peck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure it's a little bit scary,'' the new coach said Monday.  
``It's my first head coaching job. But I tell you what, the 
position we were in at Louisiana Tech, each and every year was a 
little scary at times, because we expected to be the best and 
expected to be at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where I expect to be here,'' she said at her first news  
conference at Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck announced even before last season began that she would  
become the coach and general manager of the WNBA's new Orlando 
franchise. Under their lame-duck coach, the Boilermakers were 
ranked No. 1 in the nation, won their final 32 games and finished 
34-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims-Curry, 32, accepted the offer ``because they expect to be  
among the best, and I couldn't have left Louisiana Tech for anyone 
that didn't want to be the best,'' she said. ``So it's a little bit 
scary, but we'll deal with it and we'll go forward. Hey, you work 
hard and good things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former high school coach in Louisiana, Sims-Curry also was an  
assistant at Texas A&AMP;M, Tulane and Stephen F. Austin. Her husband, 
Kelly Curry, also an assistant coach with the Lady Techsters, will 
join her staff as a Boilermakers assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really am proud and very honored to have the opportunity to  
be the new coach at Purdue,'' Sims-Curry said. ``As an assistant, 
we all dream and work for an opportunity like this. ... The work 
ethic and commitment this program stands for, we will work each and 
every day to continue that. I could not be any more excited and 
thrilled to death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the big changes, however, will be the departure of the  
senior backcourt of Stephanie White-McCarty, a first-team 
All-American, and Ukari Figgs, this year's Final Four most valuable 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having seen this team and knowing quite a bit about them ... I  
feel like I do have a little bit of feel for our personnel and 
where we are and where we want to be,'' Sims-Curry said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that you've got to begin with your defensive effort.  
A lot of times, your philosophy will come with what type of 
personnel you have. I don't see that much change in the system. 
Certainly, it's worked well, and we'll continue to build on that 
and add a few things and go from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims-Curry is the fourth Purdue coach in five seasons. Lin Dunn  
was fired in 1996; Nell Fortner, another Louisiana Tech assistant 
who replaced Dunn, left after one season to lead the U.S. Women's 
National Team; and Peck was the coach for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue athletic director Morgan Burke called Sims-Curry ``a  
person who will nurture and build on the strengths in our program. 
... We have some very talented returning players, but clearly we're 
going to lose two All-Americans, and we're mindful we have our work 
cut out for us to continue to move this program forward. We think 
the person who can do that is Kristy Sims-Curry.''

	Dow Ends Down 43.84 at 9,963.49  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as an earnings  
warning from Gillette put the brakes on yesterday's rally. At the 
close on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 
43.84 at 9,963.49. The index shifted between positive and negative 
territory for much of the session, rising as much as 23 points in 
choppy trading. Broader stock indicators were mixed. The 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was the brightest spot in 
the market for much of the session before giving up most of its 
gains in the last hour of trading. It was up 3.11 at 2,563.17. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was down 3.23 at 1,317.89. Some traders 
attributed today's market dip also to investors hoping to lock in 
profits from yesterday's jump that took the Dow to a record high 
close: up 174.82 at 10,007.33.

	Economic Indicators Rise Again  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While the numbers weren't as strong as the past  
two years, a key indicator of future economic growth suggests the 
country will continue to thrive at least through the summer. The 
Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose for the fifth-straight 
month in February, the Conference Board reported today. Rising 
consumer expectations and a drop in first-time claims for jobless 
benefits were among factors pushing the index up 0.2 percent in 
February, in line with economists' expectations. The index is 
designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months in 
advance.

	Program Calculates Mutual Fund Fees

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new computer program developed by federal  
regulators allows mutual fund investors to calculate the costs of 
funds and compare different funds. Many investors don't realize, 
for example, that a 1 percent annual fee will reduce the final 
account balance in a mutual fund by 18 percent on an investment 
held for 20 years. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been 
pushing the mutual fund industry for improved disclosure of fund 
fees and investment risks. The computer program unveiled today, 
called the mutual fund cost calculator, ``takes some of the mystery 
out of mutual funds by enabling investors to evaluate and compare 
costs,'' SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said.

reported today that its U.S. sales were up 14 percent in March over 
the same month a year ago, based on the daily sales rate. Ford 
broke a long list of company records, led by its strongest monthly 
sales of light trucks ever. March sales of F-series pickups, the 
nation's top-selling vehicle for 17 years, were the highest for any 
car or truck in any month since June 1978. Ford's car sales, 
excluding its Jaguar unit, were up nearly 6 percent while its light 
truck sales increased 19 percent to set a record for any month. SUV 
sales were up 11 percent while total pickup sales were up 28 
percent.

	Ford Air Bags Do Well in Test  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Side air bags on Ford Motor Co.'s 1999 models  
greatly reduce the likelihood of serious head injury to the driver 
in crash tests, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said 
today. The institute, which is financed by insurers, crashed two 
1999 model Lincoln Town Cars by hurtling them sideways into a pole 
that smashed into the driver's door. Side air bags are standard 
equipment on the 1999 Lincoln Continental and Town Car. Ford has 
started offering them with head protection as options in front 
seats of some of its less expensive vehicles: 1999 Ford Explorer 
and Mercury Mountaineer sport utility vehicles, Ford Windstar 
minivans and the Jaguar XJ8 and X200. Side air bags with head 
protection also are on BMWs, Saabs, Volvos and some Mercedes 
models.

DaimlerChrysler AG workers following a 16-month undercover 
investigation at their auto plant. A forklift operator, William 
Sturkin, was charged with possession with intent to deliver cocaine 
and heroin at the Dodge City truck assembly plant, where he has 
worked for more than 20 years. Police arrested 10 others last week 
on lesser charges. Authorities launched the probe in late 1997 when 
workers complained to management about drug dealing at the plant.

	Hope Seen in Japan's Auto Market  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO -- Automakers have been hit harder by Japan's recession  
than just about any other industry. Domestic sales have fallen 23 
consecutive months, plunging by about 20 percent. But analysts see 
demand roaring back once the recession eases up. And, while dealers 
fight for survival on the front lines, Japanese and foreign 
automakers are jockeying for position to cash in when the market 
finally comes around. American carmakers, which have always 
struggled in Japan, are investing in their sales networks, a major 
weakness, hoping to make significant inroads before the locals can 
turn the corner.

Ciresi agreed to advise and assist Justice Department lawyers 
through June 30 at the substantially reduced rate of $75 per hour

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Mixed at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks turned mixed Wednesday morning amid  
concerns over the recent fast pace of market gains. The dollar 
slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average gained 20.10 points, or 0.12 percent,  
to 16,499.81 at the end of the morning session, marking its highest 
intraday level so far this year. On Tuesday, the average closed up 
144.93 points, or 0.89 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.81 yen at late morning, down 0.25 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its level of 120.62 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices started slightly lower on  
profit-taking as market players worried that Japan's still weak 
economic fundamentals did not warrant the Nikkei's rise of 4 
percent since the end of last month.

<HEADLINE> Duval Dominates Masters Practice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- David Duval didn't even bring his golf clubs  
to Augusta National and he still managed to dominate the first day 
of practice for the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	While Duval did nothing but have a little lunch in the clubhouse  
and formally register for the first major of the season, player 
after player walked off the 18th green Monday with the hottest 
player in the game on their minds. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the changes made to toughen up the golf course came in  
second to talk about the streak Duval finds himself on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish he would play a little less, so maybe I might win  
one,'' Justin Leonard said. ``What he's done is incredible. If 
there was somebody whose respect he didn't have before this year, I 
think he's gained it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of his last two tournaments and four already in the  
young year, Duval is a favorite not only in the Las Vegas sports 
books (5-1), but also among his peers to do what he agrees is 
necessary to validate his career -- win his first major. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since Tom Watson in 1980 and Johnny Miller six years prior  
to that has a golfer dominated on the PGA Tour like Duval has in 
the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't won a major yet,'' Fred Couples said. ``But he's won  
11 of the last 34 times he's played. That's borderline ridiculous. 
I don't know of anyone else who's done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, who never plays on the Monday of a tournament, arrived  
with little fanfare on the back of a golf cart to take in the scene 
and have a bite to eat before getting down to business Tuesday with 
his tournament preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	He enters the week fresh off wins at The Players Championship  
and the BellSouth Classic, just two hours down the road in Atlanta. 
He also enters with the added confidence of having played well 
enough last year to miss a playoff only when Mark O'Meara knocked 
in a 20-footer for birdie on the last hole to win his first major. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine he's going to suffer any kind of letdown,''  
said Mark Calcavecchia. ``It's got to be a pretty good way to come 
into this tournament, winning two in a row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, Duval agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's helpful to win the week before you go  
somewhere,'' Duval said. ``It makes you realize that what you're 
doing, you're doing right. And I know I can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's streak not only shoved Tiger Woods out of the favorite's  
role, it also overshadowed the changes made to the golf course 
inspired by the runaway win by Woods two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Two new tee boxes have lengthened the course and a heftier cut  
of rough might make it more difficult to stop the ball on Augusta's 
slick greens if players miss the generally forgiving fairways. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes will be most evident on the par-5 15th, where  
fairway mounds that many times funneled balls further down the 
fairway have virtually been eliminated and 20 mature pine trees 
planted in their place. Six more pine trees frame the green, 
replacing a mound to the right of the green. 
</P>
<P>
	On 17, the tee was moved back 25 yards, bringing back into play  
the pine tree that President Eisenhower wanted to have cut down 
after it caught one too many of his drives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more the length, the more of an advantage to the long  
hitters,'' Steve Stricker said. ``No. 17 is a perfect example.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That could favor Woods, of course, who overpowered the course  
two years ago, shooting 18 under and winning by 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods was in contention at The Players Championship before  
fading, and took last week off to prepare for the only major he has 
won. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it is not Woods any longer who inspires fear from his  
fellow competitors. Taking that spot is Duval, who shot four rounds 
in the 60s to win in Atlanta and made it look easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see his name on the scoreboard and it's like, `OK now,  
here he comes,'' Fred Funk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's performance is even more remarkable in that he appears  
to be capable of carrying it on for a long period of time. He's 
talked about feeling peaceful, and very much in control of himself 
behind those wraparound shades. 
</P>
<P>
	The thought of winning his first major at the age of 27, though,  
could cause his heart to skip a beat or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited,'' Duval said. ``It's a big week and I'm looking  
forward to it.''

	NATO Rejects Yugoslav Truce Offer  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Calling it a sham, Western leaders  
rejected Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's proposed Orthodox 
Easter cease-fire against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Neither the 
cease-fire declaration nor statements from Yugoslav officials said 
anything about holding fire against NATO forces, which mounted 
their most intensive strikes of the two-week-old air campaign and 
promised heavier firepower to come. The allies demand that 
Milosevic withdraw military and paramilitary troops from Kosovo and 
accept an international military force to police a settlement that 
grants autonomy to the Serb province. A Kosovo rebel spokesman also 
rejected the cease-fire.

	US To House Kosovo Refugees in Cuba  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration announced the  
United States would take in up to 20,000 ethnic Albanian refugees 
from Kosovo and house them temporarily at the U.S. naval base at 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Brian Atwood, administrator of the U.S. 
Agency for International Development, said he expected the first 
refugees to be flown to Guantanamo by the week's end. The Kosovar 
Albanians will be given ``temporary protective status'' for up to 
18 months, he said, adding that he expected conditions in Kosovo 
would allow them to return to their homeland before then.

	Chinese Premier Begins U.S. Visit

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite tense relations between Beijing and  
Washington, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today opened a nine-day U.S. 
visit in Los Angeles. China has called for a halt to the NATO 
airstrikes in Yugoslavia and it resents a U.S. initiative to 
provide a missile defense shield for Japan and Taiwan. In the 
United States, criticism of China's human rights record is 
widespread and there is concern over alleged nuclear espionage. 
Even so, Zhu still hopes to close a deal to allow Beijing to join 
the World Trade Organization when he meets with President Clinton 
on Thursday. Zhu will also visit Denver, Chicago, New York and 
Boston.

	Side Air Bags Do Well in Test

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Side air bags on Ford Motor Co.'s 1999 models  
greatly reduce the likelihood of serious head injury to the driver 
in crash tests, a safety research institute said. The Insurance 
Institute for Highway Safety crashed a 1999 Lincoln Town Car, 
hurtling it sideways into an upright pole that smashed into the 
driver's side door. The side air bag cushioned the dummy's head 
from the force of the crash, making it ``survivable despite the 
(crash's) severity,'' said institute president Brian O'Neill.

	Young Face Greater Smoking Perils

smoking, the more damage is done. The research, which appears in 
tomorrow's Journal of the National Cancer Institute, shows that 
smoking in the teen-age years causes permanent genetic changes in 
the lungs and forever increases the risk of lung cancer. About 3 
million teen-agers now smoke, according to government estimates.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hundreds of universities are launching courses

whether a seat in front of a computer is as good as a seat in a 
college classroom. The College Board warns that Internet courses 
could hinder the progress of poor and minority students who arrive 
at college with less exposure to computers than white or 
more-affluent students. And a report by the Institute for Higher 
Education Policy says colleges still lack enough knowledge about 
Internet-based learning to justify its rapid growth.

Albert Belle was the highest-paid player for the third straight 
season, earning $11,949,794. The New York Yankees opened with 
baseball's highest payroll ever, $85.1 million -- an average of

	Yugoslav Leader Declares Cease-Fire  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic declared a unilateral cease-fire Tuesday in his campaign 
to crush rebels in Kosovo, saying he wanted to honor the Orthodox 
Easter holiday this weekend. Western leaders called the move a sham 
and pledged to press ahead with airstrikes. Moments after the 
cease-fire took effect at 8 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT), air-raid sirens 
wailed in Belgrade, heralding new NATO attacks. President Clinton 
and NATO insisted that half-measures would not end the NATO air 
campaign that began March 24, and British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair's office said Milosevic's announced truce ``doesn't go nearly 
far enough.''

	NATO Troops in Bosnia Fired On

	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- A NATO helicopter flying on  
a routine mission apparently came under fire over Bosnian Serb 
territory, NATO officials said Tuesday, the latest in a recent 
series of attacks on alliance-led forces in Bosnia. The crew of a 
Black Hawk helicopter observed a flash on the ground 10 miles 
southwest of the northern Bosnian city of Doboj on Monday. Within 
seconds they saw an object fly in front of them, forcing them to 
take ``evasive action.'' The helicopter landed safely. NATO-led 
forces are investigating the incident and received assurances from 
the Bosnian Serb Army and local police that they will cooperate.

	Missouri Votes on Concealed Guns

<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri voters decided Tuesday in a  
close contest whether to lift a concealed-weapons ban dating to the 
days of Jesse James. With 67 percent of the vote counted, a slight 
majority of voters favored Proposition B, which would lift the ban. 
The secretary of state's office said the partial tally had 418,634 
voting for the proposition and 413,296 voting against. The vote 
marked the first time a state has put the question of concealed 
weapons to the voters.

during a meeting but they did not have time for adequate 
discussion. ``It would have taken all morning,'' Zhu said. Zhu's

people advocating a free Tibet and an independent Taiwan. His trip

awarded to a former three-pack-a-day smoker with lung cancer. Judge 
John Munter said the punitive award in Patricia Henley's case was 
excessive. The judge said an award of $25 million is enough to 
punish Philip Morris for misleading the public about the dangers of 
smoking and for marketing cigarettes to teen-agers.

fraud'' areas, according to a lawsuit. ``This is redlining at its 
worst,'' said co-counsel Raymond Boucher, who filed the lawsuit 
Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court on behalf of Darren Haylock. 
Haylock attempted to make a call last week from South Central Los 
Angeles to Belize but MCI refused to let the call go through, the 
lawsuit states. An operator told Haylock that South Central was 
considered a ``high fraud'' area and blocked the call.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Votes on Concealed Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri voters decided Tuesday  
whether to lift a concealed-weapons ban dating to the days of Jesse 
James. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote marked the first time a state has put the question of  
concealed weapons to the voters. Thirty-one other states allow 
citizens to carry concealed guns, but those measures were enacted 
by legislators. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition B resulted from failed yearly attempts by pro-gun  
lawmakers to pass a concealed-weapons law against a threatened veto 
by Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association almost singlehandedly bankrolled  
the campaign for Proposition B -- providing more than $3.7 million, 
well over 95 percent of the money behind the measure -- in what was 
viewed as an important test of gun sentiment in the heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since this is the first time it's ever been put to a vote,  
both sides on this issue are going to learn a tremendous amount,'' 
said Fred Myers, a leader of the Proposition B campaign. ``This 
will be a race that political scientists and pundits will mull for 
years, because it's breaking such new ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said allowing law-abiding people to pack guns would  
keep the criminals guessing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The honest people of this state need to be able to defend  
themselves while going from their homes to their businesses,'' Greg 
Jeffrey, a spokesman for the Proposition B campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The other side received just one-fourth the funding but had help  
from Hillary Rodham Clinton, who recorded a telemarketing message 
targeted at women. The first lady said Proposition B is ``just too 
dangerous for Missouri families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch was among the law  
enforcement officers who feared the measure would court trouble: 
``We don't want to be going back to the old Wild West days with 
everyone wearing a gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James, the Wild West's most notorious outlaw, was a native of  
Kearny. Missouri banned concealed weapons in a crackdown on 
gunslinging in 1875, seven years before James was shot to death on 
the family homestead by a member of his gang. 
</P>
<P>
	If Proposition B passes, state residents will need a second  
permit to carry a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Applicants will have to undergo criminal and mental health  
background checks, take at least 12 hours of state-approved 
training and have no violent offenses on their records for at least 
five years.

<HEADLINE> Brit Air Offers Loans to Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Airways is trying to give business a lift  
by offering to help customers pay for their flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline began Tuesday offering travel loans of between $800  
to $24,000 to make it easier for people to splurge on their 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	The loans carry a 15.9 percent annual interest rate, and  
borrowers will have up to two years to repay. Customers also will 
have the option of repaying their loans within three months without 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways said it is the first airline to offer such a  
service. The loans are currently available at six of the company's 
travel shops in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways hopes the offer will appeal to customers by  
making it easier for them to plan and book holiday flights, said a 
spokeswoman, Sara Jones. ``Obviously it would attract new customers 
as well,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the program catches on, British Airways will make it  
available at all of its 23 travel shops in Britain. The airline is 
working with Abbey National Group to provide the loans.

	XENIA, Ohio (AP) -- A man who killed a couple at a Valentine's  
Day dance was sentenced Tuesday to the death penalty he begged for 
at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	James Taylor, who served as his own lawyer, was sentenced by  
Judge Thomas Rose, who accepted the jury's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 68, was convicted of killing Ronald Rihm, 51, and Rihm's  
wife, Carolyn, 57, in 1998. Prosecutors said Taylor had gone to the 
dance to kill his wife, who had left him and moved in with the 
Rihms. She was not shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said that he intended to kill himself in front of his  
wife but that his gun went off accidentally when Rihm bumped his 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Rihms were his friends, and he asked for the death  
penalty, saying he felt sorry for them. 
</P>
<P>
	But at Tuesday's sentencing, Taylor proclaimed his innocence.

<HEADLINE> Man Accused in Hit on Boy's Dad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABILENE, Texas (AP) -- Sixteen-year-old Brandon Lund wanted his  
father dead. So the teen-ager came up with a solution straight out 
of the ``T.J. Hooker'' reruns he loved to watch: He hired a hitman. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Brandon had a change of heart, the former Boy Scout  
learned that calling off a hit isn't like canceling a dentist 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the alleged hitman, Billy Don Wilson, went on trial  
on murder charges for allegedly breaking into the Lund home with 
five other people and killing Brandon's father for his $5,000 gun 
collection in 1998. Brandon was also slashed with a knife but 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you set out to find cold-blooded, calculating people, the  
tables can turn on you in horrible ways that can't be predicted,'' 
said District Attorney James Eidson. ``Apparently, the gun 
collection enticed Wilson so much that he didn't care about whether 
Brandon wanted his father dead or not. In fact, Brandon became a 
liability in a plan he initiated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Wilson, 23, will receive an automatic life  
sentence. Prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon, now 17, was convicted in October and sentenced to two  
years in a juvenile prison. He and two members of Wilson's gang are 
expected to testify against Wilson. Three others are awaiting trial 
on lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear why Brandon wanted someone to kill his father,  
46-year-old Mark Lund. At Brandon's trial, prosecutor Dan Joiner 
argued that the teen-ager had no specific reason: ``He just didn't 
like the way his father was running the household.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon, who loved old cop shows, sought out a hired killer.  
Police say he fell in with a crowd of rough outcasts who robbed 
homes, stole cars and were willing to kill Brandon's father for a 
price -- the man's military gun collection. 
</P>
<P>
	The pack was deep into masterminding the killing when Wilson,  
its leader, received a phone call. It was Brandon, sounding scared 
and confused, but certain that he had changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brandon's position has always been that whatever he said, he  
did everything in his power to stop what was going on,'' said 
Brandon's lawyer, Ed Paynter. ``I've always maintained that 
whatever Brandon did didn't have a damn thing to do with those six 
hoodlums killing his dad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Wilson and his gang went ahead with their plan  
anyway and executed it with assassinlike efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in black, they cut the phone line and crept through a  
window. After ransacking the house, Wilson pushed Mark Lund onto a 
bed, shoved a pillow in his face and shot him in the head, 
prosecutors allege. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, a member of Wilson's gang scratched a cross on Brandon's  
face with her fingernail and slashed his throat with a knife, 
prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's attorney, Mike Fouts, said he will suggest that someone  
else in the gang was the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing is apparent,'' Fouts said. ``From the get-go  
everyone is telling different stories and trying to cover 
themselves. We have to look more closely at the situation to really 
determine what happened that night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Lee, 21, and Charles ``Eight Ball'' Allen, 19, will get no  
more than 35 years in prison if they testify as promised at the 
trials of the other defendants.

<HEADLINE> Young Face Greater Smoking Perils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Smoking in the teen-age years causes permanent  
genetic changes in the lungs and forever increases the risk of lung 
cancer -- even if the smoker quits, a study finds. And the younger 
the smoking starts, the more damage is done. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, at a time when more than a third of teens take up  
the smoking habit, shows ``there is something uniquely bad about 
starting young,'' said John K. Wiencke, a genetics expert at the 
University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The research gives powerful laboratory evidence of why starting  
smoking before the age of 18 can be particularly harmful to 
long-term health, said Wiencke, author of a study Wednesday in the 
Journal of the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Youthful smoking on a daily basis apparently causes lung damage  
that lasts a lifetime, he said. Such damage is less likely among 
smokers who start in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like it is the age when smoking starts that is  
important,'' Wiencke said. ``It didn't matter if they were heavy or 
light smokers -- what mattered is that they started young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies have indicated that young smoking stunts the  
lungs' full development and increases the risk of breathing 
problems later in life. Studies have also shown that smoking in the 
teen years is more addictive and that smokers who begin young are 
less likely to break the habit. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wiencke's study for the first time shows dramatic and  
enduring DNA damage caused by youthful smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``This reinforces the idea that we need to stop young people  
from smoking, not only from the addiction standpoint, but also from 
the cancer risk standpoint,'' Wiencke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveys by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  
indicate that 34.8 percent of high school students were regular 
smokers in 1995. That number rose to 36.4 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Of smokers ages 30 to 39, 62 percent had tried smoking by the  
age of 16, and 24.9 percent had taken up the smoking habit 
permanently by that age, the CDC found. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3 million teen-agers now smoke, the government estimates.  
And about a third of all smokers will die of smoking-related 
illnesses, including lung and other types of cancers, heart 
disease, stroke, emphysema and chronic pulmonary obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	In their study, Wiencke and colleagues tested for DNA  
alterations in the nontumor lung tissue of patients being treated 
for lung cancer. The group included 57 people who were current 
smokers, 79 who were former smokers and seven who had never smoked. 
</P>
<P>
	The healthy lung tissue was tested for the number of DNA  
alterations per 10 billion cells. Some alterations occur with age, 
but the number of gene changes was much higher among smokers -- and 
highest of all among those who started smoking at a young age, 
Wiencke said. 
</P>
<P>
	For nonsmokers, there were 32 DNA alterations per 10 billion  
cells. For current smokers, the alterations were about eight times 
higher. The findings were adjusted statistically for the number of 
years smoked and for the amount smoked. 
</P>
<P>
	The startling discovery was that for former smokers, the  
important factor determining DNA damage was when they started 
smoking, not how long or how much, Wiencke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former smokers who started at age 7 through their 15th birthdays  
had an average of 164 genetic alterations. Ex-smokers who started 
from ages 15 through 17 had an average 115 alterations. 
</P>
<P>
	Among ex-smokers who didn't start smoking until after they were  
20, however, the DNA alternations averaged 81, fewer than half that 
of people who started smoking earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Such alterations occur when chemicals in tobacco smoke fuse with  
genes in the DNA of lung cells. These chemical complexes, called 
adducts, cause mutations and significantly increase cancer risk, 
said Wiencke. 
</P>
<P>
	The study shows that ``genetic alterations from tobacco  
carcinogen exposure may persist in former smokers,'' said an 
editorial in the journal by three cancer researchers at the 
University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. The 
editorial said the finding ``fits one more piece into the lung 
cancer risk assessment puzzle.''

<HEADLINE> Company Urges Employees to Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A small New Jersey financial services  
company has come up with a unique way to inspire company spirit and 
improve employee fitness -- corporate marathoning. 
</P>
<P>
	J.G. Wentworth, which has offices in Philadelphia and Fort Lee,  
N.J., offered any employee who finished a four-month training 
program an all-expenses-paid trip to the Los Angeles Marathon. 
Forty-six workers started the program, or about 20 percent of the 
250-person staff; 29 completed the training, got the free trip and 
ran in the March 14 marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Even non-runners got into the spirit by rooting on the  
marathoners and hosting pasta dinners and a welcome-home party. 
</P>
<P>
	Though 5 a.m. training runs and workers limping around the  
office with sore knees may not seem like morale boosters, company 
officials said the marathon wellness program has improved company 
loyalty, led employees to work longer hours and created a more 
relaxed workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people are healthier, they work better and they enjoy  
their lives more,'' executive vice president Michael Goodman said. 
``Because of this, we're a better company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The marathon program was so successful, J.G. Wentworth is doing  
it again. The company is giving away free trips to the London 
Marathon in April 2000 for employees who earn points by running a 
series of training races. If 50 people qualify for the marathon and 
the company reaches certain sales targets, the entire staff will 
get a free trip to England. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never ran a day in my life. But I started the day after I  
got the e-mail,'' said Tom Hoffman, who ran Los Angeles and now is 
training for London. ``I wanted the free trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company has tried other employee incentive programs,  
including offering trips for white-water rafting or to Washington, 
D.C., based on certain company goals. But the marathon-wellness 
program was the most successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want to come into work,'' said vice president Randi  
Sellari, who ran the marathon despite painful tendinitis in both 
knees. ``They have company loyalty, where they didn't have it 
before. People are talking about the company; they are motivated. I 
see people staying later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Training was the hardest part for most of the J.G. Wentworth  
employees, who often work 10- or 12-hour days. Employees met 
several times a week at 5 a.m. for runs either in Central Park in 
New York or along the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia. On the 
weekends, they would meet for two- to three-hour runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how quickly you become friends with people that  
you run with almost every day, especially when it's 20 degrees 
outside and its six o'clock in the morning,'' said Al Nickelberry, 
director of sales and a 20-year marathoner who helped set up the 
company's training regiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelberry and Goodman have become unlikely training partners.  
Nickelberry has run since he could walk, completing about two 
marathons a year for more than a decade. Goodman never liked 
running and never thought of doing a marathon. But the pair, who 
both live in the New York suburbs, still meet twice a week for 
pre-dawn runs in Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running is something that once you get over that hump  
everybody in the company can do, and everybody finds their level 
and finds partners to run with,'' Goodman said. ``You find people 
that you wouldn't normally relate to, and you relate to them about 
running.''

<HEADLINE> Hope Seen in Japan's Auto Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Flanked by local rivals such as Honda and Toyota on  
a gritty road lined with dealerships, Ford dealer Yoshiaki Kikuchi 
has the unenviable task of hawking American cars to Japanese 
consumers who aren't exactly running to make big purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers have been hit harder by Japan's recession than just  
about any other industry. Domestic sales have fallen 23 consecutive 
months, plunging by about 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just hanging on,'' said Kikuchi, ``doing our best to  
stay in business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts see demand roaring back once the recession eases  
up. And, while dealers fight for survival on the front lines, 
Japanese and foreign automakers are jockeying for position to cash 
in when the market finally comes around. 
</P>
<P>
	American carmakers, which have always struggled in Japan, are  
investing in their sales networks, a major weakness, hoping to make 
significant inroads before the locals can turn the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor has been pouring money into distribution channels and  
is about to enter Japan's cutthroat small-car market for the first 
time with its Ka model -- a big hit in Europe that is expected to 
appeal to Japanese tastes. 
</P>
<P>
	German-American automaker DaimlerChrysler AG, meanwhile, has  
broken ties with Japanese partners to sell some of its models 
independently. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the aggressive strategy is sound.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've established a stronger network, so they'll be able to  
ultimately benefit when the market gets stronger,'' said Peter 
Boardman, an industry analyst with Warburg Dillon Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Japanese manufacturers are also toughening up with  
production cutbacks and cash infusions from foreign partners. 
Analysts expect them to emerge from the recession more formidable 
than ever, having finally been forced to confront structural 
problems and increase efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Renault of France agreed to invest $5.4 billion in  
Nissan Motor, taking a 37 percent stake in the debt-burdened 
automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	And Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's biggest automaker, has slashed  
production at its main plant in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you see the market correct and stabilize, I think we're  
going to see the Japanese come back stronger than they were 
before,'' said Steve Usher, an auto analyst with Jardine Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say Japan's automakers have fared remarkably well amid  
the sharp downturn in domestic sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty incredible,'' Usher said. ``There's not an  
American or European carmaker that could have sustained that kind 
of pressure in their core market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A weak yen has helped them weather the difficulties by making  
Japanese exports less expensive in other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	But exports, which account for nearly half of the automakers'  
sales, might not continue to prop up the industry if the yen posts 
a sharp recovery or demand drops off in key markets such as the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say that despite falling revenue, Japanese automakers  
are in a strong position because they retain a technological edge 
over their foreign rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	They are said to hold a big lead in the development of  
environment-friendly vehicles, which are expected to become an 
important part of the market in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota was the first automaker to market a gasoline-electric  
hybrid car and Honda Motor Co. plans to launch one this year. 
Overseas rivals don't expect to have their versions ready for sale 
before 2001.

<HEADLINE> Guard Urges Fishing Boat Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A U.S. Coast Guard panel has recommended mandatory  
inspections of fishing boats and licensing of skippers in the wake 
of four sinkings along the East Coast that killed 11 clam 
fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
	Most fishing fatalities -- including the recent deaths -- are  
preventable, said the Fishing Vessel Casualty Task Force. The 
report was to be released today by Coast Guard officials in 
Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The spate of accidents in December and January wasn't unique,  
the report said. A comparison of deaths of the last four years 
showed no significant shift in casualty statistics, the Coast Guard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inadequate safety standards, poor compliance with safety  
regulations, and insufficient participation in voluntary safety 
measures too often lead to unsafe conditions, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel recommended several measures -- including operator  
licenses, competency certificates for crew and mandatory vessel 
inspections, all of which would require congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tragic deaths described in this report tell us that the  
time is right to seek breakthrough levels of casualty reduction,'' 
Rear Admiral R.C. North wrote in a memo attached to a report. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, boat inspections are voluntary, and many owners fail  
to maintain their vessels, equipment and basic safety gear, the 
task force said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of fishing vessel safety standards is analogous to  
requiring parachutes for an airplane crew, but only marketing 
voluntary measures to encourage a mechanically sound aircraft and a 
competent pilot and crew,'' the report said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Judy, Hubby May Compete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It may soon be Judge Judy vs. Mr. Judge Judy in  
the court of public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Sheindlin, the husband of ``Judge Judy'' Sheindlin and  
like her a retired New York City judge, is talking to producers of 
the ``People's Court'' about taking over as its arbiter, according 
to an executive with the syndicated TV show's distributors who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Left in the cold could be current ``People's Court'' jurist  
Edward Koch, who appointed both Sheindlins to the bench when he was 
New York City mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judge Judy'' has dominated the newly hot court show genre, its  
ratings up 76 percent over last season, and has made the 
no-nonsense former judge a star. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the ratings for ``People's Court'' haven't changed  
over the past year and two new TV judges, Joe Brown and Mills Lane, 
have passed Koch in average audience size, said Marc Berman, a 
television analyst for the media buying firm Seltel. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience for ``Judge Judy'' is two and a half times that of  
``People's Court,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Signing up Judy's husband could entice curious viewers who  
wonder what sort of man would live with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a bad thing, because the show needs some  
attention,'' Berman said. ``I don't think he will beat Judy in the 
long run, but it will bring people in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear what Gerald Sheindlin's workload would be;  
``People's Court'' has discussed having him appear in at least half 
of the shows during the TV season that begins in September, said 
the executive from Warner Bros. Television, the show's 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Judy sent word through a spokeswoman that she didn't want  
to talk about potentially competing with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	An executive at ``Judge Judy'' seemed to be spoiling for a  
fight, despite asking not to be identified. ``We can't wait,'' the 
executive said. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch has presided over ``People's Court'' since the show was  
revived in September 1997. ``People's Court'' with Judge Joseph 
Wapner was as much a cultural touchstone in the 1980s as ``Judge 
Judy'' is today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 74-year-old former mayor, who was hospitalized briefly for  
low blood pressure last month, referred calls to producers at 
``People's Court.''

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Comes With Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- If theaters want the Force to be with them,  
they may have to meet strict conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio distributing the eagerly anticipated ``Star Wars:  
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' wants multiplexes to show the 
movie only in their biggest and best theaters for at least two 
months, with no more than eight minutes of coming attractions. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, 20th Century Fox is asking that theater owners who  
play ``Phantom'' on more than one screen keep it on all those 
screens through the minimum run. Theaters are also being told to 
refrain from using a single movie print to show the film on two 
screens. And they're being asked not to show any non-movie 
advertisements before the film. 
</P>
<P>
	These, at least, are the conditions Fox wants. The final terms  
still must be worked out over the next few weeks in negotiations 
between the studio and theater owners. 
</P>
<P>
	If Fox gets its way, a theater failing to follow the studio's  
conditions could be hit with hefty fines or lose the right to show 
what could be one of the highest-grossing films of all time, one 
expected to rival ``Titanic.'' ``Titanic'' grossed a record $600 
million in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are often conditions put on (theaters), but this is  
pretty unusual,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor 
Relations Co., which tracks the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Fox feels that with this type of product they can make  
these demands and the exhibitors will agree to them. I mean, who 
wouldn't want to have their theater playing this movie?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Phantom'' opens May 19. The movie is a ``prequel'' to the  
``Star Wars'' trilogy of the 1970s and '80s, taking audiences back 
to when Darth Vader was a child. The film is accompanied by a major 
merchandising and promotional campaign that includes toys and 
souvenir Pepsi cans. 
</P>
<P>
	How many theaters will show the movie is still unknown because  
it is uncertain how many of them will agree to these and other 
terms dictated by Fox, which is distributing the movie for director 
George Lucas. He financed it himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions were first reported Tuesday in the Hollywood  
trade publication Daily Variety. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at 20th Century Fox declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Several theater chain owners said they couldn't discuss the  
conditions because they had not yet negotiated with Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	These conditions are in addition to the previously announced  
requests by Fox and Lucas that theaters refrain from selling 
tickets in advance -- a move that is aimed at thwarting scalping but 
is likely to mean longer lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The request -- still being negotiated with theaters -- would be a  
blow to ticket services like Moviefone, through which people can 
buy tickets by phone for a service charge of about $1.50 per 
ticket.

<HEADLINE> Rodman, Actress Say Marriage is Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eccentric basketball rebounding star Dennis  
Rodman and his actress wife Carmen Electra have called their 
marriage quits -- again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carmen Electra and Dennis Rodman have announced that they have  
mutually agreed to end their 6-month-old marriage under amicable 
circumstances. Divorce papers were filed today in Los Angeles on 
behalf of Miss Electra. Miss Electra and Mr. Rodman are and will 
remain friends,'' publicist Matt Labov said Tuesday, speaking for 
both. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, 37, and Electra, 26, were married in Las Vegas on Nov.  
14 after what was reported to be an all-night bender. Nine days 
later, Rodman cried fraud and filed for an annulment, saying he was 
of unsound mind when he recited his vows. 
</P>
<P>
	Electra, whose real name is Tara Patrick, was with Rodman at  
Planet Hollywood in February when he announced he would be joining 
the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	During that news conference, Rodman said he and his wife were  
happily married, but living in separate homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Electra attended several games to watch her husband play.  
</P>
<P>
	Then on March 13, Rodman, 37, received permission to leave the  
Lakers to resolve personal issues. He rejoined the team in Orlando 
on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time rebounding champion, who has helped teams win  
five NBA championships, insisted the eight-day break had nothing to 
do with drinking, gambling, smoking or marital problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman later stated it was Electra who encouraged him to return.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was an instant hit with fans when he joined the team,  
helping the Lakers win nine straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the team has performed erratically since Rodman  
returned from his leave of absence. One of the lowest points came 
Saturday night when Rodman was ejected after picking up two 
technical fouls in the final minutes of an 81-76 loss to visiting 
Golden State.

<HEADLINE> Viagra Lures Men to Doctor's Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- The benefits of Viagra are extending  
beyond the pill's ability to restore sexual function in men. 
</P>
<P>
	A physician at the University of Vermont College of Medicine  
says that the anti-impotency drug is luring into his office men who 
usually wouldn't go to see their doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, they are getting beneficial treatment that they may  
have missed out on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quality of life issues for patients are what matter,'' said  
Dr. Mark Plante, a urologist and assistant professor of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Plante is not keeping records of his Viagra patients, but says  
there is no doubt that many men looking for the drug are being 
helped in other ways.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Company Recalls Salmon Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A New Jersey company is recalling all  
varieties of Perona Farms smoked salmon dip because it may be 
contaminated with listeria, a type of serious, sometimes 
lifethreatening, bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who have purchased 8-ounce containers of Perona Farms  
smoked salmon dip -- including Moroccan, scampi and pastrami 
varieties -- should not eat the dip, but return it to the place of 
purchase for a refund. 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy people may suffer only such symptoms as severe headache,  
nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea from listeria. But the germ can 
cause serious, even fatal, infections in young children, the 
elderly or people with weak immune systems, and can cause 
miscarriages in pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
	Food inspectors in New York found listeria in one batch of  
smoked salmon dip, but Perona Farms of Andover, N.J., said Tuesday 
it is recalling all batches and varieties of the dip. No illnesses 
have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The dip was sold in stores in Washington, D.C., and 12 states:  
New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, 
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, 
Kentucky and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers may contact the company at 1-800-750-6190.

<HEADLINE> Japan Criticizes U.S. Trade Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's farm minister said Tuesday that the  
possible invocation of a section of a controversial U.S. trade law 
could damage ties between Washington and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoichi Nakagawa, who heads the Ministry of Agriculture,  
Forestry and Fisheries, said the punitive Super 301 provision goes 
against the spirit of the World Trade Organization, according to a 
ministry spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the U.S. is trying to implement it, it is bad for  
U.S.-Japan relations,'' the spokesman, speaking on customary 
condition of anonymity, quoted Nakagawa as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Nakagawa's comments come after the United States released its  
annual report on foreign trade barriers on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Washington would urge Tokyo to implement further  
deregulation measures in the telecommunications, housing, medical 
services and pharmaceuticals sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese media reports have interpreted that as an indication  
the Clinton administration is threatening to invoke Super 301 if no 
progress is made on insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Kaoru Yosano, Japan's trade minister, criticized the  
report, saying it was ``not necessarily based on international 
rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Japanese officials are scheduled to hold working-level  
talks on Japan's insurance market next week in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Pungent Cash Trips Up Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ERIE, Pa. (AP) -- A man who allegedly grabbed $500,000 in cash  
from the safe of his fiancee's parents and went on a spending spree 
with a pal was tripped up because the stash had been there so long 
it had taken on a musty odor. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the dancers at an Erie strip club smelled trouble  
after 23-year-old Steven P. Woitkowski and a friend gave them tips 
totaling nearly $8,000 over two days in early February. Woitkowski 
now faces burglary and theft charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say a tip from the club's owner about the pungent  
cash halted a spending spree by Woitkowski that also included a new 
Mercedes-Benz, video and stereo equipment and a trip to Atlantic 
City with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	His friend Joseph Dibble faces related counts for allegedly  
using the cash to tip the dancers along with paying late rent, 
child support and traffic tickets. Both are scheduled for June 1 
court hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the crimes occurred at about the time Woitkowski was  
scheduled to meet his fiancee -- the Salchaks' daughter, Nicole -- 
for a Valentine's Day getaway with the family in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	When Woitkowski didn't show, Nicole Salchak returned on Feb. 16  
to find he had cleared out of the apartment they shared. Four days 
later, her parents returned home to an empty safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Police suspect Woitkowski had a key to the Salchaks' home and  
knew their safe's combination. Officials say they have recovered 
$35,000, every bill rife with the safe's old-money smell. 
</P>
<P>
	Woitkowski's lawyer, Dennis Williams, said his client  
``emphatically denies any involvement'' in the theft or spending 
spree. Dibble's lawyer, Gene Placidi, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way the Salchaks described it, this money was their life  
savings,'' said Millcreek Township Detective Lt. William Detisch. 
``They've indicated to us that they just didn't trust banks. If 
they choose not to make interest on the money and keep it in a 
safe, who's to say they can't do that?''

<HEADLINE> Changes Made in Masters Tradition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga.. (AP) -- It's been a year of changes under Augusta  
National chairman Hootie Johnson and there will be another 
tradition change when players tee off on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	No longer will the players go off in twosomes. They'll play in  
threesomes the first two days and switch to twosomes for the 
weekend. The low 44 players and ties, plus any player within 10 
shots of the leader, qualify for play on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups will stay the same for the first two days with set tee  
times. In the past, pairings were redone according to the score 
after the first day of play. 
</P>
<P>
	Masters officials cited increasingly larger fields as the reason  
for threesomes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have rounds taking closer to five hours,'' Couples  
said. ``At Augusta we're used to a quicker pace. I can only 
remember a few times we played threesomes because of the weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Mark O'Meara will play with U.S. amateur  
champion Hank Kuehne and England's Lee Westwood for the first two 
days, going off at 1:12 p.m. on Thursday and 10:16 a.m. on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other changes this year include the growing of rough,  
alterations to four holes to make the course player longer and 
harder, and ending the annual international players dinner. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *KUCHAR ILL BUT HOPES TO PLAY:* Amateur Matt Kuchar captivated  
the Masters crowds in 1998 with his 21st-place finish but he's 
battling a stomach virus that might keep him from playing this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuchar, a junior at Georgia Tech, was taken to a hospital on  
Tuesday in a run-down condition after he practiced for nine holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Chest X-rays showed no problems and he didn't have a  
temperature. Father and caddy Peter Kuchar said his son still 
``hopes to tee it up on Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FLOWER FANS REJOICE:* This may be the best year for flowers at  
Augusta National since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	The azaleas, dogwoods, wisterias and forsythia are blooming in  
all their glory, perfectly timed for the opening of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Trippe of Spartanburg, S.C., who has watched 38 Masters,  
said it's the best he's seen since the year Jack Nicklaus won his 
second green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	``The floral color has been off the last two years but this year  
I'm comparing it to the 1965 tournament,'' Trippe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Augusta National officials said the peak of the bloom could come  
later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
                              	----	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GLITTERING TRIBUTE TO NICKLAUS:* Greg Norman said a Masters  
without Jack Nicklaus is ``like your wife losing a diamond out of a 
wedding ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus will miss his first Masters in 40 years because of hip  
surgery and Norman said all the players will miss him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He put the Masters on the map for the modern day player,''  
Norman said. ``He is it, the Masters. It will be a sad weekend 
without him.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              	----	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DEFENDING CHAMPION BATTLING A COLD:* Defending champion Mark  
O'Meara caught cold from one of his kids and it kept him and Tiger 
Woods from their annual pre-Masters week battles at their home club 
in Isleworth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling better but I'm not 100 percent,'' O'Meara said on  
Tuesday. ``I was a little run down from playing three weeks in a 
row and got the cold from one of my kids. Tiger and I didn't get to 
play against each other like we usually do. There was no reason to 
push it. I feel better after a good night's sleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said, ``Mark was really under the weather. He needed to  
take it easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two only played once. O'Meara won the money.  
</P>
<P>
	While he was off, O'Meara worked on the menu for Tuesday night's  
champions dinner which is always hosted by the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Entree choices included chicken and steak fajitas, Italian food,  
and sushi. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sandy Lyle had haggis one year so I thought I could have  
sushi,'' O'Meara said. ``I don't like cooked fish but I like raw 
fish.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              	----	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PALMER HOPES TO MAKE THE CUT:* Arnold Palmer has missed 15  
consecutive cuts but the four-time Masters champion says he always 
is hoping he can do it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, standing in the parking lot with wife Winnie, said he is  
feeling good but not playing well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping lightning will strike Friday and I will make the  
cut,'' Palmer joked. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DUVAL FAVORED TO WIN:* No surprise. The professional oddsmakers  
have made David Duval the betting favorite to win the Masters at 
5-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is shooting for this third consecutive title after winning  
The Players Championship and the BellSouth Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Andy Clifton, the deputy chief oddsmaker at Ladbrokes  
of London, rated Tiger Woods next at 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love was 16-1, Ernie Els 20-1, and Fred Couples and Lee  
Westwood 22-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Mark O'Meara was next at 25-1.

<HEADLINE> Good Start to New Baseball Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For all those fans who spent the winter wondering whether Mark  
McGwire could do it again, start counting. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit home run No. 1 Monday night when he connected on  
opening day -- just like did last season on the way to a 
record-breaking 70. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year is over with. Turn the page,'' McGwire said after  
his St. Louis Cardinals lost to Milwaukee 10-8. ``It was a great 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said David Weathers, who served up the shot: ``Welcome to  
1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A little bit later, Ken Griffey Jr. also went deep. He hit his  
seventh home run on opening day, one behind Frank Robinson's 
record, in an 8-2 loss to Chicago. The Seattle star did it after 
career homer king Hank Aaron threw out the first ball at the 
Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even before Big Mac and Junior homered, there was plenty to  
jazz up Monday's 11 openers. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Clemens made his debut for the World Series champion New  
York Yankees, striking out eight in 6 1-3 innings in a no-decision 
at Oakland. The Rocket and his new teammates wore a No. 5 on their 
left sleeves, a tribute to the late Joe DiMaggio, but lost 5-3 in a 
rain-shortened game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken, of all people, hurt himself and had to leave a game.  
Kevin Brown, the $105 million man, was knocked out in his matchup 
with Randy Johnson. Detroit's Brian Moehler took a no-hit bid into 
the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
	And, just like last year, there were home runs. Lots of them.  
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle broke loose for Baltimore. Raul Mondesi went wild  
for Los Angeles. Jose Canseco connected for Tampa Bay. Bernard 
Gilkey hit two off Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Encarnacion wasted no time -- he homered for the Tigers on  
the first pitch of the afternoon at Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	After an opening day appetizer Sunday night in Mexico between  
Colorado and San Diego, baseball began in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call this my holy day,'' Orioles fan Robin Steel said at  
Camden Yards. ``That's what it is for those of us who worship in 
the church of baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The morning began with the traditional opening-day parade in  
Cincinnati. Later, ailing Andres Galarraga threw out the first ball 
at Atlanta, via TV hook-up from his home. At night, McGwire, 
Griffey and Clemens took over. 
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa, who hit 66 last year, and the Chicago Cubs open  
tonight at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year I was ready, but I think in 1999 I am more ready  
because a lot of people are expecting me and Mark to come back and 
do the same way,'' Sosa said after a workout at the Astrodome. ``I 
have to say that he's ready and I'm ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle was ready, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Playing his first game for the Orioles, the star who figures to  
challenge for the home-run lead this year in cozy Camden Yards hit 
a three-run homer that highlighted a 10-7 win over Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle's teammates and the crowd of 46,733 gave him a standing  
ovation, and the surly slugger responded with a rare curtain call. 
Belle also had an RBI single, more than enough to offset Canseco's 
398th lifetime homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles won despite losing Ripken, who left in the third  
inning because of a stiff lower back. Ripken, who voluntarily ended 
his record streak of 2,632 straight games last year, was listed as 
day to day. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, the Orioles unveiled a large, orange ``7'' in  
the third-base coaching box to honor Cal Ripken Sr., who died March 
24 of lung cancer at 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Jr. did not get any hits, leaving him 122 short of 3,000.  
But Wade Boggs singled twice for the Devil Rays, putting him 76 
short of the milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi delivered the biggest hits. His three-run homer with two  
outs in the bottom of the ninth tied it, and his two-run homer in 
the 11th lifted Los Angeles over Arizona 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler, meanwhile, was the day's pitching star -- rather than  
Brown or Johnson. There was slight evidence that umpires were 
calling higher strikes, as the commissioner's office ordered them 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler came within eight outs of joining Bob Feller as the only  
pitchers to throw no-hitters on opening day as Detroit defeated 
Texas 11-5. Juan Gonzalez broke up Moehler's bid with a one-out 
single in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, I was thinking about it,'' Moehler said.  
</P>
<P>
	His performance was far better than anything from the day's two  
marquee matchups: Johnson vs. Brown at Dodger Stadium or Curt 
Schilling vs. Tom Glavine at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, baseball's first $100 million man, gave up three home  
runs for the Dodgers. Johnson, who signed for $52.4 million, was 
so-so for the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	At Atlanta, neither Schilling nor Glavine was especially sharp  
as Philadelphia beat the Braves 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas City Royals once again proved that nothing counts  
until opening day. After posting baseball's best exhibition record 
at 22-9, they lost 5-3 to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Marlins, however, got off to a fine start. Worst in  
the majors last year with 108 losses, they beat the New York Mets 
6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have a lot of fun this year,'' new Marlins  
owner John Henry said.

<HEADLINE> Republic Changes Name for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Republic Industries, the nation's  
largest car retailer, changed its name to AutoNation Inc. today, 
signaling the company's focus on selling and renting cars and 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all part of our rapid and continuing development as a  
national retailer and marketer,'' said Steven R. Berrad, co-chief 
executive officer of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation USA is the name Republic used for its car  
dealerships. As part of its renaming, which is effective 
immediately, the company changed its New York Stock Exchange 
trading symbol to ``AN'' from ``RII.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation began buying new-car dealerships in December 1996 to  
cut advertising and other costs. AutoNation has more than 380 new 
automotive franchises in 20 states and 45 AutoNation USA used 
vehicle megastores in 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which also owns National Car Rental Systems Inc.  
and Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc., had 1998 sales of $17.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Wizards Fire Coach Bickerstaff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the underachieving Washington Wizards  
struggling to become a .500 team, general manager Wes Unseld 
decided ``it was just not working'' and fired his coach before the 
season was completely lost. 
</P>
<P>
	That happened two years ago. It also happened Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Unseld sent old friend Bernie Bickerstaff on his way with much  
the same words he used to dismiss Bickerstaff's predecessor, Jim 
Lynam. When Bickerstaff took over at the All-Star break in 1997, 
the team rallied to its first playoff appearance in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Unseld needs someone new to provide that same kind of spark  
to the 1999 Wizards, now 13-19 after back-to-back losses to Toronto 
and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just wasn't happening,'' Unseld said. ``And it didn't seem  
to change. With 18 games left and a chance to still be in this 
thing, I decided to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Jim Brovelli takes over as interim coach, but Unseld  
made it clear he has some candidates in mind and will start 
contacting them to try to fill the position before season's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can get the individual I am looking for, I will do that  
immediately, if possible,'' Unseld said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brovelli, 57, was 1-1 in his NBA head coaching debut earlier  
this season when Bickerstaff was out with the flu. He would not say 
whether he's interested in keeping the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it harder, because it's Bernie,'' said Brovelli, who  
worked with Bickerstaff at San Diego State and with the Denver 
Nuggets. ``He gave me the first opportunity to coach in the league. 
I'm going to miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards, who play host to the New Jersey Nets tonight,  
probably need to finish at least 13-5 to have a shot at the 
playoffs. Their backcourt of Mitch Richmond and Rod Strickland is 
one of the best and Juwan Howard is a top forward, but they lack a 
quality center and have shown a tendency to fall apart in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players said Bickerstaff's uptight demeanor made the  
atmosphere too tense, leading to nine losses in games they've led 
after the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, it did get tight a little bit,'' swingman  
Calbert Cheaney said. ``You tend not to play the way you're capable 
of playing when you're tight. In the fourth quarter, when it's time 
to make some buckets and try to win the game and you're tight, you 
can't win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff sometimes left players baffled with his novel player  
rotations. Several times this season he would play a starter for 
five minutes or so, then bench him the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys weren't very relaxed in their roles and weren't  
sure exactly what was expected of them on a nightly basis,'' guard 
Tim Legler said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the losses mounted, Bickerstaff admitted he wasn't able to  
coax his players into producing the hustle and desire necessary for 
a fourth-quarter victory. He also said his team simply wasn't as 
talented as some of the opponents, which didn't sit well with his 
players or Unseld. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a player, you don't like to read that,'' Legler said,  
``that your coach says you're not as good as another team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff's comment that ``Miami is a better team than we  
are'' after Sunday's 90-79 loss to the Heat might have clinched 
Unseld's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The personnel we have should be in the playoffs,'' Unseld  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff was in his 10th season as an NBA coach. His record  
was 338-348, including 77-71 with the Wizards. He began his 
coaching career in Washington in 1973, serving as an assistant 
until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Unseld, who played for Washington in the 1970s, lured  
Bickerstaff from his job as general manager of the Denver Nuggets 
in 1997 season. The Wizards made the playoffs that year, but were 
eliminated on the final day last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff's best showing as a coach was in 1987, when he led  
Seattle to the Western Conference finals, one of three postseason 
appearances with the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff's dismissal is the NBA's fourth coaching change this  
season, following Del Harris (Lakers), Dave Cowens (Charlotte) and 
John Calipari (New Jersey).

<HEADLINE> Israel Churches Closed in Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAZARETH, Israel (AP) -- Distraught Christians closed churches in  
Jesus' boyhood town today and some, armed with clubs, patrolled 
streets in response to weekend clashes with Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the outbreak of sectarian violence, the town of  
42,000 Muslims and 18,000 Christians was still simmering with fear 
and suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	In the predominantly Christian neighborhood of Al Mutran, dozens  
of young men stood guard outside a small chapel, St. Mary's, at 
nightfall Monday. The Muslims ``started it, and we're answering,'' 
said Gabi Maji, a member of the neighborhood watch. ``We're 
defending the lives of our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A car driven by a Muslim was pelted with stones in Al Mutran  
after some claimed the driver had made insulting comments about 
Jesus to those patrolling the neighborhood. A priest in a long blue 
robe shook his head dejectedly and pleaded with the young men over 
a loudspeaker to hold back, with some success. 
</P>
<P>
	Disappointed tourists visiting Nazareth's major attraction -- the  
Basilica of the Annunciation -- found locked gates today, with a 
notice posted on the doors in English explaining that the closure 
was an act of protest against assaults on Christians. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the way it should be. It's horrible for the people  
who were attacked,'' said Lars Petersen, 33, an elevator repairman 
from Copenhagen, Denmark, as he stood outside the church where 
tradition says the Angel Gabriel told Mary she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	With the millennium only nine months away, the Christian-Muslim  
tensions are hurting plans by the Israeli government to turn 
Nazareth into a showcase for pilgrims now that Bethlehem, Jesus' 
traditional birthplace, is under full Palestinian control. 
</P>
<P>
	At the core of the dispute is a half-acre plot next to the  
Church of the Annunciation. The Christian mayor, Ramez Jeraisi, 
wants to build a Venetian-style plaza for millennium pilgrims 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslims say the land belongs to the Islamic Trust, or Waqf, and  
demand that a large mosque be built on the site. The dispute is in 
the courts and the plaza is on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Nazareth long prided itself in its tolerance and coexistence  
between followers of the two religions. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many Muslims complain that even though they constitute  
a majority, they have not been adequately represented and that 
Christians have dominated the town's affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence erupted Easter Sunday, with the two sides accusing each  
other of starting the taunting and stoning attacks. By the end of 
the day, a dozen people were injured in street clashes. The windows 
of dozens of cars owned by Christians had been smashed. 
</P>
<P>
	In one mixed neighborhood, Yvette Aboud, a Christian, said she  
was surprised by the sudden tension. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to live here in peace,'' she said, ``not how we have  
been in the last few days.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Turn Lower; Dow Down 26.08 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned modestly lower Tuesday as an  
earnings warning from Gillette put the brakes on Monday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 26.08 at 9,981.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower as well. The Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 6.30 at 1,314.82, and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 6.34 at 2,553.72. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the blue-chip index rose 174.82 points to close at  
10,007.33, a new record that marked the Dow's second finish above 
10,000. The Nasdaq and S&AMP;P 500 indexes also set new records, 
sustained by a rally in Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette, which said first-quarter profits will probably not  
meet Wall Street analysts' expectations, fell 7 1/4 today to 50 1/2. The 
company's announcement sobered traders who had bid stocks higher 
Monday on expectations of strong first-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette's news also hurt other consumer products companies.  
Procter &AMP; Gamble, a component of the Dow, fell 1 9/16 to 99 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, IBM rose as the company unveiled a new version of its Web  
server, which allows companies to provide faster service on the 
Internet. IBM was up 1 5/8 at 185 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 233.4 million shares, 
slightly ahead of Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was off 0.96 at 613.67, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.20 at 718.04.

<HEADLINE> Toyota To Expand in N. America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ERLANGER, Ky. (AP) -- Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America  
Inc. will expand its northern Kentucky headquarters, company 
officials announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The $15.4 million project will add 80,000 square feet,  
increasing the facility's size to 258,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota already has expanded the facility once since locating in  
Erlanger in 1996. Last year, a laboratory for quality and 
production engineering activities opened at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion will increase the number of work stations and  
conference rooms, and provide space for a cafeteria. Workers who 
had been using a leased building nearby will be moved to the main 
facility after the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our two and a half years in operation here, we have  
continued to absorb administrative functions'' that were handled in 
japan and at other North American facilities, said Teruyuki 
Minoura, president and chief executive of TMMNA. ``As a result, our 
full-time employment at Erlanger will grow to 700 team members, and 
we have to expand existing work and meeting space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At present, 630 people are employed at the facility.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Mayor Arrested on Sex Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- A mayor known for his colorful persona  
and volunteer work was arrested Tuesday on sexual misconduct 
charges involving two young girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald ``Ajax'' Ackerman was charged with criminal sexual  
conduct and attempted criminal sexual conduct after the parents of 
both girls complained about him, Police Chief William Corbett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corbett would not elaborate on the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman, 42, was jailed pending an arraignment Wednesday.  
Corbett said Ackerman had not yet hired a lawyer who could comment. 
Ackerman and his wife have an unlisted phone number. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman is a former drug and alcohol addict who is known for  
his long beard, hair tied in a ponytail and two earrings in his 
left ear. 
</P>
<P>
	He goes by his nickname, after the warrior Ajax in a movie about  
street gangs, rides his Harley-Davidson and wears leather biker 
duds. 
</P>
<P>
	He has worked part-time as an aide at a mental health center,  
runs his own youth and adult center and volunteers at an HIV/AIDS 
clinic and a runaway shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the National Association of Social Workers named  
Ackerman the Michigan Public Citizen of the Year for his work in 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been mayor of Port Huron, a city of 37,000 people 50  
miles northeast of Detroit, since 1997.

<HEADLINE> Former SEC Lawyer Gets Jail Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A former lawyer with the Securities and Exchange  
Commission was sentenced today to a year in prison for bribing a 
broker to promote the stock of a company he represented. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert D. Schulman, 56, of New York City was sentenced by U.S.  
District Judge John F. Keenan in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Schulman was convicted July 30 of conspiracy to commit wire  
fraud and interstate commercial bribery for participating in a 
scheme to make secret payments to stock brokers to entice them to 
sell shares of Grayhound Electronics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	He formerly served as a staff lawyer in the Enforcement Division  
of the SEC's Northeast Regional Office from 1968 to 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Schulman was snared in an undercover FBI investigation in which  
agents posed as corrupt brokers willing to accept bribes to promote 
stocks to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Schulman told an FBI agent posing as a  
dishonest stockbroker that he was a lawyer for Grayhound 
Electronics and several of its European shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	He allegedly promised to make secret payments of Grayhound stock  
to the broker in exchange for the broker's agreement to sell more 
than a million shares of Grayhound to his customers so that the 
stock price would rise from 38 cents a share to $1 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	After the phony broker bought 50,000 shares of Grayhound  
supposedly on behalf of a customer, Schulman had 15,000 shares of 
Grayhound deposited into a secret brokerage account for the 
broker's benefit, prosecutors said.

<HEADLINE> 10 Commandments Case Is Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- A federal judge who has been overruled  
twice has again thrown out a lawsuit by an atheist who wants the 
Ten Commandments removed from a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Suhre sued over marble tablets displayed on a wall at  
the Haywood County courthouse four years ago, claiming they violate 
his constitutional right to freedom of religion. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Lacy Thornburg dismissed the lawsuit on  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Suhre's lawyer, George Daly, filed a notice of appeal Saturday  
and the case now goes back to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``We suspect they've been waiting for me to die,'' Suhre said  
Monday night. ``If I die before the court answers, there won't be a 
case any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suhre, 88, of Waynesville, contends the tablets helped sway a  
jury against him in 1991 during a minor legal dispute with a 
neighbor. Suhre refused to swear on a Bible, and believes jurors 
felt compelled by the display and their religious beliefs to oppose 
his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Thornburg said the Commandments represent the historical  
significance of ``the emergence of basic laws which remain to this 
day included in local, state and national codes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Only a narrow and shrewish interpretation of the display could  
lead one to conclude that it is an endorsement of Christian or 
Jewish faith,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thornburg dismissed the case twice before, both times before  
trial, and was overruled both times by higher courts. He then held 
a hearing on the issue before dismissing the case again. 
</P>
<P>
	A Ten Commandments display in a courtroom also has caused  
controversy in Alabama, where two years ago, then-Gov. Fob James 
has threatened to call out the National Guard to defend the 
display. That case was dismissed by the state Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Card Company Scores Big on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Stephen and Susan Polis Schutz were flower  
children in the Sixties. Now they deliver the passion of that era 
on artful greeting cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Their 23-year-old son Jared is a tightly wound computer  
entrepreneur. He's delivering his parents' messages too, but at the 
lightning speed of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The blend of the parents' creative juices and their son's  
business acumen has transformed the family's Blue Mountain Arts 
into one of the most popular Web sites. Millions of Internet users 
visit www.bluemountain.com to send free electronic messages for 
birthdays, anniversaries, all the major holidays and some 
little-known ones too. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Blue Mountain was ranked the 10th most visited Web  
site, surpassing Amazon.com and eBay, according to Media Matrix, a 
marketing research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't consider any of the other electronic greeting card  
companies to be competition,'' said Jared Schutz, who handles 
business development for both Blue Mountain operations. ``Our main 
competition is going to be the other top 10 sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site dominates the Internet greeting card business --  
even though Blue Mountain Arts holds less than 1 percent of the 
traditional greeting card business. 
</P>
<P>
	Its secret is a well-stocked supply of electronic cards, ranging  
from wriggling, singing animated animals to Shakespearean sonnets. 
It's ready for almost any occasion, even the Chinese Lantern 
Festival and Bastille Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day at Blue Mountain.com is like 10 years at Blue  
Mountain Arts,'' Mrs. Schutz said. ``It's more hectic now, probably 
the most hectic it's ever been because of the Web site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts believe the company gained an edge by launching the  
site in 1996 when most businesses were still figuring out how to 
take advantage of the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a completely remarkable phenomenon even for the Web,''  
said Drew Ianni, an online advertising analyst for Jupiter 
Communications. ``I would be hardpressed to think that any company 
could do what they have done starting out from scratch today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strength of the company comes from the Schutzes, who met in  
New Jersey while he was a graduate student in physics at Princeton 
and she was getting a bachelor's degree in English at Ryder 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	They protested the Vietnam War and rallied for farm laborers in  
California, driving an older car nicknamed Freedom that was 
decorated with psychedelic hearts and flowers. They married in 1969 
and relocated to Boulder, where Stephen Schutz worked at an 
atmospheric agency and his wife nurtured a writing career. 
</P>
<P>
	It was their desire to work together that prompted them to put  
one of her poems and his artwork on a silkscreen poster. They 
talked the manager of a bookstore into selling a dozen on 
consignment. 
</P>
<P>
	As other stores followed suit, the Schutzes created Blue  
Mountain Arts in their home, renting out the main floor, and living 
and working in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Schutz's poems are words of love, hope and encouragement  
inspired by her family. Her husband's artwork is mostly in pastel 
shades, with silhouettes of people, trees and plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought if we could sell our posters around the country,  
then we could travel, be together and have a great time,'' Mrs. 
Schutz said. ``We took all the money we had and put it on a down 
payment for a pickup truck and put a camper on it ... that's how we 
supported ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their three children were bundled along for the cross-country  
trips, sometimes sitting in baby carriages at their parents' side 
at trade shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The company gradually branched into books, stationery and other  
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Schutz got the idea for a Web site as a way to keep in  
touch with his son while he was getting a political science degree 
at Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Schutz has been the driving force behind trying to  
make it profitable. Since the cards are free, the publishing 
company has financed the site, a cost that has grown significantly 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a major business right now, but the money is going one  
way and it's out,'' Mrs. Schutz said. ``It has to become a 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her son has added subtle advertising that pops up only after a  
user sends a card. He also founded an online flower delivery 
service, Proflowers.com, which allows customers to order direct 
from the grower for delivery by Federal Express. He said the cost 
savings to consumers is about 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the family does not typically disclose sales figures,  
Jared Schutz estimated that Proflowers did $1 million in sales in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site's success also has boosted sales by 20 percent a  
year for the publishing company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the company has about 140 employees, including artists,  
designers and Web site specialists. Jared Schutz is looking to add 
businesses to the site, but the Schutzes firmly believe the cards 
should remain free. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mission is helping people around the world communicate  
their deepest feelings,'' Mrs. Schutz said. ``We're going to keep 
it free.''

<HEADLINE> Hardaway Scoring More in New Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Penny Hardaway resisted the temptation to tell everybody he was  
right all along. There was nothing wrong with his offensive game 
that a change in position wouldn't solve. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time All-Star, sensitive to criticism that he hasn't  
been scoring enough, offers the Orlando Magic's Eastern 
Conference-leading record as evidence he's been doing a lot of good 
things this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But with leading scorer Nick Anderson sidelined by a hamstring  
injury the past week, Hardaway was averaging 26 points per game -- 
10 above his season average -- going into Tuesday night's game 
against the Knicks in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason, he and coach Chuck Daly agreed, is that with  
Anderson out the team needs Hardaway to fill a role that he's 
probably been better suited for all along. 
</P>
<P>
	A point guard for most of his NBA career, Hardaway's scoring  
picks up dramatically when he's not expected to set up the offense 
and create opportunities for teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's played his best basketball since I've been here,'' Daly  
said after Hardaway keyed a late run Monday night that carried the 
Magic to a 106-99 victory over the Boston Celtics. ``He plays 
better off the ball. He's happier there, and that's what he wants 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Hardaway insists he doesn't have a problem playing the  
point, he wants people to understand that his statistics will 
suffer. If it's gaudy numbers they want, then give him the ball 
coming off screens and in other situations where he can get more 
open shots. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a role he was prepared to accept before injuries limited  
him to 19 games last season. He returned to point guard this year 
because of the re-emergence of Anderson, who's been the Magic's 
most consistent scorer since February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the point, I tried to put my ego to the side and go out  
there and get everybody involved and get a victory. But nobody sees 
it that way,'' Hardaway said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want me to go out and score 30, score 25, like they've  
seen me in the past. But I'm not the same, and we don't have the 
same team. We have more guys who can really score. If you get 
everybody involved, you win almost every game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway's primary responsibility on offense for three seasons  
was to get the ball to Shaquille O'Neal. When Shaq left for the Los 
Angeles Lakers in 1996, the Magic became more dependent on their 
playmaker's scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	But injuries have slowed the two-time all-NBA selection much of  
the past two seasons and, at times, he's seemed reluctant to assert 
himself on offense. Even his teammates would like to see Hardaway 
be more aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to understand this is an unselfish guy,'' said  
Darrell Armstrong, who has been starting as point guard with 
Anderson injured. ``When Shaq was here, he gave shots up. He didn't 
really care about posting up. All he cared about was winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just in his nature to be unselfish. When he doesn't  
score, he does a lot of things to help this team. He rebounds, he 
gets assists, plays defense. He does it all. It's not all about 
scoring. You can score a lot of points and play a bad game 
sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway couldn't have said it better himself.  
</P>
<P>
	So, what happens when Anderson returns? Does Hardaway make back  
to the point? Or how about Anderson moving to small forward? 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't speak for the coach,'' said Hardaway.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not our job,'' he said. ``It's the coaches job. And  
whatever he says, that's the way it's going to be.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Air Bags Do Well in Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Side air bags on Ford Motor Co.'s 1999 models  
greatly reduce the likelihood of serious head injury to the driver 
in crash tests, a safety research institute said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is financed by  
insurers, crashed two 1999 model Lincoln Town Cars by hurtling them 
sideways into an upright pole that smashed into the driver's side 
door. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first test, the car had no side air bag and the head  
injuries sustained by the dummy representing the driver were severe 
enough to cause death in an actual collision, institute president 
Brian O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second test, the side air bag cushioned the dummy's head  
from the force of the crash, making it ``survivable despite the 
(crash's) severity,'' O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Side air bags are standard equipment on the 1999 Lincoln  
Continental and Town Car. Ford has started offering them with head 
protection as options in front seats of some of its more popular 
and less expensive vehicles: 1999 Ford Explorer and Mercury 
Mountaineer sport utility vehicles, Ford Windstar minivans and the 
Jaguar XJ8 and X200. 
</P>
<P>
	Side air bags with head protection also are on BMWs, Saabs,  
Volvos and some Mercedes models. 
</P>
<P>
	Some automakers offer side air bags that protect the chest area  
rather than the head. Ford's side air bags are designed to do both, 
deploying from the side of the seat and inflating upward and 
forward, said Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers such as BMW and Volvo also are designing side air  
bags to try to prevent passengers from being ejected out a window 
during rollover crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the institute test, cars are crashed sideways at 18 mph into  
a vertical pole, pushing the pole well into the driver's side, past 
the steering wheel rim. 
</P>
<P>
	The test is comparable to one manufacturers can use to pass  
recent federal head protection requirements. The Transportation 
Department estimates that if all cars had side air bags with head 
protection, about 600 deaths could be prevented in crashes each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Slightly less than a third of all fatal motor vehicle crashes  
are side-impact crashes, and most of the deaths they cause involve 
head injuries, according to a government database of fatal 
accidents from 1993-1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute also said side air bags could help with the  
mismatch among vehicles when larger vehicles such as SUVs or 
pickups crash into the sides of cars. Studies show those accidents 
mostly kill the passengers in the smaller vehicles, the cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kinds of air bags are an important step forward in  
making cars crash compatible,'' O'Neill said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Reporter Reveals Chiquita Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A reporter facing sentencing next month for  
illegally obtaining voice mail from Chiquita has named a former 
attorney for the banana company as a confidential source for his 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Gallagher also testified Monday that attorneys for The  
Cincinnati Enquirer did not tell him that accessing Chiquita's 
voice mail might be illegal until after he had tapped the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was relayed to me that it might be illegal,'' Gallagher  
said. ``By then, I had accessed (the system) 15 to 20 times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher, 42, was the lead reporter for the Enquirer's series  
in May 1998 that questioned Chiquita's business practices in 
Central America. The newspaper later renounced the series, fired 
Gallagher, apologized to Chiquita Brands International on the front 
page and paid the Cincinnati-based company more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, Gallagher pleaded guilty to illegally intercepting  
communications and obtaining unauthorized access to Chiquita's 
computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	He never testified about how he obtained the voice mail  
messages, but agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. On Monday, he 
was called to testify by attorneys representing George Ventura, a 
Salt Lake City lawyer who formerly worked for Chiquita. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura goes on trial April 19 on charges that he helped steal  
the voice mail messages. Attorneys were in court to argue about 
evidence to be allowed in that trial, and whether charges of 
illegal interception of communication should be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning from Ventura's attorney Marc Mezibov,  
Gallagher said Ventura was one of about six people he promised 
confidentiality in return for their help on the Chiquita series. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher, 40, could be sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison, but his  
plea bargain notes that there is no mandatory prison term. His 
sentencing was delayed until May 13, after he testifies at 
Ventura's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Enquirer local news editor David Wells, who oversaw reporters'  
work on the Chiquita articles, said editors and lawyers acted 
quickly when Gallagher told them he had accessed the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as his editors knew about the access, he was told  
never to do it again,'' Wells said after the hearing.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Offer Privacy Tools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to jump-start a promising new privacy  
technology, Microsoft and a prominent Internet group will offer a 
free digital tool kit that one day will allow consumers to restrict 
what personal information Web sites collect about them. 
</P>
<P>
	These new tools, to be announced today, initially will help  
Internet companies write electronic privacy promises that can 
automatically be evaluated by a Web browser or other software using 
a nascent technology called the platform for privacy preferences, 
or P3P. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers today must manually find a company's privacy statement  
online, if one exists, and read through legalese to determine what 
information a Web site might be harvesting, such as their name, 
e-mail address or even favorite authors or clothing sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the new technology, a customer's Internet browser could  
electronically interpret a company's promises, issuing a warning 
only if it can't find a statement or if the Web site wants more 
information than a consumer is willing to disclose. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite support from the world's largest software company,  
hurdles remain and widespread adoption is months, if not years, 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology is mired in a patent dispute and also almost  
certainly will require tens of millions of people on the Internet 
to install new browser software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's new tools, for example, are based partly on a  
relatively new computer code called extensible markup language, or 
XML, that even the most current versions of some browsers don't yet 
fully support. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft and the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier  
Foundation planned to make their announcement today at the opening 
of an important privacy conference in Washington. They will propose 
changes in a key specification controlled by the World Wide Web 
Consortium, an Internet standards group, which would allow online 
merchants to use their new digital tools. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technology they're announcing probably isn't the final  
answer, but it's a real positive step,'' said Rick White, former 
co-chairman of the Congressional Internet Caucus who now practices 
technology law in Washington state. ``I'm not certain that 
technology will solve all the problems -- there are some gaps you 
might have to fix in a legislative way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Congress and the Clinton administration have threatened the  
industry with tough new privacy laws unless companies adequately 
regulate themselves over ways they collect customer information 
across the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union already has passed laws that prohibit the  
transfer of personal information about its citizens without their 
consent to any outside country. The White House is negotiating to 
see how those laws might affect U.S. businesses on the Internet, 
where international borders are blurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to get a lot of the system up to speed  
quickly,'' predicted Tara Lemmey, executive director of the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement is the industry's answer to what it describes  
as a frustrating chicken-and-egg problem -- how to encourage 
Internet consumers to use the new privacy technology until Web 
sites begin to offer electronic promises that can be understood by 
the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do here is build a foundation,'' said  
Saul Klein, a group program manager at Microsoft. ``We're not 
saying that we think this is the answer to self-regulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One serious problem for the technology is a legal battle with  
Seattle-based Intermind Corp., which earlier this year won a patent 
important to P3P. The company has said it is willing to license the 
technology for a reasonable price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good software patents are expensive, and we were way ahead of  
the curve,'' said Drummond Reed, the company's chief technology 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web consortium said the group is ``looking seriously ... at  
the validity and applicability of this patent.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Suspends Computer Use at Labs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Security concerns and fear of espionage  
have forced the Energy Department to suspend use of classified 
computers at three of the nation's top research labs. 
</P>
<P>
	The shutdown affects the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia  
National Laboratories in Albuquerque and the Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory in California, DOE spokesman Chris Kielich said 
in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson ordered the shutdown as part of  
``an overall initiative to improve cybersecurity,'' Kielich said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Security checks have escalated at Los Alamos since reports  
surfaced last year that a lab employee might have committed 
espionage in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Wen Ho Lee, who was fired from the lab March 8, became the  
target of an FBI investigation in 1996. Lee, a Tawainese-born 
American citizen, has not been charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	He reportedly was put in charge of updating computer software  
for nuclear weapons in the spring of 1997, less than a year after 
the FBI began investigating whether China obtained U.S. secrets 
during the 1980s that gave it the technology to create miniaturized 
warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	China has denied that it engaged in nuclear espionage.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Energy Department said that three of the  
government's 12 nuclear weapons facilities, including the weapons 
lab at Los Alamos, received a less than satisfactory security 
rating for last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Alamos lab spokesman Jim Danneskiold said the security  
shutdown could affect 2,000 employees. Lab director John Browne 
said he will review worker ``self-assessments'' and decide if the 
computers can come back on.

	Heavy snow fell in parts of the West today, while rain and  
thunderstorms stretched from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The heaviest snowfall came in California's Sierra Nevada, with  
up to 2 feet of snow fell overnight at higher elevations around 
Lake Tahoe on the California-Nevada state line. 
</P>
<P>
	That snow fell on top of nearly 2 feet that accumulated in the  
mountains during the Easter weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have any pull, will you tell it to stop?'' said Judy  
Miller, a service manager at the Donner Park Unocal on Interstate 
80 in Truckee, Calif. ``It's too late in the season to be getting 
so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At lower elevations, 3 to 4 inches of snow fell overnight in  
Nevada's Reno and Carson City area. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 8 inches of snow was forecast elsewhere in the mountains  
of Northern California and lesser amounts in Montana and Idaho. 
Wind gusting to 50 mph was possible in the Southwest, where 19 
inches of snow fell at higher elevations of northern Arizona on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the East, rain and thunderstorms stretched from Wisconsin and

<HEADLINE> Rain Makes Rocket's Debut a Washout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Roger Clemens kicked the mound in disgust  
with his right foot. Tony Phillips' homer had just destroyed his 
aura of invincibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Two innings later, Clemens headed to the dugout to watch his new  
team lose a soggy season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens was nearly unhittable for the first 4 2-3 innings of his  
debut with the New York Yankees on Monday night against the Oakland 
Athletics, despite a 47-minute rain delay between the second and 
third innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to extend the 15-game winning streak with which he closed  
last season for the Toronto Blue Jays, Clemens had allowed only a 
drag bunt single by Jason McDonald in the third inning and had 
struck out seven of the 17 batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
	But, after walking Miguel Tejada on a full count with two outs  
in the fifth, Clemens gave up Phillips' game-tying shot to right 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little quick on my slide step,'' Clemens said. ``He's  
got that zone down where he's very dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Jeter's 410-foot homer to center field in the top of the  
seventh put the Yankees ahead 3-2 and gave Clemens another chance 
for the win, but again the five-time Cy Young Award winner could 
not hold the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	With one out in the bottom of the seventh, Clemens walked  
Phillips and was taken out of the game after throwing 107 pitches. 
The bullpen then blew Clemens' chance for a win, as well as the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Giambi's run-scoring groundout off Mike Stanton tied the  
game 3-3 and Matt Stairs followed with an RBI single off loser 
Stanton. John Jaha then doubled off Jeff Nelson to drive in 
Oakland's fifth run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony got us going,'' Giambi said. ``(Clemens) was dealing and  
it was tough, but Tony kind of broke the string. That kind of put a 
light at the end of the tunnel for us when it was kind of getting 
dim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game finally ended at 12:27 a.m. PDT after a second rain  
delay of 1 hour, 21 minutes that prevented the Yankees from batting 
in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, traded to the Yankees in February by the Blue Jays,  
struck out eight and walked five while allowing four hits in his 
debut for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very excited to take the mound,'' he said. ``I'm pretty  
jacked up for every start. But taking the field with these guys is 
very special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens remained two short of the AL record of 17 consecutive  
wins shared by Dave McNally of the Baltimore Orioles in 1968-69 and 
Johnny Allen of the Cleveland Indians in 1936-37. The major league 
record is 24 by Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants in 1936-37. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen anybody so high to win a ball game as Clemens  
was in the dugout for the first inning,'' said Yankees interim 
manager Don Zimmer, a Red Sox coach during part of Clemens' 13-year 
tenure in Boston. ``He was like a wild lion. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the game started, he looked like he was pitching for a  
World Series win. He's some competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees left the bases loaded in the first two innings  
against Oakland starter Gil Heredia, a late opening day replacement 
for injured Kenny Rogers, scoring just one run. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get a base hit in the first or second inning with the  
bases loaded, I think that's enough for Clemens,'' Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clemens started 5-6 with a 3.50 ERA, but did not lose  
again after May 29. He went 15-0 with a 2.29 ERA the rest of the 
season, winning his second straight Cy Young Award while leading 
the AL in wins, ERA and strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he was disappointed about walking five batters, Clemens  
said he was relatively satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering the conditions out there, I felt good,'' he said.  
``I felt strong. I felt I was able to channel my emotions. I was 
happy with that.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chiquita Lawyer on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Lawyers defending a former Chiquita banana  
company attorney accused of stealing voice mail for a newspaper 
investigation argued Tuesday that a reporter's promise of anonymity 
to a source is a legally enforceable commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for George G. Ventura made the argument to try to  
prevent two former reporters for The Cincinnati Enquirer from 
linking Ventura to the illegal intrusion into Chiquita's internal 
voice-mail system. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense is trying to persuade a judge to throw out all 10  
felony charges against Ventura, a former lawyer for Chiquita Brands 
International Inc. who is now in private practice in Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Ann Marie Tracey didn't say when she will decide.  
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has pleaded innocent to unlawful interception of  
communications and unauthorized access to computer systems. He 
could get 12 1/2 years in prison if convicted. His was postponed 
Tuesday to July 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's lawyers argued that a reporter who promises anonymity  
to a source has effectively entered into a legally binding contract 
that protects the source against being exposed later by the 
reporter, even under pressure of prosecution. They said Ohio's 
shield law, which allows reporters to protect the identities of 
confidential sources, also protects the sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one (reporter) decides he is going to become an arm of the  
prosecutor and divulge the identity of a confidential source, then 
he has done journalism a tremendous disservice, because then no 
confidential source is ever going to cooperate with a reporter 
again,'' said Marc Mezibov, a lawyer for Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Breyer, the prosecutor, said he saw no reason to legally  
protect the identity of confidential sources. He said that could 
have the effect of releasing such sources from any accountability 
for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters Michael Gallagher and Cameron McWhirter relied on the  
voice mail messages in an Enquirer package of stories last May 
accusing Cincinnati-based Chiquita of improper dealings in Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the Enquirer fired Gallagher, apologized on its front  
page to Chiquita and said it was paying Chiquita more than $10 
million to settle any claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher pleaded guilty in September to felony charges and is  
awaiting sentencing that could range from 2 1/2 years in prison to 
probation. The prosecutor said Tuesday he will ask to have 
Gallagher's sentencing delayed until after Ventura's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	McWhirter has not been charged and now works for The Detroit  
News, also owned by Gannett Co. Inc. McWhirter has said he did not 
access Chiquita's system but got codes from a source and gave them 
to Gallagher.

<HEADLINE> Judge Awards $26.5 Mil. to Smoker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jurors were right to blame Philip Morris  
for concealing tobacco's dangers, marketing cigarettes to minors 
and ruining the health of a three-pack-a-day smoker who now has 
lung cancer, a judge says. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he cut her $51.5 million damage award nearly in half.  
</P>
<P>
	The new award -- $26.5 million -- is still enough to cause  
``substantial discomfort'' even to a company the size of Philip 
Morris, Judge John Munter ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The original verdict won by Patricia Henley in February was then  
the largest ever in a tobacco liability lawsuit filed by an 
individual smoker. The jury awarded $1.5 million in compensatory 
damages to cover medical expenses and $50 million in punitive 
damages to punish the cigarette maker, which has a net worth of 
$3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Awards in three similar cases have been overturned on appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Although Munter said the $50 million punitive award was  
excessive, the reduced amount is still more than the $15 million 
Ms. Henley sought at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also denied the company's request for a new trial,  
saying the evidence showed Philip Morris ``failed to disclose 
information known to it concerning the addictive and harmful 
properties of its product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company also ``misled the American public'' by claiming a  
continuing scientific controversy on the effects of smoking, and 
``willfully and consciously marketed its cigarettes to 
teen-agers,'' Munter wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Wartnick, a lawyer for Ms. Henley, noted that she has the  
option of rejecting the reduced award and retrying the case. But he 
said $26.5 million should be enough to ``get a message across to 
Philip Morris and to any other company that looks to market 
products that kill human beings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris attorney Michael York said the company planned to  
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of very significant and complicated legal  
issues that need to be resolved by an appellate court,'' York said. 
He declined to specify the issues or comment on the judge's 
criticism of Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	William Ohlemeyer, another lawyer for the company, had argued  
that Philip Morris wasn't responsible for Ms. Henley's decision to 
smoke and never claimed cigarettes were safe. He said there was no 
evidence she started smoking or continued to smoke because of 
Philip Morris ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henley, 52, of Los Angeles, said she became hooked on  
Marlboros at age 15 and smoked three packs a day until 1997, after 
she started suffering coughing fits and other health problems. She 
was diagnosed last year with inoperable lung cancer, which she says 
is now in remission after chemotherapy and radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Her suit was the first tried in California since the repeal of a  
1987 law that protected tobacco companies against suits by 
individual smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, an Oregon jury awarded $80.3 million to the family of  
a Portland man who died of lung cancer after smoking three packs of 
Marlboros a day for 42 years.

<HEADLINE> Division Over Internet Learning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hundreds of universities are launching courses  
or degree programs online, but a pair of reports being released 
Wednesday question whether a seat in front of a computer is as good 
as a seat in a college classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports' complaints range from whether the programs'  
effectiveness is evaluated properly and whether they cost too much 
to whether they are unfair to certain students. 
</P>
<P>
	The College Board, in its report, warns that Internet courses  
could hinder the progress of poor and minority students who arrive 
at college with less exposure to computers than white or 
more-affluent students. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's this rush to get online and go virtual. ...Colleges,  
policy-makers and (Internet) providers who are driving this market 
need to think about broad access,'' Larry F. Gladieux, a senior 
researcher at the board, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A second report, by the Institute for Higher Education Policy,  
says colleges still lack enough knowledge about Internet learning 
to justify its rapid growth. For example, studies haven't explained 
a higher dropout rate for Internet-based learners -- 32 percent 
compared to 4 percent in one study -- or looked at whether students 
do better from Internet instruction alone or from a mix of Internet 
and classroom learning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the studies suggest the grades of distance learners  
are higher or comparable,'' said Jamie Merisotis, president of the 
institute, which did the study for two teachers' unions. ``We don't 
know whether the poorer performers are dropping out at a higher 
rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet classes are a growing option for students who find  
on-campus meetings inconvenient because of distance, work schedules 
or family duties. There are 26,000 courses online, and roughly 
750,000 students take them. They include and courses at Stanford, 
the University of California, Los Angeles and Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	The most visible advance, supporters say, is the first-time  
accreditation of an online school: Students at Jones International 
University, operated out of Denver, now have such privileges as 
transferring credits and earning employer tuition reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wondered if I was going to get a quality education,'' said  
Joan Crittenden, a Navy safety official who received her master's 
degree in business communications from Jones in December. ``I 
actually think I did get a better education. More of the resources 
were at my fingertips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Distance learning started with classes taken by mail or by  
watching teachers' lectures on videos or cable television. The 
Internet's profit potential is driving the renaissance of an 
educational outlet designed to serve older, nontraditional 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike correspondence school or video-lecture predecessors,  
Internet-based distance learning has a place on campus, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Everhart, a medieval studies professor at Georgetown  
University, holds classes off- and online. She says professors who 
have mastered e-mail now use Web pages to post course readings, 
homework and bulletin boards where students can discuss lessons by 
leaving messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are students I might not ordinarily hear from in  
class,'' Everhart said. ``But in a chat room, they feel freer to 
state their opinions and ask their questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Pittinsky is a co-founder of Blackboard Inc., which  
creates and maintains Internet sites for college courses. ``There's 
no question, there is a market,'' Pittinsky said. ``Professors all 
over the country talk about the educational value of offering their 
students courses on the Web.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reliance on technology marketed by Blackboard, Real Education of  
Denver and Convene in San Francisco has led to criticism that the 
ventures are more about higher profits than higher learning. 
</P>
<P>
	College officials could be easily seduced by pitches that  
virtual learning cuts the costs of ``bricks and mortar'' learning, 
said the College Board's Gladieux. 
</P>
<P>
	And a technological divide still exists, Gladieux said, raising  
questions about equal access. For example, computers are in 75 
percent of households with incomes over $75,000, but just 20 
percent of households making less than $15,000 have computers or 
daily access. White families are twice as likely to have computers 
at home as black or Hispanic families. 
</P>
<P>
	And freshmen at private or public historically black colleges  
are only half as likely to have campus e-mail than freshmen at 
other private or public universities. 
</P>
<P>
	But Andrew Rosen of Kaplan said online courses can help students  
with less money. A law degree from Kaplan's Concord Law School 
costs up to $21,000, including the cost of a computer, rather than 
$80,000 for a more traditional law school, Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Online education has the potential to close a lot of the gaps  
that exist right now,'' Rosen said.

<P>
	MINSK, Belarus (AP) -- Gennady Karpenko, a Prominent Belarusian  
opposition leader, died Tuesday of a stroke. He was 49. 
</P>
<P>
	Karpenko, was vice speaker of Belarus' popularly elected  
parliament before President Alexander Lukashenko disbanded it in 
1996 and replaced it with a body of his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The disbanded parliament is still recognized as legitimate by  
many Western democracies, the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	After parliament was dissolved, Karpenko worked as one of the  
leaders of the opposition United Civic Party. A physicist by 
training, he was a member of the Belarusian Academy of Sciences.

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- George D. Lockhart, a founder of the  
Pittsburgh law firm Kirkpatrick &AMP; Lockhart LLP, died Monday of 
congestive heart failure. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart, known for his humility and sense of humor, began his  
law practice at the Pittsburgh firm of Reed Smith Shaw &AMP; McClay. In 
1946, after completing his military service during World War II, he 
and six other lawyers formed their own firm.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucille Lortel, who earned the title ``Queen of  
off-Broadway'' for bringing innovative new actors, playwrights and 
productions to the American stage, died Sunday. She was 98. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lortel, whose career in theater spanned more than 70 years,  
produced or co-produced about 500 plays, five of which were 
nominated for Tony Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Louise Wadler, Lortel began her own acting career in the  
1920s and made her Broadway debut in 1925 with a small role in 
George Bernard Shaw's ``Caesar and Cleopatra.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She quit performing in 1939 to please her husband, Louis  
Schweitzer, a chemical engineer who made a fortune manufacturing 
cigarette papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of boredom, she began staging readings in a barn at their  
estate in Westport, Conn. In 1947, she was asked by the actor 
Canada Lee and playwright Philip Huston to help find a place and 
audience for a staged reading of a new play, ``The Painted Wagon,'' 
and the still-thriving White Barn Theater was born. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, her husband gave her the Theatre de Lys -- now called  
the Lucille Lortel Theater -- in Greenwich Village as a 24th 
anniversary gift. Its first production was a hugely popular 
adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's and Kurt Weill's ``Threepenny 
Opera'' that made off-Broadway famous. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lortel's eye for and confidence in young talent boosted the  
careers of countless actors, composers, designers, directors and 
playwrights in international theater. She established numerous 
funds and fellowships to further the arts. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Lou Milliner    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Lou Milliner, retired New Orleans newsman for  
The Associated Press whose career spanned from Morse code to the 
computer, died Sunday at age 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Milliner started his career in Little Rock, Ark., in 1935 for  
United Press, before the organization became UPI, and copy was 
transmitted in Morse. As technology progressed, he shifted to 
teletype and finally the computer. 
</P>
<P>
	After World War II, he joined the AP in New York, but  
transferred back to New Orleans in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	As night editor, he handled copy on Earl Long, the Kefauver  
hearings, James Meredith and integration, hurricanes and a steady 
flow of daily news. Among his bylined assignments was a trip to 
interview Somoza, the strongman president of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	Milliner was famous for circling errors -- ordinary ones in black  
or blue, the most egregious in red -- and posting them on the office 
bulletin board to expose the guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	He was equally well known for his passion for photography and  
scrapbooks. For 28 of his 30 years with the AP, he took pictures of 
every person he ever worked with and had 400 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired in 1977.  
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Gladys Welch Milliner; two sons, a  
daughter and seven grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online Inc. has acquired When Inc.,  
which provides a Web-based calendar service that allows users to 
keep track of their schedules from any computer connected to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online said in a statement Monday that it had completed  
the acquisition of When, based in Redwood City, Calif., for an 
undisclosed amount of its stock. The Wall Street Journal today

$150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL said it would begin a new version of the When.com service  
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The calendar service allows users to keep track of appointments,  
birthdays and upcoming activities. Subscribers can also select 
events that interest them, such as the release of certain CDs or 
books, and receive reminders when they are available. 
</P>
<P>
	The information entered in the personal calendar remains  
private, but the subscriber has the option of volunteering certain 
dates, like birthdays or anniversaries, in exchange for receiving 
selective offers from AOL advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	When.com's group calendar features allow members of an  
organization or a community to share calendar information. 
</P>
<P>
	``When.com's calendar is the perfect personalization tool to  
help build community and to connect shopping opportunities with a 
person's individual interests and community events,'' America 
Online's president, Robert W. Pittman, said in the statement.

<HEADLINE> Duval Is Presence on, Off Course  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Three months of stardom has given David  
Duval a chance to change public perception of the man behind those 
wraparound shades. 
</P>
<P>
	He is not, as someone implied today, a ``dullard.''  
</P>
<P>
	``You haven't clarified whether you're talking about my  
personality or my golf game,'' Duval said with slight agitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor is he Michael Jordan, a suggestion that made him squirm in  
his seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please,'' he said. ``I think that's entirely inappropriate.''  
</P>
<P>
	Somewhere in between is a player willing to embrace fame without  
believing he deserves it, someone who regards all this attention as 
a responsibility rather than a right. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't bother me, no,'' Duval said. ``I embrace it. There  
again, I believe it's my responsibility now. It's part of playing 
tournament golf. I think everybody knows I wouldn't seek attention. 
But I firmly believe it's my duty to be here and do the best I 
can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is not Tiger Woods, who became one of golf's biggest (and  
richest) stars before he could legally drink and handled the media 
blitz as if he had spent a lifetime preparing. 
</P>
<P>
	He is not Fred Couples, who became America's most popular player  
after winning the Masters in 1992 and couldn't flee the publicity 
fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might be in the process of becoming a golf star or whatever  
you want to call it,'' Duval said. ``But I'm not like Tiger in the 
sense that Tiger's a star. He is outside the game. I don't think 
because I've surpassed him at No. 1 that I've been given more 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The responsibility is even greater this week in the Masters, and  
for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval has drawn comparisons to Nick Price for winning at least  
four tournaments in consecutive years, to Tom Watson for winning 11 
times in his last 34 tournaments, and to Johnny Miller for winning 
four times before making the drive down Magnolia Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	He stopped by Augusta National for about two hours on Monday to  
register and have lunch. When the clam chowder arrived, there was a 
fly in his soup. 
</P>
<P>
	This became big news.  
</P>
<P>
	``Does everybody know about that?'' Duval said, hand over his  
eyes. ``I'm going to get in big trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mostly, what everyone wants to know is how he can keep so calm  
on the course, whether he's closing in on the first Sunday 59 in 
tour history or surviving U.S. Open-like conditions before a 
hometown gallery in The Players Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	And how he remains so steady in the face of stardom.  
</P>
<P>
	``His golf game is incredible,'' Couples said. ``He's winning,  
and it looks very easy. And people just don't know enough about him 
yet. He's very quiet. You can't get anything out of him, which is 
kind of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of Duval's commercial publicity is in the golf  
magazines when Titleist takes out a full page advertisement to tout 
another one of his victories. 
</P>
<P>
	He makes brief appearances on two commercials now. On a FootJoy  
spot, he gives a quizzical look to ``Sign Boy'' and doesn't say a 
word. On a PGA Tour ad, his drive knocks over the tractor picking 
up balls on the range. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not again,'' Duval says.  
</P>
<P>
	Two commercials, two words. Not enough to give any measurable  
insight to a player who inside the ropes is drawing more attention 
than Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval shed some insight on his personality and his game when  
asked about being a ``dullard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's a perception, that's fine,'' he said. ``That's how I  
try to play. I try not to make mistakes. I try to make it a very 
stress-free round every time I tee it up. I try to keep the stress 
level as minimal as I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That goes for his life, too.  
</P>
<P>
	He spent Monday in deck shoes, and as overcast skies began to  
dim on Tuesday, he still had not played a hole at Augusta National 
this week. Duval played 36 holes last month, a 5-under 67 one day 
and 5-over through five holes the next day before he quit keeping 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was enough for him to know the course. More  
importantly, he knows his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please don't get me wrong,'' he said. ``I'm not comparing  
myself to Nicklaus or Watson or Hogan. But all those players in the 
past believed that the way they were playing was the way to play. 
And I believe that I play that the way I play is the way to play. 
That's not so much saying everyone else is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just believing in what you do yourself,'' he said, ``and  
doing it.''

<HEADLINE> Road Cyclist Now King of Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Alison Dunlap would love to be a biology professor. If only  
bicycles didn't keep getting in her way. 
</P>
<P>
	At the relatively ancient age of 30, Dunlap is on her second  
life as a bike racer. A member of the U.S. Olympic road-race team 
at the 1996 Games and a bronze medalist at the 1994 world 
championships, she now is at the top of the World Cup mountain bike 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	After two victories and a runner-up finish in March, Dunlap  
heads Down Under this week for races on the hills outside Sydney 
where the 2000 Olympic mountain bike medals will be decided. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she would like to race both on and off the road at next  
year's Summer Games, Dunlap is focused on the sturdy bikes with the 
fat knobby tires that splash through mud and zoom between rocks and 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love mountain biking,'' she said. ``There's no cheating and  
no hiding, like there can be with road racing. We're all out on our 
own. The strongest rider almost always wins the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Dunlap has been by far the strongest rider.  
</P>
<P>
	She won a mountain bike stage race in Monterey, Calif., then  
took the first World Cup race of the season in Napa, Calif., 
winning by 20 seconds over Gunn Rita Dahle of Norway. Dunlap and 
Dahle are 1-2 in the women's standings going into the Sydney races 
Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunlap also has kept pace on the roads, winning one stage and  
finishing second overall in the Redlands Bicycle Classic last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	All this came about because Dunlap wasn't good enough to play  
college soccer. The last player cut from the Colorado College team 
as a freshman, Dunlap stopped by a campus cycling club meeting and 
was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time she graduated in 1991 with a degree in biology,  
Dunlap had won two national college road championships. She joined 
the national team program, won a World Cup race in Okinawa, Japan, 
in 1995 and finished in the middle of the 58-rider pack in the '96 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking for a change but not ready to retire from racing, she  
switched to mountain bikes and won a World Cup title in Budapest, 
Hungary, in April 1997 in only her fourth race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The switch (to mountain biking) wasn't hard, but it was kind  
of scary,'' Dunlap said. ``All of a sudden there were new sponsors 
and people on the team. I didn't know what to expect. But I told 
myself, `If I can do road racing, I can do this.' It has worked out 
very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trip to Sydney will help Dunlap's preparations for the  
Olympics, letting her experience the bumps and hollows of the 
Olympic course and giving her confidence once she switches her 
focus to the games next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, it might be retirement and that long-held goal of a  
biology professorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the 2001 world championships are in Vail (Colo.),'' she  
said. ``It would be awfully hard to pass that up.''

<HEADLINE> News Corp. Expands Cable Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Adding to a burgeoning U.S. media empire, Rupert  
Murdoch's News Corp. is paying $1.4 billion to take full control of 
two cable television channels, Fox Sports Net and the entertainment 
channel FX. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian magnate's deal with Liberty Media Group, a  
company controlled by AT&AMP;T Corp. and headed by cable magnate John 
Malone, will also increase News Corp.'s indirect ownership of two 
New York sports teams, basketball's Knicks and hockey's Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the accord announced late Monday, News Corp.  
will pay $1.4 billion in stock to buy out nearly all of Liberty's 
50 percent interest in Fox/Liberty Networks, a joint venture the 
two companies formed three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would give Liberty an 8 percent stake in News Corp.,  
making it the company's second-largest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fox Sports Net was created as a challenger to Walt Disney  
Co.'s ESPN channel and reaches more than 62 million households 
across the United States. FX is seen in 39 million U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This deal will enable us to leverage more fully the Fox brand  
across our cable and broadcast properties while giving us added 
flexibility over our sports and entertainment channels,'' Murdoch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp. will also take over the joint venture's 40 percent  
interest in Rainbow Programming, a unit of Cablevision that 
controls the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers and part of the 
Madison Square Garden arena where they play. News Corp. is also the 
owner of baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Media, based in Englewood, Colo., will retain its 50  
percent interest in International Sports Programming Partners, the 
international sports programming venture it formed with Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street saw the deal, which had been rumored for several  
days, as positive for both companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``They couldn't grow it under a two-headed ownership,'' said  
David Goldsmith, an analyst at Buckingham Research Group. ``News 
Corp. wants the programming to grow, sometimes at the expense of 
earnings, while Liberty wants the value of the assets to grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen said it was an added  
plus for News Corp. to bring in John Malone as an investor.

<HEADLINE> Young Face Greater Smoking Perils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Permanent genetic changes that forever  
increase the risk of lung cancer occurs in teen-agers who smoke, 
even if they quit later in life. And the younger the smoking 
starts, the more damage is done. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the conclusion of a study published today in the Journal  
of the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, coming at a time when more than a third of teens  
are taking up the smoking habit, shows ``there is something 
uniquely bad about starting young,'' said John K. Wiencke, a 
genetics expert at the University of California, San Francisco, 
School of Medicine, and first author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the research gives powerful laboratory evidence of why  
starting smoking before the age of 18 can be particularly harmful 
to long-term health. Wiencke said such youthful smoking on a daily 
basis causes lung damage that the body cannot repair. He said the 
damage is less likely among smokers who start in their 20s or 
later, although smoking at any age is unhealthful. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like it is the age when smoking starts that is  
important,'' Wiencke said. ``It didn't matter if they were heavy or 
light smokers -- what mattered is that they started young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies have indicated that young smoking stunts the  
lungs' full development and increases the risk of breathing 
problems later in life. Studies have also shown that smoking in the 
teen years is more addictive and that smokers who begin young are 
less likely to break the habit. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wiencke's study for the first time shows dramatic and  
enduring DNA damage caused by youthful smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``This reinforces the idea that we need to stop young people  
from smoking, not only from the addiction standpoint, but also from 
the cancer risk standpoint,'' Wiencke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveys by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  
indicate that 34.8 percent of high school students were regular 
smokers in 1995. That number rose to 36.4 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A CDC survey of smokers aged 30 to 39 showed that 62 percent had  
tried smoking by the age of 16, and 24.9 percent had taken up the 
habit permanently by that age. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3 million teen-agers now smoke, the government estimates.  
And about a third of all smokers will die of smoking-related 
illnesses, including lung and other types of cancers, heart 
disease, stroke, emphysema and chronic pulmonary obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	In their study, Wiencke and his colleagues tested for DNA  
alterations in the nontumor lung tissue of patients being treated 
for lung cancer. The group included 57 people who were current 
smokers, 79 who were former smokers and seven who had never smoked. 
</P>
<P>
	The healthy lung tissue was tested for the number of DNA  
alterations per 10 billion cells. Some alterations occur with age, 
but the number of gene changes was much higher among smokers -- and 
highest of all among those who started smoking at a young age, 
Wiencke said. 
</P>
<P>
	For nonsmokers, there were 32 DNA alterations per 10 billion  
cells. For current smokers, the alterations were about eight times 
higher. The findings were adjusted statistically for the number of 
years smoked and for the amount smoked. 
</P>
<P>
	The startling discovery was that for former smokers, the most  
important factor affecting DNA damage was when they started 
smoking, not how long or how much, Wiencke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former smokers who started at before their 15th birthdays had an  
average of 164 genetic alterations. Ex-smokers who started between 
age 15 and 17 had an average of 115 alterations. 
</P>
<P>
	Among ex-smokers who didn't start smoking until after they were  
20, however, the DNA alternations averaged 81, fewer than half that 
of people who started smoking earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Such alterations occur when chemicals in tobacco smoke fuse with  
genes in the DNA of lung cells. These chemical complexes, called 
adducts, cause mutations and significantly increase cancer risk, 
Wiencke said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study shows that ``genetic alterations from tobacco  
carcinogen exposure may persist in former smokers,'' said an 
editorial in the journal by three cancer researchers at the 
University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. The 
editorial said the finding ``fits one more piece into the lung 
cancer risk assessment puzzle.''

<HEADLINE> Nicklaus Can't Resist Just One Shot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Jack Nicklaus couldn't resist taking just  
one swing at Augusta National on Tuesday although he can't play 
because of hip surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, who will miss his first Masters in 40 years because of  
his January operation, was being shown changes to the course by 
chairman Hootie Johnson when they came to the famous 12th hole, a 
diabolical 155-yard par-3 over Rae's Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a nice reception,'' Nicklaus said. ``I saw Carlos Franco  
on the tee and asked him if I could borrow a club and a ball. I 
asked for a 6-iron but after thinking it over I decided to use a 
5-iron. The ball hit at the top of the bank and popped up on the 
green.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd roared like it always has for the six-times Masters  
winner on Amen Corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus reiterated he will be long gone when the tournament  
starts on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He had plans to attend the traditional champions dinner on  
Tuesday night then take a plane for the Bahamas to fish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really have no interest in watching a tournament,'' he said.  
``If (son) Gary was playing in it I would. I've always been a 
spectator for my kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Would he watch on television?  
</P>
<P>
	``I might watch on TV some but if the tournament is played  
during the daytime I'll be fishing,'' Nicklaus joked. ``I wish I 
could play but I can't. I could have probably played in the par-3 
tournament. I would like to win then have a chance to break the 
jinx.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No player has won the annual par-3 tournament on Wednesday and  
then won the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, 59, still has a target date of playing again in June  
in his Memorial Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be playing golf in two or three weeks ,'' Nicklaus  
said. ``I might even play the week before Memorial. We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 40 times Nicklaus entered the Masters, he finished in the  
top 10 an incredible 22 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Nicklaus became the oldest player to finish in the top  
10 in the Masters, recording a final-round, 4-under-par 68 to tie 
for sixth.

<HEADLINE> Poet Laureate Pinsky Gets 3rd Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's ninth poet laureate is getting a  
third, unprecedented year on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Pinsky, who teaches creative writing at Boston  
University, doesn't have the official wine allowance that Britain's 
poet laureate has been entitled to ever since Shakespeare's 
drinking friend, Ben Jonson, took the job in 1616. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard that they're going to abolish all that medieval  
nonsense, give him a one-year term like we have and put him on a 
salary,'' Pinsky said Monday about the British poet laureate, who 
serves for life. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Hughes, Britain's last poet laureate, died last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Pinsky, 58, is the ninth American laureate since Congress  
created the title in 1985. He was reappointed to a third year 
Monday by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinsky has been especially active, appearing in public and on  
TV, emphasizing poetry as part of life -- even poems composed with 
words on refrigerator magnets. 
</P>
<P>
	He will preside Wednesday at two readings at the library, one  
for youngsters of school age and one for prominent Washingtonians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping to have Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district's  
representative in Congress and William S. Cohen, the defense 
secretary, to read their favorites,'' Pinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen is a novelist, but Pinsky said he didn't know if the  
defense secretary had written any poetry. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinsky has been pushing a project in which President Clinton,  
other prominent people and ordinary Americans are asked to read 
their favorite poems aloud. About 1,000 audio and 200 video 
recordings will be made. They will be deposited in the Library of 
Congress as a record of how Americans felt about poetry at the turn 
of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Next April, Pinsky will take a major part in a conference on  
``Poetry and the American People,'' celebrating the library's 200th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinsky gets an assistant, an office at the library and $35,000 a  
year. His allowance comes from privately collected money, as does 
$20,000 each for three special consultants he will have for the 
first time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The consultants will be Rita Dove, a former poet laureate, and  
Louise Gluck and W.S. Merwin, both also well-known as poets.

<HEADLINE> Padres Put Myers on 15-day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Padres reliever Randy Myers was placed on the  
15-day disabled list today with a strained left rotator cuff. The 
move is retroactive to Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers, who underwent an MRI exam on Monday, was unable to warm  
up during San Diego's season opener on Sunday night against the 
Colorado Rockies at Monterrey, Mexico. He lacked velocity in spring 
training, when the Padres continued to try to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego gambled by acquiring Myers in a waiver deal with  
Toronto on Aug. 6. Normally a closer, he was used in a setup role 
because the Padres had one of baseball's top closers in Trevor 
Hoffman. The Padres made it an offseason priority to trade him 
because he's due more than $12 million in the final two years of 
his contract. With a salary of $6 million, he is the highest-paid 
Padres player this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres purchased the contract of left-hander Roberto Rivera  
from Class AAA Las Vegas. To make room for Rivera on the 40-man 
roster, the Padres designated infielder Ed Giovanola for 
assignment.

<HEADLINE> Strike Not Affecting Navy Readiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The Steelworkers strike at Newport News  
Shipbuilding, in its second day today, so far has not affected the 
Navy's readiness, Navy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the yard is the only shipyard that builds  
nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, there are other places the Navy 
could go if necessary should a carrier need repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy has four shipyards, and two can handle ``major  
maintenance service'' for aircraft carriers, said David Caskey, 
spokesman for the Arlington-based Naval Sea Systems Command, which 
oversees construction and maintenance of Navy ships. The shipyards 
are Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth and Puget Sound Naval 
Shipyard in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the strike is affecting the Navy's readiness,  
Caskey said, ``Not now.'' He would not speculate on long-term 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Ripley, a spokesman for the Navy's Supervisor of  
Shipbuilding office in Newport News, agreed readiness was not 
hampered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Navy maintains sufficient public and private ship repair  
capacity for all ship types, including aircraft carriers, to ensure 
readiness is maintained during periods of private sector labor 
disputes,'' Ripley said in a written statement in response to 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding is building the aircraft carrier  
Ronald Reagan, refueling the carrier USS Nimitz, doing some 
maintenance work on the carrier USS Harry S. Truman and working on 
the USS Narwhal, a submarine scheduled to be deactivated. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipyard spokeswoman Jerri Fuller Dickseski said work at the  
yard continued despite the strike. Many salaried employees rose 
through the ranks and have experience performing the hourly 
employees' jobs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how we're maintaining productivity,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Local 8888 of the United Steelworkers of America represents  
9,200 hourly workers out of the yard's total 17,400 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Local President Arnold Outlaw said fewer than 500 hourly workers  
crossed the picket line Monday and that a majority of union members 
appeared to honor the strike Tuesday. Ms. Dickseski would not say 
how many hourly employees reported for work. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 1,000 workers walked the picket lines Tuesday, Outlaw  
said. ``We will keep on doing the same thing until the shipyard 
decides they want to bring us a fair package,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	No negotiating sessions have been held since union members voted  
Thursday to reject the shipyard's final offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The union wants an across-the-board hourly pay increase of $3.95  
over three years. The shipyard has offered increases over three 
years that it said would boost the average worker's pay $2.49 an 
hour, with automatic promotions based on experience and skills.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Man Pleads Guilty to Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- A man pleaded guilty Tuesday to  
torturing two retarded men with hammers, pliers and sticks and 
scalding them with water. 
</P>
<P>
	Karol Simonton, 62, was in his second day of trial when he  
decided to admit to raping, beating and starving the men regularly, 
stealing their Social Security money and forcing them to panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Mental Retardation came under fire after  
the abuse was revealed in February 1997 and a supervisor was 
suspended for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't live as well as the dogs lived in the house,''  
prosecutor Walter Shea said of the victims, now age 63 and 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Simonton will be sentenced April 27.  
</P>
<P>
	On the rape charges alone he could face up to 60 years in  
prison. Simonton's brother, Harold, is also accused and scheduled 
to go to trial later in the week.

<HEADLINE> Heston Challenged on Gun Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Mayor Marc Morial is challenging Charlton  
Heston to a debate over gun safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Heston, president of the National Rifle Association, replied  
Tuesday: ``The mayor should take care of the problems of New 
Orleans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morial issued the challenge for a nationally televised debate on  
the eve of the actor's visit to Louisiana. New Orleans is suing 
gunmakers for shooting injuries and deaths; the NRA is backing 
legislation to bar such lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying to gag cities by sponsoring legislation that  
makes gunmakers immune to product liability suits,'' Morial said in 
a statement. ``A national debate will help the American people see 
the real issue. The real issue is the fact that guns can be 
designed safer.''

<HEADLINE> Charles Keating Enters Guilty Pleas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan chief Charles  
Keating Jr. pleaded guilty today to four counts of fraud in a deal 
with prosecutors that allows him to go free, bringing a close to a 
case that epitomized the S&AMP;L scandal of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Mariana Pfaelzer, after taking a  
90-minute recess to review conditions of the deal, accepted the 
plea. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-running case involved investors' loss of $200 million  
and the collapse Lincoln Savings, which cost taxpayers $3.4 
billion. His previous convictions had been thrown out on appeal, 
but prosecutors said they would retry him. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Keating was sentenced to time he has spent in  
jail on previous convictions, less than five years in prison. The 
judge did not impose any fines, restitution or supervision by 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also dismissed fraud charges against Keating's son,  
Charles Keating III. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how he felt afterward, Keating said, ``Great.'' Asked what  
lay ahead, he said, ``Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Keating pleaded guilty to three counts of wire fraud and one  
count of bankruptcy fraud. The latter count involved transfer of 
$975,000 from his American Continental Corp. to himself through 
relatives days before the company filed for bankruptcy protection. 
American Continental was parent of Lincoln Savings. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea followed an announcement by prosecutors in January that  
they planned to retry Keating and his son on charges that he 
defrauded investors who lost $200 million in worthless junk bonds 
issued by American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating's case returned to U.S. District Court earlier this year  
after an appellate court threw out the Keatings' 1992 federal 
convictions and said they deserved a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating, known for extravagant spending during his days as  
chairman of American Continental, was convicted in federal and 
state court on charges stemming from the collapse of Lincoln 
Savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued in the two trials that Keating looted Lincoln  
Savings of its assets to prop up American Continental. Bond 
purchasers, they said, were not told of the investment's risky 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating denied the allegations and blamed government regulators  
for Lincoln's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Sharon McCaslin told Pfaelzer the deal  
was justified because Keating was accepting responsibility for 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaslin also said that so much time had passed that some  
witnesses may have difficulty recalling the events that led to 
Lincoln's collapse. Many of the bond purchasers were elderly 
Lincoln customers who claimed they were duped into buying the 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Keating submitted a financial statement  
verifying that he had no financial resources in the United States 
or overseas that would enable him to pay $1 million in fines called 
for in the four counts involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the plea agreement, Keating faced a maximum sentence of  
20 years in prison followed by three years of supervised release, 
plus the fines and possible restitution to victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating served nearly five years in prison before the federal  
conviction was overturned on grounds some jurors learned of his 
earlier conviction in state court and discussed it in the jury 
room. Despite finding that the jury had based its verdict on the 
courtroom evidence, Pfaelzer ruled that jurors' exposure to outside 
information denied Keating a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating's state conviction was voided as well on grounds that  
the trial judge issued improper instructions to the jury. The state 
of California is appealing that reversal. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating's lawyer Stephen Neal said he thought there was little  
chance the case would be resurrected. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Keating's legal problems are not entirely over. He  
still faces $1.5 billion in civil judgments stemming from lawsuits 
filed by investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating had been sentenced to 10 years in prison on the state  
conviction and received a 12-year concurrent sentence in federal 
court. He was freed in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to jail for five days in March 1998 after Pfaelzer  
ruled that he violated the terms of his probation by applying for a 
passport. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Keating III also was convicted in the federal trial. He  
was sentenced to eight years in prison, but remained free on bail 
pending appeal.

<HEADLINE> Dollar, Gold Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The U.S. dollar was mostly lower today against  
other major currencies in European trading where dealings resumed 
after a four-day Easter weekend. Gold prices fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell to 120.98 Japanese yen from 121.83 yen late  
Monday in New York, and was lower against the euro, which rose to 
$1.0728 from $1.0708. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates compared with late Monday in New York  
included 1.4874 Swiss francs, down from 1.4895, and 1.5007 Canadian 
dollars, down from 1.5020. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound was quoted at $1.5992, down from $1.6000.  
</P>
<P>
	At midday in New York, the euro was quoted at $1.0811 but other  
currency quotes were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on euro rates in Europe, the dollar was worth 1.8231 German 
marks, down from 1.8265; 6.1144 French francs, down from 6.1275;

<HEADLINE> NFL May Reject Sale of Redskins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Two years and one day after the death of Jack  
Kent Cooke, NFL owners appear ready to reject the proposed sale of 
the Washington Redskins, a decision that could leave the franchise 
in limbo for months and perhaps years. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about Howard Milstein's finances, his contentious  
stewardship of the New York Islanders and a perceived high-handed 
lobbying approach have many owners leaning toward a veto of the 
$800 million bid, the most offered for a U.S. sports franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four of the 31 owners must approve the sale Wednesday at  
a special meeting arranged after Milstein requested a postponement 
last month in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	One league source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The  
Associated Press the group had no more than seven to 10 votes in 
Phoenix and they are still ``far short'' of the three-fourths 
required. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote could hinge on a recommendation from commissioner Paul  
Tagliabue and the league's financial committee, which will meet 
before the vote. The eight-member committee was split 3-3 with two 
abstentions in Phoenix. Committee chairman New England owner Bob 
Kraft has been one of the bid's few solid supporters, but committee 
members Tom Benson of New Orleans and Pat Bowlen of Denver are 
adamantly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the objections by some owners:  
</P>
<P>
	--While Milstein is worth an estimated $500 million, most of it  
is tied up in real estate, making his part of the bid heavily 
leveraged without the ready cash to back it up. His father recently 
agreed to supply $125 million to support the bid, but some league 
officials reportedly consider that money a loan that helps the 
financing arrangement only marginally. 
</P>
<P>
	--Milstein's part-ownership of the NHL's Islanders, which he  
bought with a partner just 14 months ago, has been ugly and 
litigious. Milstein wanted a new arena and threatened to cancel 
games because he felt the old one was unsafe. There are lawsuits 
pending between Milstein and New York's Nassau County. 
</P>
<P>
	--Milstein, according to several sources, solicited politicians  
in the nation's capital to lobby owners on his behalf. Sources say 
several owners considered it an impropriety when they received 
calls from congressmen from other parts of the country asking about 
the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	--Several owners have expressed a preference for Cooke's son,  
team president John Kent Cooke, to own the team. John Kent Cooke 
was outbid by Milstein and Daniel Snyder in an auction conducted by 
the trustees of his father's estate -- in accordance with his 
father's will after his death on April 6, 1997 -- but sources say 
some owners are eager to make the point that they alone can choose 
who joins their exclusive club. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which begs the question: If the owners say no, what  
happens next? 
</P>
<P>
	No one is saying for sure -- ``We'll cross that bridge if we have  
to,'' league spokesman Greg Aiello said -- but the league probably 
will tell the trustees to hold another auction and come back with 
another bid in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The favorite to win a second round of bidding would be Snyder, a  
Washington-area communications executive who has the money in the 
bank and who has come through the NFL process unscathed. Snyder 
could team with a losing bidder from the first round, such as 
Phoenix developer Sam Grossman, to mount a formidable bid. 
</P>
<P>
	But all that becomes moot if Milstein loses and decides to sue,  
halting the sale process with a course of action that could take 
years to play out. Milstein was asked by the owners in Phoenix if 
he would sue. His initial response was that he had not thought 
about it, but he later said he would not. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the sale is approved, John Kent Cooke will continue to  
run the team, retaining coach Norv Turner and general manager 
Charley Casserly. 
</P>
<P>
	Several free agents said they were wary of signing with the  
Redskins because of the uncertainty, and the players under contract 
want the matter resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things that has gone on too long,'' center  
Cory Raymer said Tuesday. ``And it's become a pain in the butt.''

<HEADLINE> Norman Ready for 19th Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- The shoulder is surgically mended, though  
still relatively untested. A bout with stomach flu ended just in 
time for the Masters, and his swing guru says he's hitting the ball 
better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	So why is Greg Norman being treated as little more than an  
afterthought on the eve of his 19th Masters? 
</P>
<P>
	Simple. Three years after his spectacular Sunday collapse at  
Augusta National, Norman's scarred psyche still seems to have room 
to heal. 
</P>
<P>
	It shows in his golf game, which has been maddeningly  
inconsistent since his comeback from shoulder surgery. And it shows 
on his face as he talks more about the new life he discovered while 
recuperating and less of his chances of finally winning a green 
jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I want to win the Masters, absolutely,'' Norman said.  
``But it's not a priority. There are other priorities that I enjoy 
doing. I don't have a sense of urgency anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting on the same podium where he bared his soul after blowing  
a six-shot lead in the final round to Nick Faldo in 1996, Norman 
had no problem Tuesday talking about his latest swing changes, 
rebuilt shoulder or the stomach ailment that made him appear gaunt 
after losing a half-dozen pounds or so last week. 
</P>
<P>
	But he struggled when the subject centered on the motivation of  
an extremely wealthy 44-year-old whose failures have always loomed 
larger than his many successes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy. I even enjoy playing the game of golf,''  
Norman said. ``I know it's a matter of time before I'll get back 
there in the winner's circle. But now I don't want to force it. I'm 
very easy about things. I'm very relaxed about things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That relaxation showed as Norman strolled over a few minutes  
later to the practice tee, greeting old acquaintances and signing 
autographs. Once on the course, he shared laughs with playing 
partners Steve Elkington and Shigeki Maruyama. 
</P>
<P>
	Having fun in practice and being tournament tough, though, are  
two different things. And Norman concedes he hasn't played enough 
coming into the Masters. He missed the cut in The Players 
Championship and had to withdraw from the BellSouth Classic in 
Atlanta because of his illness. 
</P>
<P>
	It showed on the second hole as Norman pulled his drive way left  
into the trees from the new tee box, then almost hit Maruyama with 
a sand shot as both practiced from the left greenside bunker. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just needs a little dose of confidence,'' said Norman's  
coach, David Leadbetter. ``He needs to play rounds under 
pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leadbetter tinkered a bit with Norman's swing during his  
seven-month layoff after last year's surgery on his left shoulder. 
Norman is swinging a bit more upright with a wider takeaway and is 
working on keeping his legs less-active. 
</P>
<P>
	The results have been mixed. He played Tiger Woods tough in a  
match that went 18 holes during the Presidents Cup, only to 
collapse in the Match Play Championship against Eduardo Romero, 
blowing a 3-up lead with five holes to play. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to lose the Australian Masters to a birdie by Craig  
Spence on the 72nd hole, and did not play particularly well at 
Doral Golf Resort before missing the cut at The Players 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen him swing this well in a long, long time,''  
Leadbetter said. ``If he gets off to a good start, he'll get better 
as the week goes on. He just needs to get his scoring boots on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norman, who missed the cut in the last two Masters after his 78  
in the closing round cost him a green jacket in 1996, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a shoulder standpoint, I'm physically stronger than what  
I was 2 1/2 years ago,'' Norman said. ``Right now, I could walk to the 
first tee, pull out a driver and swing it in one swing. That's a 
huge leap forward in the last 12 months to two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From a mental standpoint, though, things aren't so simple.  
Norman waited until Tuesday to play the course, skipping some of 
the early preparation he might have used in earlier years. 
</P>
<P>
	It was almost as if he didn't want to see the course until he  
had to. 
</P>
<P>
	``There still has to be some remnants of bad feelings around  
here,'' Leadbetter conceded Tuesday as he stood under the huge oak 
tree in front of Augusta National's clubhouse. ``That was a 
tournament for Greg to win and he just couldn't fix the leaks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Norman says he can remember the good times in Georgia,  
including back-to-back runner-up finishes in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
	And he insists that his life is more complete now, and that he  
can live it secure in the knowledge that he did his best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've taken a lot of great things out of the Masters,'' he  
said. ``If I stopped this with my last tournament and I didn't win 
it, I'd say the Masters had a great stamp on my life and how my 
life turned out.''

<HEADLINE> Man Charged for DNC Contribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A businessman was charged Tuesday with giving  
the Democratic National Committee $150,000 drawn from a South 
Korean corporation -- a violation of federal election laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert S. Lee, 49, was the 16th person charged in a Justice  
Department investigation of campaign financing. He has agreed to a 
plea agreement that will be filed Wednesday, Assistant U.S. 
Attorney Daniel J. O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien wouldn't discuss details of the plea. DNC spokesman Rick  
Hess said the DNC had thought the funds were from U.S. sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was charged with misdemeanor aiding and abetting an illegal  
campaign contribution from foreign sources, a violation of the 
Federal Election Campaign Act. The charge carries up to a year in 
prison and a fine of more than $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee is accused of giving the DNC a $150,000 check drawn on a  
California development firm's bank account that was entirely funded 
by a firm in Seoul, South Korea. The check was allegedly handed 
over to the DNC in May 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone message left for Lee's attorney was not returned.

<HEADLINE> Williams Impresses NFL Types </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Ricky Williams put on a good show for  
representatives of several NFL team today, and the thing they were 
most impressed with was his waistline. 
</P>
<P>
	With his dreadlocks tied back in pigtails, the Heisman Trophy  
winner from Texas went though a 2-hour workout at UC San Diego for 
scouts, coaches and general managers. He ran three 40-yard dashes, 
did some agility drills, pass-catching drills and then, with dozens 
of UC San Diego students looking on, benched pressed 225 pounds 22 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	The big moment came when he stepped on the scales. Back in  
mid-February during the NFL scouting combine, where he did 
interviews with teams but skipped the drills, he weighed 244 
pounds. On Tuesday, he was down to 224. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just worked really hard,'' said Williams, who went to high  
school in San Diego. ``We had to concentrate so much on losing the 
weight that maybe it took away from speed work, but I mean, I think 
the main thing was getting my weight down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the NCAA career rushing leader with 6,279 yards, made  
an impression with the two coaches whose teams have the first two 
picks in the draft April 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he did today was allow a lot of scouts, general managers  
and head coaches to rest easy tonight,'' said Chris Palmer of the 
expansion Cleveland Browns, who hold the first pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``The No. 1 thing was that he has dropped the weight,'' said  
Andy Reid of the Philadelphia Eagles. ``That's always a concern, 
somebody's up 20 pounds from a normal playing weight. You've just 
got to (come and) see. We understood that he had been on the 
banquet circuit. But he lost it and he looked sharp. That showed me 
a little something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being on the rubber-chicken circuit was tough ``only because  
you're not working out,'' Williams said. ``Eating wasn't that bad, 
it's just that you're traveling so much that it's really hard to 
take time to work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his diet, ``I just kind of made up stuff,'' Williams  
said. ``I got by. It changed almost every day. I had to work 
extremely hard. It wasn't just strictly diet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest thing he gave up?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, all sweets. Doughnuts, cheesecake. That's about it. Just  
sweets. Right now I'm going to a doughnut shop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Williams was timed anywhere from 4.6 seconds to 4.72  
running against the wind in the 40, and anywhere from 4.43 to 4.52 
in two heats with the wind. Two other college players who were 
being timed suffered hamstring injuries on the cold, blustery day. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in the crowd of 200 watching the workout were  
Cleveland general manager Dwight Clark, Indianapolis GM Bill Polian 
and coach Jim Mora, New Orleans Saints GM Bill Kuharich and 
Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is so well regarded that Saints coach Mike Ditka said  
he would trade all six 1999 draft picks and additional future picks 
to move up in the first round and get him. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuharich said the Saints haven't had any discussions yet with  
other teams, ``but that will be part of the package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch, Oregon quarterback  
Akili Smith and Williams are the three players the Browns are 
considering. Clark said there is no clear-cut favorite. The Browns 
are scheduled to work out Couch in Lexington, Ky., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Browns officials will sit down this week and discus  
the pros and cons of the three, and also entertain any trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams would like to go to Cleveland as the first pick.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great organization,'' he said. ``They have the best  
fans in the NFL. I just see myself fitting in in Cleveland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and his agent, Leland Hardy, are scheduled to visit six  
teams in three days -- St. Louis and New Orleans on Wednesday, 
Washington and Philadelphia on Thursday and Cleveland and 
Indianapolis on Friday.

<HEADLINE>  Airstrikes Complicate China Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the  
United States comes at a time of particularly tense relations 
between Beijing and Washington, including a stark dispute over the 
bombing of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	China has called for an immediate halt to the NATO airstrikes.  
And Chinese leaders even considered postponing Zhu's six-city, 
nine-day visit that was beginning on Tuesday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Zhu still hopes to close a deal with the Clinton  
administration to allow Beijing to join the World Trade 
Organization, which regulates international trade, after 13 years 
of trying. 
</P>
<P>
	In advance of his coming to Washington on Thursday, U.S. and  
Chinese trade negotiators worked furiously to try to strike a deal 
that could be announced during the visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu also will visit Denver, Chicago, New York and Boston,  
courting the political and business elite at each stop. He may 
observe financial markets, possibly the New York Stock Exchange and 
the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	China hopes to attract the foreign investment needed to help its  
slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	While in Washington, Zhu was to dine with Clinton on Thursday  
evening, hold meetings with officials of the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund and meet on Friday with a handful of 
lawmakers back early from the two-week congressional recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that they will understand better the importance of  
China-U.S. relations,'' said Yu Shuning, a spokesman for the 
Chinese Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism in Congress of China's human rights record is  
bipartisan and widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the tensions are concerns -- particularly among  
Republicans who see it as a good 2000 campaign issue -- over alleged 
Chinese nuclear espionage, Pentagon reports of a missile buildup 
against Taiwan and alleged Chinese campaign contributions to 
Clinton's 1996 re-election campagin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese, in turn, resent a U.S. initiative to provide a  
missile-defense shield for Japan and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	China also strongly opposes U.S. sponsorship at the annual U.N.  
Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva of a resolution 
condemning Beijing's human rights record -- a step taken by the 
administration only after extensive prodding from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent Communist Party-ordered crackdown on dissidents who  
formed an opposition party helped solidify anti-China sentiment in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, it will not be an easy task,'' Zhu told reporters  
in advance of his trip. ``But I will go anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, in an interview published in Tuesday's editions of the Wall  
Street Journal, Zhu asserted that the administration had recently 
backed away from closing a deal on trade ``due to pressure from 
Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is still in its spring recess -- probably sparing Zhu  
the harshest of criticism of China's human-rights record while he 
is here. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to work with the premier, we want to advance our  
national interests to work with China where we can on areas of 
interest,'' said James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman. He 
cited recent developments in North Korea, India and Pakistan's 
nuclear programs and international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	As to China's membership in the WTO, Rubin said: ``If the  
Chinese meet the objective criteria, we would like to see a 
situation where our exporters can get access to the Chinese 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China has been trying to join the WTO, and its predecessor, the  
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only are the meetings being eclipsed by the bombing campaign  
in Yugoslavia, but the NATO airstrikes have soured the atmosphere 
for the visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders have condemned the bombings as a violation of  
the U.N. charter and interference in a sovereign country's affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	China's state-run media have been unrestrained in their  
criticism. The Yancheng Evening News, a popular newspaper published 
in southern China, even doctored a picture of Clinton to make him 
look like Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Communist Party line from Beijing comparing the  
United States to Nazi Germany makes it difficult to accept that the 
People's Republic of China is doing everything possible to smooth 
over relations,'' said Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Cox, chairman of a special bipartisan congressional  
committee that concluded that China has benefited militarily from 
20 years of espionage and U.S. satellite exports, said he's glad 
Zhu didn't postpone his visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world is sufficiently complex that you cannot require  
everyone else to wait on hold while you attend to one specific 
problem in Kosovo,'' Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's determination to go ahead with the visit demonstrates the  
importance Beijing gives to smooth relations with Washington. Zhu 
would like to try to revive the amicability that President Clinton 
and China's President Jiang Zemin shared nine months ago in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu Xiaoming, deputy chief of mission at the Chinese Embassy,  
conceded that ``the climate and the atmosphere right now is not 
that good.'' But he suggested that was even more reason for the 
meetings to take place. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov canceled  
his visit to the White House at the last minute as NATO airstrikes 
got under way March 24.

plundering of the Congo, and the lives of World War II veterans 
from New Jersey were named winners Monday of the first J. Anthony 
Lukas prize for nonfiction writing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lukas Prize Project honors work that exemplifies the

<HEADLINE> Ford Sets March Sales Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With record-breaking demand for its pickups and  
sport utility vehicles, Ford Motor Co. took advantage of Americans' 
love affair with trucks to post its best March ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2 automaker reported Tuesday that its U.S. sales were up  
14 percent in March over the same month a year ago, based on the 
daily sales rate. Ford broke a long list of company records, led by 
its strongest monthly sales of light trucks ever. 
</P>
<P>
	March sales of F-series pickups, the nation's top-selling  
vehicle for 17 years, were the highest for any car or truck in any 
month since June 1978. Ford sold 85,686 of the full-size pickups 
last month, more than many models achieve over an entire year. The 
June '78 record was 90,370 F-series trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's car sales, excluding its Jaguar unit, were up nearly 6  
percent while its light truck sales increased 19 percent to set a 
record for any month. SUV sales were up 11 percent while total 
pickup sales were up 28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The news was especially good for Ford because pickups and SUVs  
carry the highest profit margins. Much of the big increase in 
F-series sales was due to robust demand for the new F-250 and F-350 
Super Duty trucks built at Ford's Louisville, Ky., truck plant, 
which has been running full-tilt with three shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're crying all the way to the bank,'' said analyst David  
Healy of Burnham Securities Inc. ``The models that are the most 
profitable for them have the biggest year-over-year increase in 
sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford announced Tuesday that it was increasing its second-quarter  
production by 20,000 trucks and 10,000 cars to meet the strong 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Explorer and Expedition SUVs also set March sales records,  
while the new Mercury Cougar and the Escort ZX2 coupes had their 
best sales months yet. Ford's minivan sales were up 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange,  
Ford was up 25 cents at $58.56 1/4 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's report comes after last week's largely upbeat sales  
figures from DaimlerChrysler AG and most major foreign automakers. 
General Motors Corp., the No. 1 automaker, is expected to report 
slightly higher March sales on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Rewey, Ford vice president of marketing and sales, said a  
stable economy marked by high consumer confidence, income growth, 
low inflation and interest rates was behind the robust demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Wall Street and Main Street respond favorably to  
consistency and stability,'' Rewey said. ``We believe that stable 
fiscal and monetary policy have played a key role in the duration 
of this expansion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Healy said he does not see any drop in the high demand in the  
short term. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anything in the picture that's going to slow this  
down unless gasoline prices keep going up 30 cents a gallon every 
week,'' he said. ``At this point, the gasoline thing is just a 
minor irritant to people who want to buy an Expedition or an 
Excursion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jaguar's sales were down 17 percent last month.

<HEADLINE> Leading Economic Indicators Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A key economic barometer rose for a fifth  
straight month in February, signaling that the U.S. economy will 
continue to thrive at least through the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said the Index of Leading Economic  
Indicators rose 0.2 percent in February, in line with economists' 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the 10 indicators that make up the leading index were  
positive, including higher consumer expectations and lower 
first-time claims for unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the fifth consecutive increase in the leading index  
but it shows less breadth than usual with only four of 10 
components rising in February,'' said Michael Boldin, director of 
business cycle research at the business-financed private research 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The index is designed to forecast economic activity six to nine  
months in advance. The Conference Board also reported that the 
coincident indicators, which measure current activity, rose 0.3 
percent and the lagging index, which measures the economy's past 
performance, rose 0.2 percent in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Taken together, the board said the three index components show a  
healthy economy and an economic expansion that will continue 
through at least late 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is consistent with the view that the economy is  
continuing to expand,'' said Michael Moran, chief economist at 
Daiwa Securities America. ``The signal that you get from this 
measure is no turning point in the economy is at hand and that is 
good news for investors and good for the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The figures had little impact on Wall Street, where the Dow  
Jones industrial average was retreating from Monday's record and 
back below 10,000. At late morning, the Dow was down 35.24 at 
9,972.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the strength in the index came from decline in initial  
unemployment claims, said Douglas Porter, senior economist at 
Nesbitt Burns Securities of Chicago. That made up for declines in 
manufacturers' new orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is consistent with the trend we've seen in the economy,  
``Porter said. ``We're not as strong as 1997 and 1998, but it still 
a solid performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the rise in the coincident indicators point to  
the Gross Domestic Product expanding at an annual rate of 3 percent 
in the first quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The index increased 0.5 percent in January and increased 0.2

<HEADLINE> Intel Pushing for Home Networking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Computer chip giant Intel Corp. is throwing its  
marketing clout behind a $190 gadget that easily links home 
computers into a network, accelerating industry efforts to 
jump-start nascent sales of home-networking equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's product, called AnyPoint Home Network, lets users of  
different machines share files, use the same printer and access the 
Internet through one account over existing phone lines. It plugs 
into the outsideof the computer, easier to install than other 
products that require consumers to open up their machines. 
</P>
<P>
	While a handful of manufacturers already sell such equipment at  
CompUSA and other computer stores, the marketing push launched 
Tuesday by the world's largest maker of computer microprocessors 
could lure mainstream consumers to the product, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their marketing might and support of this will help drive the  
customer to look for it and consider it,'' said Aaron Goldberg of 
the ZD Market Intelligence, a high-tech research firm. ``The big 
thing is to get the customers over the hurdle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only a small fraction of U.S. households link their  
computers into networks. But that should rise as consumers buy more 
than one PC -- up from 12.4 percent of homes at the end of last year 
to an estimated 17 percent by the end of 1999, according to the 
Yankee Group research firm. Also driving the trend is a rapid 
growth in high-speed Internet access, through phone and cable-TV 
lines, which encourages people to link their computers into 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to CompUSA, Intel's product will be offered by  
computer makers Gateway and IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's initiative is part of a company drive to stimulate new  
uses for computers, key to generating demand for its more powerful 
microprocessors. The urgency for Intel has intensified amid a sharp 
drop in computer prices that threatens to shift Intel's sales to 
its least profitable chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel chairman Andy Grove said the idea is to encourage  
consumers to buy a more powerful computer as the ``base station'' 
for their home, able to run more demanding applications and easily 
communicate with less powerful machines in other rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumers may balk at paying a higher price for the  
convenience of easy installation, some say. The AnyPoint product is 
nearly twice as expensive than some other offerings that also work 
through phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty cheap to network your home if you know what you're  
doing,'' said David Goldstein, president of Channel Marketing 
Corp., a research and consultant firm.

<HEADLINE> `Melissa' Virus Charges Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The lawyer for the man accused of creating  
the Melissa computer virus said Tuesday he questions whether the 
spread of the bug was really a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Melissa virus does not corrupt any file, does not erase  
any files, does not delete any files,'' Edward F. Borden Jr. said 
Tuesday. ``All it does is forward a relatively innocuous message to 
50 other people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned about whether the charges are even valid ones.  
At this point, it remains unclear as to what, if any, damage 
occurred and what caused it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Borden wouldn't say whether his client, David Smith, was  
responsible for creating the virus. Smith's previous lawyer, Steven 
D. Altman, said over the weekend that Smith never intended to do 
anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 30, was arrested last week and charged with originating  
the virus, which came disguised as an e-mail marked ``important 
message'' from a friend or colleague. It caused affected computers 
to fire off 50 more infected messages and slowed some systems to a 
crawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who is scheduled to appear in court for the first time on  
Thursday, is charged with interruption of public communications, 
conspiracy and theft of computer service. He could face up to 40 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He is free on $100,000 bail.

<HEADLINE> Trainer Compares Vicar, Unbridled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- They have different styles, but Vicar,  
Carl Nafzger's 1999 Kentucky Derby hopeful, and Unbridled, the 
trainer's 1990 Derby winner, have many similarities, including the 
paths they've traveled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unbridled and Vicar are exactly alike in personality, health  
and soundness,'' Nafzger said Tuesday on a conference call from 
Churchill Downs, where Vicar is stabled. ``But they have entirely 
different running styles.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Unbridled liked to come off the pace. Vicar likes to stay close  
to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We raced Unbridled in the Tropical Park Derby, the Fountain of  
Youth, Florida Derby and the Blue Grass,'' Nafzger recalled. He won 
the Florida Derby and was third in each of the other three races. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar goes into the 1 1-8-mile Toyota Blue Grass Saturday at  
Keeneland off a fifth-place in the Holy Bull and victories in the 
Fountain of Youth and the Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Nafzger would settle for an Unbridled-kind of Blue Grass  
performance for Vicar. 
</P>
<P>
	``A nice consistent fourth would be enough,'' Nafzger said.  
``He's already proved he can run in the Derby. If he can't, then 
we're only going to have six or seven horses in the Derby (May 1 at 
Churchill Downs).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Derby field could easily reach the 20-horse limit.  
</P>
<P>
	Eight 3-year-olds are expected to be entered in the Blue Grass  
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Nafzger doesn't want to use up Vicar in an all-out bid for  
victory, with the 1 1/4-mile Derby only three weeks away, he also 
said, ``The basic thing is he's ready to win Saturday. I'd being 
doing him a disservice if I took him over there not ready to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nafzger thinks the four top horses in the Blue Grass will be  
Vicar, Wondertross and Cat Thief, second and third in the Florida 
Derby, and Kimberlite Pipe, the Louisiana Derby winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just have to run consistent races and then go on to  
Churchill Downs,'' he said. ``The other four have some questions to 
answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They are Lemon Drop Kid, who has raced only once this year;  
Pineaff, winner of the Tampa Bay Derby; Menifee, second in the 
Tropical Park Derby, and Prado's Landing, who has been shipped in 
from Dubai, but who won one of three races last year at Laurel in 
Maryland, none farther than 5 1/2 furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Blue Grass will move him real good in the Derby,''  
Nafzger said of Vicar, The colt will be ridden by Shane Sellers, 
who not committed to riding him beyond Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nafzger would have no problem replacing Sellers on Vicar in what  
would be the trainer's first Derby since 1990.

<HEADLINE> WNBA Nears Contract Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Another labor dispute could delay the start of  
another basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA has given its players until Saturday to reach a  
contract agreement with the league. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center of the disagreement is salaries, just as it was  
when the NBA locked out its players for six months, including 
nearly half the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The union wants a minimum salary of $45,000 for the three-month  
summer season. The WNBA is proposing $20,000, according to the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole purpose of having a women's professional basketball  
league in the United States is because women are tired of going 
overseas,'' Coquese Washington, a guard for the New York Liberty 
and also a lawyer, told USA Today. ``We want to make a career out 
of something we are very good at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WNBA president Val Ackerman said the league offered a 30 percent  
increase in player salaries, year-round health, dental and 
maternity benefits and offseason career programs. The league said 
the compensation package is worth $60,000 a player. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides also are at odds over the number of players from  
the defunct American Basketball League that should be allowed in 
the league. The WNBA wants 52 of the 90 eligible players and wants 
to expand rosters to accommodate them. The union wants 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman told USA Today the WNBA doesn't believe there should be  
restrictions on the number of ABL players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will all go into the (April 27) draft together,''  
Ackerman said. ``Our plan is to allocate an additional player to 
(expansion) Minnesota and Orlando so that they'll end up with two 
allocated players, like everyone else did to start their rosters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA has a tryout camp April 15-17 in Chicago. That camp  
could be jeopardized by the stalemated negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Angels Bring No Profit to Disney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Anaheim Angels are The Walt Disney Co.'s  
only money-losing venture, but Disney chief executive officer 
Michael Eisner doesn't care. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels are a minor part of a very profitable entertainment  
conglomerate, one that reported a $2 billion profit last year. The 
team has claimed operating losses of more than $42 million in three 
seasons under Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	During the offseason, the Angels gave first baseman Mo Vaughn an  
$80 million, six-year contract, a deal that dispelled doubts among 
players and fans that Disney would spend to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be competitive,'' Eisner told the Los Angeles Times  
during a visit to the Angels spring training home in Tempe, Ariz. 
``Our own pride demands it, and I don't think our fans in Orange 
County would accept the Disney Co. not being competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't care if this might not be the greatest financial  
thing for Disney Co. They see other things we are doing well. And I 
kind of agree with that. If we're going to be on the field, we're 
going to be on the field in a successful way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eisner was so proud of getting Vaughn that he saluted the first  
baseman in Disney's annual report, citing him even before Mickey 
Mouse in a letter to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Angels are the one thing in our series of assets that does  
not turn a profit and that I don't think has the potential to turn 
a profit. That's discouraging. But that's OK,'' Eisner told the 
Times.

<HEADLINE> Refugee Issues Not New to Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As President Clinton steps up the U.S.  
response to the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo, his own history with 
the touchy issue of political refugees is likely to be a factor in 
his decision making. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has blamed his re-election loss in the 1980 Arkansas  
governor's race in part on riots among Cuban exiles who ended up at 
a federal facility in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	As president in 1994, he had 14,000 Haitian refugees housed at  
the U.S. military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- a location that 
limited domestic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	But he caused consternation in Florida that same year by his  
handling of a mass exodus of Cuban refugees touched off by Cuba's 
Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro, like Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is doing now  
by forcibly removing ethnic Albanians from Kosovo province, had 
found a way to make citizens he didn't like someone else's problem 
-- particularly a U.S. president. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20,000 Kosovo refugees that the United States has agreed to  
shelter temporarily likely will be sent to Guantanamo too, although 
Clinton administration officials delayed a final decision Monday 
while they sought assurances that European countries were fully 
engaged in the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials still were grappling with the logistics  
of transporting and sheltering 20,000 people half a world away on 
Monday. While they have been quick to lend a hand to people struck 
by natural disasters -- soldiers and millions in aid were dispatched 
to Central America after Hurricane Mitch struck last year -- the 
current crisis poses unique challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is different because you don't know what the end date  
is,'' said a White House official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. ``But you want to make sure people are surviving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were concerns now, as in times past, about how to  
adequately provide for the refugees while they are in the care of 
the United States. But concern for the plight of the Kosovar 
Albanians was outweighing other considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials decided to accept the refugees to alleviate the  
bottleneck of people flowing from Kosovo to Albania, Macedonia and 
the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro -- an estimated 400,000 people, 
mostly ethnic Albanians -- since the U.S.-led NATO bombing of 
Yugoslavia began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said U.S. policymakers  
expected that the Kosovo refugees eventually would be repatriated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe these refugees want to return to their homes,''  
Rubin said. ``This is a temporary arrangement designed to deal with 
an emergency problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government sent thousands of Cuban refugees to Fort  
Chaffee, Ark., in 1980 in the wake of the Mariel boatlift. Clinton 
got assurances from the Carter administration that no more would be 
sent after a riot left dozens injured, but a month later the 
administration sent refugees harbored in four other states on to 
Fort Chaffee. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's opponent, Republican Frank White, used public  
sentiment over the riots against Clinton, accusing him of failing 
to be tough enough with Carter to move the refugees. Clinton told 
USA Today in 1987 that the incident ``did play some role'' in his 
defeat. He subsequently regained the governors' office. 
</P>
<P>
	When thousands of Haitians began fleeing the island in rickety  
boats in 1994, Clinton ordered the Coast Guard to transport them to 
the Marine facility at Guantanamo until political stability was 
restored in Haiti. While many Haitians ultimately were allowed to 
come to the mainland, thousands had to be returned to Haiti 
forcibly. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton on Monday appealed directly to the American public for  
cash donations to the relief effort and announced ``Operation 
Sustain Hope,'' an interagency initiative for the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced a toll-free 1-800 telephone number that people  
can call to donate money for ethnic Albanians expelled from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The president asked for donations to nongovernmental groups in  
the area trying to stanch the humanitarian crisis. He directed 
potential donors to a toll-free number: 1-800-USAID-RELIEF. 
Officials said more lines would be installed in the coming days to 
cope with a flood of calls that jammed circuits.

<HEADLINE> Austin School District Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Austin school district and a deputy  
superintendent were indicted Tuesday on charges of tampering with 
statewide tests to make their students appear smarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a happy day, but this action gives us the vehicle  
to try to correct the problems throughout the system which caused 
these types of violations,'' prosecutor Ken Oden said. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury handed up 16 indictments against the Austin  
Independent School District and a 16-count indictment against 
deputy superintendent Margaret Kay Psencik. 
</P>
<P>
	The district and Psencik are accused of tampering with Texas  
Assessment of Academic Skills tests, which are used to rate and 
compare Texas schools. 
</P>
<P>
	They allegedly altered identification numbers on the tests of 16  
students who had performed poorly so that the tests would not be 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Proceeding legally against both the individuals and the  
district itself will give us the chance to seek both personal 
accountability and improvement in the whole system as well,'' Oden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, the school district could face fines of up to  
$160,000. The deputy superintendent, Margaret Kay Psencik, could 
face up to a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Oden said the Austin school district can be held legally liable  
for the criminal acts of its employees. He emphasized that the 
indictment didn't charge or imply personal wrongdoing by school 
board members, but said additional indictments are possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Psencik's lawyer, Roy Minton, said she did nothing wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll certainly be ready to go to trial on this. The lady has  
not done a single thing that's a violation of any law, nor anything 
that's improper,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation, which Oden said continues, was launched in  
September following reports that student identification numbers 
were changed on some TAAS tests.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Faces Global Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the fifth anniversary of the ethnic  
slaughter in Rwanda, with NATO's bombs aimed at halting the Serb 
onslaught against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, President Clinton is 
again confronting a question he says poses the biggest challenge to 
progress in the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you strip it all away, down deep inside there is this  
idea that you cannot organize personal life or social life unless 
some group feels better about itself only when they are oppressing 
someone else,'' he said Tuesday in pressing to expand hate crimes 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The root problem is as old as time. Classicists refer to it as  
the problem of the one vs. the other, a tribe's tendency to define 
itself by its differences with another group. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a unifying theory Clinton sees running through conflicts  
all around the globe and at home, from ``The Troubles'' in Northern 
Ireland to America's racial divide. He even sees it in the politics 
of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things I have sought to do in our country is to  
bridge all these divides, and to get all of our people ... to 
recognize that our common humanity is more important than these 
categorical differences,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Montville, director of the preventive diplomacy program at  
the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the issue 
the president is grappling with is ``as old as humankind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole idea of having outside groups that become the  
reservoir for your aggression or your fear -- you try to build 
yourself up by putting them down,'' he said. ``Some of the oldest 
names that people gave themselves was The People, to distinguish 
themselves from those who weren't quite human.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sees modern Us vs. Them tensions in conflicts from the  
bloody to the petty. 
</P>
<P>
	At political fund-raisers, he characterizes Democrats as the  
party of inclusiveness and the Republicans as the party that 
practices ``the politics of personal destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thanking one of his impeachment defenders last month, he said  
``all of the problems I've faced'' in politics might have vanished 
if people ``could just understand that they don't have to define 
their lives in terms of putting someone else down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime Clinton ally, Maria Echaveste, deputy White House  
chief of staff, has seen him grapple with these issues since his 
first run for president in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a student of history, he's drawn connections and seen the  
similarities of conflict all over the world and through time,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Echaveste said that the issue drove Clinton's race initiative --  
his attempt at fostering dialogue across racial lines -- and 
informed his handling of peace talks in the Middle East and in 
Northern Ireland. She said Clinton has been ``struck by how over 
and over and over, through both our history and world history, that 
conflict is so often based upon some rivalry, whether it's 
religious or ethnic, and some fear of the stranger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he began to brace the American public for NATO's  
intervention in the Balkans, Clinton couldn't resist a sweeping 
explanation for the U.S. interest rooted in the question of the one 
vs. the other. 
</P>
<P>
	He likened the problems behind the Kosovo bloodshed to domestic  
ethnic and social tensions here at home, ``which is why I devoted 
so much time to that initiative on race, and why I keep fighting 
for passage of the hate crimes legislation -- all these things,'' 
Clinton told a union audience on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what Kosovo's about. ... People are still killing each  
other out of primitive urges because they think what is different 
about them is more important than what they have in common.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Kosovo conflict, Montville can see centuries of Serb  
victimization playing itself out in aggression toward the ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole tradition of insult, disdain, attack and aggression  
is really what history is all about,'' Montville said, in agreement 
with the president.

<HEADLINE> Woods-Duvall Showdown at Masters?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Tiger Woods settled into his chair to size  
up his chances of winning the Masters for the second time in three 
years, the tournament that was thought to be his domain for years 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Right away, he realized he was no longer the center of  
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``How does it feel to be Avis?'' came the first question.  
</P>
<P>
	No. 1 now belongs to David Duval, whose four victories so far  
this year have been enough to surpass Woods atop the world rankings 
and make him the favorite this week at Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's playing better, no doubt about it,'' Woods said. ``But I  
like my chances, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he should. After all, it has only been two years since Woods  
set the Masters scoring record (270) and proceeded to set the world 
of golf on fire with booming drives and a charisma not seen on the 
PGA Tour since Arnold Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Jack Nicklaus predicted Woods might win as many green  
jackets as he and Palmer combined -- 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Funny how three months and four victories, not to mention a 59,  
can shift the emphasis from Woods to Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cool,'' Woods said. ``It's fine. Everybody is going to have  
their runs and David is having his run right now. It's all part of 
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Woods and Duval have become a game within the game,  
virtually the only two players anyone is talking about in the 
largest field the Masters has had in 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval won his first two tournaments of the year, the  
winners-only Mercedes by a whopping nine strokes, then the Bob Hope 
Classic with the first Sunday 59 in tour history. Woods slowed the 
Duval Express by winning in San Diego and nearly winning again a 
week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Back comes Duval, heading into Augusta with victories the last  
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the best two players in the world,'' said Fred Funk.  
``David got off to such a great start, and then Tiger kind of 
answered him. Now David is playing great. Let's see if Tiger can 
answer the bell again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than just the first major championship of the year, the  
Masters has proven to be a spectacular arena for some of golf's 
best rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Nelson and Sam Snead each won memorable playoffs over Ben  
Hogan, who still managed to win two Masters. The rivalry between 
Nicklaus and Palmer was born in the U.S. Open but flourished at 
Augusta, where they won six green jackets between them during a 
seven-year stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	The seeds for another great rivalry could be planted this week  
among the brilliant azaleas and sloping fairways of Augusta 
National. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there a little bit of a rivalry between Tiger and David?  
Yeah, probably,'' said defending champion Mark O'Meara. ``What 
David has done in the last two years is absolutely incredible. 
Natural, raw talent. ... I've never seen anybody like Tiger Woods. 
He's got the most talent of any player I've ever seen 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to be the man. David wants to be the man. That's good  
for golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comparisons to a Nicklaus-Palmer rivalry are natural.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods is a lot like Palmer, capable of drawing masses to the  
game with his emotion and a swashbuckling style that can leave a 
gallery breathless. Tigermania took root at Augusta, the same place 
where Arnie's Army was born nearly 40 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	There is nothing fancy about Duval, as a person or a player.  
Like Nicklaus, his name is becoming a fearsome sight on the 
scoreboard. He is among the longest hitters, makes all the big 
putts and has such composure that he rarely makes a mistake when it 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my best sequence of events ... I felt like you walk to the  
first tee and you feel like, 'Who's going to finish second this 
week?' And you can see that with David right now,'' said Greg 
Norman. ``I think there's one guy now dominating our tour. That's 
David.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Duval and Woods are the only ones.  
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Els beat both of them down the stretch in Los Angeles, is  
a two-time U.S. Open champion and has a game that can hold up 
against anyone. Justin Leonard counts the British Open and Players 
Championship among his four victories, while Phil Mickelson has 
already won 13 times and is still 28. 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of depth is one reason rivalries are hard to come by  
these days. But what established previous ones was not so much 
quantity as quality. Palmer and Nicklaus staged their duels in the 
Masters and U.S. Open, not the Western Open and the Bob Hope 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to say David and I are the best players in the  
world and we're going to see each other heading down the stretch on 
Sunday,'' Woods said. ``What probably will end up happening, if 
David continues to play well and I win more tournaments, is we will 
probably play head-to-head eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, it will happen in the majors.''  
</P>
<P>
	What better place than Augusta, where Woods' dominance is in  
question and Duval's credentials lack only that first major 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd embrace that if it came to pass,'' Duval said. ``The  
biggest reason you can't say it's a rivalry yet is because he and I 
haven't come down to the last few holes. Until that comes to pass, 
it's hard to make a comparison.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Well-Preserved Inca Mummies Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Archeologists have discovered three  
well-preserved Inca mummies high in the Andes Mountains, the 
National Geographic Society said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The three, relics of an Inca sacrificial ritual, were found  
beneath 5 feet of rock and earth on a burial platform atop 
Argentina's Mount Llullaillaco. The bodies of two girls and a boy 
may have been frozen since being placed there some 500 years ago, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Archeologist Johan Reinhard said in a statement that CT scans on  
the mummies showed all internal organs intact and blood appeared to 
still be present in the heart and lungs, as if the three had died 
only recently. 
</P>
<P>
	No cause of death was immediately evident, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The expedition included U.S., Argentine and Peruvian scientists  
and was supported by a grant from National Geographic. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said the burial platform held offerings to the  
Inca gods, including 35 gold, silver and shell statues, bundles or 
ornate textiles, moccasins and pottery, some of it still containing 
food. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the female mummies appeared to have been struck by  
lightning, the researchers said, while the others were undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
	The Inca empire once stretched 2,500 miles from present day  
Colombia to central Chile. It collapsed in 1532 with the Spanish 
conquest.

<HEADLINE> Doctors: Farrakhan Is Cancer-Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors for Nation of Islam leader Louis  
Farrakhan today proclaimed him cured of the prostate cancer for 
which he has been treated since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan was admitted to Howard University Hospital on an  
emergency basis last week and underwent surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul Alim Muhammad, health minister for the Nation of Islam,  
said Farrakhan's surgery was to correct an inflammation of his 
rectal wall, a side effect of eight years of treatment for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad and Alfred Goldson, who heads the radiology oncology  
department at Howard University Hospital, said a battery of tests 
on Farrakhan including bone scans and a test for prostate specific 
antigen (PSA) showed he is free of cancer.

<HEADLINE> Survey Links Freshmen, Conservatism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aside from the predictable bags of unwashed  
clothes and as yet-to-be-read books, this year's college freshmen 
may have also brought home some surprises for spring break: 
conservative views on casual sex, abortion and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	A comprehensive survey of this year's college freshmen finds a  
host of areas where young adults are taking decidedly different 
turns on issues than previous generations of students. From the 
lowest support ever for casual sex and keeping abortion legal, to 
questions of law and order and even their goals in life, the 
differences are sometimes wide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have members who are more conservative than their  
parents,'' says Chris Gillott, chairman of Pennsylvania State 
University's Young Americans for Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillott says some of his peers go home and ``come out of the  
conservative closet'' to their families, igniting heated 
discussions on topics from Social Security to affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	Young adults are looking for a return to religious or more  
traditional moral values after the legacy left by the baby boomers, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
	A few examples:  
</P>
<P>
	--Only 40 percent of freshmen agree that it's OK for two people  
who like each other to have sex, even if they have only known each 
other a short while. That's down from 42 percent in 1997, and an 
all-time high of 52 percent in 1987, according to the study by the 
Higher Education Research Institute at the University of 
California, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1970, 56 percent of the freshmen surveyed showed strong  
opposition to capital punishment. By 1998, less than a quarter of 
them believed the death penalty should be abolished. Seventy-three 
percent of freshmen said there is too much concern for criminals -- 
an almost 50 percent increase since the early 1970s when only about 
half of those surveyed felt that way. 
</P>
<P>
	--Only half of this year's freshmen backed efforts to keep  
abortion legal -- a record low figure after six years on the 
decline. Support for laws protecting abortion peaked in 1990 at 65 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have pro-choice students on our campus who still say they  
would never have an abortion,'' says Ryan Gruber, a senior at the 
University of Wisconsin, Madison, who used to head the school's 
college Republicans. ``Even if they don't want to push their 
message on others, there is less tolerance on a personal level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy Shalit, a 23-year-old author who lashes out against random  
college hookups and sexual encounters in her new book, says it's no 
surprise young adults are turning away from the values of the 
generations that preceded them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their parents are the ones who sort of believed in this  
liberation through promiscuity and experience,'' said Shalit, whose 
book, ``A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue,'' came 
out in January. But some kids today are ``embracing the codes of 
conduct that their own parents rejected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shalit pointed to the rise in ballroom dancing as one sign of  
how young adults are looking for new ways to relate to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Even views on the grand scheme of things can shift considerably  
in a few generations. Nearly three-quarters of the Class of 2002 
consider being well-off financially among their highest objectives. 
</P>
<P>
	Their parents had different goals when they were freshmen: In  
the late 1960s, more than 80 percent wanted to develop ``a 
meaningful philosophy of life.'' Today, only 40 percent of incoming 
college students find that objective compelling. 
</P>
<P>
	A record low 26 percent of freshmen believe that ``keeping up to  
date with political affairs'' is a very important or essential life 
goal. In 1966, interest in politics was at its height, with a 
record 58 percent of freshmen considering important in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	But some say these results don't necessarily signify apathy  
among today's students. Instead, activism and civic-mindedness may 
turn up in different forms, like volunteering and community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``These activities are political in the sense that they are  
trying to change the system we have,'' says Kendra Fox-Davis, a 
1998 UCLA college graduate who now is vice president of the U.S. 
Student Association in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	She added that while students today may not be as likely to  
demonstrate or march in protest like their parents, young adults 
are active on a host of issues from decreasing tuition to raising 
attention to sweatshop labor conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 freshmen norms are based on the responses of 275,811  
students at 469 of the nation's two- and four-year colleges and 
universities. Colleges were chosen to represent a cross-section of 
the student population nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA's research institute has conducted the survey annually  
since 1966.

<HEADLINE> China To Visit U.S for Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and Chinese negotiators are engaged in a  
down-to-the-wire push for an agreement to open China's vast market 
to American exports. But non-economic issues ranging from charges 
of nuclear espionage to human rights concerns may thwart a trade 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles  
today for the start of a nine-day American visit, would like to 
strike a deal that would pave the way for China to gain entry into 
the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration insists it will not accept an  
agreement that does not open Chinese markets to U.S. manufacturers 
and farmers. In addition to the economic concerns, the 
administration faces a tough sales campaign in a Congress upset 
over allegations of Chinese nuclear espionage and a new crackdown 
on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu, in an interview with Wall Street Journal executives  
distributed Monday, accused President Clinton of caving in to 
Congress and changing the standards for China's entry into the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the newspaper that Chinese concessions had brought a WTO  
agreement within reach, but ``due to pressure from the U.S. 
Congress, the U.S. government has shown a change in attitude.'' He 
called Washington's new demands ``unreasonable'' and said China is 
not inclined to make further concessions. ``Make no mistake,'' he 
said. ``China is not begging for accession to the WTO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries would like to have a tentative accord ready  
for Zhu's meeting with Clinton on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But administration officials insisted Monday the priority is to  
get an agreement that will open China's vast market, not one that 
simply meets the Thursday deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than looking at a calendar, we're going to look at the  
details of a deal and we're not going to take anything but a good 
deal,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration sees China's barriers to American exports as  
the chief cause for a record $57 billion trade deficit last year 
with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Cassidy, America's top negotiator on Chinese trade  
issues, was scheduled to resume discussions today with Long Yongtu, 
China's vice minister for trade. U.S. officials said Monday's 
opening session was devoted to a review of the gaps still existing 
between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	China has made a number of concessions in recent weeks in hopes  
of overcoming U.S. objections to its membership in the Geneva-based 
World Trade Organization which sets the rules for world trade. But 
that effort is coming at a time of serious strains in U.S.-Chinese 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Mastel, an economist at the Economic Strategy Institute, a  
Washington think tank, said tensions between the two countries are 
so great that China may achieve only a ``framework'' agreement 
where both sides would spell out areas of agreement and 
differences, and set a deadline for resolving those issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would in large part be a face-saving move ... if they can't  
finish the full package,'' said Mastel. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's visit comes at a time when the United States is upset over  
a Communist Party-ordered crackdown on Chinese trying to form a 
democratic party and allegations of Chinese espionage at U.S. 
nuclear labs. For their part, the Chinese are troubled by NATO's 
bombing of Yugoslavia, which China's government has condemned as a 
dangerous attack on international security. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart refused comment Monday on a published report that the  
chief of China's military intelligence secretly directed $300,000 
to Clinton's re-election campaign in 1996. He said the allegations 
were ``the subject of an on-going investigation at the Justice 
Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times said that former Democratic fund-raiser  
Johnny Chung had given an account to federal investigators of 
payments of $300,000 to the re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform  
and Oversight Committee, called on Clinton to insist China provide 
U.S. investigators bank records that ``would demonstrate the 
origins of the millions of dollars that flowed'' from China to the 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	And Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes declared:  
``If China continues to choose the path toward confrontation, 
instead of a fair and honest relationship, it must realize that 
everything, including trade, is at stake.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants China To Open Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and Chinese negotiators went back to work  
today in their down-to-the-wire push for an agreement to open 
China's vast market to American exports. While Chinese officials 
portrayed an agreement as close, U.S. officials insisted 
substantial differences remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Both countries are struggling to strike a deal that would pave  
the way for China to gain entry into the World Trade Organization, 
hoping an agreement can be announced on Thursday when Chinese 
Premier Zhu Rongji will meet with President Clinton at the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	In an indication that progress is being made, the discussions  
were extended into Wednesday. Chinese Vice Trade Minister Long 
Yongtu, the head of the Chinese delegation, told reporters late 
Monday that both sides were ``very close'' to a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jay Ziegler, chief spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative  
Charlene Barshefsky, was less optimistic, saying substantial 
differences remain in a number of areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu, the first Chinese premier to visit the United States in 15  
years, was scheduled to arrive later today in Los Angeles for the

<HEADLINE> Twin Suspects Appear in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HENDERSON, N.C. (AP) -- The mother of 11-year-old twins held  
their hands today as the boys appeared in court to face charges 
they killed their father and wounded their sister and the mother in 
a shooting rampage at their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Bawcum, her arm in a sling from the bullet wound she  
received Thursday night, at times appeared to ask the boys 
questions as she sat between her two sons, holding their hands. The 
boys, wearing identical blue, white and gray windbreakers, rarely 
looked at her. 
</P>
<P>
	William Harvey Bawcum Jr., 46, of Kittrell was shot to death  
last Thursday night while racing up the stairs of his home to his 
wife's aid. Mrs. Bawcum, 45, was wounded along with the Bawcums' 
16-year-old daughter, Robin. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys were appointed to represent the boys at today's  
hearing. The fifth-graders are charged as juveniles with 
first-degree murder and assault. Children under 13 cannot be tried 
as adults in North Carolina. If convicted, they could be sent to a 
juvenile facility until they are 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys have been held since last weekend at Dorothea Dix  
Hospital, a Raleigh mental hospital. Prosecutors want the boys' 
mental capacities evaluated, but the boys' attorneys objected 
today, and District Judge Claude Allen didn't rule on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Family friends said the shootings erupted after Mrs. Bawcum  
tried to take a hunting rifle she found on a bed in the boys' room. 
The Bawcums all were shot with a .38-caliber pistol, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police draped jackets over the boys' heads to shield them from  
photographers today as they came and went from the Vance County 
Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff R. Thomas Breedlove said Monday he wanted to interview  
the brothers but was waiting until attorneys were appointed for 
them, and he also planned to talk to the mother and sister.

<HEADLINE> McGregor Talks of 'Star Wars' Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Ewan McGregor says playing young Obi-Wan Kenobi in  
the new ``Star Wars'' movie wasn't all swords and special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the filming was ``the epitome of tedium,'' the  
28-year-old Scottish actor said in Tuesday's Express. 
</P>
<P>
	``The work was so complex with all the special effects and stuff  
that I found myself hanging around for days,'' he said. ``I was 
frowning a lot. It became just a frowning exercise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The George Lucas-directed movie, ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The  
Phantom Menace,'' is the first installment in the much-anticipated 
three-part prequel to the blockbuster space trilogy. It comes out 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Boredom didn't stop McGregor from signing up for the two other  
``Star Wars'' movies, which are to be completed by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'm just an actor who can't say no. Besides, there's  
nothing cooler than being a Jedi knight,'' he said.

Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. said. Armstrong, fiercely 
protective of his privacy in recent years, relented after McLane 
explained the historic significance of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be club's 35th and final season in the Astrodome, the  
world's first indoor stadium. Next April, the Astros will move into 
a new retractable-roof ballpark downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting as de facto spokesman for Armstrong, who rarely does  
interviews, McLane said Armstrong was a fixture at Colt .45s and 
Astros games when he lived in the area for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loved living in Houston. He had such a great experience  
living here,'' said McLane, who was host to the Ohio native in his 
field-level box. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was escorted onto the field by Jimmy Wynn and Bob  
Aspromonte, members of the 1965 Astros. About 70 current astronauts 
lined both baselines while Armstrong waved twice to a standing 
ovation and delivered a one-hop pitch to Craig Biggio. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong will mark the 30th anniversary of his landmark moon  
walk July 20.

<HEADLINE> Shareholders OK Astra-Zeneca Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Shareholders in Swedish drug-maker  
Astra have approved a merger with Britain's Zeneca, completing the 
moves to create one of the world's largest pharmaceutical 
companies, Astra and Zeneca said in a joint announcement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A small bloc of Astra shareholders had been skeptical of the  
merger plans, which were announced in December. But the companies 
said the merger was accepted by shareholders with 96 percent of 
Astra's capital and votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said the redenomination of Zeneca's share capital  
into dollars was completed on Monday and the name of the group was 
changed to AstraZeneca PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	AstraZeneca's headquarters will be in London, with research and  
development operations in Sweden. The company is expected have 
annual sales of about $11.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Astra's ulcer and heartburn medication Prilosec is the world's  
best-selling prescription drug. Zeneca is the second-leading maker 
of cancer drugs behind Bristol-Myers Squibb of the United States. 
It also has a large agrochemical business and owns Salick Health 
Care, a U.S. operator of cancer treatment and dialysis centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Commenting on the formation of the new pharmaceutical group Tom  
McKillop, chief executive of AstraZeneca, said: 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm determined that the energy, thoroughness and cooperation  
which has enabled the new company to be created in such good time 
will now be devoted to ensuring that AstraZeneca builds further on 
its excellent platform for growth.''

<HEADLINE> Economic Indicators Rise Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While the numbers weren't as strong as the past  
two years, a key indicator of future economic growth suggests the 
country will continue to thrive at least through the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose for the fifth  
straight month in February, the Conference Board, reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising consumer expectations and a drop in first-time claims for  
jobless benefits were among factors pushing the index up 0.2 
percent in February, in line with economists' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the fifth consecutive increase in the leading index  
but it shows less breadth than usual with only four of 10 
components rising in February,'' said Michael Boldin, director of 
business cycle research at the business-financed private research 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	A drop in orders from manufacturers held the index down.  
</P>
<P>
	The index is designed to forecast economic activity six to nine  
months in advance. The Conference Board also reported that the 
coincident indicators, which measure current activity, rose 0.3 
percent and the lagging index, which measures the economy's past 
performance, rose 0.2 percent in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Taken together, the board said the three index components show a  
healthy economy and an economic expansion that will continue 
through at least late 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is consistent with the view that the economy is  
continuing to expand,'' said Michael Moran, chief economist at 
Daiwa Securities America. ``The signal that you get from this 
measure is no turning point in the economy is at hand and that is 
good news for investors and good for the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The figures had little impact on Wall Street, where the Dow  
Jones industrial average retreated from Monday's record and dropped 
back below 10,000. The Dow fell 43.84 to close at 9,963.49, but the 
Nasdaq composite index climbed to a second straight record close. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Porter, senior economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities of  
Chicago, said the index was reflecting a trend in an economy that 
now is in the ninth year of an expansion. ``We're not as strong as 
1997 and 1998, but its still a solid performance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the rise in the coincident index indicates the  
Gross Domestic Product expanded at an annual rate of 3 percent in 
the first quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading index increased 0.5 percent in January and increased  
0.2 percent in December. During the six months ended in February, 
the leading index rose 1.4 percent and eight of the 10 components 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading indicators are calculated from a base of 100, set in  
1992. First calculated in the late 1960s, it is periodically 
fine-tuned and figures from past years are revised.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom May Purchase Nextel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc., the nation's second-biggest  
long-distance phone company, is in preliminary talks about 
acquiring wireless phone service provider Nextel Communications 
Inc., The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the two phone companies have yet to reach  
agreements on key terms that include price, however, and said some 
people involved in the talks put the odds that a deal will be 
reached at no more than 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper cited unidentified people familiar with the  
matter. It said the companies declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie DePeau, a spokeswoman for MCI WorldCom, said this morning  
her company ``doesn't comment on rumor or speculation.'' Nextel 
spokesman Ben Banta said ``we have no comment'' on the report. 
</P>
<P>
	On the takeover speculation, Nextel stock was up 37 1/2 cents at  
$40 a share at midday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, where MCI 
WorldCom was down $3.37 1/2, or by 3.6 percent, at $89.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Nextel, based in McLean, Va., has been considered a likely  
takeover target, especially since it will be the last independent 
U.S. wireless company once the pending $56 billion pact between 
Airtouch Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group PLC is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, which is based in Jackson, Miss., doesn't own any  
wireless operations although its biggest rival, AT&AMP;T Corp., has a 
growing wireless businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Nextel has a current stock-market value of nearly $11 billion  
and long-term debt of $7.7 billion. Its major shareholders include 
billionaire Craig McCaw, whose family made a major investment in 
Nextel in 1995 and who together now hold a roughly 20 percent 
stake.

<HEADLINE> Five Bodies Found in Missouri Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A man arrested Tuesday in the death of  
one of five men whose decomposing bodies were found in his home had 
left behind a handwritten card listing the names of the dead and 
how they could be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty clear ... that that list was left so that whoever  
found the bodies would be able to know who the victims were and be 
able to address the matter in a rational manner,'' prosecutor Bob 
Beaird said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Beach, a 56-year-old limousine driver, was charged late  
Monday with first-degree murder in one of the killings. He was 
jailed without bond and scheduled for arraignment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He is accused in the death of his step-nephew, 45-year-old  
Kenneth Gulley, who was shot in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaird would not say how the other men died or why Beach was  
charged with Gulley's death and not the others. 
</P>
<P>
	All five men had been dead for days. Neighbors reported hearing  
gunshots from inside the home early Friday morning and said the 
home's air conditioner ran nonstop since then in what police 
believe was an attempt to slow decomposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Beach was captured without a struggle Tuesday morning at a hotel  
parking lot just five blocks from the crime scene. He called 
relatives to let them know his whereabouts -- knowing they would 
alert police, Sgt. Dave Bernard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beach even made calls to the department's robbery unit and tips  
hotline. Bernard would not say what Beach said in those calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Beach and all five victims worked in the taxi and limousine  
business. Police have not said why the believe the killings 
happened.

<HEADLINE> Vaughn Leaves Game After Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Mo Vaughn, signed to an $80 million  
contract by the Anaheim Angels in the offseason, sprained his left 
ankle tumbling into the dugout and left Tuesday night's opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn hurt himself in the first inning. Limping, he was finally  
replaced after the fifth and taken for precautionary X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn chased a foul popup by Omar Vizquel, the second batter of  
the game, into the Cleveland dugout. The first baseman jumped down 
over the steps, landed awkwardly. 
</P>
<P>
	He remained in the game, but limped noticeably, particularly  
when he ran. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians also had a player leave the game early. Left fielder  
David Justice was replaced after two innings because of a strained 
left calf.

<HEADLINE> Pay to Tobacco Farmers May Be Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Tobacco farmers and allotment owners may  
have to wait until the Christmas holidays before they receive their 
first payments from a $5.15 billion trust fund bankrolled by 
cigarette companies. 
</P>
<P>
	A memo from cigarette industry attorney Phil Carlton, obtained  
by The News &AMP; Observer of Raleigh, warns that it will be the end of 
the year before the national trust fund can be set up and start 
distributing money. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo was sent to tobacco state politicians, including North  
Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt and Attorney General Mike Easley. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt and several others who negotiated the trust fund deal in  
January had predicted the money could be available as early as this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlton blamed the delay on cash flow problems.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even tobacco companies have cash flow problems, especially  
these days,'' Carlton said. ``It is best for everyone involved to 
start thinking of this money as a Christmas gift this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trust fund is in addition to a $206 billion legal settlement  
reached last November between cigarette makers and 46 states that 
sued to recover their Medicaid costs for treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust fund will be overseen by a board of trustees to be  
established in each of the 12 tobacco-growing states included in 
the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Allotments, which are basically annual licenses to grow a  
certain amount of tobacco, have been cut by more than a third over 
the last two years because of dwindling demand and abundant 
supplies of the crop.

<HEADLINE> Source: Snyder New Mizzou Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Quin Snyder, the top assistant to Mike Krzyzewski at Duke for  
the past four years, has been selected as the new coach at 
Missouri, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to Snyder, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Tuesday night that the 32-year-old former Duke point guard had 
agreed to take the job after meeting with Missouri officials 
earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The school has called a news conference for Wednesday morning to  
name the replacement for Norm Stewart, who retired suddenly last 
Thursday after 32 years at Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder met with Missouri athletic director Mike Alden in Detroit  
last Friday. The source said the two met again Tuesday in Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, a native of the Pacific Northwest, played at Duke from  
1986-89 and the Blue Devils went to the Final Four in 1986, 1988 
and 1989. He is third on school's career assist list with 575. 
</P>
<P>
	He was given a lot of credit for the developement of sophomore  
point guard William Avery, who led the Blue Devils to a 37-2 record 
and into the national championship game this season. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Alden on Friday, Snyder said he was not  
entertaining other offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just say I was very impressed with Missouri,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Snyder emerged as the leading candidate after former New Jersey  
Nets coach John Calipari took himself out of the running. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa coach Bill Self also said Tuesday evening that he had  
withdrawn his name from consideration. Missouri assistant Kim 
Anderson was left as the only other candidate besides Snyder to be 
interviewed by Alden. 
</P>
<P>
	Alden has said he wants to move quickly in signing a coach.  
Wednesday is the first day of the late signing period and it 
continues through May 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari, who led Massachusetts to the Final Four in 1996, was  
fired by the Nets on March 15 after the team started the season 
3-17. He removed his name from consideration after talking with 
Alden and others on Saturday while visiting in-laws in Osceola, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari's agent, Craig Fenech, said Missouri officials had  
offered Calipari the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He considered it pretty seriously but decided it wasn't the  
right fit for him at the time,'' Fenech said Tuesday. ``In the end, 
he just wasn't prepared to pull the trigger. He doesn't know what 
he wants to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Self said he made the decision to withdraw after meeting earlier  
Tuesday with Missouri officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm flattered by Missouri's interest in me,'' he said. ``I  
believe that the Missouri coaching position is a good one and I 
felt that I had to explore it for the welfare of my family. 
However, when it comes right down to it, the University of Tulsa is 
where I want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Self has been coach at Tulsa for two seasons and has a 42-22  
record. His team defeated No. 16 College of Charleston in the first 
round of the NCAA tournament before losing to Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Self previously coached for four seasons at Oral Roberts in  
Tulsa.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Turn Lower; Dow Down 39.96 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned lower Tuesday as an earnings  
warning from Gillette put the brakes on Monday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 39.96 at 9,967.37. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed after trading lower through  
much of the morning. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 1.51 at 
1,322.63, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 
7.73 at 2,567.79. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Dow rose 174.82 points to close at 10,007.33, a  
new record that marked the index's second finish above 10,000. The 
Nasdaq and S&AMP;P 500 indexes also set new records, sustained by a 
rally in Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette, which said first-quarter profits will probably not  
meet Wall Street analysts' expectations, fell 6 13/16 today to 50 
15/16. The company's announcement sobered traders who had bid 
stocks higher Monday on expectations of strong first-quarter 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette's news also hurt other consumer products companies.  
Procter &AMP; Gamble, a component of the Dow, fell 1 1/2 to 99 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM rose today as the company unveiled a new version of its Web  
server, which allows companies to provide faster service on the 
Internet. IBM was up 1 3/16 at 185 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! was providing the Nasdaq Stock Market a boost today as  
traders sent its shares higher in advance of its earning report, 
due Wednesday. Many analysts believe the Web search engine company 
will surpass a First Call consensus estimate of 8 cents per share. 
Its shares were up 12 1/8 at 231 1/4 after rising 39 3/16 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers today by an 11-to-8  
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 341.5 
million shares, slightly ahead of Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was off 1.98 at 612.65, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.64 at 717.60.

<HEADLINE> Rain Makes Rocket's Debut a Washout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Roger Clemens kicked the mound in disgust  
with his right foot. Tony Phillips' homer had just destroyed his 
aura of invincibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Two innings later, Clemens headed to the dugout to watch his new  
team lose a soggy season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens was nearly unhittable for the first 4 2-3 innings of his  
debut with the New York Yankees on Monday night against the Oakland 
Athletics, despite a 47-minute rain delay between the second and 
third innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to extend the 15-game winning streak with which he closed  
last season for the Toronto Blue Jays, Clemens had allowed only a 
drag bunt single by Jason McDonald in the third inning and had 
struck out seven of the 17 batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
	But, after walking Miguel Tejada on a full count with two outs  
in the fifth, Clemens gave up Phillips' game-tying shot to right 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little quick on my slide step,'' Clemens said. ``He's  
got that zone down where he's very dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Jeter's 410-foot homer to center field in the top of the  
seventh put the Yankees ahead 3-2 and gave Clemens another chance 
for the win, but again the five-time Cy Young Award winner could 
not hold the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	With one out in the bottom of the seventh, Clemens walked  
Phillips and was taken out of the game after throwing 107 pitches. 
The bullpen then blew Clemens' chance for a win, as well as the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Giambi's run-scoring groundout off Mike Stanton tied the  
game 3-3 and Matt Stairs followed with an RBI single off loser 
Stanton. John Jaha then doubled off Jeff Nelson to drive in 
Oakland's fifth run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony got us going,'' Giambi said. ``(Clemens) was dealing and  
it was tough, but Tony kind of broke the string. That kind of put a 
light at the end of the tunnel for us when it was kind of getting 
dim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game finally ended at 12:27 a.m. PDT after a second rain  
delay of 1 hour, 21 minutes that prevented the Yankees from batting 
in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, traded to the Yankees in February by the Blue Jays,  
struck out eight and walked five while allowing four hits in his 
debut for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very excited to take the mound,'' he said. ``I'm pretty  
jacked up for every start. But taking the field with these guys is 
very special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens remained two short of the AL record of 17 consecutive  
wins shared by Dave McNally of the Baltimore Orioles in 1968-69 and 
Johnny Allen of the Cleveland Indians in 1936-37. The major league 
record is 24 by Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants in 1936-37. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen anybody so high to win a ball game as Clemens  
was in the dugout for the first inning,'' said Yankees interim 
manager Don Zimmer, a Red Sox coach during part of Clemens' 13-year 
tenure in Boston. ``He was like a wild lion. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the game started, he looked like he was pitching for a  
World Series win. He's some competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees left the bases loaded in the first two innings  
against Oakland starter Gil Heredia, a late opening day replacement 
for injured Kenny Rogers, scoring just one run. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get a base hit in the first or second inning with the  
bases loaded, I think that's enough for Clemens,'' Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clemens started 5-6 with a 3.50 ERA, but did not lose  
again after May 29. He went 15-0 with a 2.29 ERA the rest of the 
season, winning his second straight Cy Young Award while leading 
the AL in wins, ERA and strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he was disappointed about walking five batters, Clemens  
said he was relatively satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering the conditions out there, I felt good,'' he said.  
``I felt strong. I felt I was able to channel my emotions. I was 
happy with that.''

<HEADLINE>  Richardson To Stay at DePaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Quentin Richardson says the NBA can wait.  
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, Conference USA's player of the year as a freshman,  
is returning to DePaul for at least one more season. 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates are relieved, his coach is pleased, the family  
that was mostly responsible for his decision is at peace, and 
Richardson is now a happy 18-year-old who can still some day make a 
big payday in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was basically a decision on whether I needed to be able to  
take care of my family,'' a smiling Richardson said at a news 
conference Monday. ``I asked them were we hurting that bad? My 
father, my sister and my step mom all said, `No, they would be 
fine, it could wait.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's father, Lee, has worked as a motorman with the  
Chicago Transit Authority for 32 years. At age 56 he wasn't ready 
to retire and he wanted his son to work on his education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always told him I wanted him to stay in school,'' Lee  
Richardson said. ``He has always told me that he wanted me to 
retire, but I told him `Hey, I'll be all right.' If he left it up 
to me, I'd want him to do all four. All four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DePaul coach Pat Kennedy and Richardson's sister, Rochelle,  
talked with several NBA general managers and scouts, seeking input 
to gauge where Richardson might be taken if he declared for the 
draft this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson was projected as a middle to late first-round pick  
where he could probably get a salary of about $900,000. Most 
advised staying in school to work on his game and improve his draft 
positioning. That could, in turn, bring a larger contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to give him the chance to sit down and weigh out  
whether he was really prepared to do this. We wanted him to be at 
the top of his game when he does it,'' Rochelle Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a financial hardship. We just wanted to do what is  
best for him, as well as academically and as a business decision. 
It was not a good idea to let him get out and get locked into a 
contract and not get the (playing) time that would be advantageous 
to his future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's decision will certainly help DePaul as it tries to  
rebuild a national reputation. His return should mean more 
victories, more fans in the stands and more publicity that will aid 
recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy had a rooting interest in Richardson returning, but made  
sure he obtained all the information and then let his young star 
make the decision. He wasn't told of Richardson's decision until 
right before it was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's maybe even bigger than when he said he was first coming  
here,'' said Kennedy, who landed Richardson as a recruit right 
after it appeared he was headed to Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, at 6-foot-5, played mostly small forward last season  
and will need to move his game to the perimeter as an off-guard, 
where he would probably play in the NBA. He averaged 18.9 points 
and 10.5 rebounds, using his jumping quickness, long arms and 
uncanny sense of timing to scrap on the boards with bigger players. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, chosen the nation's top freshman last year by the  
U.S. Basketball Writers Association, The Sporting News and 
Basketball News, will acquire an insurance policy against injury 
this season, his sister said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most disappointing aspect of Richardson's first season at  
DePaul was the Blue Demons' failure to make the NCAA tournament. 
Led by fellow freshmen and Chicago prep stars Bobby Simmons and 
Lance Williams, DePaul had to settle for the NIT, where a 
first-round win over Northwestern was the school's first victory in 
the postseason since 1990. The Blue Demons (18-13) were eliminated 
in the second round by eventual NIT champ California. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who attended the news conference, was glad to have his  
friend and teammate back for another season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was playing with me, telling me he was coming back and then  
telling me he was going. Now we have a chance to have a great 
team,'' Williams said.

<HEADLINE>  Richardson To Stay at DePaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Quentin Richardson says the NBA can wait.  
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, Conference USA's player of the year as a freshman,  
is returning to DePaul for at least one more season. 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates are relieved, his coach is pleased, the family  
that was mostly responsible for his decision is at peace, and 
Richardson is now a happy 18-year-old who can still some day make a 
big payday in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was basically a decision on whether I needed to be able to  
take care of my family,'' a smiling Richardson said at a news 
conference Monday. ``I asked them were we hurting that bad? My 
father, my sister and my step mom all said, `No, they would be 
fine, it could wait.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's father, Lee, has worked as a motorman with the  
Chicago Transit Authority for 32 years. At age 56 he wasn't ready 
to retire and he wanted his son to work on his education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always told him I wanted him to stay in school,'' Lee  
Richardson said. ``He has always told me that he wanted me to 
retire, but I told him `Hey, I'll be all right.' If he left it up 
to me, I'd want him to do all four. All four years.''

<HEADLINE> Switched-Baby Mom May Sue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENA VISTA, Va. (AP) -- Paula Johnson, the mother of one of the  
3-year-old girls switched at birth, will sue for custody of her 
biological daughter and also wants to keep the other girl, whom she 
is raising, her lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paula is going to assert her constitutional right to raise her  
own child,'' attorney John Blakely said. ``We are going to file a 
petition to obtain full custody as soon as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson also will appeal a judge's approval Monday of the $2  
million settlement between the state and the families who are 
raising her biological daughter, Rebecca Chittum, the attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the agreement provides money for the grandparents who  
share custody of Rebecca. Blakely told Circuit Judge Thomas Wood 
the settlement was insufficient and that at least $1 million should 
go solely to the child. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason to divert any of this money away from this  
child to the grandparents,'' Blakely said. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would come from the state, which runs the University  
of Virginia Medical Center, where Rebecca Chittum and Callie Conley 
were switched in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson took the real Rebecca home, believing she was her  
daughter Callie Conley, and the girl has been known as Callie 
Conley ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the real Callie went home with Kevin Chittum and  
Whitney Rogers, and has been known as Rebecca Chittum ever since. 
The couple died in a car crash last July 4, around the time the 
switch was discovered. Rebecca is being raised by the parents of 
Chittum and Ms. Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Blakely said Ms. Johnson plans to maintain custody of Callie.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is no constitutionally protected right of grandparents  
to have custody of grandchildren,'' he said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the switch was never determined.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Blakely had set the stage for a challenge to  
Rebecca's custodial grandparents, but said Ms. Johnson had made no 
firm decision on whether to seek custody of her biological 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The natural mother has a God-given right to raise her child  
and is the natural custodian of her own child,'' Blakely told Wood. 
``They have no blood relationship to Rebecca.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over how much money the two children and their  
families deserve for the mix-up has ruined an informal custody and 
visitation agreement. Visitations have ended, and feelings between 
the two families have soured. 
</P>
<P>
	``If your child were in the care of someone else,'' Blakely told  
the newspaper, ``and you saw some of the money that you think 
should be going to your child going to people to whom it doesn't 
belong, you'd be upset and wonder whether or not something should 
be done about the placement of that child.''

<HEADLINE> Intel Pushing for Home Networking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Computer chip giant Intel Corp., is marketing a  
new gadget that easily allows consumers to create their own home 
computer network. 
</P>
<P>
	The $190 AnyPoint Home Network lets users of different machines  
share files, use the same printer and access the Internet through 
one account over existing phone lines. It plugs into the outside of 
the computer, easier to install than other products that require 
consumers to open up their machines. 
</P>
<P>
	While a handful of manufacturers already sell such equipment at  
CompUSA and other computer stores, the marketing push launched 
Tuesday by the world's largest maker of computer microprocessors 
could lure mainstream consumers to the product, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their marketing might and support of this will help drive the  
customer to look for it and consider it,'' said Aaron Goldberg of 
ZD Market Intelligence, a high-tech research firm. ``The big thing 
is to get the customers over the hurdle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only a small fraction of U.S. households link their  
computers into networks. But that should rise as consumers buy more 
than one PC -- up from 12.4 percent of homes at the end of last year 
to an estimated 17 percent by the end of 1999, according to the 
Yankee Group research firm. Also driving the trend is a rapid 
growth in high-speed Internet access, through phone and cable-TV 
lines, which encourages people to link their computers into 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to CompUSA, Intel's product will be offered by  
computer makers Gateway and IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's initiative is part of a company drive to stimulate new  
uses for computers, key to generating demand for its more powerful 
microprocessors. The urgency for Intel has intensified amid a sharp 
drop in computer prices that threatens to shift Intel's sales to 
its least profitable chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel chairman Andy Grove said the idea is to encourage  
consumers to buy a more powerful computer as the ``base station'' 
for their home, able to run more demanding applications and easily 
communicate with less powerful machines in other rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumers may balk at paying a higher price for the  
convenience of easy installation, some say. The AnyPoint product is 
nearly twice as expensive than some other offerings that also work 
through phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty cheap to network your home if you know what you're  
doing,'' said David Goldstein, president of Channel Marketing 
Corp., a research and consultant firm.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Output on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq's production of crude oil is  
approaching its pre-1991 Gulf War level, an Oil Ministry official 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement to the official Iraqi News Agency, the director  
of planning at the Oil Ministry, Faleh al-Khaiat, said that Iraq is 
now producing 2.6 million barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq produced about 3 million barrels per day before it invaded  
Kuwait in August 1990, a move that led to U.N. trade sanctions and 
the 1991 Gulf War that caused extensive damage to its oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Iraq is currently exporting a little over 2 million barrels  
per day. Added to that is the domestic use of oil and the quantity 
sold to Jordan under special arrangements, (so) the total 
production of crude oil is 2.6 million barrels per day,'' al-Khaiat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Khaiat did not explain the rise in output, but it is believed  
to be due to the arrival of spare parts with which Iraq has been 
repairing its oil infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	He complained that Iraq has received only $10.5 million dollars  
worth of the spare parts ordered during the fourth phase of the 
oil-for-food program, which ended in November 1998. That represents 
just 25 of the 750 orders worth $300 million that the government 
had made. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil-for-food program allows Iraq to sell $5.2 billion worth  
of crude oil every six months on condition that Iraq uses the 
proceeds to buy food, medicine and humanitarian supplies for its 22 
million people. Spare parts for the oil industry are also 
permitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Khaiat accused the U.S. and British representatives on the  
U.N. sanctions committee of ``inventing baseless excuses'' to stall 
the remaining contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Britain say they withhold approval of  
equipment that could have a military use.

	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Claims for unemployment benefits in Spain  
fell to 10.78 percent of the workforce in March from 10.94 percent

	March's jobless rate was the lowest since December 1981, the  
government said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry's rate is one of two used to measure unemployment  
in Spain. Analysts, however, tend to watch the National Statistics 
Institute's quarterly unemployment survey more closely because it 
covers everyone who is out of work, not just those eligible for 
unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the institute, the unemployment rate stood at 18.17  
percent in the fourth quarter of 1998, down from 18.55 percent in 
the third quarter. Spain has the highest unemployment rate in the 
European Union.

<HEADLINE>  Road Cyclist Now King of Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Alison Dunlap would love to be a biology professor. If only  
bicycles didn't keep getting in her way. 
</P>
<P>
	At the relatively ancient age of 30, Dunlap is on her second  
life as a bike racer. A member of the U.S. Olympic road-race team 
at the 1996 Games and a bronze medalist at the 1994 world 
championships, she now is at the top of the World Cup mountain bike 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	After two victories and a runner-up finish in March, Dunlap  
heads Down Under this week for races on the hills outside Sydney 
where the 2000 Olympic mountain bike medals will be decided. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she would like to race both on and off the road at next  
year's Summer Games, Dunlap is focused on the sturdy bikes with the 
fat knobby tires that splash through mud and zoom between rocks and 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love mountain biking,'' she said. ``There's no cheating and  
no hiding, like there can be with road racing. We're all out on our 
own. The strongest rider almost always wins the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Dunlap has been by far the strongest rider.  
</P>
<P>
	She won a mountain bike stage race in Monterey, Calif., then  
took the first World Cup race of the season in Napa, Calif., 
winning by 20 seconds over Gunn Rita Dahle of Norway. Dunlap and 
Dahle are 1-2 in the women's standings going into the Sydney races 
Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunlap also has kept pace on the roads, winning one stage and  
finishing second overall in the Redlands Bicycle Classic last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	All this came about because Dunlap wasn't good enough to play  
college soccer. The last player cut from the Colorado College team 
as a freshman, Dunlap stopped by a campus cycling club meeting and 
was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time she graduated in 1991 with a degree in biology,  
Dunlap had won two national college road championships. She joined 
the national team program, won a World Cup race in Okinawa, Japan, 
in 1995 and finished in the middle of the 58-rider pack in the '96 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking for a change but not ready to retire from racing, she  
switched to mountain bikes and won a World Cup title in Budapest, 
Hungary, in April 1997 in only her fourth race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The switch (to mountain biking) wasn't hard, but it was kind  
of scary,'' Dunlap said. ``All of a sudden there were new sponsors 
and people on the team. I didn't know what to expect. But I told 
myself, `If I can do road racing, I can do this.' It has worked out 
very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trip to Sydney will help Dunlap's preparations for the  
Olympics, letting her experience the bumps and hollows of the 
Olympic course and giving her confidence once she switches her 
focus to the games next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, it might be retirement and that long-held goal of a  
biology professorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the 2001 world championships are in Vail (Colo.),'' she  
said. ``It would be awfully hard to pass that up.''

<HEADLINE> How the Earnings Test Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	President Clinton and Republicans in Congress are contemplating  
eliminating Social Security penalties for people ages 65 to 69 who 
earn income from work. How the penalty, known as the earnings test, 
currently works: 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	For people ages 65 and over:  
</P>
<P>
	Retirement benefits are reduced by $1 for every $3 of income  
earned from work above $15,500 a year in 1999. Investment income is 
not counted. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a senior citizen entitled to the current average  
Social Security benefit -- $9,360 a year -- who earned $20,000 a year 
from work would lose $1,500 in Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The $15,500 earnings limit that triggers the penalty is  
scheduled to rise to $17,000 in 2000, to $25,000 in 2001 and to 
$30,000 in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to get compensation -- called delayed retirement credits  
-- for the lost benefits, a person must forego their entire Social 
Security check during each month worked. Once he or she stops 
earning above the limit -- or reaches age 70, when the penalty no 
longer applies -- Social Security checks are increased, to take 
account of each month worked, at a current rate of 5.5 percent per 
year worked. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the average Social Security benefit now is $780 a  
month. Senior citizens who forfeit those checks entirely starting 
at age 65 in 1999 until age 70 in 2004 would, upon their 70th 
birthdays, draw benefits of about $995 a month -- a 5.5 percent 
increase for each of the five years of lost checks -- for the rest 
of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The delayed retirement credit is scheduled to rise incrementally  
until it reaches 8 percent a year for workers born in 1943 and 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	For people ages 62 to 64 who take Social Security's early  
retirement option: 
</P>
<P>
	Benefits are reduced by $1 for every $2 earned above $9,600 a  
year in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Even partial loss of benefits entitles a person to compensation  
later. But it is not available until the person's 65th birthday, 
even if work stops sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Most proposals to eliminate the earnings test penalty do not  
include this age group.

<HEADLINE>  Bombed Yugoslav Town a Grisly Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEKSINAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Search teams dug through a row of  
bombed-out apartment buildings Tuesday, pushing aside twisted 
steel, chunks of concrete and splintered wood in hopes of finding 
survivors of a NATO airstrike that obliterated the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The overnight attack killed 12 people in Aleksinac, a mining  
town of 17,000 people, the official Tanjug news agency reported. 
Dozens of others were wounded in the raid, Serbian television said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the worst single report of civilian casualties since NATO  
airstrikes began March 24. The town is located 100 miles south of 
Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Two corpses, pools of blood and parts of dismembered bodies lay  
Tuesday among crumbled heaps of corrugated steel and seared brick. 
Bewildered residents picked through debris to recover belongings. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke curled from a home along a residential street that caught  
fire during the raid. Bricks, boards and roof tiles were strewn 
about, some thrown up to 200 yards by the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	At the entrance of the local hospital, Dr. Bratislav  
Miladinovic, appeared dazed and in shock. He was on duty at the 
time of the strike, and only later learned that it killed his 
sister and father. His wife and child were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, NATO said the strike had been aimed at a  
nearby military post housing an artillery brigade, and that it was 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Air Commodore David Wilby of Britain said it was possible  
that one of the weapons ``fell short'' due to a guidance system 
fault, incoming fire or another cause and that ``any unintended 
damage'' was ``very much regretted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic, who visited the site  
Tuesday, accused NATO of ``genocide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Since there are no military targets nearby, the objective of  
the criminal aggressors is evident -- to kill Serb civilians,'' 
Marjanovic said.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Salaries Up 19 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball salaries are going up twice as fast as  
ticket prices, with the biggest escalation in seven years pushing 
the average above $1.7 million on opening day, according to a study 
by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore outfielder Albert Belle was the highest-paid player on  
opening day for the third straight season, earning $11,949,794. 
Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez was second at $11 million, followed 
by Los Angeles pitcher Kevin Brown ($10,714,286) and Atlanta 
pitcher Greg Maddux ($10.6 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire, last season's star with a record 70 homers, was  
11th at $8,333,333. Sammy Sosa, who chased McGwire all summer long 
and finished with 66 homers, was tied for ninth at $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19.3 percent increase, the largest since a 21.7 percent rise  
prior to the 1992 season, pushed the average to a record $1,720,050 
from $1,441,406 at the start of last season, according to the AP 
study, which examined the contracts of 830 players on opening-day 
rosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaries rose just 4.2 percent rise prior to last season. With  
an increase of 16.3 percent next year, the average would top $2 
million for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price of a ticket increased 9.7 percent this year,  
from $13.59 to $14.91. In comparison, the Consumer Price Index has 
gone up 1.0 percent in the last year. And while the CPI has gone up 
18.7 percent since 1991, baseball ticket prices have soared 72.6 
percent and salaries rocketed up 193 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series champion New York Yankees opened with  
baseball's highest payroll ever, $85.1 million -- an average of 
$3.04 million per player. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles was second at $79.2 million, followed by Baltimore  
($78.5 million), Texas ($74.9 million), Atlanta ($73.5 million) and 
Cleveland ($68.9 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona moved up from 21st at $31.6 million at the end of last  
season to seventh at $65.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end were three teams below $20 million: Montreal  
was last at $17.3 million, Florida was 29th at $18.8 million and 
Minnesota was 28th at $19.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been going through all those over the past few months,  
but I want to see the final numbers before I make any judgments,'' 
commissioner Bud Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, the NBA's average is about $2.8 million this  
season, the NHL's is $1.17 million (using a mixture of U.S. and 
Canadian dollars), and the NFL's is $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	An indication of why small and middle markets no longer can  
compete can be seen at the top of the salary scale. The number of 
players earning $8 million or higher more than doubled from 10 to 
23, while the total at $9 million or more tripled from three to 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of players at $1 million or more rose from 317 to 348  
and the percentage of millionaires in the majors rose from 37.7 
percent to 41.9. The number at $2 million or higher rose from 216 
to 254, and $4 million players shot up from 98 to 128. The $5 
million club swelled from 63 to 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles and the New York Mets each had the most millionaires  
at 18, with Baltimore, Boston and the New York Yankees at 17. 
Florida had the fewest with four, the Chicago White Sox had five, 
and Kansas City, Minnesota and Montreal had six each. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap between the top and bottom decreased somewhat this year.  
The Yankees' payroll was 5 1/2 times that of Montreal; last year, when 
Baltimore had the highest payroll, the Orioles' spent 7 1/2 times more 
than the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	Total payroll rose from $1.21 billion to $1.43 billion. The  
median salary -- the point at which an equal number of players are 
above and below -- rose from $500,000 to a record $700,000. It 
dropped to $275,000 in 1995 following the end of the 7 1/2-month 
strike before resuming its rise. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 68 players at the $200,000 minimum, which is higher  
than the average prior to 1982. Last year, there were 66 at the 
minimum -- then $170,000 -- on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	In reality, the amount the Yankees are spending on players this  
year is more than $91.4 million because their payroll doesn't 
include the $2.5 million salary of Darryl Strawberry, who is on a 
minor league roster; $2.5 million they are paying toward the salary 
of Oakland pitcher Kenny Rogers; $500,000 they are paying Minnesota 
as part of last year's Chuck Knoblauch trade; $800,000 they are 
paying released infielder Dale Sveum; plus money they are paying 
Arizona as part of last month's Darren Holmes trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The listed salary includes a player's 1999 salary plus a  
prorated share of any signing bonus or guaranteed income not 
attributed to a specific year. Contract figures were obtained by 
the AP from various player and management sources. 
</P>
<P>
	A different method of calculation is used by baseball to  
determine the luxury tax. That method, which uses the average 
annual value of contracts and is based on 40-man rosters, has the 
Dodgers with the highest payroll, followed by the Orioles and 
Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Ford Sets March Sales Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With record-breaking demand for its pickups and  
sport utility vehicles, Ford Motor Co. took advantage of Americans' 
love affair with trucks to post its best March ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2 automaker reported Tuesday that its U.S. sales were up  
14 percent in March over the same month a year ago, based on the 
daily sales rate. Ford broke a long list of company records, led by 
its strongest monthly sales of light trucks ever. 
</P>
<P>
	March sales of F-series pickups, the nation's top-selling  
vehicle for 17 years, were the highest for any car or truck in any 
month since June 1978. Ford sold 85,686 of the full-size pickups 
last month, more than many models achieve over an entire year. The 
June '78 record was 90,370 F-series trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's car sales, excluding its Jaguar unit, were up nearly 6  
percent while its light truck sales increased 19 percent to set a 
record for any month. SUV sales were up 11 percent while total 
pickup sales were up 28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The news was especially good for Ford because pickups and SUVs  
carry the highest profit margins. Much of the big increase in 
F-series sales was due to robust demand for the new F-250 and F-350 
Super Duty trucks built at Ford's Louisville, Ky., truck plant, 
which has been running full-tilt with three shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're crying all the way to the bank,'' said analyst David  
Healy of Burnham Securities Inc. ``The models that are the most 
profitable for them have the biggest year-over-year increase in 
sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford announced Tuesday that it was increasing its second-quarter  
production by 20,000 trucks and 10,000 cars to meet the strong 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Explorer and Expedition SUVs also set March sales records,  
while the new Mercury Cougar and the Escort ZX2 coupes had their 
best sales months yet. Ford's minivan sales were up 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Ford closed  
down 6 1/4 cents to $58.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's report comes after last week's largely upbeat sales  
figures from DaimlerChrysler AG and most major foreign automakers. 
General Motors Corp., the No. 1 automaker, is expected to report 
slightly higher March sales on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Rewey, Ford vice president of marketing and sales, said a  
stable economy marked by high consumer confidence, income growth, 
low inflation and interest rates was behind the robust demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Wall Street and Main Street respond favorably to  
consistency and stability,'' Rewey said. ``We believe that stable 
fiscal and monetary policy have played a key role in the duration 
of this expansion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Healy said he does not see any drop in the high demand in the  
short term. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anything in the picture that's going to slow this  
down unless gasoline prices keep going up 30 cents a gallon every 
week,'' he said. ``At this point, the gasoline thing is just a 
minor irritant to people who want to buy an Expedition or an 
Excursion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jaguar's sales were down 17 percent last month.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Hot Since Deadline Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Since picking up four players hours before the  
March 23 trading deadline, Detroit has been unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
	That can only mean trouble for the rest of the NHL -- the Red  
Wings were pretty good to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
	Good, but not great.  
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings, winners of the last two Stanley Cup  
championships, had losing streaks of three, four and five games. 
But since acquiring Chris Chelios, Wendell Clark, Ulf Samuelsson 
and goalie Bill Ranford at the trade deadline, the team has won 
seven straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has really revived everybody,'' said goalie Chris Osgood,  
who has won five of those seven games, one of them his third 
shutout of the season. ``We're a totally different team the last 
two weeks. We're excited again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the newcomers appear to have added was a bit of nastiness.  
That was on display early in Monday night's 3-2 win over the 
Anaheim Mighty Ducks when Darren McCarty drew two minutes for 
roughing just 35 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty, who had missed the 10 previous games with an injury,  
has never been a wallflower. But until the new guys showed up, the 
Red Wings couldn't afford to use him as an enforcer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've proved in the past that you have to use the regular  
season to set things up for the playoffs,'' McCarty said. ``Right 
now, we're gearing ourselves up for the postseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings are attempting to become the first team to win  
three consecutive Stanley Cups since the New York Islanders won 
four straight (1980-83) 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit (41-30-6) is the No. 3 team in the Western Conference  
with almost no chance of overhauling first-place Dallas. That means 
the Red Wings probably will draw Anaheim or St. Louis in the first 
round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mighty Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg wouldn't mind if it was his  
team. He respects Detroit, but Hartsburg thinks maybe too much is 
being made of the Red Wings' recent acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's a bit of a slap at the other guys who were  
here,'' Hartsburg said. ``They were a pretty good hockey team 
before the trades. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, if we come back here for the playoffs, maybe we'll have  
learned something about how it's going to be. They've been on a 
roll, no question about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been almost storybook stuff since the new players  
arrived. Clark has scored four goals, including the winner against 
Philadelphia on March 28. Chelios, who has been paired on defense 
with Nicklas Lidstrom, has played almost 25 minutes a game. And he 
added a goal in the Red Wings' 6-1 victory over Tampa Bay on March 
26. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranford, 5-18-3 for the season, has won both his starts since  
coming to Detroit as Osgood's backup. Samuelsson, recovering from a 
broken foot, is expected to be ready for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can never tell, but the guys have helped out,'' said  
Detroit coach Scotty Bowman, who is shooting for an NHL-best ninth 
Stanley Cup. ``It's given us a chance to play different guys, where 
we might not have had that luxury before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big trades don't always work. Sometimes the new guys don't fit  
in. Yet Detroit's four newcomers were made welcome at once. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are not just average guys,'' Detroit forward Martin  
Lapointe said. ``They are world-class players. They adapt to 
pressure well. They would fit in well on any team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lapointe noted that Clark, Chelios and Ranford all earned the  
respect of the others on the very first day by working hard in 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should see Billy in practice,'' Lapointe said. ``You can't  
measure that.''

<HEADLINE> Iverson, Brown Try To Make Amends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson insists it's no big deal.  
Larry Brown isn't happy with his star player, but doesn't expect 
things to change. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter who is right or wrong, it's easy to see who loses in  
the latest spat between Iverson and his coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia 76ers.  
</P>
<P>
	Once again, Iverson and Brown emerged from a meeting Monday  
saying nice things about each other, but giving no indication their 
rocky relationship will change. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearances aside, Iverson and Brown seem to have added to the  
rift that threatens to derail a young team on the rise. The script 
is all too familiar for Iverson, whose pursuit of recognition as 
the best player in the league has again been eclipsed by 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you throw my name in the mix with something negative, I  
mean it just explodes,'' said Iverson, who has a deep thigh bruise 
and hasn't played since exchanging words with Brown on Friday night 
against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what y'all need to sell papers. That's what y'all need  
for people to look at your show or whatever. Y'all need that 
energy. Y'all need that negativity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson did not practice and is not expected to play tonight  
against Milwaukee. He was on court for a brief shootaround at the 
end of the team's workout at a suburban college, then talked with 
Brown for 20 to 30 minutes before both emerged to discuss their 
latest attempt at a truce. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great meeting,'' Iverson said. ``And I don't think it  
was a meeting called for what went on with the last game. That's 
something that's been going on ever since coach Brown got here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the one issue on which Iverson and Brown agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I've taken Allen out since I've been here, I've had  
the same response,'' Brown said. ``And I understand. He just wants 
to play. He doesn't understand how it affects maybe his teammates 
or me. ... I don't think it's going to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also had words with Iverson's bodyguard after practice  
Monday. The coach kicked Terry Royster out of the locker room after 
the Cleveland game. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson did not play the opening 2:03 of the second quarter  
against the Cavaliers after going 0-for-7 in the first quarter. 
When Brown told Iverson to go back into the game, Iverson, 
according to courtside reporters, muttered, ``It's about time you 
put me back in,'' and used an obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Iverson denied he cursed Brown.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking at different things on TV and in the paper, and  
they're saying things that I didn't even say,'' Iverson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown wouldn't recount the exchange, but said there was a  
``second response'' from Iverson when the coach tried to put him 
back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know him, I know his response,'' Brown said. ``And it's not  
something I normally take offense with. I did at the time. I think 
I had a right to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson played for two weeks after hurting his right thigh in a  
collision with the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal on March 19. He told 
the trainer he couldn't play in the second half against Cleveland, 
and the 76ers lost 85-80 without him. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson skipped the team's one-game road trip to Toronto on  
Sunday, and the 76ers lost 97-82 -- their second straight loss and 
seventh in nine games as they plummet out of the playoff picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson said his leg stiffened when Brown sat him back down  
against the Cavaliers. Rick Mahorn denied a report that he and 
other 76ers players had to talk Iverson out of leaving the arena at 
halftime of the Cleveland game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nothing like that,'' Mahorn said. ``It was just us  
corralling the wagons together and saying, `We're all together for 
the long haul.' It's nothing where anybody's better than the other 
person. We all have to take care of our jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How long Brown and Iverson can coexist this way is the biggest  
question facing the team. Since Brown was hired last year, they've 
quarreled about playing time, coaching style and missed practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson signed a $70.9 million, six-year contract in January,  
proclaiming past differences with Brown over. 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously, they're not.  
</P>
<P>
	``If y'all think that Larry Brown and myself are not going to  
have any altercations, I mean that's crazy,'' Iverson said. 
``That's ridiculous.''

<HEADLINE> Woods, Duvall To Make Masters Show?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- It took two years to do it, but the people  
who run the Masters finally made the changes to Augusta National to 
try and stop Tiger Woods from running away with too many green 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe they needn't have bothered. The way David Duval is  
playing, he'll see to it himself. 
</P>
<P>
	In the time it took to lengthen a few holes, plant some new  
trees and deepen the rough along Augusta's generous fairways, a new 
force wearing wraparound sunglasses emerged to shake up the golf 
world's balance of power. 
</P>
<P>
	And as the 63rd Masters prepares to unfold Thursday, Duval finds  
himself slipping more and more comfortably into the favorite's role 
many assumed Woods would easily hold for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm ready to play and I go out and play well and think  
clearly, I'll have a chance to win,'' Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two years have passed since Woods routed the field by 12  
shots to win his first Masters only a few months after he was old 
enough to drink legally. No less an expert than Jack Nicklaus 
predicted Woods might win 10 green jackets. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Duval had yet to win a PGA tournament. His  
reputation was growing, but mainly for a propensity to finish 
second a lot. While Woods was trying on his new green jacket in 
1997, Duval was long gone after missing the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, how things have changed.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval started winning shortly after, and it seems like he can't  
stop. Seven wins came in little more than a year, and he's added 
four more this year, including the last two. 
</P>
<P>
	``His golf game, it's incredible,'' Fred Couples said. ``He's  
winning and it looks very easy. I just haven't seen anyone do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wins were enough to knock Woods from atop the world  
rankings, and spark the beginnings of a rivalry that golf fans can 
only hope will be tested with a head-to-head showdown on a spring 
Sunday in Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
	While Duval comes in having won two straight, Woods also has  
been playing well and is rested after taking off the BellSouth 
Classic last week in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's playing better, no doubt about it,'' Woods said of Duval.  
``But I like my chances, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does defending champion Mark O'Meara, who thinks Duval's hot  
streak might be just the thing to rejuvenate the competitive juices 
of his neighbor and frequent playing partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Woods) wants to be the man. David wants to be the man.  
That's good for golf,'' O'Meara said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval and Woods top a crowded field of 96 golfers who will  
follow the honorary group of Gene Sarazen, Byron Nelson and Sam 
Snead off the first tee Thursday. It's the biggest Masters field in 
33 years and will play in threesomes for the first time since 1962 
because of its size. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the only thing different in a tournament where  
tradition weighs heavy and change comes slowly and often 
unannounced. 
</P>
<P>
	A new back tee on the par-5 second will make it difficult for  
most golfers to reach in two, and another on 17 will bring into 
play the pine tree on the left side of the fairway that President 
Eisenhower made famous by saying it should be cut down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously they've made changes, and the scores will be  
higher,'' said Couples, who lost last year when O'Meara made a 
20-footer for birdie on the last hole. ``There's no way they're 
going to be lower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara, who served sushi and fajitas as host of the the  
champion's dinner Tuesday night, seems almost forgotten in the 
hoopla surrounding Duval's dominant play. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was in the clubhouse last year tied with Couples at 8  
under when O'Meara snuffed any chances of a playoff by making 
birdies on the last two holes to win by a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what happens this week or in the future, I was able  
to step up to the plate and win at least one,'' O'Meara said. ``The 
game doesn't owe me anything, and I know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara, who added a British Open title to give him two majors  
in one year after playing 18 years without any, was the PGA Tour's 
player of the year last year in a close race with Duval. This year, 
it hasn't been close. 
</P>
<P>
	``What David has done in the last two years in professional golf  
is absolutely incredible,'' he said. ``You know, he's been pretty 
low-key about it. But let's face it, in today's era of unbelievably 
talented deep fields, to win the amount of events he's won is 
phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was so low-key Tuesday he didn't bother to play for a  
second straight day. Instead, he hit a few balls and worked on his 
chipping. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he talked about how he elevated his game to another level  
when he quit worrying about bad shots or where balls would end up. 
That is especially important at Augusta, where the bounces and 
kicks can be unnerving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have to learn to be very conservative here, very  
patient, and accept that you're going to hit some good shots that 
are going to end up 50 feet away,'' Duval said. ``You're going to 
get some kicks off of some hills that you're not going to 
particularly like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if the kicks mostly go right and Duval finds himself in  
position to win his first major at the age of 27? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm prepared for it,'' he said. ``I think last year's  
event here certainly helped in that fashion.''

<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- NATO is taking pressure off neighboring  
Balkan states by flying tens of thousands Kosovo Albanian refugees 
to temporary homes. More than 1,000 exhausted refugees stumbled off 
planes in Turkey and Norway. Some refugees will be flown as far as 
Australia. The flights began from Macedonia late yesterday and 
continued today. A daylong airlift to Turkey was carrying 3,500

	3 Well-Preserved Inca Mummies Found

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Archeologists have discovered three  
well-preserved Inca mummies high in the Andes Mountains, the 
National Geographic Society said today. The three, relics of an 
Inca sacrificial ritual, were found beneath 5 feet of rock and 
earth on a burial platform atop Argentina's Mount Llullaillaco. The 
bodies of two girls and a boy may have been frozen since being 
placed there some 500 years ago. An archeologist said tests on the 
mummies showed all internal organs intact and blood appeared to 
still be present in the heart and lungs, as if the three had died 
only recently.

	Yugoslavia Declares Cease-Fire  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav leadership today  
declared a unilateral cease-fire in their battle against rebels in 
Kosovo to mark Orthodox Easter, hours after the most intensive 
night of NATO air raids across Yugoslavia. Western officials said 
the bombings would continue. It was unclear if the cease-fire would 
continue past the holiday Sunday, but NATO and U.S. officials had 
been expecting a cease-fire offering. Defense Secretary William

Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, would be a ``safe haven'' for up to 20,000 
Kosovar refugees in the coming days. The refuge would be only 
temporary, said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart. ``We 
fully intend the Kosovars will ultimately return to their homes.'' 
The NATO campaign against Yugoslavia continued with ``a productive 
and aggressive'' round of bombing, Lockhart said.

	Airstrikes Complicate China Talks

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the  
United States comes at a time of tense relations between Beijing 
and Washington, including a dispute over the bombing of Yugoslavia. 
China has called for an immediate halt to the NATO airstrikes. Zhu, 
whose six-city, nine-day visit began today in Los Angeles, still 
hopes to close a deal with the Clinton administration to allow 
Beijing to join the World Trade Organization, which regulates 
international trade, after 13 years of trying.

	Clinton Wants Hate-Law Expansion  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Decrying ``the persistence of old, even  
primitive hatreds,'' President Clinton today asked Congress to 
expand federal hate crime laws to include offenses based on sexual 
orientation. The president also directed the departments of 
Education and Justice to collect and periodically publish data on 
hate crimes at colleges, including crime statistics as well as 
surveys on students' racial attitudes. Clinton said Americans 
should resist destructive, biased attitudes because they imperil 
the country's future.

	CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Two Libyan suspects in the 1988  
Pan Am jet bombing were arraigned by Scottish authorities at a 
deserted U.S. airbase today. Suspected former intelligence agents 
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah were 
fingerprinted, photographed and gave DNA samples one day after 
Libya surrendered them for trial. The two men were then arraigned 
on charges contained in a 1991 U.S.-British indictment accusing 
them of planting the bomb that ripped apart Flight 103 over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988. The attack killed 270 
people.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Another labor dispute could delay the start of  
another basketball season. The WNBA has given its players until 
Saturday to reach a contract agreement with the league. At the 
center of the disagreement is salaries, just as it was when the NBA 
locked out its players for six months, including nearly half the 
season. The players' union wants a minimum salary of $45,000 for 
the three-month summer season. The WNBA is proposing $20,000, 
according to the union.

<HEADLINE> Man Who Spread AIDS Virus Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- A 22-year-old man accused of infecting  
girls and young women with the AIDS virus has been sentenced to 
four to 12 years in prison for knowingly spreading HIV through 
unprotected sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Nushawn Williams struck a plea deal Monday after only two of his  
infected partners agreed to testify. Investigators said he traded 
drugs for sex with young women and teens he approached in schools 
and parks. 
</P>
<P>
	The case spread fear across rural western New York when it  
became public in October 1997. State confidentiality laws prevent 
people who are HIV positive from being identified. But prosecutors 
persuaded a judge to disclose Williams' identity and allow for his 
photo to be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who is already serving a prison sentence for selling  
cocaine, pleaded guilty to statutory rape for having sex with a 
13-year-old girl. He also pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment 
for having unprotected sex with another teen-ager. She later 
contracted the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams claimed he didn't believe the public health nurse who  
told him he was HIV-positive, so he continued having unprotected 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not an evil person,'' defense attorney Richard Slater  
said. ``He's been painted as an evil person. He feels badly that 
he's ill. He expressed to me the concern he may not live out his 
sentence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams pleaded guilty to a similar reckless endangerment  
charge involving a 15-year-old girl in New York City and is 
awaiting sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents are still angry at any mention of Williams, a drifter  
who happened into town and thrust Mayville into the national debate 
on AIDS education. Many said the sentence was not severe enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave (the victims) a death sentence,'' Richard Smith said.  
``I think he should have one.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch is  
expanding his reach in cable television in the United States, 
buying out most of partner John Malone's interest in a joint 
venture for $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp., the media conglomerate controlled by Murdoch, will  
take over substantially all of the operations of the Fox/Liberty 
Network, which was founded three years ago as a venture between 
News Corp.'s Fox Entertainment Group and Malone's Liberty Media 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, announced late Monday evening, News Corp. will  
gain control of regional sports network Fox Sports Net, which 
reaches more than 62 million households across the United States, 
the entertainment network FX, which reaches more than 39 million 
households, and other related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty will receive about 51.8 million U.S.-listed shares of  
News Corp., worth about $1.43 billion based on Monday's closing 
stock prices. In early trading today, News Corp.'s shares slipped 
31 1/4 cents to $33.50 on the New York Stock Exchange while Liberty 
Media shares rose $1.50 or 2.7 percent to $57.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about the deal has been swirling for several days  
after published reports by several newspapers pushed News Corp.'s 
New York-listed shares to a 52-week high. 
</P>
<P>
	``In acquiring Liberty's interest in these properties, News  
Corporation has firmly established itself as the leader in original 
cable programming and distribution,'' Murdoch said. ``This deal 
will enable us to leverage more fully the Fox brand across our 
cable and broadcast properties while giving us added flexibility 
over our sports and entertainment channels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, News Corp. will also take over the  
joint venture's 40 percent interest in Rainbow Programming, a unit 
of Cablevision that controls the New York Knicks basketball team, 
the New York Rangers hockey team and part of Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty will retain its 50 percent interest in International  
Sports Programming Partners, the international sports programming 
venture it has partnered with Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp. is one of the world's largest media companies with  
operations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, 
Australia, Latin America and the Pacific Basin. It had revenue in 
1998 of $14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Media is a subsidiary of AT&AMP;T Corp. and is one of  
nation's largest providers of cable television programming. Malone 
is the former head of Tele-Communications Inc., the cable giant 
acquired by AT&AMP;T.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Sign Gandy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers solved a big problem  
on the offensive line today by signing left tackle Wayne Gandy to a 
four-year contract, only to develop another when right tackle 
Justin Strzelczyk reinjured his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Strzelczyk underwent his second knee operation in less than a  
year after reinjuring the right knee ligament he tore in October, 
an injury that forced him out of the Steelers' final nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	Strzelczyk was expected to return and challenge former  
first-round draft pick Jamain Stephens at right tackle, but now is 
out indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	With training camp starting in 3 1/2 months and Strzelczyk facing  
months of rehabilitation, it is likely he will miss a significant 
portion of the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers signed the 6-foot-5, 300-pound Gandy to a contract  
believed to be worth $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh spent weeks courting Gandy, a consistent, durable  
player who will replace Will Wolford at left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Gandy started the Rams' last 64 games but has never played in  
the playoffs, one reason he signed with Pittsburgh. The Steelers 
made six consecutive playoff appearances prior to last season. 
</P>
<P>
	His signing puts the Steelers over the NFL salary cap, but they  
will drop back under the cap Wednesday when Wolford is expected to 
officially announce his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolford, who played left guard before moving to left tackle last  
season to replace John Jackson, recently held a retirement party at 
his Kentucky home. But he did not officially notify the NFL of his 
retirement, and Steelers coach Bill Cowher has tried to persuade 
him to play only on passing downs.

<HEADLINE> Garth Brooks Ends Baseball Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Where's Garth?  
</P>
<P>
	That's what some fans wanted to know today at the San Diego  
Padres' home opener against the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Seems the country crooner bowed out gracefully after a showy six  
weeks at spring training in Peoria, Ariz., turning down an offer by 
the Padres to travel with the team for the first month as a 
non-roster player. 
</P>
<P>
	``We offered him a (Trevor) Hoffman deal, $32 million for four  
years, but he said he could make that in a weekend, so he decided 
to shut her down,'' General Manager Kevin Towers joked. 
</P>
<P>
	But seriously, Towers said Brooks didn't want to hurt the  
chances of a real player. 
</P>
<P>
	``The closer it got to the season starting, I think, this is the  
type of guy Garth is, he saw this as maybe potentially costing a 
young prospect or player a spot on a roster and he didn't want that 
to happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of nights during the last week of spring training,  
Brooks and third base coach Tim Flannery played two mini-concerts 
for Padres staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it was on his mind,'' Towers said. ``The next morning  
(April 1) he came in and said he was not traveling with us to 
Vegas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, 37, left on a high note. He got his first RBI in 22  
spring training at-bats, helping the Padres win 9-8 to finish the 
Arizona circuit with a 19-11-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was great,'' Brooks said last week. ``All my six  
weeks, all I wanted to do was contribute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said he got what he wanted from spring training -- a  
chance to fulfill a boyhood dream and to jump-start his Touch 'Em 
All Foundation, which earns money for children's charities based on 
players hitting homeruns, stealing bases or pitching strike outs. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation's name comes from a term used to describe what a  
baseball player does after hitting a home run -- touch all the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said 70 players have already pledged their participation,  
including Ken Griffey Jr., Roger Clemens, Kevin Brown, Andy Ashby, 
Larry Walker and Walt Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was invited to the Padres' home opener to sing the  
national anthem, but his managers declined the invitation, club 
spokesman Charles Steinberg said. Brooks sang ``The Star-Spangled 
Banner'' at the 1993 Super Bowl, and said it was the hardest song 
in the world to sing. 
</P>
<P>
	Towers said he was happy Brooks joined the Padres at camp,  
calling him a genuinely good and hard working guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was an inspiration to our players,'' he said. ``The passion  
he had for the game of baseball and the way he went about it. It's 
a good reminder for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The publicity for the team and the game didn't hurt either.  
</P>
<P>
	``He interacted with the fans and signed autographs for 3 1/2 hours  
every night. He did not harm, put it that way,'' Towers said. 
</P>
<P>
	And, the team misses him.  
</P>
<P>
	``They all said they miss the cowboy. Just having him around,  
you know. There was just something special about him being around 
everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Will Brooks, who first worked out with the team in 1998, be back  
for a third spring training? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. All I know is that we've got a heck of a lot  
more country-western fans than we probably had before he went into 
camp,'' Towers said.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Salaries Up 19 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The biggest escalation in seven years pushed  
baseball's average salary above $1.7 million on opening day, 
according to a study by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore outfielder Albert Belle was the highest-paid player on  
opening day for the third straight season, earning $11,949,794. 
Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez was second at $11 million, followed 
by Los Angeles pitcher Kevin Brown ($10,714,286) and Atlanta 
pitcher Greg Maddux ($10.6 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire, last season's star with a record 70 homers, was  
11th at $8,333,333. Sammy Sosa, who chased McGwire all summer long 
and finished with 66 homers, was tied for ninth at $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series champion New York Yankees opened with  
baseball's highest payroll ever, $85.1 million -- an average of 
$3.04 million per player. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles was second at $79.2 million, followed by Baltimore  
($78.5 million), Texas ($74.9 million), Atlanta ($73.5 million) and 
Cleveland ($68.9 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona moved up from 21st at $31.6 million at the end of last  
season to seventh at $65.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end were three teams below $20 million: Montreal  
was last at $17.3 million, Florida was 29th at $18.8 million and 
Minnesota was 28th at $19.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The average salary of $1,720,050, easily a record, was up 19.3  
percent over last year's opening-day average of $1,441,406, 
according to the AP study, which examined the contracts of 830 
players on opening-day rosters and the disabled list. It was nearly 
five times the 4.2 percent rise prior to last season and the 
largest increase since a 21.7 percent rise prior to the 1992 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	With an increase of 16.3 percent next year, the average would  
top $2 million for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, the NBA's average is about $1.8 million this  
season, the NHL's is $1.17 million (using a mixture of U.S. and 
Canadian dollars), and the NFL's is $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been going all those over the past few months, but I  
want to see the final numbers before I make any judgments,'' 
commissioner Bud Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	An indication of why small and middle markets no longer can  
compete can be seen at the top of the salary scale. The number of 
players earning $8 million or higher more than doubled from 10 to 
23, while the total at $9 million or more tripled from three to 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of players at $1 million or more rose from 317 to 348  
and the percentage of millionaires in the majors rose from 37.7 
percent to 41.9. The number at $2 million or higher rose from 216 
to 254, and $4 million players shot up from 98 to 128. The $5 
million club swelled from 63 to 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles and the New York Mets each had the most millionaires  
at 18, with Baltimore, Boston and the New York Yankees at 17. 
Florida had the fewest with four, the Chicago White Sox had five, 
and Kansas City, Minnesota and Montreal had six each. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap between the top and bottom decreased somewhat this year.  
The Yankees' payroll was 5 1/2 times that of Montreal; last year, when 
Baltimore had the highest payroll, the Orioles' spent 7 1/2 times more 
than the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	Total payroll rose from $1.21 billion to $1.43 billion. The  
median salary -- the point at which an equal number of players are 
above and below -- rose from $500,000 to a record $700,000. It 
dropped to $275,000 in 1995 following the end of the 7 1/2-month 
strike before resuming its rise. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 68 players at the $200,000 minimum, which is higher  
than the average prior to 1982. Last year, there were 66 at the 
minimum -- then $170,000 -- on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	In reality, the amount the Yankees are spending on players this  
year is more than $91.4 million because their payroll doesn't 
include the $2.5 million salary of Darryl Strawberry, who is on a 
minor league roster; $2.5 million they are paying toward the salary 
of Oakland pitcher Kenny Rogers; $500,000 they are paying Minnesota 
as part of last year's Chuck Knoblauch trade; $800,000 they are 
paying released infielder Dale Sveum; plus money they are paying 
Arizona as part of last month's Darren Holmes trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The listed salary includes a player's 1999 salary plus a  
prorated share of any signing bonus or guaranteed income not 
attributed to a specific year. Contract figures were obtained by 
the AP from various player and management sources. 
</P>
<P>
	A different method of calculation is used by baseball to  
determine the luxury tax. That method, which uses the average 
annual value of contracts and is based on 40-man rosters, has the 
Dodgers with the highest payroll, followed by the Orioles and 
Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Charles Keating Enters Guilty Pleas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan CEO Charles  
Keating Jr., a central figure in the S&AMP;L scandal in the 1980s, has 
pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud in exchange for a plea 
agreement that allows him to go free. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-running case involved investors' loss of $200 million  
and the collapse of Lincoln Savings, which cost taxpayers $3.4 
billion. His previous convictions had been thrown out on appeal, 
but prosecutors said they would retry him. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Mariana Pfaelzer accepted the plea  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Keating was sentenced to time he has spent in  
jail on previous convictions, totaling a bit less than five years 
in prison. The judge did not impose any fines, restitution or 
supervision by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also dismissed fraud charges against Keating's son,  
Charles Keating III. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how he felt afterward, Keating said, ``Great.'' Asked what  
lay ahead, he said, ``Life.'' He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating pleaded guilty to three counts of wire fraud and one  
count of bankruptcy fraud. The latter count involved transfer of 
$975,000 from his American Continental Corp. to himself through 
relatives days before the company filed for bankruptcy protection. 
American Continental was parent of Lincoln Savings. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea followed an announcement by prosecutors in January that  
they planned to retry Keating and his son on charges that he 
defrauded investors who lost $200 million in worthless junk bonds 
issued by American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating's case returned to U.S. District Court earlier this year  
after an appellate court threw out the Keatings' 1992 federal 
convictions and said they deserved a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating, known for extravagant spending during his days as  
chairman of American Continental, was convicted in federal and 
state court on charges stemming from the collapse of Lincoln 
Savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued in the two trials that Keating looted Lincoln  
Savings of its assets to prop up American Continental. Bond 
purchasers, they said, were not told of the investment's risky 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating denied the allegations and blamed government regulators  
for Lincoln's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Sharon McCaslin told Pfaelzer the deal  
was justified because Keating was accepting responsibility for 
fraud. McCaslin also said that so much time had passed that some 
witnesses may have difficulty recalling the events that led to 
Lincoln's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the plea agreement, Keating faced a maximum sentence of  
20 years in prison followed by three years of supervised release, 
plus the fines and possible restitution to victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating served nearly five years in prison before the federal  
conviction was overturned on grounds some jurors learned of his 
earlier conviction in state court and discussed it in the jury 
room. Despite finding that the jury had based its verdict on the 
courtroom evidence, Pfaelzer ruled that jurors' exposure to outside 
information denied Keating a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating's state conviction was voided as well on grounds that  
the trial judge issued improper instructions to the jury. The state 
of California is appealing that reversal. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating lawyer Stephen Neal said he thought there was little  
chance the case would be resurrected. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Majoli Eyes Bausch &AMP; Lomb Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMELIA ISLAND, Fla. (AP) -- The stress fracture in her foot has  
healed, leading Iva Majoli to believe the health of her tennis game 
will follow suit soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Majoli, the 1997 French Open champion, earned just her fourth  
victory of the year Monday, defeating Sandra Nacuk 7-5, 6-3 in the 
opening round of the Bausch &AMP; Lomb Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I'm getting closer and closer to the top players,''  
said Majoli, the 16th seed in this tournament and 32nd-ranked 
player in the world. ``1998 is over. I can start 1999 fresh. It's 
like a new beginning. I'm looking forward to my next matches and 
I'm working real hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No. 10 seed Chanda Rubin, No. 11 Magui Serna, No. 14 Virginia  
Ruano-Pascual and No. 15 Nathalie Dechy all won their first-round 
matches. They were the only seeds in action on a light opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	The stars -- Venus Williams, Lindsay Davenport and Monica Seles --  
were to take the court today in the $520,000 tournament, the last 
stop in the United States before most players head to Europe and 
the heart of the clay court season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninth-seeded Anna Kournikova defeated Evgenia Koulikovskaya 6-1,  
7-5 in one of the early matches. Koulikovskaya was a late entry, 
earning her spot after Andrea Glass dropped out with a hip injury. 
Also in morning action, 13th seed Lisa Raymond defeated Larisa 
Neiland 3-6, 6-1, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Majoli had today off in the final stop in the United States  
before most of the women head to Europe and the heart of the clay 
court season. 
</P>
<P>
	That's normally the season Majoli likes most and she hopes to  
use it to re-enter her name among the world's elite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at some of the girls and I think to myself, I can get  
in front of these girls,'' said Majoli, who missed the end of 1998 
and a good portion of this year with the stress fracture. ``I want 
to get back. I feel I can be up there for the next few years. The 
young players are coming, but I've got a good, aggressive game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a much lengthier comeback trail is Jennifer Capriati, who  
defeated Sylvia Plischke 7-5, 6-3 for just her fourth victory of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati entered the tournament ranked 81st in the world and  
will take another month off after this week to work with her new 
coach, Harold Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm beginning to believe I can win again,'' Capriati said.  
``My tennis is good enough that I can still beat some of these 
players. I think Harold Solomon, in a short time, has helped me to 
believe that, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati persevered through a sloppy first set that took exactly  
an hour to complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Plischke, ranked 39th in the world, strained her thigh muscle  
early in the second set and Capriati hurried to a 5-0 lead. 
Capriati lost the next three games, but broke Plischke's serve for 
the eighth time in the match to close it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``All this was part of it being the first match on clay'' this  
year, Capriati said. ``It's about making adjustments, getting used 
to the bad bounces and stuff. Every game was close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another player slowly moving up the rankings is Tara Snyder of  
Wichita, Kan. She took center court early in the day and beat 
Larissa Schaerer of Paraguay 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder, ranked 36th, will play seventh-seeded Conchita Martinez  
tonight. She'll take the confidence she gained in a second-round 
victory here last year against last year's seventh seed, Irina 
Spirlea, on the way to a quarterfinal appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to keep working on the physical aspect, especially  
with my legs, trying to build a good base underneath me,'' Snyder 
said. ``That's one thing that sets Venus, Serena and Davenport 
apart. They're so strong and they can pound away at it on the 
baseline.''

<HEADLINE> US Finds Stainless Steel Is Dumped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is one step away from  
slapping punitive tariffs on a type of stainless steel from Japan, 
Spain and four other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has found those countries illegally  
price stainless round wire in the United States. It will impose 
tariffs of up to 36 percent if an independent agency finds that the 
pricing practices hurt or could injure American producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission is expected to rule by  
mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased,'' said George Kurisky, chairman of the  
U.S. Stainless Wire Action Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department ruling Monday represents the latest in a  
string of victories for the U.S. steel industry, which has yet to 
lose a key ruling in trade complaints filed to combat low-priced 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Those successes, however, have made it more difficult for  
domestic producers to put foreign steel products under quotas or 
impose stronger sanctions to fend off imports blamed for thousands 
of layoffs and bankruptcies at some U.S. companies. Administration 
officials cite the favorable rulings as evidence the normal 
administrative process works. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, 10 U.S. manufacturers sought tariffs after accusing  
Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Spain and Taiwan of dumping 
round wire in the U.S. market at prices below production costs or 
home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Stainless steel round wire is used to produce springs, wire rope  
and fasteners in construction and other applications. It represents 
a small portion of the overall steel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	A crucial decision covering the most common steel product,  
hot-rolled carbon steel, is due this month. The Commerce Department 
already has found evidence of dumping by Japan, Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and Brazil face steel tariffs in the hot-rolled case,  
while Russia has agreed to curb exports to avoid similar tariffs. A 
U.S. comment period for implementing the Russian agreement closed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On stainless round wire, tariffs proposed by the Commerce  
Department ranged from 3 percent for exports from South Korea to 36 
percent for shipments made by Spain's main producer. Japanese round 
wire could be subject to tariffs of up to 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stainless steel round wire is a $300 million-a-year domestic  
industry, and imports add another $100 million, industry officials 
said. Shipments from the six countries under Commerce Department 
scrutiny account for one-third of all imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The government already has imposed tariffs on stainless wire  
rod, the precursor to round wire, and has found six countries 
guilty of dumping stainless plates in coils, which could lead to 
more tariffs if injury is proven. Other complaints are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases acted on Monday were filed by ACS Industries Inc. of  
Woonsocket, R.I.; Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. of Dunkirk, N.Y.; 
Branford Wire &AMP; Manufacturing Co. of Mountain Home, N.C.; Carpenter 
Technology Corp. of Reading, Pa.; Handy &AMP; Herman Specialty Wire 
Group of Cockeysville, Md.; Industrial Alloys Inc. of Pomona, 
Calif.; Loos &AMP; Co. Inc. of Pomfret, Conn.; Sandvik Steel Co. of 
Clarks Summit, Pa.; Sumiden Wire Products Corp. of Stockton, 
Calif.; and Techalloy Co. Inc. of Mahwah, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Wizards To Interview Maurice Cheeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Washington Wizards received permission  
Tuesday to interview Philadelphia 76ers assistant Maurice Cheeks 
for their vacant coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	Wizards general manager Wes Unseld called Sixers GM Billy King,  
who gave permission for the former star point guard to interview 
for the job vacated by Bernie Bickerstaff's firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixers coach Larry Brown confirmed Cheeks' upcoming interview  
after Philadelphia's 95-87 victory over Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards named Jim Brovelli interim coach after firing  
Bickerstaff Monday, but Unseld has made it clear he wants to hire 
someone else before the season is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can get the individual I am looking for, I will do that  
immediately, if possible,'' Unseld said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheeks, one of six players to have his number retired by the  
Sixers, retired in 1993 as the NBA's career steals leader. He led 
the Sixers in steals in each of his 11 seasons in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just flattered that anyone would give me an interview,''  
Cheeks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheeks was an assistant with the Quad City Thunder of the CBA  
for a year. He's in his fifth season as a Sixers assistant, 
including the last two under coach Larry Brown.

<HEADLINE>  Good Start to New Baseball Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For all those fans who spent the winter wondering whether Mark  
McGwire could do it again, start counting. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit home run No. 1 Monday night when he connected on  
opening day -- just like did last season on the way to a 
record-breaking 70. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year is over with. Turn the page,'' McGwire said after  
his St. Louis Cardinals lost to Milwaukee 10-8. ``It was a great 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said David Weathers, who served up the shot: ``Welcome to  
1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A little bit later, Ken Griffey Jr. also went deep. He hit his  
seventh home run on opening day, one behind Frank Robinson's 
record, in an 8-2 loss to Chicago. The Seattle star did it after 
career homer king Hank Aaron threw out the first ball at the 
Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even before Big Mac and Junior homered, there was plenty to  
jazz up Monday's 11 openers. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Clemens made his debut for the World Series champion New  
York Yankees, striking out eight in 6 1-3 innings in a no-decision 
at Oakland. The Rocket and his new teammates wore a No. 5 on their 
left sleeves, a tribute to the late Joe DiMaggio, but lost 5-3 in a 
rain-shortened game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken, of all people, hurt himself and had to leave a game.  
Kevin Brown, the $105 million man, was knocked out in his matchup 
with Randy Johnson. Detroit's Brian Moehler took a no-hit bid into 
the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
	And, just like last year, there were home runs. Lots of them.  
</P>
<P>
	Albert Belle broke loose for Baltimore. Raul Mondesi went wild  
for Los Angeles. Jose Canseco connected for Tampa Bay. Bernard 
Gilkey hit two off Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Encarnacion wasted no time -- he homered for the Tigers on  
the first pitch of the afternoon at Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	After an opening day appetizer Sunday night in Mexico between  
Colorado and San Diego, baseball began in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call this my holy day,'' Orioles fan Robin Steel said at  
Camden Yards. ``That's what it is for those of us who worship in 
the church of baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The morning began with the traditional opening-day parade in  
Cincinnati. Later, ailing Andres Galarraga threw out the first ball 
at Atlanta, via TV hook-up from his home. At night, McGwire, 
Griffey and Clemens took over. 
</P>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa, who hit 66 last year, and the Chicago Cubs open  
tonight at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year I was ready, but I think in 1999 I am more ready  
because a lot of people are expecting me and Mark to come back and 
do the same way,'' Sosa said after a workout at the Astrodome. ``I 
have to say that he's ready and I'm ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle was ready, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Playing his first game for the Orioles, the star who figures to  
challenge for the home-run lead this year in cozy Camden Yards hit 
a three-run homer that highlighted a 10-7 win over Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle's teammates and the crowd of 46,733 gave him a standing  
ovation, and the surly slugger responded with a rare curtain call. 
Belle also had an RBI single, more than enough to offset Canseco's 
398th lifetime homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles won despite losing Ripken, who left in the third  
inning because of a stiff lower back. Ripken, who voluntarily ended 
his record streak of 2,632 straight games last year, was listed as 
day to day. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, the Orioles unveiled a large, orange ``7'' in  
the third-base coaching box to honor Cal Ripken Sr., who died March 
24 of lung cancer at 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Jr. did not get any hits, leaving him 122 short of 3,000.  
But Wade Boggs singled twice for the Devil Rays, putting him 76 
short of the milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi delivered the biggest hits. His three-run homer with two  
outs in the bottom of the ninth tied it, and his two-run homer in 
the 11th lifted Los Angeles over Arizona 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler, meanwhile, was the day's pitching star -- rather than  
Brown or Johnson. There was slight evidence that umpires were 
calling higher strikes, as the commissioner's office ordered them 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Moehler came within eight outs of joining Bob Feller as the only  
pitchers to throw no-hitters on opening day as Detroit defeated 
Texas 11-5. Juan Gonzalez broke up Moehler's bid with a one-out 
single in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, I was thinking about it,'' Moehler said.  
</P>
<P>
	His performance was far better than anything from the day's two  
marquee matchups: Johnson vs. Brown at Dodger Stadium or Curt 
Schilling vs. Tom Glavine at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, baseball's first $100 million man, gave up three home  
runs for the Dodgers. Johnson, who signed for $52.4 million, was 
so-so for the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	At Atlanta, neither Schilling nor Glavine was especially sharp  
as Philadelphia beat the Braves 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas City Royals once again proved that nothing counts  
until opening day. After posting baseball's best exhibition record 
at 22-9, they lost 5-3 to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Marlins, however, got off to a fine start. Worst in  
the majors last year with 108 losses, they beat the New York Mets 
6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have a lot of fun this year,'' new Marlins  
owner John Henry said.
