<HEADLINE> Lebanon Starts Massive Repair Work After Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon Saturday started to repair
power stations, roads and bridges destroyed in the 10-hour Israeli
air strike on the country two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Army engineering units were installing iron bridges and
building alternative side roads near the two bridges linking
Beirut and southern Lebanon that were destroyed, said
Secretary-General of Lebanon's Higher Relief Council Liwa Ruad
after an emergency meeting chaired by Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction of destroyed bridges will complete in two
months, he said.
</P>
<P>
But, what usually is an hour-long drive now will stretch three
or four hours as cars will have to take detours along narrow and
winding mountain roads amid snarled traffic.
</P>
<P>
Ruad said that within 10 days, electricity supply in Beirut
and its environments will increase from the current 2 hours daily
to 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
The full restorage of power supply will need a period of time,
he said, without giving a specific date.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched a 10-hour aerial blitz on Lebanon's
infrastructure Thursday night to retaliate an earlier cross-border
attacks by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, which is
fighting to oust Israeli troops out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Eight Lebanese, most of them civil defense workers, were
killed and 64 others wounded in the Israeli offensive, the
biggest since the 1996 Israeli "Grapes of Wrath" operation which
killed at least 200 people, most of whom are civilians.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said its Katyusha rockets, which killed two
Israelis, served as a response to the wounding of a Lebanese
woman by the Israeli shelling in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Officials have estimated at 30 million U.S. dollars the damage
to the two destroyed power stations lying on a hill overlooking
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, which is suffering the worst economic recession with
a huge debt of over 18 billion dollars since it launched a massive
reconstruction process, has already secured offers for help.
</P>
<P>
Billionaire Saudi Prince Walid bin Talal has offered to foot
the bill of rebuilding the power stations while Syria offered
emergency electricity supply.

<HEADLINE> Russia Opposes Laying Pipeline on Caspian Sea Bed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Yuri Proshin said here on Saturday that Russia opposes to
laying oil pipeline through the Caspian Sea bed due to
environmental issues and failure to finalize the Caspian Sea
legal regime.
</P>
<P>
Russia insists that Iran's route should be taken into
consideration for transferring the Caspian oil and gas, because of
its high importance from security and economical points of view,
Proshin told Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
He said that economic issues should be given due attention,
even though political issues are always taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Caspian Sea legal regime, the Russian
official said that the best solution to the issue is the division
of the sea, namely division of oil fields and of territorial
waters, free shipping and removal of any border among littoral
states.
</P>
<P>
The five Caspian Sea littoral states, Russia, Azerbaijan,
Iran, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan hold different views on the
sea's legal regime.
</P>
<P>
Iran insisted on common ownership of the littoral states over
the sea while some others called for division of the sea among
littoral states.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi in the meeting said that Russia and Iran shoulder
a heavy responsibility in the political, economic and security
domains.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran and Russia are supposed to be able to play a
role in solving regional crises, which should not provide an
excuse for presence of foreign powers in the region.

<HEADLINE> Official: Russia's 1999 Inflation to Hit 85 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Deputy Prime Minister
Viktor Khristenko warned Saturday that the country's inflation may
amount to 85 percent by the end of the year and the ruble exchange
rate could slide to 30 against the U.S. dollar if it fails to
resolve its debt problem.
</P>
<P>
"The government's objective is to work with creditors,"
Khristenko said while touring Saratov, a city 1,500 kilometers
southeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"We have no right for illusions that Russia can borrow new
credits," the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, has passed 18 of
31 measures prescribed by the International Monetary Fund as part
of a reform program that Russia must fulfill to unlock 4.5 billion
dollars in loans to avoid an embarrassing default on earlier debts
to the fund.
</P>
<P>
An IMF mission is scheduled to come to Moscow next Monday to
review Russia's standing.
</P>
<P>
Khristenko said the cabinet "is not making new debts but tries
to refinance the old ones" at the current talks with international
financial institutions."
</P>
<P>
Given a positive settlement of the debt issue, Russia's
industrial output could grow 3.5 percent by the end of the year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Russia's economy "seems stable" as
industrial production went up 1.5 percent in the first five months
of the year, Khristenko said.
</P>
<P>
He said the cabinet does not aim to draw up new long-term
programs for Russia's socioeconomic development in the next 10 to
15 years, but rather, it will implement the "already written"
ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said Saturday it
would not resort to Central Bank loans for meeting foreign debt
payments in the second half of the year if the IMF in late July
approves the economic program of the government and Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under this program, the IMF, the World Bank and the Japanese
government are to release funds which are "sufficient to refinance
the foreign debt payments falling due this year," Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kasyanov's predecessor, Mikhail Zadornov, Russia's
total foreign debts, aside from those inherited from the former
Soviet Union, now stand at 110 billion dollars, with over 17
billion falling due this year, about two-thirds of the country's
budget spending.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Measures to Uproot Drug Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani on Saturday called for practical measures to uproot
the production of narcotics in the world.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the appeal in a meeting with Deputy
U.N. Secretary General and Executive Director of the U.N. Drug
Control Program (UNDCP) Pino Arlacchi, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Instead of mere rhetoric, there should be efforts to present a
practical way of wide-scale global campaign against root causes
of narcotic drugs smuggling, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that the relevant international
organizations have not taken serious measure to uproot narcotics
production.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani pointed out that profitability of trade in drugs
has tempted dreadful mafia networks to infiltrate into media and
power control centers.
</P>
<P>
Such an influence has gone to an extent that the more Iran
steps up its campaign against "death merchants" (drug smugglers),
the more it comes under fire under the pretext of human rights
abuses, said Rafsanjani, chairman of Iran's powerful advisory
State Expediency Council.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as long as decisive and practical campaigns have
not been launched against drug production centers, the struggle
against the illicit phenomenon will not gain any success.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami in his separate
meeting with Arlacchi said that illicit drugs have posed a
serious threat to human societies.
</P>
<P>
Expressing pleasure with the effective cooperation between Iran
and the UNDCP in fighting drug trafficking, he said that
Iran has become a major barrier to trafficking of drugs to
the west.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also expressed Iran's interest in wide-scale
cooperation with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the scope of Iran's cooperation with the U.N. and
its subsidiary organizations should expand," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arlacchi, who are currently in Iran to attend a drug-burning
ceremony, said that the UNDCP intends to pave the grounds for
regional states to fight against narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Iran on Saturday afternoon burned 55 tons of narcotics to
mark the international anti-drug day.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international community appreciates Iran's
endeavors for the sake of the world health and stability and
now the wall of discrimination and misinformation against Iran
has broken.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is willing to cooperate with Iran in carrying out
technical projects to secure success of the campaign against
illicit drugs, he said.

TEHRAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Saturday expressed indignation over recent Israeli
attacks on Lebanon, which killed at least 8 people and incurred
damage on the country's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with his Lebanese counterpart Salim
Hoss, Kharrazi said that Iran is ready to extend aid to Lebanon to
repair the damages resulting from the Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
The signatories to the April 1996 agreement should take the
responsibility to exert pressure on Israel to terminate its
attacks on Lebanon, he stressed, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Hoss stressed the Lebanese people and government's
firm determination to counter the Israeli aggression and thanked
Iran for its support and assistance to his country.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched large-scale air strikes on Lebanon since
Thursday evening to avenge the Katyusha rocket attacks on its
northern areas by the Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was Israel's heaviest military offensive against Lebanon
since its "Grapes of Wrath" operation in 1996.
</P>

Under a ceasefire agreement signed in April 1996, the two
warring sides should refrain from attacks on or from civilian
targets.
</P>

also condemned the Israeli attacks on Lebanon and called on the

TEHRAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran Saturday afternoon set aflame
55 tons of various narcotics seized from drug traffickers to mark
the international anti-drug day.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Deputy Secretary-General and Executive Director of the

</P>
<P>
Due to hot whether, the drug pile caught fire itself and

</P>
<P>
Mohammad Fallah, secretary of the anti-drug headquarters at the
Iranian Presidential Office, said at the ceremony that Iran
seized some 54 tons of various drugs during the first three
months of the current Iranian year which started on March 21.
</P>
<P>
He said that in addition to some 30,000 Iranian security
personnel deployed along the country's 1,925-kilometer-long
eastern borders, Commander-in-Chief of the Iranian Armed Forces
Ali Khamenei last year ordered the Iranian army and the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps to form military units in the region
to fight against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Fallah said that last year, 95 Iranian personnel were killed in
anti-drug actions while the number of the wounded and disabled was
four times of the figure.
</P>
<P>
He called on other countries and the world community to help Iran
combat drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
"There is no alternative but to conduct the anti-narcotics
campaign," he said.
</P>
<P>
In another ceremony on Friday, five tons of narcotics were
also set aflame in Iran's central province of Kerman to mark the
international anti-drug day.
</P>
<P>
The deputy secretary of the anti-drug headquarters, who was
only named as Heshmati, said at the ceremony that the country
allocates some 7,000 billion rials (about 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars) annually to fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
He said that some 270 Iranian personnel have been killed in
anti-drug campaigns since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The official put the number of addicts in Iran at one million,
adding there are 210 million addicts throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Iran launched a large-scale anti-drug campaign after the Iranian
Majlis (parliament) passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989.
</P>
<P>
And the amount of confiscated narcotics have been on drastic rise
in recent years.

held the conference.
</P>
<P>
The passing century has witnessed amazing scientific
breakthroughs, and the applications of scientific knowledge has
become the most important engine for economic development, the
UNESCO said.
</P>
<P>
But the progress has come at a price with more frequent natural
disasters provoked by global warming, increasing scarcity of
drinking water, disappearing forests, plants and animal species
and air pollution reported around the world.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the general public is alarmed at both the
rate and the direction of science progress.
</P>
<P>
The after-effects of Chernobyl accident, the birth of Dolly the
cloned sheep and other transgenic animals, have raised the fears
of the consequence of scientists' fiddling dangerously with
Nature.
</P>
<P>
The World Conference on Science, the first global conference on
science since 1979, is welcomed by the scientific community.
</P>
<P>
"It is appropriate that the last major conference under UN
frame is on science," M.S. Swaminathan, the president of India's
M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Because the 20th century is a century of science," said
Swaminathan, a keynote speaker at the opening ceremony of the
conference, who is also UNESCO Chairman in Ecotechnology.
</P>
<P>
After Saturday's opening ceremony, the conference will be
divided into three forums. Twenty five topics about natural
science and its relationship with the human society will be
discussed during the next five days.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be concluded by adopting a Declaration on
Science and the Use of Scientific and a Science Agenda.

<HEADLINE> Peace Deal Closing, Say Sierra Leone Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) - Sierra Leone's rebel leader Foday
Sankoh said Saturday that he and Kabbah's government are closing
to a deal in a marathon peace talks in Lome, Togo.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh said that "I think we have come to the end of the
negotiations, it is just a matter of getting a mandate from my
people, that is the People' s War Council, the High Command of the
combatants," he said. "Then I think we'll come to a final
conclusion," according to local radio reporting.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Nigerian President Olusegan Obasanjo and his host,
Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema, met both sides of the talks
on Friday in Togo and released a joint statement early Saturday
urging the two sides to make "a final effort for peace and
reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
The rebel United Revolutionary Front's (URF) refused Wednesday
an offer from President Tejan Kabbah of three cabinet posts in
return for peace, deeply dampening hopes of the international
mediators.
</P>
<P>
But the rebels latter seemed satisfied for a Sierra Leone
government's enhanced offer of four cabinet posts and four
lower-tier posts.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, in a short visit to Sierra Leone Friday pledged that
Nigerian troops, who constitute the bulk of the West African
Peace Keeping Force or ECOMOG would stay in this war-torn country
in an apparent gesture of beefing up the Sierra leone
government's stands.
</P>
<P>
The rebels' power-sharing demand had been a major hurdle in the
peace talks held in Lome, Togo between Sierra Leone government
and RUFT rebels.
</P>
<P>
The RUF has been demanding certain key positions in a new
transitional government but Sierra Leone government had formerly
insisted that the rebels must transform themselves into a unarmed
political party and participate in next election.
</P>
<P>
The rebels has been waging war against successive governments
in Sierra Leone, since 1991. International community managed a
hard-earn cease-fire on May 24 to usher out the much desired
peace talks in Lome.
</P>
<P>
Since negotiations began, the two sides have agreed in
principle on the release of Sankoh, the jailed RUF leader who was
sentenced to death last October on treason charges.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have also agreed on the release of prisoners of war,
and to allow humanitarian relief to be distributed in their areas
of control.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the power-sharing, the thorny issue of the future
role of the Nigerian-led ECOMOG intervention still remains to be
sorted out. The ECOMOG force has been defending the government
against rebel insurgents.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warned Syria Before Air Raids on Lebanon: Arens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Prior to launching air raids on
Lebanon, Israel had warned Syria to stop Hezbollah guerrillas from
violating a 1996 cease-fire understanding which bars attacks
against and from civilian targets, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe
Arens said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Arens told Israel Radio that Israel had sent several messages
to Damascus in recent months, warning that it would not tolerate
Hezbollah attacks against Israel's northern areas.
</P>
<P>
"But unfortunately, the messages were not well received," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas fired Katyusha rocket salvos on
northern Israel on Thursday, killing two civilians.
</P>
<P>
Israel unleashed retaliatory air strikes against Hezbollah
bases and civilian targets in Lebanon on Thursday night, killing
at least eight people and destroying infrastructures such as power
stations and bridges.
</P>
<P>
This was the heaviest military offensive since Israel launched
the "Grapes of Wrath" operation against Lebanon in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed after the operation, the two warring
sides should refrain from attacks on or from civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military sources said Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon, had seemingly begun to contain Hezbollah activities
after the air strike, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a war of attrition
to oust Israel from a 15-km deep border zone it carved out
in 1985 in south Lebanon with a declared aim of preventing
cross-border attacks against Israel's northern areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel said Damascus is using Hezbollah activities as leverage
to force Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights it seized from
Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Though he accepts the United Nations Resolution 425 which
calls on Israel to withdraw from south Lebanon, the outgoing
Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes
any territorial concession on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, who defeated Netanyahu in the
May election, has pledged to pull Israeli troops out of Lebanon
within a year of office through negotiations with Syria, which
will necessitate territorial compromise on the Golan.
</P>
<P>
The talks with Syria have been frozen since they broke off in
early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Barak has distanced himself from the decision to strike
civilian targets in Lebanon. His office said he was informed only
after Netanyahu had made the decision.
</P>
<P>
But Arens said Barak did not oppose the strikes after learning
of the decision. Barak's office did not comment on Arens' remarks.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Palestinian National Authority
Saturday accused Israel of damaging Middle East peace efforts
by carrying out the air strikes against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"This dangerous escalation against Lebanon is a fatal strike
against the peace process and the international efforts to move
forward the Syrian and Lebanese negotiating tracks," the official
Palestinian news agency WAFA said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian PM Warns Youth of Drug Effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye Saturday warned youths against drug abuse and
trafficking saying that the practice could destroy their precious
lives.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye gave the warning in the Tanzanian capital when
officiating a ceremony to mark the World Drug Day, saying it is a
shame for a nation like Tanzania to be used as a drug trafficking
center, adding that the influence of drugs is much more serious
than that of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
"We should not tolerate those who use our kids to enrich
themselves," he said, noting that any young people should engage
in income generating activities allowed by laws.
</P>
<P>
He said it is astonishing to see that people involving in the
business are those who were unable to buy return air tickets.
</P>
<P>
In the celebrations which were attended by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) resident representative Sally
Fegan-Wyles, Sumaye said concerted efforts are needed to fight
against the scourge.
</P>
<P>
Fegan-Wyles read a message of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
that between three and four percent of the world's population
still regularly consume illegal substance.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister hailed non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
dealing with drug addicts for their commitment to help the youth.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Calls to Protect Youth from Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of Labor
and Social Affairs Hassen Abdella Saturday called on parents and
educational institutions to play a leading role in protecting the
youth from the adverse effects of drug abuse and illicit drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by the minister at a meeting here to mark
this year's international day against drug abuse and illicit drug
trafficking which falls on June 26.
</P>
<P>
Hassen said saving the youth from the ill-effects of drug abuse
is not a task to be brushed aside to the government alone.
</P>
<P>
He urged the society in general and parents as well as schools
in particular to work together to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Ethiopian government has issued a
national anti- drug policy, adding that the government is fully
committed to implement continental and international conventions
against illegal drug activities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Vice-Minister of Health Lamisso Hayiso
said there is a rapidly growing tendency of cannabis cultivation
and consumption in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He said as it is the case in other parts of the world, the most
 vulnerable group to drug abuse in Ethiopia is the youth.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of health has introduced a regular drug abuse
prevention educational program at 27 high schools in Addis Ababa
and Nazareth, he added.

NICOSIA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- All chapters pertaining to the
accession talks between Cyprus and the European Union (EU) will
have been examined by the end of this year, EU negotiator for
Cyprus Leopold Maurer said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Maurer arrived here on Wednesday at the head of a 13-member
European Commission delegation to pave the way for the next round
of negotiations on Cyprus' bid to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
He described the next chapters to be discussed, namely the
free movement of capital, goods and services, social policy,
transports, environment, taxation and energy as "very difficult."
</P>
<P>
Maurer said Cyprus's interest rate ceiling is an
"anachronistic" measure which has to be abolished as "it will
hamper the whole liberalization process in the chapter of free
movement of capital."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, Estonia, Slovenia, Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic started substantive accession negotiations with the EU in
November 1998.

<P>
BUCHAREST, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Romania agreed Saturday to grant
the passage through its airspace to 10 Russian aircraft en route
to Kosovo transporting peacekeeping soldiers and military
equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique by the Romanian Foreign Ministry and
Defense Ministry, the government granted the Russian request
raised Friday after urgent consultations with NATO.
</P>
<P>
Romania will treat Russia's request as an emergency case, which
means permission could take effect without approval from the
parliament, said the communique. Under Romanian laws, the passage
of foreign troops should be endorsed by the parliament except for
special and emergency cases, which can be permitted only by the
president.
</P>
<P>
In this circumstance, however, the foreign military aircraft
should pass through within four hours. Russia has agreed to
reformulate its half-hour flying interval to meet the regulation,
the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Romania on June 13 spiked Moscow's request for an air passage
to Kosovo because Russia had not reached an agreement with NATO on
the peacekeeping role in Kosovo.

BUDAPEST, June 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 scientists and
decision makers from all over the world are discussing the
challenges and opportunities of science in the next century as the
World Conference on Science opened here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
By bringing together representatives from all scientific fields,
the conference, entitled Science for the 21st century, will debate
the achievements, shortcomings and challenges of science as well
as its social, economic and ethnic implications in the decades to
come.
</P>
<P>
The passing century has witnessed amazing scientific
breakthroughs and the application of scientific achievements have
become a powerful engine for economic development.
</P>
<P>
But progress has come at a price of more natural disasters
provoked by global warming, an increasing scarcity of drinking
water, disappearing forests, plants and animal species, and air

<P>
At the same time, the after effects of the Chernobyl accident,

animals have raised fears for scientists' dangerous game with
Nature.

The World Conference on Science, the first global conference on

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Talks Seen to Break Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The British minister responsible
for Northern Ireland on Saturday expressed confidence that
last-minute talks to unblock the Northern Ireland peace process
would produce a deal next week.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a deal. I can't believe that anybody would not
realize the seriousness of the present situation. We'll make
something," Mo Mowlam was quoted telling BBC Ulster radio.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart
Bertie Ahern met leaders from across the province's political and
sectarian divide on Friday for four hours of talks aimed at
reviving the Good Friday peace deal signed last year.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said progress was made but difficulties
remained over two issues -- when and how Irish Republican Army
(IRA) guerrillas would hand over their weapons, and the place of
the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein in a power-sharing executive.
</P>
<P>
Blair has set Wednesday as a deadline for finding a solution,
warning both sides that the province is "staring into the abyss".
He and Ahern will return to Belfast to chair the talks on Monday.
</P>
<P>
They say all parties linked to the Good Friday agreement on
Friday backed fundamental principles including guerrilla
disarmament by May 2000 and the creation of a power-sharing
provincial cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"I think the chances are better now than they were on Friday
because I think on Friday, when we agreed the principles that
everybody signed up to, that was an important groundbreaking first
step," Reuters quoted Mowlam as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the powerful Ulster Unionist Party said it was still
waiting for a commitment to IRA disarmament from Sinn Fein and
that it would have to see weapons being given up before allowing
the IRA's political wing into the new executive.
</P>
<P>
Next week's political wrangling will coincide with the tense
run-up to the annual Protestant Orange Order march through the
village of Drumcree, which has become a byword for sectarian
violence after bitter clashes between Catholic nationalists and
Protestant in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam appealed for calm ahead of the July 4 march, noting that
"both sides in Drumcree should step back and look at what people
in Northern Ireland are feeling."
</P>
<P>
The annual "marching season" in the province is a traditional
flashpoint as Protestants in bowler hats and sashes take to the
streets to celebrate centuries-old Protestant victories in battle.

<HEADLINE> GCC Chief Condemns Israel's Attacks Against Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil Al-Hujailan Saturday condemned the
latest Israeli air raids against Lebanese targets, saying it is
proof of Israel's hostile policy toward the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli aggression on Lebanon took place at a time when
high hopes emerged for a pro-peace new Israeli government after
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak won the May elections, said the GCC
chief.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes, during the past two days, launched heavy
air raids against Lebanese infrastructure and civilian areas,
leaving at least eight people killed and 60 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states support the general Arab stance calling for the
establishment of a just and comprehensive peace based on
respecting all related U.N. resolutions and the land-for-peace
principle, said Al-Hujailan.
</P>
<P>
He said the GCC countries have agreed that Israel must
implement all signed agreements with the Arabs, especially with
the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
He called on the world community to double its efforts to build
a just and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance
established in 1981, groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Hire 30,000 Teachers for New School Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday announced 1.2 billion dollars in grants to hire 30,000
teachers for the new school year, a program approved by Congress
with bipartisan support last year.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately there are some in Congress who are backing away
from their commitment to reduce class size" by financing a total
of 100,000 new teachers, Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
"I think a promise made in an election year should be kept in
the years when there are no elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has turned to domestic issues after several months of
the Kosovo crisis as the 2000 presidential election is approaching.
</P>
<P>
Racing against the 2000 political calendar, Clinton promised
"to be working right up to the very end" of his term.
</P>
<P>
Clinton acknowledges the reality that "the closer you get to
the election the more difficult it will be to pass anything."
</P>
<P>
In a domestic policy speech Friday at Georgetown University,
Clinton called on Congress to approve his proposals on the issues
such as gun control, Medicare, Social Security and child care.
</P>
<P>
House Republicans, who are reluctant to cooperate with the
president, showcased their own priorities Friday to bolster
national security, improve education, cut taxes and safeguard the
Social Security surplus for improving the program.

<HEADLINE> Wanda Flops Again Chinese First Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- An injury time header and broiling
temperatures sank defending champions Dalian Wanda to another
defeat, a narrow 1-2 to Beijing Guo'an in a Chinese first division
soccer match here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wanda, who snatched their first win of the season on Thursday
with a 3-1 victory over Guangzhou Songri, found themselves back to
the familiar losing form as they fell to their 10th unwinning
match in the scorching Beijing sun.
</P>
<P>
Striker Nan Fang, boyfriend of the diving Olympic champion Fu
Mingxia, emerged as the hero of the home side, breaking the
deadlock in the 20th minute and killing the match for Guo'an with
a raking header in the 91st minute.
</P>
<P>
Wanda briefly revived their hopes for an away draw when center
forward Wang Tao levelled the match at 1-1 after 81 minutes, but
the four-time champions in the last five year failed to hold on.
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed coach Li Yingfa, citing a sore throat, didn
't show up in the after-match news conference, while his
understudy, assistant manager Sui Wei blamed the hot weather for
their another dismal performance.
</P>
<P>
Wanda remained on the wrong end of the 14-team standings table
with nine points from 11 round of matches standing at the 13th
spot.
</P>
<P>
1995 league champions Shanghai Shenhua claimed the top spot for
the first time this season, after beating Guangzhou Songri 2-1 on
home turf.
</P>
<P>
Former pace-setters Sichuan Quanxing slided two places to the
third with their 1-2 away loss to Liaoning Fushun.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in today's action, Chongqing Longxin was forced to a
1-1 tie by visiting Shenzhen Ping'an; Luneng Taishan nipped
Shenyang Haishi for a 1-0 win; Jilin Aodong edged the bottom club
Wuhan Heart K 1-0 at home; Tianjin Taida scored a 1-0 narrow home
win over Qingdao Hainiu.

<HEADLINE> China Speeding Up Community Service Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- China will try to speed up the
development of its service industry in urban communities, a senior
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
China's city dwellers usually live in close communities in
separate zones where services are in short supply. According to
one study of seven major Chinese cities, more than 70 percent of
the urban families badly need services like appliance repairs,
newspapers and house cleaning.
</P>
<P>
This area could absorb 11 million more workers, Yang Yanyin,
deputy minister of civil affairs, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the community service business in China has been
developing rapidly since 1986, when the Civil Affairs Ministry
first called for growth in the sector. She said that it used to be
entirely government sponsored and most of those who benefited from
it were either handicapped or living in extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
But these days urbanites can enjoy services available in their
neighborhoods so the next step is to socialize the community
service industry before industrializing the sector, she said,
explaining that in most major Chinese cities, funds from various
investors are being channeled into local service businesses.
</P>
<P>
At the preliminary stage, the most important purpose of
socialization of these services is still to maintain social
results and there is a long way to go before China can
industrialize the community service sector, she said.

<HEADLINE> French President to Attend EU-South America Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac left
here on Sunday for Brazil to attend the first summit of European
Union (EU) and South American countries to be held in Rio de
Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his departure for Brasilia, Chirac said that he
hopes the summit can promote the political, economic and cultural
relations between the EU and South American countries.
</P>
<P>
He called on South American countries to build closer economic
and trade ties with Europe to avoid a domination by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU is worried about the U.S. strategy to
absorb the whole South American market into the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which groups the United States,
Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to counter-balance the U.S. offensive, the EU
seeks to build a bilateral free trade zone with Argentina, Brazil,
Chile and Uruguay in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Brazilian newspaper "O Estrado de Sao
Paulo" published on Sunday, Chirac warned that a greater
integration of South American economies with the United States
will harm the EU's economic interests.
</P>
<P>
"France attaches great importance to the existence of a
balanced relationship between Latin America, the United States and
Europe. It wants a multi-polar world with strong economic entities
in different regions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state or government of 48 EU, South American and
Caribbean countries are expected to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
The South American leaders have called on the EU to give up
trade protectionism as a condition for their closer economic and
trade relations.

<HEADLINE> Economists Call for Closer Links Among Mainland, HK, Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Economists from China's mainland,
Hong Kong and Macao agreed at a seminar held here on Sunday that
closer economic links should be promoted among them.
</P>
<P>
They said the three areas have become more interdependent
economically over the past two decades since the reform and
opening-up was launched in the mainland, and their cooperation is
also becoming stronger.
</P>
<P>
With Hong Kong's return and Macao's upcoming return to the
motherland, the three areas should seize the opportunities and
achieve common prosperity by making good use of their respective
advantages, according to the economists.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong should retain its status as a regional center of
finance, commerce, information and transportation, and such a
status is of great significance to the development of the mainland
and Macao, they said.
</P>
<P>
For the mainland and Hong Kong, there exist great potentials
for their cooperation in high-tech research and application. The
mainland enjoys strong scientific and technological facilities,
but many research achievements are put on the shelf. In comparison,
Hong Kong has developed market network and abundant
financial resources.
</P>
<P>
Macao has close links with the European Union, Taiwan and the
Pearl River Delta in south China. In this sense, Macao is able to
introduce advanced high technology to the Pear River Delta and
other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
And the products from the Peal River Delta and other areas of
China can be sold around the world with the help of established
marketing network in Macao and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As for the close bonds between Hong Kong and Macao, Hong Kong
business people have been major investors in Macao's tourism,
gambling, manufacturing, export, real estate, finance,
telecommunications and transportation sectors.
</P>
<P>
With both areas practicing free market economy and enjoying a
high degree of autonomy, it is possible for the two to achieve
economic integration sometime in the future, they said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Speaks About Securities Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
today called for a greater effort to safeguard the development of
the securities market as it is an integral part of the country's
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The securities market has played an active role in accelerating
China's economic development in the past few years and should be
used to support the reforms and development of state-owned
enterprises, Wen told a national meeting on the supervision and
regulation of futures and securities markets.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, which ended here today, was hosted by
the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the nation's
securities watchdog, shortly before the country's first Securities
Law takes effect as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
By listing them on the stock market, the state-owned businesses
could raise capital, transform their management, and then
restructure totally, he said. Maintaining the healthy development
of the securities market will be of great importance.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that it will help by improving the supervision and
standardization of trading practices in the securities market, and
tough measures are needed to control the stock exchanges, listed
companies, securities companies, and intermediary institutions
according to law.
</P>
<P>
He said that the interests of investors need to be protected to
keep the securities market running safely and efficiently and the
qualifications of officials in charge of this need to be improved
in order to reduce market risks.
</P>
<P>
According to officials at the conference, the CSRC's branches
nationwide will start operation on July 1, forming a centralized
and unified network of securities supervisors.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The French government on Sunday

residence castle of 18th century French philosopher Voltaire which

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Official Expects Higher Oil Prices by Yearend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti oil official
predicted on Sunday the oil prices might edge up beyond 18
U.S. dollars per barrel in the fourth quarter of 1999 due to the
cutdown of supplies in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
based his estimation on many factors, mainly the reduction of oil
supply as a result of output cut by major oil producing countries,
the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the prospect of the world demand for oil to reach 1
million barrels per day (bpd) in the year would also help
lift the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the growing demand to the "happy
ending of the economic crisis that stormed Asian countries in the
past couple of years, coupled with a boom in the U.S. and European
economies."
</P>
<P>
Another factor likely to prompt up the oil prices, he said, is
that non-Opec nations would not increase production this year due
to the sagging oil prices in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti oil official also voiced satisfaction over
the Opec member states' commitment to a production reduction
agreement that will expire in March 2000, saying the commitment
has yielded positive outcome, especially in the second quarter,
during which demand is traditionally weak..
</P>
<P>
Opec members, along with some non-Opec countries, agreed last
March to slash their output by about 2.1 million bpd.

<HEADLINE> Defense Should Be Improved Through Science: Jiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today urged the armed forces of the country to increase their
consciousness of improving themselves through science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
He told delegates at the 14th Meeting of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA)'s Institutes of Higher Learning that the
armed forces should develop a large contingent of skilled
technological personnel who are loyal to the Communist Party of
China (CPC) and the people.
</P>
<P>
Since the Third Plenary Session of the CPC's 11th National
Congress in 1978, the PLA's institutes of higher learning have
trained a great number of people for military development and made
significant contributions to building a revolutionary, modern army,
said Jiang, who is also general secretary of the CPC Central
Committee and chairman of Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said that the institutes of higher learning have carried out
important instructions of Deng Xiaoping and that under the
military strategy in the new period, they have adapted to the
changing situation, continued reforms, and improved the quality
and standards of teaching.
</P>
<P>
The world is experiencing rapid changes in science and
technology while the military is undergoing profound changes, he
said. Information will be the greatest factor in fighting ability
in the battlefields of the future and this contest will be one of

<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang said that, in the face of new military developments in
the world, an effort needs to be made to strengthen defense and
the military's ability to cope with hi-tech regional wars.
</P>
<P>
The PLA's institutes of higher learning are training bases for
skilled personnel and they should receive top priority, Jiang said,
asking their leaders to work harder and accomplish more in their
courses.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that priority should be given to ideological and
political development. Efforts should be made to arm the students
with Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping
Theory so as to help them develop a correct view of the world, of
life, and of values and to enhance their sense of mission and
responsibility and of devoting themselves to national defense and
military development.
</P>
<P>
The institutes need to make sure that the students are
politically qualified, the president stressed, adding that the
level of students in the institutes has to be improved
comprehensively.
</P>
<P>
He said that the level and standards of the staff determine the
level of teaching and without a highly qualified contingent of
staff, talk about developing talented students will be empty talk.
</P>
<P>
A major reason why the Harbin Military Institute of Technology
became as prestigious as Beijing University and Qinghua University,
he said, is that it had a group of internationally famous
specialists and professors.

<P>
The institutes should perfect policies and systems and maintain
favorable conditions to attract good students and let young
teachers with innovative ideas excel, Jiang said, adding that this
should be one of their major duties.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the armed forces as a whole should join the
effort and concentrate on building the institutes of higher
learning.
</P>
<P>
He asked PLA officers and departments at all levels to proceed
with the strategy of modernizing national defense and the military
in the next century and take the initiative to support the
development of the institutes.
</P>
<P>
He said that these institutes of higher learning should make
full use of their skill and push for scientific and technological
innovations.
</P>
<P>
He also asked them to play a bigger role in scientific research
for national defense, academic research on military sciences, and
the use of scientific and technological developments for combat
readiness.
</P>
<P>
The institutes must actively provide the troops and military
departments with services in knowledge, technology and information.
</P>
<P>
The general principles and guidelines for the development of
the PLA institutes of higher learning have already been set, he
said, and asked the delegates to earnestly implement these
principles, be innovative and aggressive and continue to make new
achievements in teaching.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Awaiting News on Peace Efforts on Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- As last ditch attempts to
salvage the peace process in Congo (K) continued in Zambia Sunday,
President Thabo Mbeki remained at home, awaiting the ripe time to
jet off for the African heads of state summit.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki would go to the summit when he got an indication from
Zambia's President Frederick Chiluba that the summit would produce
concrete results, Mbeki's spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa told reporters
here in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage there has been no indication as to when the
president, together with other regional leaders, may arrive for
the summit," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The summit aims to end the 11-month conflict between Congolese
President Laurent Kabila's government and the Tutsi-led rebels.
</P>
<P>
Mamoepa said Mbeki was in constant contact with Chiluba and
South African ministers in Lusaka, and was kept abreast of
developments.
</P>
<P>
"The president is giving the current peace process his full
support," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, African defense and foreign ministers on Sunday
afternoon continued bilateral meetings in Lusaka -- aimed at
ensuring sufficient consensus for a draft cease-fire document
presented to them by negotiators, according to South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
These ministers were presented with the document on Saturday
night to study before any plenary session could take place.
</P>
<P>
They were likely to meet on Sunday evening to tie up loose ends
in the proposed cease-fire agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- France has called on Israel and the
Lebanese Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas to stop attacking each
other and "go out of the logic of reprisal."
</P>
<P>
The French envoy to the Middle East, Yves Aubin de la
Messuziere, who had discussed with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
and Prime Minister Salim Hoss, said in Beirut on Sunday that the
Committee of Surveillance of the Ceasefire in Lebanon is the only
right place to resolve violations against the 1996 ceasefire
agreement between Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Committee of Surveillance, which consists of France, the
United States, Israel, Lebanon and Syria, will meet on Tuesday to
discuss the tension between Israel and Lebanon following the
Israel air raids against Lebanon last week.
</P>
<P>
Eight people were killed and about 60 injured in Lebanon during
the Israeli raids, which destroyed infrastructures of civil
service like bridges and electricity power plants and deprived
Beirut of electricity for three days.
</P>
<P>
Israel made the raids after two people were killed in rocket
attacks by Hezbollah on Galilee, a northern Israeli city.
</P>
<P>
Messuziere arrived in Beirut Sunday morning from Damascus,
where he met with Syrian President Hafez Assad, said French
Foreign Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
He was sent by French President Jacques Chirac to Lebanon to
show France's support to the country. Chirac has expressed his
regret about the Israeli air raids and said that France stands by
Lebanon in its new confrontation with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Former British Tennis Fame: Remove the Grass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Former British Davis Cup player
John Lloyd called to remove grass for the sake of the Wimbledon
championship and All England Club event should be played on more
even surface.
</P>
<P>
The uneven pace of grass reduced the quality of tennis at
Wimbledon, according to Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
"The tournament would be a lot better off with the demise of
grass," he wrote in a newspaper column for the Independent On
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of tennis would improve by leaps and bounds, it
would be three times better to watch." the Independent quoted
Lloyd.'
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said the backlash from converting the world's premier
grass court tournament into a synthetic court event would be short-
lived and the essence of Wimbledon would survive.
</P>
<P>
"This is not meant as a snub to Wimbledon, which is the
greatest event in the sport, but it is not the grass at Wimbledon
that makes it so special," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Digging up the grass would cause a slight blip and then it
would be quickly forgotten. Wimbledon would be so much better on a
medium-paced surface."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.'s NAPA, the automobile
parts company, opened its first distribution center in China here
today on a franchise basis.
</P>
<P>
The NAPA Lamba Auto Parts Chain Store Co. Ltd is one of
thousands of foreign or domestic franchises in China and analysts
predict that franchises will be China's favorite marketing form in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
The franchisee buys the rights to a franchiser's name and
established operating systems. Statistics show about a third of
the U.S.'s retail sales coming from franchise stores each year,
and every 7 minutes, a new one is opened.
</P>
<P>
China's franchise business was born out of the chain store
business and in its several years it has grown well, according to
Pei Liang of the China Chain Store &AMP; Franchise Association. He
says that 31 percent of the enterprises with annual sales above 50
million yuan last year were franchise stores.
</P>
<P>
China had some 90 chain stores in 1997, a third of which were
franchises. But last year, the number of chain stores with sales
above 50 million yuan hit 121, and 40 percent of those were
franchises.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Ends Chronic Grain Shortage (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and farmers
are now able to offer a definite answer to the question "Who will
feed China?" that aroused worldwide concerned four years ago as
continuous harvests have provided enough grain to the world's most
populous nation.
</P>
<P>
"China has put an end to the situation of chronic grain
shortages, and basically balanced its grain supply and demand, due
to good grain harvests in the past four consecutive years," said
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji at a recent grain marketing system
reform conference.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time China has confirmed a grain surplus for
a population of some 1.25 billion at a time when its grain
marketing reform is proceeding smoothly. The country experienced
regional grain oversupplies in 1984 and 1990, but officials at the
Ministry of Agriculture attributed this to a poor grain marketing
system.
</P>
<P>
Sector insiders estimate that China has increased its grain
output by more than 180 billion kg during the past four years,
while its grain demand only amounted to 50 billion kg in the same
period, with an obvious supply surplus over consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
"We were kept too busy growing grain in the past, but now we
can take our time. And moreover, we have sufficient grain reserves.
What do we need to worry about?" said Cui Shi'an, director of the
planting administration department of the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China's agroscience level and calamity-resistance capacity have
grown to ensure grain harvests, with an output gap of only 10
billion kg, whether the years are good ones or lean ones, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
"China has no problem in maintaining and increasing grain
production, so long as it enjoys social and political stability,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Improved agricultural infrastructure and adoption of modern
agrosciences have made it possible for the country to stabilize
its annual grain production at about 500 billion kg, or some 400
kg for every Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Ends Chronic Grain Shortage (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past 50 years, China has managed to increase annual
grain output from 100 billion kilograms to 500 billion kilograms.
Insiders attribute the growth mainly to government policies and
investment in agricultural science and technology.
</P>
<P>
China's leaders have always placed agriculture at the top of
the national economic development agenda and have racked their
brains to find ways to provide food for all the people.
</P>
<P>
The household responsibility contract system, which was adopted
in the early 1980s, made farmers more enthusiastic about growing
grain and the two grain purchase price increases in the 1990s also
helped. Modern agronomy and the plastic sheeting and better
quality seed technology have begun to contribute to the country's
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Sufficient grain supplies have made it possible for the central
government and farmers to turn to higher quality grain types and
the government says that it will no longer protect poor-quality
crops.
</P>
<P>
"This move will affect farmers' incomes somewhat, but in the
long run, it will benefit them because China has no other choice
but to develop high-quality agriculture to feed its growing
population," according to Chen Ke, who is in charge of grain macro-
controls at the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that China will have 1.3 billion people by the
year 2000 and 1.6 billion by 2030, so it will find itself in a
relatively tight situation, which is why the central government
wants badly to protect farmland, develop water-saving agriculture,
and tap the potential of agronomy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the grain marketing system reforms are intended to
raise farmers' and grain marketers' awareness of market
competition and to promote grain production and marketing while
giving a role to the world market in regulating China's grain
supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
The central government has always been sober-minded about food
problems as can be seen in the Agriculture Action Plan of China's
Agenda 21, where 10 out of 39 projects involve grain production.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Leader Criticizes Dalai Lama's Separatism (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Legqog, the chairman of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua today
said that the Dalai Lama's separatism under the guise of
negotiations will never work and will be in vain.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama long advocated "Tibetan independence" and has
said repeatedly in recent years that he wants to negotiate with
China's central government, Legqog said, But his true intention is
to engage in divisiveness in the name of negotiations and this is
political trickery.
</P>
<P>
Since he fled abroad in 1959, the Dalai Lama has been obstinate
in his attempts to gain "Tibetan independence." In September of
1987 and June of 1988, he proposed a "Five-Point Plan" before the
Human Rights Sub-committee of the U.S. House of Representatives
and "New Proposals" at a press conference at the European
Parliament in Strasbourg, France.
</P>
<P>
On both occasions, he claimed to be holding negotiations with
the central government based on the "Five-Point Plan" and the "New
Proposals" but, Legqog said, the "Five-Point Plan" and "New
Proposal" in fact advocated "Tibetan independence" and the idea
that "Tibet was an independent country."
</P>
<P>
The essence of the Dalai Lama's position was the denial of the
fact that the Chinese government has full sovereignty over Tibet.
When the 10th Panchen Lama passed away in early 1989, the Buddhist
Association of China invited the Dalai Lama to return to China to
attend funeral services and its President Zhao Puchu handed over
an invitation letter to the Dalai Lama's representative but he
refused the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, there have been some riots in Lhasa that were
instigated by a small group of separatists. It has been shown that
the Dalai Lama's "government in exile" not only provided financial
aid to the separatists but also sent people to organize and
participate in the riots. They continue to hold so-called "
uprising commemorations" outside China on March 10 every year and,
on such occasions, the Dalai Lama himself will deliver speeches
and advocate divisiveness.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Leader Criticizes Dalai Lama's Separatism (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legqog said that seeing China's international status improving
with its economic growth and social stability, the Dalai Lama had
to ask for renewed contacts with the central government and there
were proper channels for contacts and talks between his private
representative and Chinese central government departments, but the
representative made public information about the contacts and
distorted the contents in an attempt to mislead the public.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the Dalai Lama broke off all contacts with
the central government and shut the door on contacts. In recent
years, he has continued to move from one place to another,
reviving his claim that he wants to hold negotiations with the
central government, but he has continued to lie about the history
of Tibet at various public occasions and has attempted to mold
public opinion to support "Tibetan independence."
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama and his followers have never stopped their
propaganda and support for dividing the motherland in the Tibet
Autonomous Region and have been responsible for stirring up acts
of violence and terrorism in Lhasa and other places and have
plotted "peace marches" and "referendums" abroad.
</P>
<P>
They attempted to internationalize the "Tibet issue," Legqog
said. In March 1997, the Dalai Lama went to Taiwan where he
collaborated with "Taiwan Independence" forces and planned to open
an office of his "exiled government" in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The central government has stated repeatedly that it can
negotiate with the Dalai Lama and has welcomed him to end his
exile and return to the motherland to do things that benefit the
Tibetan people, provided that he completely abandons his notion of
"Tibetan independence" and recognizes that Tibet is an inseparable
part of China's territory and ceases his activities to divide the
motherland, Legqog said.
</P>
<P>
The central government's principled stand and basic attitude
have always been consistent and explicit, and the Dalai Lama knows
this. He is insincere in his desire to negotiate with the Chinese
central government and his claim that he wants to negotiate with
it is a mere pretext to deceive the world's people.
</P>
<P>
His attempt was to divide the motherland and to restore the
theocratic feudal system of serfdom that dominated Tibet with a
combination of political and religious power, Legqog concluded.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Bombs Eritrea's Assab Airport Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian air force again
bombed Eritrea's Assab airport, a strategic military target, at
7:00 a.m. Sunday morning, Ethiopia announced here Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"This is the second attack on this strategic military target in
two days, " said a press statement issued here by the Office of
the Ethiopian Government Spokesperson Selome Taddesse.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian air force also attacked the airport at the Red
Sea port of Assab at 10:00 a.m. earlier on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that Sunday's "attack by the Ethiopian
air force caused extensive damage to the runway and Assab
airport."
</P>
<P>
But it did not mention the ground fighting between the
Ethiopian and Eritrean armies at the western front near the
vicinity of Mereb River which broke out Friday.
</P>
<P>
An earlier announcement made by the office Saturday evening
claimed that "5,950 Eritrean soldiers have been killed, captured
or wounded" in the fighting Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But so far Eritrea has not confirmed its toll.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea blamed each other for initiating more
fighting in the wake of renewed calls from the Organization of
Africa Unity (OAU) and the U.N. Security Council for immediate and
unconditional cease-fire between the two Horn of Africa neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Friday's offensive came after a one-week lull in hostilities.
Prior to that, there had been intense fighting around the Mereb
River from June 9 to 17.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian defense forces claimed to have put over 24,450
Eritrean soldiers out of action during the period, whereas Asmara
said its forces had killed or wounded more than 18,000 Ethiopian
soldiers during the week-long fighting.
</P>
<P>
The war between the two countries broke out on May 6,1998 over
a disputed stretch of their border area.

<HEADLINE> Iran Suspends Planned Flight to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's national flag carrier
Sunday canceled its planned first flight to Lebanese capital
Beirut because of the Israeli air blitz on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The flight is due for today, but Iran Air cancelled it and
did not set the new date for it," said an official of Lebanon's
national airline Middle East Airline (MEA).
</P>
<P>
He said Iran Air made the decision in the wake of the Israeli
air strikes on Lebanon two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Iran Air and MEA signed an agreement to resume
flights between the two countries, which have been suspended since
the Iran 1979 Islamic revolution. MEA has made the first flight to
Tehran on May 21.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Israel launched the biggest strike on
Lebanon since the 1996 "Grapes of Wrath" operation, killing at
least eight people and injuring more than 60 others.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed its attacks, which also destroyed the country's
power stations, road networks and a communication center, were
in retaliation for the cross-border attacks by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah argued that it fired Katyusha rockets into northern
Israel in order to avenge the wounding of a Lebanese women by
Israeli shelling.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war
against the Israeli occupation troops out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Residents in Northern Israel Strike Over Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Israelis in the
north blocked major road junctions on Sunday as part of their
strike over the security and economic situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
A group of representatives of the demonstrators, including some
local council members, gathered in front of the Prime Minister
Office in Jerusalem to protest against the government's policy of
not paying economic compensation to the damage caused by the
Katyusha rocket attacks recently.
</P>
<P>
"The recent Katyusha attack on the north by Hezbollah has not
only caused security problems for us, but caused tremendous
economic demage to our economy and the government should
compensate that for us as it promised to do so," one protesters
told Xinhua in front of the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
"We just want to tell the outgoing government and the incoming
new government under Ehud Barak to settle the security issue in
the north and pay attention to our economic situation there
because daily business in the north has badly affected by the
attacks," the protesters added.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of Katyusha rocket attacks by the Lebanese
Hezbollah on the Galilee area in northern Israel occurred
Thursday, in which two people in Kiryat Shimona were killed and
nearly 30 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the rocket attacks, Israeli Air Force fighters
launched air strikes against Lebanese power and transformer
stations, key bridges and communication centers as well as
Hezbollah targets.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the northerners were once again ordered to
stay inside the bomb shelters due to the threat of shellings or
rockets from Lebanon. They were only allowed to return home Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During Sunday's demonstration, 13 local and regional councils
along the northern border also closed their municipal services to
the public, according to protesters.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the damage from Thursday's rocket attacks was
estimated at 5 million U.S. dollars, but the indirect effect on
local industry, tourism and business generally is expected to
reach millions more, they said.

<HEADLINE> NPC's Clarification on Right of Abode Issue Well Received in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of various
sectors in Hong Kong issued statements today to render their full
support for the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the
Basic Law concerning the right of abode issue by China's National
People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
They all hailed the move as a demonstration of safeguarding the
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee issued its interpretation earlier
Saturday. The interpretation will drastically reduce the number of
mainlanders eligible for the right of abode to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong deputies to the NPC and members of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, expressed their all-out support for the NPC's
clarification, adding that the interpretation which clarifies the
legislative intent of the relevant provisions of the Basic Law is
lawful and reasonable.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the NPC's interpretation has been made after
widely soliciting opinions of different sectors in Hong Kong,
whose action is believed to win a wide support from the Hong Kong
residents because it conforms to their fundamental interest and to
safeguarding the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
In their statements, local industrialists and businessmen
agreed that the NPC's interpretation will help improve Hong Kong's
commercial environment and benefit its long-term stability and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Many lawyers pointed out that the NPC's interpretation will not
bring a bit of harms to the spirit of a high-degree of autonomy
and judicial independence for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Actually, it helps Hong Kong solve its practical problems and
maintain the normal order of its society.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Discover Ancient Tombs in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists recently
unearthed 123 ancient tombs dating as far back as the Warring
States Period (475-221 B.C.) and as recent as the Qing Dynasty (
1644-1911) in Liulin County, north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports indicate that 78 tombs date to the Warring
States Period, 36 to the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 220 A.D.) and nine
to the Ming and Qing dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Chambers in the Warring States tombs are 3-5 meters long and 1.
8-4 meters wide. The tombs were found at a depth of 4-7 meters.
</P>
<P>
Most of the brick Han Dynasty tombs have been looted and
heavily damaged, with only one tomb containing recoverable relics
such as carved doors and pillars.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists note that 400-odd pottery, stone, bone, jade,
bronze, lacquer and porcelain recovered during the excavations
will be highly valuable for future research into the politics,
economy and culture in ancient China.

<HEADLINE> French Envoy Visits Lebanon on Israeli Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A French Senior Official Sunday
made a visit to Beirut to discuss the latest development after the
Israeli air blitz on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Yves Messuziere, who heads French Foreign Ministry's Middle
East and North Africa Department, held talks with Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, he told a news conference that he discussed
the dangerous security situation on the borer with Lebanese
leaders and the solution to it.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Lebanon and Israel end the
strike-and-revenge formula soon and settle the problem through
the international monitoring committee.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Hoss insisted that Lebanese government will
continue to support the resistance movement as long as any inch of
Lebanese land is occupied in the hands of Israel, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister hoped that the coming truce monitoring
committee approve a bill condemning the Israeli aggression on
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, Israel launched the biggest strike on Lebanon
since the 1996 "Grapes of Wrath" operation, killing at least
eight people and wounding more than 60 others.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed its attacks, which also destroyed the
country's power stations, road networks and a communication
center, were in retaliation for the cross-border attacks by
guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah argued that it fired Katyushas into northern Israel
in order to avenge the wounding of a Lebanese women by Israeli
shelling.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah and Israeli forces have been in fighting nearly on a
daily basis.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring committee, compromising representatives from the
United States, France, Syria, Israel and Lebanon, was established
to oversee the implementation of a cease-fire understanding
reached between Hezbollah and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The committee is scheduled to convene under Lebanon's request
to review the complaints filed by both Lebanon and Israel who
charge each other for violating the understanding.
</P>
<P>
Messuziere came here Sunday morning from Damascus, where he
held talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on the same
issue.
</P>
<P>
With 35,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, Syria is the main
power broker in the country.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Welcome NPC's Interpretation of Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Major Hong Kong-based newspapers
voiced support today for the interpretation of the Basic Law by
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
saying that the move helps maintain Hong Kong's prosperity,
stability and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-language newspaper "Wen Wei Po" said in an
editorial that the NPC Standing Committee's interpretation of the
Basic Law gives the most authoritative and accurate explanation of
the legislative intent of some provisions.
</P>
<P>
The courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
have then criteria to follow when citing some provisions of the
Basic Law in the trial.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the NPC Standing Committee's
interpretation reflects the will of the general public, including
all circles of Hong Kong and foreign investors in the region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors all regard the interpretation as beneficial
to the Hong Kong residents and business circle, and it will by no
means weaken the judicial independence of Hong Kong, the newspaper
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The "Ta Kung Pao" newspaper noted that interpretation adopted
by the NPC Standing Committee is of extremely significance to
increase the Hong Kong residents' understanding of the Basic Law
and rule of the region by law.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that social disorder may arise if people do not act
in accordance with the Basic Law, it said, noting that only with a
true observation of the Basic Law can the SAR's power of final
adjudication and the status of judicial independence be ensured.
</P>
<P>
The interpretation gives a more clear definition on the
qualifications of those inland children born of the Hong Kong
residents, it said, and makes sure that they would come to Hong
Kong in order and jointly contribute to Hong Kong's development.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also praised the correct, wise and lawful
measures taken by the chief executive and the SAR government in
solving the right of abode issue.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government managed to prevent some social problem that
may occur with the possible influx of 1.67 million immigrants and
soundly settled the issue with the help of the central government.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, the Hong Kong commercial daily noted that the
rule of law is the basis for social stability, and to safeguard
the rule of law requires the concerted efforts of all the citizens
in the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The NPC's interpretation does not mean interfering into the
judicial independence of the SAR and will not harm the
authoritativeness of the Court of Final Appeal, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government, the central government, and the NPC all
respect the SAR's judicial independence and safeguard the
authoritativeness of the Court of Final Appeal, the newspaper said.

<P>
SHIGAZE, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Panchen Lama attended a
summer thangka-exhibition ceremony at Tibet's Zhaxi Lhunbo
Lamasery today and presented hada (white silk used as a gift) for
the lamasery's thangkas (paintings on brocade) featuring prominent
Buddhas.
</P>
<P>
Today is May 14 on the traditional Tibetan calendar and for
more than 500 years, for three days starting today, three thangkas
with the Amitaya, Sakyamuni, and Maiyuiri Buddhas are placed in
the sun up against a 40-meter wall to bring good luck and dispel
disasters.
</P>
<P>
Lamas and many Buddhists who traveled long distances to the
lamasery prostrated themselves and presented hadas and prayed that
Buddha may help dispel disasters and bring good luck.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Panchen Lama went up onto a roof of a hall and waved
to the crowd of worshipers who paid their respects to the 9-year-
old lama.
</P>
<P>
Erdeni Losang Qamba Lhunzhub Qoigyijabu, the 11th Panchen Lama,
returned to Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery on June 20 after religious
activities in Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region,
southwest China.

Zhaxi Lhunbo covers 300,000 sq.m. and has been the residence of
all previous Panchen Lamas. It was built in 1447 and is one of six
major monasteries of Tibetan Buddhism and a major place for
Tibetan Buddhists to perform religious activities.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says UNSCOM Spying Charges Understandable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
has confirmed that there was some evidence showing that U.N.
weapons inspectors in Iraq were involved in spying for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"I think there was a measure of justification in those
allegations and Washington never denied it," Annan told BBC
television on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Scott Ritter, a former weapon inspector, had
said Washington used the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), which
was in charge of Iraqi disarmament, to obtain information on how
to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the allegation was understandable.
</P>
<P>
"The suspicion will always be there: 'Are they coming to disarm
or are they coming to spy'," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"That was worrisome because it not only undermined UNSCOM but
it could undermine future disarmament regimes," he said.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has not been in Iraq since U.S.-British bombing raids in
last December.

vehicles and five motor cycles to intensify patrols within the

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Western Leaders to Help Repair Damaged Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
on Sunday urged the western leaders to help repair damaged
Yugoslavia before there is another humanitarian disaster in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"We have to make sure that the Serbs, who in some ways are
victims, should not be twice punished," Annan told the BBC's
Breakfast with Frost program.
</P>
<P>
"We said at the beginning of the war that the fight was not
with the Yugoslav people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we say we are only going to offer humanitarian assistance,
I hope we are going to define it in a broad manner to include
electrical supplies and water, which are life sustaining," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said electricity and water systems in Yugoslavia had been
destroyed by 10 weeks of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief warned of another refugee crisis if power was not
restored by the onset of the harsh Balkan winter.
</P>
<P>
"Come winter, if (the Serb people) have no heat, they may also
be on the move," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Each time I have the chance I am telling the NATO leaders
that we need to be careful not to box ourselves in. If we do that,
it will create another humanitarian disaster," said the secretary
general.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the rebuilding of the whole southeastern European
region would take about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He said aid should be offered irrespective of whether President
Slobodan Milosevic stays in power.
</P>
<P>
NATO countries like the United States and Britain had ruled out
any money to rebuild Yugoslavia without a change of government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Kosovo, tensions between Serbs and ethnic
Albanians remain high, as Albanians continue to conduct reprisals.
</P>
<P>
Albanians in Kosovo have looted and torched thousands of Serb
houses across Kosovo since NATO arrived, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Albanians are settling scores, and until
NATO stops the reprisals, it will not be able to restore law and
order or impose peace.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Energy Minister Concludes Visit to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of Energy and
Mineral Resources Suleiman Abu-Aleem said here Sunday that Jordan
and Iraq agreed on developing oil relations and hoped that the U.N.
embargo imposed on Iraq would be lifted soon.
</P>
<P>
Abu-Aleem made the remarks in a statement before his departure.
</P>
<P>
He said he was happy of the results of his four-day visit to
Iraq. Joint minutes were signed by the two sides on Saturday
evening to tackle an agreement of last January that is part of a
bilateral oil protocol to secure Jordan's needs for crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rasheed said after signing
the joint minutes that "Iraq is ready to meet the needs of any
Arab country" for crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed praised the oil cooperation between Iraq and Jordan,
saying "it is a good example for the joint Arab cooperation," the
Iraqi News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Abu-Aleem, who left for home Sunday, said in Baghdad upon his
arrival on Wednesday that he would discuss with Iraqi officials on
the possibility for the Jordanian Petroleum Company to develop an
Iraqi oil field.
</P>
<P>
However, Saturday's joint minutes made no mention about that,
which indicates that the two sides have not reach an agreement on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Under the joint Iraqi-Jordanian oil protocol signed last
January, Iraq will provide Jordan with 4.8 million tons of crude
oil in 1999 at preferential prices.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq has provided all
Jordan's needs for crude oil and derivatives under U.N. permission.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced earlier that Iraq and Jordan were preparing for
the final stages to start the construction of an Iraqi-Jordanian
oil pipeline which will be executed on stages, the joint minutes
did not mention that either.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Urged to Change for Curbing AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF)
has urged Kenyans to change their behaviors to curb the spread of
HIV/AIDS as the AIDS-related deaths had reached an "alarming"
proportion.
</P>
<P>
AIDS awareness should be translated into practical behavioral
changes if the trend is to be reserved, UNICEF country
representative Crispin Wilson said when closing a week-long AIDS
awareness workshop in Mombasa, Kenya's southeastern port city, at
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Wilson noted that the UNICEF had spent millions of shillings on
AIDS prevention since the first case was reported in Kenya in
1984.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Nation newspaper quoted him as saying that the
infant mortality rate had gone up to 72 percent from 60 percent in
the past few years due to the spread of the virus.
</P>
<P>
He was puzzled that in Kenya, although the AIDS awareness rate
was estimated at 90 percent, only five percent was translated into
action practically.
</P>
<P>
Wilson also noted his organization had decided to include
teachers in the AIDS awareness program as they were in touch with
the most vulnerable group which consisted of youths aged between
15 and 24 years.
</P>
<P>
A report prepared by Kenya's National AIDS Control Program
which was tabled at the workshop indicates that the rapid increase
in young adult deaths would have serious impact on development.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative number of AIDS deaths would increase from the
current 100,000 to a million by the year 2000 and to over 2.1
million by the year 2005, the report says.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Disciplines Would-be Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has prepared a code of conduct for his in-coming cabinet, warning
the would-be ministers to be prepared for the coming sacrifice and
tough responsibilities, or be ready to go.
</P>
<P>
"Accepting to serve in this administration means complete
dedication to leadership, total commitment to hard work and
stringent discipline, there is no other way to make Nigeria great
again," he said in capital Abuja Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As means of involving the new helmsmen in the crusade,
President Obasanjo proposed the code of conduct that would be
presented later, which, according to him, will be more stringent
than before.
</P>
<P>
"Ministers should agree to the code of conduct as a proof that
they would lead by example," the New Nigerian newspaper Sunday
quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Accepting the job at this time meant full recognition of the
implication and responsibility of public office, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He further explained that the essence of the anti-corruption
bill, which has been presented to the national assembly, is to
have a law to back the crusade and to have an anti-corruption
commission that would be empowered to "seek, find and recover."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, who described his three-week presidency as "very
rough", predicted a "rough" experience for the incoming ministers.
</P>
<P>
"You must be prepared to make sacrifice, if any sacrifice for
this purpose is considered too much, it would be better not to
accept the responsibility", he said.
</P>
<P>
During a retreat with the ministers, which the president put as
an occasion for the would-be ministers to ponder and deliberate
fundamental issues pertaining to their assignments, Obasanjo said
that Nigeria's experience of bad governance was characterized by
federal ministers who systematically abused the privilege of
public office.
</P>
<P>
The president briefed the would-be ministers on the current
anti- corruption campaign, urging them to disabuse their minds of
the "wrong notion that one ministry is more lucrative than
another."
</P>
<P>
"There would be no juicy ministries under our administration,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He told the nominees, who would be sworn in Wednesday, that the
 challenge of minimizing corruption is daunting, adding that there
was no other choice but to fully confront it with determination
and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Washington Protesters Urge U.S., NATO to Rebuild Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (xinhua) -- About 100 protesters marched in
downtown Washington on Saturday to urge the U.S. and its NATO
allies to rebuild infrastructure in Yugoslavia destroyed during
their recent 79-day bombing.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, holding signs including "End NATO Occupation
of Yugoslavia," "Humanitarism is not a Victory," and "Bring Back
Troops Now," gathered at the Dupont Circle at about noon time.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the rally, several of them urged the U.S. and its
allies to meet their moral obligations by helping Yugoslavia to
rebuild the bridges, hospitals and schools destroyed during the U.
S.-led NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon the U.S. and NATO to meet their moral obligation
and finance the reconstruction of the once-beautiful Yugoslavia,"
said Carol Moore, a war tax resister.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said earlier this week that "not a
penny" will be spent on helping rebuild the civilian
infrastructure in Yugoslavia so long as Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic remains in power.
</P>
<P>
This policy is "not only immoral, but also illegal," said
Malcom Cannon, Washington Director of the International Action
Center (IAC).
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators then marched to the headquarters of the
American Broadcasting Company (ABC) chanting slogans "Clinton we
say no, NATO out of Kosovo," and "NATO, NATO you can't hide,
bombing is genocide."
</P>
<P>
"ABC, shame on you!" the protesters chanted in front of the ABC
building. "ABC is too biased and one-sided in covering the war," a
woman protester told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"It's ok to kill Serbs, bomb the bridges, the hospitals, is it
the message ABC wants to send out to the world?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
They also marched a few blocks to the building of The
Washington Post, in front which, Moore destroyed "our invoices for
subscriptions" to the newspaper "because of its editorial support
for the brutal, immoral and illegal bombing of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
"The Washington Post is a pro-war newspaper. When 10,000
marched to the Pentagon two weeks ago, it took the Post a whole
week to mention the largest anti-war rally in nearly ten years,"
Moore said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration is one of a series of protests organized by
the IAC, set up by Ramsey Clark, the former U.S. attorney-general.
</P>
<P>
IAC is outlining "a multi-point indictment of the U.S.
government's conduct in the war against Yugoslavia" through a
Commission of Inquiry initiated by Clark for the International War
Crimes Tribunal, Cannon told Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> China to Produce First Textbooks on Islam (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- China plans to compile a set of
textbook to help the country's over 20 million Muslims better
understand Islam which has existed in the country for 1,300 years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese language books will explain the Koran and the
instructions and doctrines of Allah in accordance with
contemporary Chinese views on the religion, according to Khalid
Yang Zongshan, vice president of the China Islamic College and
director of the project.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the compilation effort will require at least five
years. Islamic colleges, religious associations and various other
institutes nationwide will participate in the compilation effort,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The central government fully supports the effort, according to
Li Ge, an official with the State Council's Religious Bureau. He
noted that China has always supported Islamic education and called
for completion of the compilation project at the earliest possible
date. "The government will provide funding and personnel for the
project," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed founded Islam, one of the world's four major religions,
on the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century. Islam entered into
China along the ancient Silk Road during the Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Islamic doctrines had been imparted orally in mosques over a
long period of time. However, the establishment of Islamic
colleges following the founding of the People's Republic in 1949
sparked a change in the style of presentation. Nonetheless, the
basic teaching method is to recite the Koran.

<HEADLINE> UAE Firms Hire Students as Hot Summer Comes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- As the hot summer comes and
many employees go on vacation, firms in the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) are turning to undergraduates to fill vacant posts, the
Gulf News daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of hands and the cost factor are driving companies
to think about taking on students, according to Yousef Tuqan,
support and services manager at Abra, a recruitment company which
has been advertizing for university students to apply for
temporary jobs and internships over the summer.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown during the summer makes high-paid replacements
unviable, he explained to the paper. So Abra made the move to
introduce the idea of student summer interns to companies and the
response has been very positive.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wins," said Tuqan. "Many of the college students get
hands-on experience and make contacts in their fields," he added.
</P>
<P>
The young recruits have to meet the prescribed federal and
company requirements, such as being of legal working age, before
taking up jobs. The salaries paid to them is something to be
negotiated by the hiring company and the prospective summer temp.
</P>
<P>
Jobs available for university students on a temporary basis
throughout the summer include public relations posts, customer
service, sales, or just being an extra pair of hands around the
office, the report said.

"Sutras are often difficult and some people fail to fully
understand what they are reciting. Young believers need access to
thorough and systematic illustrations and analyses," said Huang
Xinman, 26, a former imam currently studying at the China Islamic
College.
</P>
<P>
He said the textbooks will provide explanations of the sutras
in line with modern development.
</P>
<P>
Khalid said other countries, especially the Islamic countries,
largely rely on textbooks to help spread Islam.
</P>
<P>
Haji Shamsiddin Mahmud, vice president of the China Islamic
Association, pointed out that the textbooks will be used in
colleges and mosques.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese Muslims were tortured and the religion trampled upon
during the tumultuous Cultural Revolution period (1966-76),
leading to the current lack of highly experienced imams," said
Haji, adding that "many experienced elder teachers have since
passed away."
</P>
<P>
According to the China Islamic Association, China has restored
30,000 mosques since the end of the Cultural Revolution, but a
large majority of the over 40,000 imams in the country had primary
or at best secondary school education.
</P>
<P>
"A set of textbooks is essential to help them improve their
educational levels," said Haji.
</P>
<P>
China has nine Islamic colleges and voluminous research books
on the religion, providing a base for the compilation project.

bank aimed at achieving improved debt collection and cost

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Works to Ease Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 27 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
is making great efforts to ease air pollution, especially problems
caused by acid rain, smoke and dust and auto exhaust emissions.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some 17 cities, covering 63 percent of the
province's total area, have become victims of acid rain which has
brought about an annual economic loss of four billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
With rapid urbanization, pollution caused by automobile exhaust
has become serious in the province. At the same time, sulfur
dioxide, smoke and dust are major air pollution problems in its
cities.
</P>
<P>
A local environmental protection official said that to solve
the problems, the provincial government will reduce pollution
resulting from the use of coal by adjusting its energy structure
and limiting the use of coal and oil with more than one percent of
sulphur content.
</P>
<P>
The province will not approve construction projects with coal-
burning power plants in urban areas or city suburbs, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many industrial enterprises causing air
pollution, such as cement plants, will be closed by the end of
this century, he said.
</P>
<P>
The province will tackle exhaust emissions by stopping selling
leaded gasoline and tightening controls over motor vehicles, he
said, adding that automobiles failing to meet emission standards
will not be allowed to enter into the market, and they are
required to install emission control equipment before being sold.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Guangdong is to carry out the "Blue Sky" drive, a
ten-year environmental improvement project aimed at improving air
quality and controling acid rain, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The project will require a total investment of 5.4 billion yuan.
When it is completed, most of the industrial enterprises and
service businesses in the province will replace coal, their
current fuel, with natural gas, which is economical and
environmentally friendly.

<HEADLINE> Barak Moves Closer to Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak seems to move toward a narrow government after signing
a coalition agreement with the left-wing Meretz party, making it
the third coalition partner.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which was signed late Saturday night,
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid will become education minister in the
new cabinet. The party will also get the trade and industry
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The deal came after Barak signed coalition agreements Friday
with Yisael ba'Aliya, the Russian immigrant party, and the
National Religious Party, which champions Jewish settlement in the
 West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Although winning a landslide in the May election for prime
minister, Barak has had to struggle to forge a coalition from
the 15 factions in the 120-seat parliament, each with demands
as diverse as Israeli society, since his Labor-led One Israel
alliance controls only 26 seats.
</P>
<P>
With the joining of the three partners, Barak's coalition
now has 47 seats, still short of the minimum number of 61
seats required to form a government.
</P>
<P>
He has courted the second and the third largest parties, the
right-wing Likud and the ultra-Orthodox party Shas, in order to
form a broad-based coalition as he promised after the elections.
</P>
<P>
But the inclusion of Meretz, which opposes to sit together
with Shas, indicated that Barak might be heading for a narrow
coalition of 66 seats, while leaving the door open for Shas
and Likud.
</P>
<P>
The talks with Shas, which seizes 17 seats in the parliament,
broke off Friday on disputes over the distribution of cabinet
portfolios. Shas was especially unhappy that Barak granted the
interior ministry, which has been under its control for 15 years,
to Yisrael ba'Aliya.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Sunday that One Israel will continue talks
with Shas later in the day. The talks with Likud will resume only
after the negotiations with Shas end.
</P>
<P>
There has been strong opposition, both inside Likud and One
Israel, to the inclusion of Likud in the coalition. Some Likud
members said the right-wing party, which plunged to 19 seats from
32 seats in the elections, can only be rebuilt while sitting in
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Senior One Israel members, meanwhile, said bringing in the
Likud would not help Barak carry out his promise to move forward
the Middle East peace process.

HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of China is determined to reinforce its
image as an international metropolis by playing a more active role
in the world sports arena.
</P>
<P>
This was reflected by Hong Kong's recent decision to bid for
the 2006 Asian Games for the first time in its history.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong athletes, in the name of "Hong Kong, China" in Asian
and international sports events, achieved remarkable success in
1998 by winning a total of 68 gold, 76 silver and 65 bronze
medals.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong delegation ranked 13th among the 43 participating
delegations with five golds, six silvers and six bronzes at the
13th Asian Games in Bangkok last December. It is the most
remarkable success it had ever scored.
</P>
<P>
This year Hong Kong has played host to such world class events
as the Fourth World Short Course Swimming Championship, the Tenth
Hong Kong Open - a stop of ATP Tour, and Diving Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
In early May, Hong Kong successfully hosted China's National
Archery Champions Championship -- the first national sports event
held in Hong Kong since its return to China two years ago.
</P>
<P>
This shows that Hong Kong opens the door to Chinese mainland's
sports events and will develop sports in close coordination with
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
As to Kong Kong's bid for the Asian Games, President of Hong
Kong's Sports Federation and Olympic Committee (SF&AMP;OC) Timothy Fok
said: "With the help of the HKSAR government, we do have
confidence in bidding for the Games and developing Hong Kong,
especially in the area of sports in depth."
</P>
<P>
Fok said he believes that hosting Asian Games would bring about
substantial benefits to Hong Kong's economy including major
contributions to enhancing tourism industry, stimulating the
region's sports, reinforcing its international city image and
providing more working opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Home Affairs David Lan said the SAR government
backs the SF&AMP;OC bidding for international events such as the Asian
Games, and playing host to these sports events will surely
rejuvenate Hong Kong, especially in the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, as a regional business and financial center,
possesses convenient communications, a great number of hotels and
advanced telecommunication. And the city is also on the way of
economic recovery from the setbacks caused by the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Fok pointed out that with the support from the government and
the people from all walks of life, Hong Kong's sports associations
had full confidence in bidding to host the 2006 Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
The SF&AMP;OC has been in existence since 1951. But in the past 48
years, Hong Kong had never hosted a major international games.
</P>
<P>
Now, the biggest obstacle for Hong Kong's bid for the Asian
games is the lack of a multi-functional sports complex,
especially a stadium that could run major games' opening and
closing ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
At present, the largest sports complex in Hong Kong is a
40,000-seat Hong Kong Stadium exclusively for football matches.
</P>
<P>
"To establish more sports facilities is our main goal,
particularly in schools, because efficient sports facilities could
offer more training opportunities for the young people," said Fok.
</P>
<P>
Apart from football, Hong Kong's sports are amateur nowadays.
To develop the city's sports and make it be accustomed to the
professionalism trend in the international sports arena, Hong Kong
SF&AMP;OC deleted the word "amateur" from its former title early this
year.

<P>
TEHRAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Executive Director of the U.N. Drug
Control Program (UNDCP) Pino Arlacchi announced here on Saturday

that 7 million dollars of the sum is to go to controlling borders
and the remaining 6 million dollars to research works, addicts'
rehabilitation and raising awareness of local communities.
</P>
<P>
The allocation do not represent assistance to Iran, rather
it marks cooperation between Iran and the U.N. body to control
drugs, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Arlacchi, who is also deputy U.N. secretary general,
did not mention the term for the allocation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of the anti-drug headquarters at the
Iranian Presidential Office Mohammad Fallah said that excluding
the sum spent by the security forces and the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps and related organizations, his
headquarters spends as much as 120 million dollars annually on
drug control.
</P>
<P>
To mark the international anti-drug day, Iran burned 55
tons of narcotics on Saturday afternoon in northern Tehran to
show its determination to continue campaign against drug
trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Trees Dying for Unknown Disease in Northern Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of trees have been dying
at least in three districts in northwestern Bangladesh for an
"unknown disease," the latest issue of the news weekly Dhaka
Courier reported.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the death of such a large number of trees in the
districts of Pabna, Sirajganj and Rangpur is yet to be detected,
as some experts hold one kind of fungus responsible while others
suspect that the deficiency of some nutrients in the soil is
responsible.
</P>
<P>
There are no official figures as to how many trees have died so
far because of this "mysterious" disease, but unofficial estimates
say that at least 30 percent of the trees in the districts have
died over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
The report said a senior scientific officer of the Forest
Research Institute, Chittagong visited Pabna district, some 130
kilometers northwest of here, and three other adjacent districts,
and after an exhaustive survey concluded that the trees were dying
because of one kind of fungus attack.
</P>
<P>
He suggested spraying of some fungicide over the infected trees
but it did not work, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Iqbal Zuberi, chairman of the Botany Department of
Rajshahi University, in northwestern Bangladesh, said a few years
ago that the death of the trees was the manifestation of a
desertification process in the northwestern region.
</P>
<P>
But a scientific officer of a local Government and Rural
Development project in Dinajpur, 286 kilometers northwest of the
capital city, said that deficiency of certain nutrients in the
soil of the northwestern districts was responsible for the death
of the trees. The micro-nutrients in the soil of the flood-prone
northwestern districts were lost to receding flood waters, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts working in these districts said that
intensive cultivation of high-yield variety of paddy dependent on
underground irrigation facilities had resulted in the depletion of
micro-nutrients like zinc and sulfur in the soil and underground
water, and these might have been the cause of the death of the
trees.
</P>
<P>
The death of trees has posed a serious threat to the
environment of the region, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Eyes Tamil Diaspora to End Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has launched a new
initiative that could represent an important change in its
approach to counter the long-standing rebellion by secessionist
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an imaginative twist to the "hearts and minds" component of
counter-insurgency doctrine, it is for the first time trying to
reach out to the extensive Tamil diaspora.
</P>
<P>
"There are 600,000 to 800,000 people of Sri Lankan Tamil origin
overseas but we've traditionally had very little contact with
them," Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar told Jane's Defense
Weekly in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Foreign Ministry started a monthly
newsletter in Tamil for the expatriate community.
</P>
<P>
The main aim is to explain that Sri Lanka has changed, and to
provide them with an alternative source of information about the
country.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the initiative finally aims to
curtail LTTE's funding which has played a crucial role in
prolonging the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has established more than 40 overseas offices since
1983 when they launched its rebellion against the Sri Lankan
government for an independent Tamil homeland in the north and east
of the country.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that LTTE's overseas offices generate 4-6
million U.S. dollars monthly in support of its cause.

<P>
NEW YORK, June 26 (Xinhua) -- World Cup new-comers Russia
entered the women's World Cup soccer tournament quarterfinals with a
4-1 victory over Canada on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian team started strongly in the first half, hoping to
get an early goal in the match which decided which team qualify for
the quarterfinals as the runners-up of the Group C.
</P>
<P>
The Australians took a slight upper hand in the first half, but
failed to score a goal.
</P>
<P>
The Russian team were obviously more experienced, they played
defensively in the first half, making preprations for their attack
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
The two teams played to a goalless draw after the first 45
minutes and in the second half, the Australian team seemed a little
bit tired while the Russia team took over the domination.
</P>
<P>
The Russian team had 5 shots in the first 10 minutes of the
second half. They efforts got rewarded as captain Irina Grigorieva
beat Canadian goal-keeper Nicci Wright at the 54th minute.
</P>
<P>
Some 12 minutes later, Grigorieva made an assist to enable her
teammate Elena Fomina score to put Russia 2-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian team played desperately after being 2-0 down.
Charmaine Hooper narrowed the margin to 2-1 at the 76th minute. But
they hopes of levelling the scoring were dashed by Fomina and Olga
Karasseva who scored at the 86th and 90th minutes respectively.
</P>
<P>
Grigorieva was happy to score the first goal for her team:"It
was an important goal. In the second half we were on the ball. I
was really happy to be the one to score."
</P>
<P>
Grigorieva said:"Our next goal is to fight the Chinese team. We
are fully award that the Chinese team are the favorites. We will
fight to the end."
</P>
<P>
"Sydney is looming, dominating all of our thoughts." said
Grigorieva said.
</P>
<P>
Grigorieva said she had no idea what tactics they would adopt
against the favored Chinese team:"I have no idea now, that is for
the coach to determine. Maybe a few days will pass and then we will
work on them."
</P>
<P>
The Russian team will play China in the quarterfinals at San Jose
on June 30.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A 244-year-old wooden statue
of Buddha with 1,000 hands and 1,000 eyes, which is on UNESCO's
World Heritage list, has been reopened to the public after a
thorough renovation.
</P>
<P>
The huge carving, 23.5 m high and weighing 110 tons, and said
to be the tallest wooden statue in the world, is located in the
Puning Temple in Chengde, in north China's Hebei Province. It was
put on the World Heritage list in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Before the repair work, the statue was in danger of collapsing
at any moment, since it was badly rotten and worm-eaten.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts led by the State Cultural Heritage
Administration, steamed the statue and replaced the damaged
portions.
</P>
<P>
The restoration work, costing nine million yuan (about 1.1
million U.S. dollars), lasted about nine months.

<P>
QINGDAO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The sea level off this major port
city in east China has risen ten cm since 1956, and is still
rising, according to a monitoring report released by the State
Oceanic Administration (SOA).
</P>
<P>
The level of Qingdao's coastal waters was 249 cm in 1998,
compared with 239 cm in 1956. It was found to be rising
continuously this year, says the report based on the data from the
SOA's oceanological forecasting station here.
</P>
<P>
However, the station's senior engineer, Guo Mingke, ruled out
any serious impact on the nearby coastal areas as a result of the
rise of the sea level, such as a shrinking coastline, damage to
dykes, or soil salinization.

The paper urged entrepreneurs engaged in tourism to grasp the
opportunities to develop the tourism industry and tourism-related
businesses in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, a total of 340,123 foreign
tourists visited Myanmar in 1998. Myanmar is trying to boost the
number of tourist arrivals to 500,000 in the fiscal year

<HEADLINE> Experts Say Philippines' Mayon Restive Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' most active
volcano, Mayon, is restive again with an increased emission of
sulfur dioxide after its eruption last Tuesday, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Standard newspaper Sunday quoted experts of the
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) as
saying that the institute placed Mayon's emission of sulfur
dioxide at 4,700 tons per day, well above the normal rate of 500
tons.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that if present indications continue, the
alert status will have to be raised from the existing level 1 to
2.
</P>
<P>
Alert level 2 means the six-kilometer permanent danger zone
around the volcano will be widened to seven kilometers.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, the volcanic debris accumulated after
Mayon's eruption last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mayon's eruption last week lasted for about 10 minutes, raining
ash on surrounding areas in the eastern part of the Philippines.
But no casualties had been reported during the eruption.
</P>
<P>
Mayon, the most active volcano in the world, has erupted at
least 40 times since 1616. The volcano's eruption on February 2,
1993 killed 78 people and affected 17,119 persons.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar-Thailand Bilateral Trade Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar-Thailand bilateral trade
including their border trade reached 50.63 million U.S. dollars in
 the first two months of this year, increasing by 56.1 percent
over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures published by the country's
Central Statistical Organization, Myanmar's export to Thailand
during the two-month period amounted to 6.92 million dollars,
falling by 2.6 million dollars from the corresponding period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Myanmar's import from Thailand during the period
increased to 43.71 million dollars from 22.91 million dollars a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that the balance of trade in the period
was  in favor of Thailand as Thailand's export to Myanmar
accounted for a high percentage of 86.3 of the total bilateral
trade while its import from Myanmar represented a low percentage
of 13.7.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, one of Myanmar's major trading partners in Asia,
began formal border trade with Myanmar in March 1996 by opening
three border trading points which are Tachilek, Myawaddy and
Kawthoung.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in 1998 the two countries'
bilateral trade including their border trade stood at 441.9
million dollars with Thailand enjoying a huge trade surplus of

<HEADLINE> China to Open Two Russian Supermarkets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Two big Chinese supermarkets will
soon be launched in Russia to boost Russian consumer's confidence
in Chinese goods, the China Daily Business Weekly reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory work is proceeded well, an official from the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), who
declined to be named, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Contracts have been signed between the two countries, sites
have been fixed and real estate purchased. Only some details
remain to be thrashed out, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Tiankelong, a well-known supermarket chain company in China,
will run one of the two markets, and the other will be contracted
by four separate businesses, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Nothing but high-quality and famous-brand Chinese commodities
will be available on the shelves of these supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
As one of the fruits of Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to Russia
in February, the two supermarkets have received high attention
from the Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
"We should view the issue of the two supermarkets from a
strategic perspective regarding the development of the Sino-
Russian relationship," said State Councilor Wu Yi.
</P>
<P>
"No matter from the economic or political perspective, it is
both necessary and significant to open the two markets in Russia,"
said Qin Xuanren, a professor at the University of International
Business and Economics.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia have been seeking to increase the range of
their economic cooperation as both have realized that hugs and
friendliness should not be the sum of the bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
Although China's exports to Russia have been declining since
last year, largely due to the poor economic situation in Russia
and the shrinkage of Russian consumers' purchasing power, the
Russian market is still regarded as possessing huge potential.
</P>
<P>
"High-level consumption only accounts for 10 percent of the
total consumption volume in Russia, and what the majority of
Russian consumers demand is medium- and low-grade products," said
the MOFTEC official.
</P>
<P>
Chinese exports, characterized by relatively low prices and
high durability, have been popular mainly in the medium- and low-
grade product markets overseas.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the General Administration of Customs indicate
that the Sino-Russia bilateral trade volume reached 5.48 billion U.
S. dollars in 1998, down 10.5 percent from 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies LA-EU Summit Threatening Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States does not
see its interests threatened by the rapprochement to be built
during the Latin America-European Union summit, which will be held
June 28-29 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The view was expressed by Arturo Valenzuela, new presidential
advisor for Latin American affairs, in an exclusive interview with
the Brazilian daily "Folha de Sao Paulo" on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela denied that the LA-EU Summit, to be attended by
heads of state and government of 33 Latin American and Caribbean
countries and 15 European Union countries, might be seen by the
United States as a threat to its strong commercial influence in
the Latin American region.
</P>
<P>
He said, the LA-EU Summit could be an instrument for the
Americas to achieve the opening of the "restrictive" European
market, which could mean good news for world trade.
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela said that the summit will not set back the timetable
for implementing the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by the
year 2005 and that the real obstacle to for the creation of FTAA
is on the side of the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Clinton will not get the "fast track"
approval from the U.S. Congress until the end of his term even
though FTAA will continue to be a priority for his administration.
</P>
<P>
However, experts here believe that the United States is worried
by the eventual approach of the EU to Latin America and the
Caribbean and for the possible creation of a free trade area
between the EU and Mercosur in 2005.
</P>
<P>
They note that the United States does not like to see a rising
political, economic, and commercial influence of Europe or any
other part of the world in Latin America, because it traditionally
regards the region as its backyard.

The document voiced support for market economy and proposed to
seek "a just distribution" of the benefits produced by economic
globalization.
</P>

It said that globalization does offer opportunities for social
progress and the creation of wealth but it also constitutes a
challenge to the regions and nations of the world.

"The challenge is to link material advances with social
progress in a new consensus that will assure that political
considerations will prevail over purely economic considerations,"
said the document.
</P>
<P>
The Council also adopted another document, urging Argentina and
the United Kingdom to solve their dispute over the Malvinas island
through dialogue.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Snow-Covered Areas Shrinking in Peruvian Andes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian Andes has lost more than
11 billion cubic meters of snow in the last 27 years because of
global warming and environmental pollution, an expert said.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian physicist Ramiro Valdivia told the press on Saturday
that accelerated thawing has occurred in the 20 glacier areas in
the country's western and eastern mountain ranges.
</P>
<P>
He warned that snow melting in high mountains means both an
irreversible damage to the environment and ecosystem and a loss of
water and tourism resources.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the snow-covered area of Ticlio, 4,818 meters
above sea level in the Rimac watershed in southern Peru, only
small stretches of mountains and cliffs are covered with snow and
ice has been receding at a rate of 10 meters per year.
</P>
<P>
Valdivia attributed the receding of ice to the effect of global
warming and the carbon monoxide produced by automobiles.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,945 glaciers of mountain type, 95 of valley type
and one of rocky type have been identified in the country's 20
glacier areas.

<HEADLINE> EU Reaffirms Support to Latin American Anti-Drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A European Union
representative reaffirmed here Saturday that the EU supports the
Latin American and Caribbean countries in their war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
EU vice commissioner Manuel Marin, a Spaniard who is here to
attend the June 28-29 summit of Latin America, the Caribbean and
the EU, said that the European bloc recognizes the principle of "
shared responsibility" in fighting drugs.
</P>
<P>
He said that Europe admitted its responsibility many years ago
that the drug consumers were responsible for drug flooding and
thus adopted specific measures to promote the exports from the
Andean Community, including a zero customs duty for the group's
industrial products.
</P>
<P>
The Andean Community groups Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia
and Chile.
</P>
<P>
Marin criticized the United States, the biggest market for
drugs, for its annual unilateral "certification" policy of "
punishing or rewarding" drug-producing countries in light of their
anti-drug policies and actions.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Japanese Trade Set to Pick Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral trade and economic
cooperation between China and Japan will step into recovery, the
Business Weekly reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show the Sino-Japanese trade volume
declined by 4.8 percent to 57.9 billion U.S. dollars during the
1997-98 period and Japanese investment also slumped due to the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
As a result, pessimism has grown in the two countries'
economic circles.
</P>
<P>
However, Guo Li, an official in the Asian Affairs Department
of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, was
quoted by the weekly as saying: "There is no reason for woe. There
is still huge potential for further development since the
complementary advantages of the Chinese and Japanese economies
have not been fully brought out."
</P>
<P>
Guo interpreted the declines in bilateral trade and economic
cooperation mainly as an "adjustment." "This had been very obvious
even before the outbreak of the financial crisis," she added.
</P>
<P>
She called for efforts by the two countries to foster new
growth points in their bilateral economic cooperation, especially
in the Chinese exports to Japan.
</P>
<P>
She suggested China improve its export product mix and Japan
make more efforts in market access, technology transfer and direct
investment in China.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Calls for Clear Rules of Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The South American Common
Market (Mercosur) will express its hope at the Latin America-
European Union summit that clear free trade rules will be worked
out to accommodate the interests of all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview with Xinhua, Argentina Foreign Deputy
Minister Andres Cisneros expressed the hope on the eve of the
summit which will be held here on June 28-29.
</P>
<P>
The summit is aimed at starting firm negotiations toward a free
trade agreement and deepening mutual understanding between the
European and Latin American economic blocs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Mercosur is expected to make two fundamental
achievements at the summit: a firm commitment to free trade and
the formation of political consensus in the region, two pillars
for the bloc to negotiate with its European counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The starting line for Mercosur is to push the EU to gradually
eliminate its subsidies that damage Latin America's production and
export capabilities and cause great imbalances in bilateral trade,
said Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
Cisneros told Xinhua that both regions share political and
cultural values and views in matters of international policies and
bilateral and multilateral relations, but the EU's practice of
subsidies stands as the biggest disagreement between the two blocs.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur countries, which are Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay
and Paraguay with Chile and Bolivia as partners, are promoting
ties with Asian countries, especially China, to balance their
relations with other regions of the world.

<HEADLINE> Krajicek Crashes out in Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Former champion Richard Krajicek of
the Netherlands has gone out of Wimbledon at the infamous "
champions graveyard" of Court No. 2.
</P>
<P>
But fellow Wimbledon winners Andre Agassi and Boris Becker are
both through to the fourth round, as is multiple finalist Goran
Ivanisevic.
</P>
<P>
Court No. 2, which has accounted for so many top seeds over the
years, hosted its latest shock when the Dutch fifth seed fell to
Lorenzo Manta of Switzerland, 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 4-6, 4-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss is ranked 196th in the world and had never won a
Grand Slam match until this year's Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek looked to have overcome a dreadful start to take the
match into a fifth set.
</P>
<P>
But it was the 24-year-old from Winterthur held his nerve to
book a meeting with 11th seed Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the 1996 champion Krajicek, Becker and Agassi
secured their places in the last 16 with convincing victories.
</P>
<P>
Three-time runner-up Ivanisevic is also in the fourth round
after a 7-6 (7-2), 6-4, 7-6 (7/3) over Paul Haarhuis of the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Becker, a three-time winner at the world's
biggest grasscourt tournament, beat Australian Lleyton Hewitt 6-1,
6-4, 7-6 (7-5) while Agassi overcame the challenge of Alberto
Martin 6-2, 6-0, 2-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
For the German, there is a match with second seed Pat Rafter,
potentially the match of the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
Becker once again demonstrated why he will be remembered as one
of Wimbledon's outstanding players, overwhelming his teenage
opponent with a mixture of guile and power.
</P>
<P>
The only tricky moments for the right-hander came in the
opening game, which went to several deuces, and the final set
which saw a series of breaks before Becker took the tie-break.
</P>
<P>
For Agassi, the 1992 champion, the match saw him lose his first
set of the tournament against the Spaniard Martin.
</P>
<P>
After displaying top form for the first two sets, the 29-year-
old seemed to lose concentration for a moment in the third and
paid the price as his opponent took the set 6-2.
</P>
<P>
A fortuitous net-cord helped Agassi to a vital break in the
seventh game of the next set, and the fourth seed reestablished
control to take the match.
</P>
<P>
Australian qualifier Wayne Arthurs beat 14th seed Tommy Haas of
Germany 7-6, 7-6, 7-6 and will now play Agassi.
</P>
<P>
Todd Martin, the American eighth seed, beat another German Jens
Knippschild 6-7, 6-1, 7-6, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
In the women's draw, third seed Lindsay Davenport cruised
through to the last 16 but Julie Halard-Decugis of France, seeded
11, was beaten by American teenager Alexandra Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
Ninth seed Mary Pierce and unseeded Nathalie Dechy avoided the
fate of compatriot Halard-Decugis. Dechy beat Tatiana Panova of
Russia 6-0, 6-3 while Pierce took out Elena Wagner of Germany 6-3,
6-0.
</P>
<P>
Jelena Dokic, the 16-year-old Australian qualifier who defeated
top seed Martina Hingis of Switzerland in the opening round, will
play Pierce after beating Luxembourg's Anne Kremer 6-7, 6-3, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Hill Hints at British Farewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Damon Hill has hinted that he may
retire from Formula One auto racing sooner than planned after his
worst qualifying performance in seven years in French Grand Prix
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old announced earlier this month that he will stop
racing at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
But his worst qualifying performance for seven years in France
on Saturday led him to suggest that he may stop racing after the
British Grand Prix in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The former world champion will only be allowed to compete in
Sunday's French GP at Magny-Cours after Jordan appealed to the
stewards.
</P>
<P>
He originally finished outside the time limit of 107% of the
pole position time, after a fire damaged his car and rain then
made the track slower.
</P>
<P>
But Hill admitted the bad performance was still partly his own
fault, and he apologized to team boss Eddie Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"I'd not want to be in a situation where I'm damaging Eddie's
chances and I'd have to say on today's evidence I'm not helping. I
didn't perform well," he admitted.
</P>
<P>
"I only want to race if I feel I can deliver and frankly I don'
t feel like I'm delivering."
</P>
<P>
Hill made his debut for Brabham at Silverstone, and has not
failed to qualify for a Grand Prix since his days with the
uncompetitive former team.
</P>
<P>
The winner of 22 races would be guaranteed an emotional send-
off from British fans.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not making any definite announcement but anything is
possible," said Hill when asked if the sell-out event would be his
last race.
</P>
<P>
Jordan said on Friday that he expected Hill to stay on until
the end of the year, and that he was welcome to do so.
</P>
<P>
But earlier in the week he told BBC Radio 5 Live that Hill's
career might end sooner than that.
</P>
<P>
And after Saturday's drama he admitted: "We are talking about
the issue and I'm pleased he's thinking about Jordan's position in
the championship.
</P>
<P>
"This situation is one in which Damon and I clearly understand
what is required, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Hill missed out by just 0.003 of a second on making the
qualifying cut-off time in a chaotic and dangerous wet weather
session.
</P>
<P>
He had to use the spare car when broken exhaust sparked a fire
in his race car and the spare suffered a similar fate after the
session.
</P>
<P>
"Today shows the difficulties I've been going through and that'
s why I announced I'm going to retire," said Hill.
</P>
<P>
"I must say those were the worst conditions I have ever
experienced in a qualifying session. It was extremely treacherous,
" he added.

<HEADLINE> Krajicek Bows Out at Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Former champion Richard Krajicek of
the Netherlands has gone out of Wimbledon at the infamous "
champions graveyard" of Court No 2.
</P>
<P>
But fellow Wimbledon winners Andre Agassi and Boris Becker are
both through to the fourth round, as is multiple finalist Goran
Ivanisevic.
</P>
<P>
Court No 2, which has accounted for so many top seeds over the
years, hosted its latest shock when the Dutch fifth seed fell to
Lorenzo Manta of Switzerland, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 4-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss is ranked 196th in the world and had never won a
Grand Slam match until this year's Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek looked to have overcome a dreadful start to take the
match into a fifth set.
</P>
<P>
But it was the 24-year-old from Winterthur held his nerve to
book a meeting with 11th seed Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the 1996 champion Krajicek, Becker and Agassi
secured their places in the last 16 with convincing victories.
</P>
<P>
Three-time runner-up Ivanisevic is also in the fourth round
after a 7-6 (7-2), 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) over Paul Haarhuis of the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Becker, a three-time winner at the world's
biggest grasscourt tournament, beat Australian Lleyton Hewitt 6-1,
6-4, 7-6 (7-5) while Agassi overcame the challenge of Alberto
Martin 6-2, 6-0, 2-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
For the German, there is a match with second seed Pat Rafter,
potentially the match of the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
Becker once again demonstrated why he will be remembered as one
of Wimbledon's outstanding players, overwhelming his teenage
opponent with a mixture of guile and power.
</P>
<P>
The only tricky moments for the right-hander came in the
opening game, which went to several deuces, and the final set
which saw a series of breaks before Becker took the tie-break.
</P>
<P>
For Agassi, the 1992 champion, the match saw him lose his first
set of the tournament against the Spaniard Martin.
</P>
<P>
After displaying top form for the first two sets, the 29-year-
old seemed to lose concentration for a moment in the third and
paid the price as his opponent took the set 6-2.
</P>
<P>
A fortuitous net-cord helped Agassi to a vital break in the
seventh game of the next set, and the fourth seed reestablished
control to take the match.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten became the first
Brazilian man to reach Wimbledon's fourth round in the Open era.
</P>
<P>
The 11th-seeded Kuerten, who had a lifetime record on grass of
0-4 until this week, swept past qualifier Nenad Zimonjic 6-4, 6-4,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
Rafter confirmed his reputation as one of the favourites for
the title with a straight sets win over Australia Open finalist
Thomas Enqvist.
</P>
<P>
The second seed broke in the Swede's first service game but
Enqvist hit back to set up a tie-break.
</P>
<P>
Enqvist lost touch on service returns in the second set and
Rafter eased through it with two breaks.
</P>
<P>
After a short break for rain, the first of the championships,
Rafter sealed an impressive 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, 6-3 win.
</P>
<P>
Goran Ivanisevic booked his place in the last 16 at the expense
of his bogey man Paul Haarhuis.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic edged a tight match 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) and
battled back after the Dutchman had two points for a double break
in the third set.
</P>
<P>
Gustavo Kuerten demonstrated his newly-found liking for grass
with a confident 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 win over Nenad Zimonjic.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian had gone out in the first round on his two
previous appearances but has conquered his fears in impressive
style this year.
</P>
<P>
Even playing on the infamous Court Two did not faze him as he
dominated against the Yugoslavian qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Zimonjic struggled with his serve, producing nine double faults,
and Kuerten took full advantage.
</P>
<P>
There were also wins for former semi-finalist Todd Martin while
Germany's Tommy Haas crashed out at the hands of Australian
qualifier Wayne Arthurs.

<HEADLINE> Novotna Moves Through after Struggle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Jana Novotna overcame a sluggish
start to see off Maria Antonia Sanchez Lorenzo and set up a fourth
round clash against Nathalie Dechy at Wimbledon on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The defending champion trailed 3-0 and 4-1 in the opening set
before getting her game together.
</P>
<P>
The confidence returned although she needed three set points to
take the set 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The second set was also close until Novotna broke for 4-3 and
took the next two games to wrap up victory.
</P>
<P>
The Jelena Dokic bandwagon is still rolling in the ladies
singles after she made it through to the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
Dokic, conqueror of top seed Martina Hingis in the first round,
set up a meeting with ninth seed Mary Piece in the last 16 after
beating Anne Kremer.
</P>
<P>
The Australian did not have things all her own way against one
of Luxembourg's only class sporting exports.
</P>
<P>
Kremer claimed the first set on a tie-break but Dokic showed
her growing maturity in taking the next two.
</P>
<P>
US Open champion Lindsay Davenport booked her fourth round
place with a comfortable win over Laura Golarsa, the oldest
survivor in the women's draw.
</P>
<P>
The third seed, still seeking her first Wimbledon title, was
again in composed form with her booming baseline shots again
proving decisive.
</P>
<P>
Davenport assumed control when she won six games in a row to
take the first set and go 4-0 up in the second.
</P>
<P>
Golarsa had no answer as the American wrapped up a 6-3 6-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
Mary Pierce outclassed Elena Wagner with a powerful display on
Court Three to ease into the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchwoman was always in charge of the baseline battle and
her opponent's frustration grew as the match began to drift away
from her.
</P>
<P>
Wagner's serve fell to pieces at times in the second set and
Pierce picked her off at will.
</P>
<P>
She also executed two delightful drop shots near the end of the
second set as she secured a 6-3 6-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon debutante Alexandra Stevenson marched into the last
16 with an impressive straight sets win over 11th seed Julie
Halard-Decugis.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old, who made the Edgbaston quarter-finals earlier
this month, never looked back after taking the first three games
and won 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The consistent Nathalie Dechy also went through after ending
the giant-killing run of Tatiana Panova.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchwoman was never in trouble on course to her 6-0, 6-3
victory.
</P>
<P>
Last year's runner-up Nathalie Tauziat made short work of Seda
Noorlander as she became the first woman to reach the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
The eighth seed, opening proceedings on Court 13, took command
from the start against the Dutch woman who was making her first
third round appearance.
</P>
<P>
Tauziat held all her service games although Noorlander failed
to take advantage of a number of second serves.
</P>
<P>
The French woman easily progressed with a 6-1, 6-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
Former champion Conchita Martinez saw her latest bid for a
second title end in disappointing fashion as she lost to Lisa
Raymond in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Martinez lifted the famous trophy in 1994 but has since slipped
from a career-high ranking of second to 20th.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard played well at the net but struggled with her
first serve as she lost 6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Fourteenth seed Barbara Schett carried on her best-ever run at
Wimbledon with a 6-2, 6-3 defeat of Larisa Neiland.
