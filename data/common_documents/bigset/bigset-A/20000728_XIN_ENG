<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Considers Resignation EDS-Updates with details about Barak's meeting with Levy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy is considering to resign from the government, local daily
Ha'aretz reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak met Levy at the Defense Ministry
Thursday evening in Tel Aviv and Levy told Barak that he is
considering to resign from the government, the daily quoted a
source as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Barak decided to meet Levy again on Sunday to discuss the
tension between them.
</P>
<P>
Levy refused two weeks ago to go to Washington to attend the
Camp David summit with Barak, insisting that the time was not ripe
for the summit because the Palestinians were not ready to make
compromise on key issues in the Israeli-Palestinian final-status
talks.
</P>
<P>
The two-week summit, attended by Barak, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton, ended Tuesday
without reaching a framework agreement on the issues of the status
of Jerusalem, refugees, borders and settlements.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Barak briefed Levy about the failure of
the summit.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Levy, Barak also updated government
ministers on the outcome of the summit and his future plan for
strengthening the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after meeting with his cabinet ministers, Barak also met
opposition Likud party leader Ariel Sharon at the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Likud officials said that during the meeting, Barak briefed
Sharon about the summit and the two did not discuss the possibility
of forming a national unity government.
</P>
<P>
"Sharon did not intend to discuss the unity government with
Barak and that Sharon suspects Barak of using him to lower Shas'
price for returning to the coalition," the Likud officials added.
</P>
<P>
Sharon also blamed some Likud members for being responsible for
rumors that he wanted to form a national unity government with
Barak, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Before the Camp David summit, Barak's coalition partners Shas,
National Religious Party and Yisrael Ba'aliya, resigned from the
government, leaving the coalition on the verge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
Levy's Gesher (bridge) party formed One Israel party with
Barak's Labor following the general elections in May of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Levy's resignation would be another heavy political blow to
Barak, who is facing no-confidence motions in the Knesset
(parliament) next week.

JERUSALEM -- More than half of Israelis are affirmative on Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's decision to attend the Camp David peace
summit while a similar proportion of people think he offered too
much to the Palestinians, according to an opinion poll published on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The "exclusive" poll, by the Israeli daily The Jerusalem Post,
of 513 Jewish and Arab Israelis showed that 59 percent of the
respondents said Barak was right to go to Camp David, while 37
percent opposed the move. Four percent had no reply. (Israel-

Washington, Clinton said: "I think it would be a big mistake to

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israel to Resume Talks Sunday on Interim Issues: Spokeswoman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians and Israel will start a "
new phase" of intensified negotiations on Sunday, on interim
issues, in the wake of the collapse of Camp David summit,
Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi said Friday in the West Bank
city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, headed respectively by Palestinian chief
negotiator Saeb Erekat and his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran, will
discuss the issues such as a delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from
the West Bank and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli
jails.
</P>
<P>
"I can safely say you are going to see an intensive, stepped up
diplomatic campaign or movement on all fronts because nobody is
interested in seeing a collapse," Ashrawi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak failed in their two-week summit hosted by United States
President Bill Clinton, which concluded on July 25, to reach an
agreement on the final status between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks include such thorny issues as the status
of Jerusalem, Palestinian statehood, the fate of Palestinian
refugees and Jewish settlements, water, border and security.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has repeatedly expressed his intention to declare
independence on September 13 after the interim period stipulated in
the 1993 Oslo accord expires, even without an agreement with
Israel.

<HEADLINE> UCJ Condemns Maltreatment of Turkish Cypriot Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Union of Cyprus Journalists
(UCJ) Friday condemned the maltreatment of Turkish Cypriot
journalists by the breakaway regime in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The UCJ made the condemnation in letters to the Secretariat of
the International Federation of Journalists, the OSCE (Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe) representative on freedom
of the media, the International Press Institute, and other
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
In its letters, the UCJ noted that "eight Turkish Cypriot
journalists were attacked and wounded by heavily armed forces" in
the northern part of Nicosia when covering on July 24 a
demonstration by Turkish Cypriots protesting the loss of their bank
deposits after six banks went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974, when Turkey invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island after a failed pro-
Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots in the north declared a breakaway state in
1983, which is only recognized by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The UCJ noted that dozens of Turkish Cypriot journalists
Thursday staged a silent protest outside the main headquarters of
the police force, deploring the assaults and arrests of press
people during the July 24 demonstration.
</P>
<P>
It requested the "solidarity once more" of the receivers of the
letters.
</P>
<P>
During the July 24 incidents, 18 people were injured when police
used truncheons, tear gas and pressurized water to disperse a 3,
000-strong crowd, while some 60 people were reported to have been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
The protesters were demanding the authority to pay them their
monthly compensation to cover losses incurred after six banks were
put under "public administration" in the past six months.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus in Favor of Participation in All European Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou Friday stressed that Cyprus' participation in
all European institutions, including that of Common Foreign and
Security Policy, is important to the island's security.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou made the remarks in Geneva, where he is participating
the Cypriot delegation to the U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou also expressed the conviction that the European Union
(EU) would not complain for non-participation of Cypriot officers
in its forces if Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides' proposal for
demilitarization of the island is accepted.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus would participate in non-military activities of
the force, such as peace-keeping mission, with some 150 officers.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government believes its involvement in institutions
such as the Common Foreign and Security Policy will further assist
its efforts towards the EU membership, Papapetrou said, noting that
the island's security concerns will thus be better served.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, Cyprus, together with the other
12 candidate countries for accession to the EU, and Norway and
Iceland met Thursday in Brussels with the 15 EU member states.
</P>
<P>
They were briefed by the EU states on issues concerning Common
Foreign and Security Policy and ways of cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Failure of Camp David Summit a Success of Palestinians: Kadoumy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Farouk Al Kadoumy, director of the
political department of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO), said here Friday the failure of the Camp David summit is a "
success for the Palestinian side."
</P>
<P>
He was speaking upon his arrival in Cairo on a two-day visit in
Egypt for consultations with Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and United States President Bill Clinton concluded the two-
week summit in the U.S. on July 25 without reaching an agreement on
the Palestinian-Israeli final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
Kadoumy said the Palestinian negotiators are seeking an end to
the conflict with Israel and not just a permanent settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians would never forsake their lands which were
occupied by Israel since the Jewish regime's establishment in 1948,
he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Kadoumy will also review with Egyptian officials the Arab
stance, especially ahead of the Arab foreign ministers meeting
slated for September under the chairmanship of the Palestinian
National Authority.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's statements
that the Palestinian state will be declared on September 13, even
without a peace agreement with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Naval Ships' Head Meets Tanzanian Army Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the visiting
Chinese naval ships met here on Friday with senior Tanzanian
military officials on further developing bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Rear Admiral Huang Jiang, who led the two-ship group which
arrived at the Dar es Salaam harbor Friday morning, said the visit
was aimed at promoting mutual understanding and deepening
friendship.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a meeting with General Robert Mboma,
Commander in Chief of Tanzanian People's Defense Forces (TPDF) at
TPDF headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Huang said, "China and Tanzania enjoy a long history of
friendly relationship that was cultivated by leaders of the older
generations of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Huang, who is also Chief of Staff of the South Sea Fleet,
stressed that the fast development of Chinese economy will enhance
the cooperation between China and other developing countries in
maintaining world peace.
</P>
<P>
Mboma expressed satisfaction with the cooperation between
Tanzania and China, especially in the military sector.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania highly appreciates the assistance provided by China
in building the navy which has been playing a very important role
in defense of the 1,224-kilometer coast and the exclusive economic
zone," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mboma expected cooperation to be further boosted in military
personnel training and equipment upgrading.
</P>
<P>
Later Huang paid a courtesy call on acting Mayor of Dar es
Salaam City, Wilson Mkama, who extended his brotherly greeting to
the Chinese warships on a two-day goodwill visit to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by Chinese navy ships to Africa since
the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, though in
early 1400s the Chinese trade fleet headed by Zheng He, great
voyager of the Ming Dynasty, had visited the eastern coast of
Africa for several times.
</P>
<P>
The navy group consists of the Shenzhen DDG167, China's newest
guided missile destroyer, and Nancang AOG953, China's largest
assorted supply ship, with a total of 480 officers and soldiers
aboard.
</P>
<P>
They were greeted by Tanzanian Navy Commander RADM Ligate Sande
and other senior officers along with hundreds of overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Leaving its base in Zhanjiang in southern China on July 5, the
Chinese warships first paid a four-day visit to Malaysia from July
11 to 14.
</P>
<P>
They will leave Tanzania on Sunday for Simonstown, South Africa,
the last leg of the three-nation tour.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in the port of Dar es Salaam, the Chinese
navy men will hold a friendly football match with their Tanzanian
counterparts while the ships are open to the public both on Friday
and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980s, Chinese navy has dispatched 13 ship groups to
visit a total of 17 countries in five continents in the world.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to File Telecommunication Trade Complaint Against Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
announced Friday that it will file a trade complaint against
Mexico before the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the talks
aimed at lowering barriers to competition by U.S.
telecommunication companies have broken down.
</P>
<P>
"These barriers adversely affect U.S. interest and deprive
Mexican citizens of the benefits of competition," U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in announcing the U.S.
action.
</P>
<P>
The administration said it will file in the next several days a
request for consultations with Mexico before the World Trade
Organization in Geneva. That request will seek a 60-day
consultation period between the two nations. If the issues are
still not resolved, the United States would be cleared to file a
WTO case against Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky said a failure of Mexican authorities to carry
through on their promises triggered the administration's decision
to begin the process that could result in a WTO case against
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
However, Barshefsky said it was still the administration's hope
that the telecommunications issues be resolved during the next 60
days of consultations, allowing the administration to drop the
action.
</P>
<P>
U.S. telecommunications companies, including AT&AMP;T and MCI
WorldCom, contend that the Mexican government and Mexico's
dominant telephone company, Telmex, have engaged in unfair
practices aimed at restricting access by foreign competitors.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky said that in the case of Mexico, the issues involved
high fees charged foreign carriers to connect to Telmex lines,
improper rate schedules imposed for international calls and the
failure of Mexican authorities to carry through on deregulation of
Mexico's telephone market.

<HEADLINE> Tire Explosion Could Be Origin of Fire on Concorde: Investigators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The explosion of one or two tires
could be the origin of the fire which engulfed the rear part of
the Air France Concorde before it crashed, said investigators
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Accident Investigation (BEA) said in a communique
that one or two tires on the undercarriage on the left side of
plane was destroyed during the take-off and that the fire did not
seem to come from an engine on the left wing as it was previously
thought.
</P>
<P>
"We notice notably the destruction of one and perhaps two tires
of the four tires of the left principal undercarriage," said BEA.
</P>
<P>
But it said that it is still too early to deduce the cause of
the accident.
</P>
<P>
The BEA said that the debris of tire was found on the No. 26
runway used by the Concorde, but no debris from inside the engine
had been found so far.
</P>
<P>
"No debris from inside the engine has been found. The origin of
the fire appears to be outside the engines," it said, adding that
it remains to be determined yet.
</P>
<P>
The Concorde plane has three undercarriages, one with two
wheels in front and two "principal undercarriages " with four
wheels under both wings in the rear part of the fuselage.

<HEADLINE> Lloyds TSB Push Profits Up 12 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain's most profitable retail
bank, Lloyds TSB, has reported a 12 percent rise in profits, a
better result than expected by City analysts.
</P>
<P>
The bank's pre-tax profits for the first six months of this
year increased to 2.068 billion pounds (1.365 billion U.S. dollars)
from 1.853 billion pounds (1.223 billion dollars) in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Economists in the City expected the bank's profits in the first
half of the year would be 1.950 to 2.010 billion pounds (1.287 to
1.327 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bank also named Shell deputy chairman Marten van den Bergh
as successor for its chairman Brian Pitman, who will retire in
April 2001.
</P>
<P>
Neither the result nor the appointment did anything to support
Lloyd's sliding share price, though. Its shares were down after
the results, falling 2 percent to 573 pence Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Competition in the UK banking sector is intense, and as a
result Lloyd's share price has halved during the past year,
underperforming the banking sector by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
A senior equity salesman said, "If you just look at the results
in isolation, you would expect the stock to go better, but the
strategy worries are still there and the sector is not having a
nice time."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows 5.2 Percent in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy increased at
an annual rate of 5.2 percent in the second quarter of this year,
up from a revised 4.8 percent in the first quarter, the Commerce
Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration in real gross domestic product (GDP), the
total output of goods and services produced in the country, in the
second quarter came as a surprise to economists, who had widely
forecast that the economy had slowed in the spring under the
impact of a series of interest rate increases by the Federal
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
But the report also showed that inflation remained in check in
the period. A GDP price gauge favored by Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan rose at an annual rate of just 2.3 percent in the second
quarter, down from a first quarter rate of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The major contributors to second quarter GDP growth were
inventory buildup, business investment and government spending.
The acceleration was partially offset by a slower rate of consumer
spending and a worsening trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Businesses increased inventories by 60.3 billion dollars,
compared with a rise of 36.6 billion in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Federal government spending rose 17.5 percent in the second
quarter after falling 14.2 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Total private domestic investment rose 21.2 percent in the
second quarter, up from a 5.1 percent rate in the first quarter.
Software and computer equipment spending rose 21 percent in the
second quarter, up from 20.6 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending on goods and services gained 3 percent in the
second quarter after a surge of 7.6 percent in the first, which
was the fastest rise since the second quarter of 1983.
</P>
<P>
The worsening trade deficit subtracted 1.5 percentage points
from GDP growth in the second quarter, compared to a reduction of
0.9 percentage points in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Friday's report included the government's annual revisions of
past GDP data. Those revisions left the annual GDP increase at 4.2
percent in 1999 but revised upward the gains in 1998, from 4.3
percent to 4.4 percent, and in 1997, from 4.2 percent to 4.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly movements were also revised, with the fourth
quarter of 1999 now shown as increasing at an astonishing 8.3
percent pace, the strongest since a 9 percent surge in the second
quarter of 1984.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times over
the past 13 months in an effort to slow the economy and keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that the growth remains robust, economists said,
the Fed may be forced to boost interest rates for a seventh time
at its next meeting on August 22 to keep inflation in check.

<HEADLINE> Bank of America to Cut 10,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Bank of America Corp. will cut
as many as 10,000 jobs across the country over the next year to
improve its earnings and efficiency, the bank announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The cuts, about 7 percent of the Charlotte, South Carolina bank
's 150,000-person work force, will focus on middle- and upper-
level management as well as jobs made unnecessary by improvements
in efficiency, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The company's chairman and chief executive officer, Hugh L.
McColl Jr., said the days of the banking company's rapid,
nationwide expansion from its North Carolina base are over and it
needs to concentrate on improving its daily business.
</P>
<P>
The company, the nation's second-largest bank in terms of
assets behind Citigroup, was created in 1998 when Charlotte-based
NationsBank acquired San Francisco-based BankAmerica. It employed
150,854 people as of June 30, more than 11,000 fewer than a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The bank reported earlier this month that second-quarter
earnings were 2.06 billion U.S. dollars, up slightly from 1.92
billion dollars in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said Bank of America's difficulties have come as
it shifts its growth strategy. After growing in the 1990s by
acquiring other institutions, Bank of America is now looking to
get more revenue from existing operations.
</P>
<P>
The bank has more than 4,500 branches in 21 states. It serves
more than 30 million households and 2 million businesses.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Safety Supervision on Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China today formed an organization
to improve supervision of shipping safety on the mighty Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the Chinese Ministry of Communications,
the newly-founded Yangtze River Maritime Affairs Bureau will
oversee safety on the Yangtze by preventing pollution caused by
ships, conducting checkups of vessels, and enforcing rules and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Operating under the State Maritime Affairs Administration, the
new bureau, located in Wuhan, a leading industrial city on the
upper reaches of the river, will also set up branches in other
cities along the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's predecessor was the Yangtze River Shipping Affairs
Bureau, which was later renamed the Yangtze River Ports and
Shipping Supervision Bureau. It was also in charge of monitoring
safety on the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Shipping service on the Yangtze has been expanding rapidly
since China started its reforms in 1978, and the river is now the
country's busiest in terms of cargo and passenger transportation
volume.
</P>
<P>
To date, 3,000 companies ship on the mighty waterway, ferrying
60 million passengers and carrying 186 million tons of cargo
annually.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 15 ports on the Yangtze are authorized to open to
foreign vessels. So far this year, more than 80,000 foreign
vessels have entered these ports.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 28 (Xinhua) -- No drafts can be made of major
policies of local governments in south China's Guangdong Province
without prior approval from the local people's congresses,

the legal system, education, science, culture, health and sports,
importance measures covering population, the environment and
resources, and amendments to local economic and social development
plans.

The Guangdong People's Congress also stipulated 17 items that
require local governments to report to the local people's
congresses at various levels for making of new policies.
</P>
<P>
They include the use and administration of education funds,
administration of old-aged pension, and public funding for housing
construction.

KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral relations between
Malaysia and Bangladesh will be further enhanced with the four-day
visit by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina beginning Monday,
the Malaysian Foreign Ministry said Friday.

</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina, to be accompanied by a 73-member delegation
including senior officials including Labour and Employment
Minister M.A. Mannan and State Minister for Foreign Affairs Abul
Hasan Chowdhury, will call on Mahathir and attend a bilateral
meeting when the two leaders are expected to discuss and exchange
views on various bilateral, regional and international issues of
mutual interest, it said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Investment in SIP Termed Great Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Jurong Town
Corporation International Pte Ltd (JTCI), Singapore's largest
investment company, said here Friday that his company has enjoyed
great success in all its investment in the China-Singapore Suzhou
Industrial Park (SIP), a cooperation project between the
governments of China and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
JTCI's Managing Director Dominic Ng made the point at a
signing ceremony of a Memorandum of Understanding between JTCI and
the Beijing Economic and Technological Investments Development
Corporation for collaboration in projects in the Beijing Economic-
Technological Development Area.
</P>
<P>
He said that both the Xinsu Industrial Development Company and
the consultancy arm - JTCI Consultant (Suzhou) set up by JTCI in
SIP in 1994 are presently doing well and reaping profits.
</P>
<P>
"To-date, Xinsu has 57 international investors, with 100%
occupancy for its standard factories and 70 percent for flatted
factories," he said.
</P>
<P>
With almost full occupancy for its factories, Xinsu has bought
more land in the SIP to develop its next phase of ready-built
factories and also is working on build-to-suit clients within SIP
he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to JTCI Suzhou, he said the JTCI wholly-owned
subsidiary is currently handling several projects in building and
building design, infrastructural works, project management and
fitting-out works.
</P>
<P>
JTCI Suzhou has made great strides in China with its services
being widely accepted by many multinational companies and
industrial park developers in China and it has proceeded to expand
its business beyond Suzhou to Chongqing, Zhejiang, Shanghai and
Beijing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked for a general assessment on JTCI's investment in SIP, Ng
responded that it has been totally a success. His assessment
contradicted the negative assessment by quite a number of
Singaporeans who think Singapore's investments in SIP have
suffered setbacks.
</P>
<P>
Lim Neo Chian, JTCI Chairman who doubles as the Chief Executive
Officer of the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Co Ltd,
confirmed that JTCI will continue to grow its business in SIP.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for Incontestable Presidential Election in Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- France Friday called for an
incontestable presidential election in Cote d'Ivoire and denied
that it wants to interfere into the internal affairs of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Cote d'Ivoire has protested against the remarks by French
Minister-Delegate for Cooperation Charles Josselin, who said that
the country's opposition leader Alassane Ouattra should be able to
run as a presidential candidate in the election in October and
advised the junta leader Robert Guei against running for the
president.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry assistant spokesman Bernard Valero said
that Cote d'Ivoire needs an incontestable presidential election
and needs to concentrate on solving its problems.
</P>
<P>
"The stand of France is clear and constant. France backs the
electoral process in Cote d'Ivoire for the re-establishment of
democracy in conformity with the timetable announced," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Cote d'Ivoire regarded the remarks of Josselin as an
interference into its internal affairs and some people protested
on Friday in front of the French embassy in Abidjan, according to
reports from Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The military junta also stopped the opposition leader Ouattra
from embarking on a plane bound for Paris on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The French spokesman said that he has no comment on the event,
but called on Cote d'Ivoire authorities to guarantee the normal
life of the 20,000 French nationals in their country.
</P>
<P>
"Appeasement and calmness are important. We trust our friends
of Cote d'Ivoire. France hopes that the members of the French
community could continue to see to their activities in a normal
way," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A gunman who took National
Airlines jet pilots hostage at John F. Kennedy International
Airport Thursday night surrendered to the police Friday after a 5-
hour standoff.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, Aaron Commey, rushed into the plane with over 140
passengers on board about 10:30 PM EST and took pilot and co-pilot
hostage, allowing the passengers and the crew of seven to escape,
authorities said. The plane was ready to departure for Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
He released them later with a list of demands, including his
wish to speak to Argentine diplomats to the United States. Police
said the message was passed on, without giving further details.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, 22, surrendered at about 3:30 AM Friday. He walked
off the Boeing 757 with arms handcuffed behind his back. No
injuries were reported during the whole process.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the flight had been delayed by fog about an hour
but was ready to take off when the man flashed his gun at airline
workers, rushing onto the plane and into the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
National Airlines began service in 1999. It provides daily
nonstop flights between Las Vegas and major metropolitan areas in
the United States, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and
Miami.

CHONGQING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- For the second time in recent
week days, a lawsuit has been filed against Canon China Co. Ltd
over promotional material that implies Hong Kong and Taiwan are
separate states instead of China's areas.
</P>
<P>
Today a suit was filed by attorney Lu Lei, from the Chongqing-
based Hezong Law Office, who claimed information in Canon's
website, canon.com.cn., is worded to mean that Hong Kong and
Taiwan are states.
</P>
<P>
Canon China Co., Ltd is the copyright owner of the website.
</P>
<P>
The first suit against Canon came from Tang Weijiang, 29, a
Chongqing resident, who accused the Canon Hong Kong Co., Ltd of
implying in a promotional CD for canon laser printers that Hong
Kong and Taiwan are states.
</P>
<P>
Contained on the disc is a segment titled "100 Changes of Zhao
Wei," which describes various countries the popular young Chinese
actress has visited, naming China, Hong Kong and Taiwan
individually.
</P>
<P>
Zhao was named best female lead at the 17th China Gold-Eagle
Awards last year for her performance in the TV series "Princess
Huanzhu." She became the spokeswoman for Canon laser printers last
year.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Lu said that Canon Hong Kong Co., Ltd has apologized
and pledged to recall and destroy all similar discs, and has
described calling Hong Kong and Taiwan states in the CDs as an "
editing mistake" -- an explanation he said he doesn't buy.
</P>
<P>
He said that this is not simply an accidental slip up in
editing, but an intentional action seriously hurt the feelings of
the Chinese people. The Canon company must face legal punishment,
Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu has filed a lawsuit with the Chongqing No.1 Intermediate
People's Court against the Canon China Co., Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Canon Hong Kong Co., Ltd and Canon China Co., Ltd are two
companies solely-funded by the Canon company of Japan. The two
companies were established in 1971 and 1997, respectively.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Listed Commercial Company Formed in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Friendship Overseas
Chinese Incorporated Co., Ltd. has become China's largest listed
commercial company after reorganizing its assets.
</P>
<P>
The company, listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 1994,
currently has a network of 760 commercial establishments across
China, covering a total space of 490,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
With a cost of 385 million yuan (46.4 million U.S. dollars),
the company recently bought the Lianhua Supermarket, China's
leading supermarket, and Fuxingdao Commodity Circulation Base, one
of the oldest commercial storage bases in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Lianhua has a total of 734 chain stores nationwide and its
sales volume was ranked the first among supermarkets in China for
three years. The sales volume of the Lianhua was 730 million yuan
in 1999, and reached 550 million yuan in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the number of Linahua's chain stores will
increase to 1,800 by 2002, with its sales volume up to 18 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Business experts say there is little room for the development
of the retail trade, therefore department stores will face more
difficulties and risks.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale assets reorganization of Shanghai Friendship
Overseas Chinese Incorporated Co., Ltd. is a successful experiment
in the restructuring of China's commercial businesses and is of
great importance to the reform of state-owned commercial firms,
experts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- With set orientation, objectives
and plans for the development of relations in the 21st century,
China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will
continue to work together in political, economic and security
aspects, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the annual ASEAN-China Dialogue, Tang said
China will maintain exchanges at various levels with ASEAN, and is
ready to increase bilateral security dialogue with the regional
grouping.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the two sides intensify joint efforts to
advance mutual cooperations, such as economic, trade, investment,
financial, scientific, technological and other fields.
</P>
<P>
China would also like to discuss with ASEAN countries on ways
to better incorporate its policy to develop its west region into
Sino-ASEAN cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed China's hope to strengthen coordination and
cooperation with ASEAN in regional and international affairs, with
priorities given to the 10+3 (ASEAN plus China, Japan and the
Republic of Korea) cooperation, among others.
</P>
<P>
Tang disclosed that Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji will attend the
fourth East Asian leadership meeting, which he said demonstrates
China's strong support to the East Asian cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said he is happy about the "vigor
and vitality" that Sino-ASEAN relations have shown at the turn of
the century and both sides have made considerable progress in
exploring a new-type bilateral relationship, which is based on
good-neighborliness, mutual trust, dialogue and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt-MILF Talks Postponed to August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The resumption of talks between the
Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
will not take place Saturday as earlier scheduled but some time in
August as requested by the MILF.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said Friday in a
statement that government panel chairman Edgardo Batenga has
relayed this information to the Executive Committee during its
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"So that would mean that the July 29 talks would not push
through because they (MILF) are suggesting August. There is no
specific date (and) they are suggesting that preferably it should
be done outside the country," Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
But Aguirre said the government will persuade the MILF to agree
to hold the talks inside the country now that the MILF panel
members will be given safety and security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
However, the advisor said MILF chairman Hashim Salamat and
other MILF leaders may not qualify for the safe conduct pass since
there is a pending warrant for their arrest issued by a court in
General Santos City for their alleged involvement in bombings in
the city.
</P>
<P>
"We have to respect the court. The safety and security
guarantee is applicable only to offenses that are political in
nature like rebellion, sedition, conspiracy and similar offenses,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre also assured the public that back-channeling with the
MILF will continue, adding that the government is heartened over
the MILF's seeming openness to discuss autonomy as the solution to
the Mindanao problem.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF is the country's largest Muslim rebel
group which has been fighting for the establishment of an
independent state in Mindanao for more than two decades.

<HEADLINE> Hostages' Safety Remains Paramount: Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Friday reassured the international community that his government
continues to work for the safe release of the remaining hostages
in the hands of the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed from the United States by a local radio station,
the president made it clear that the Philippine government
continues to put a premium on the hostages' safety.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the negotiations. We cannot rush the
process. We can do this, but our paramount concern is the hostages
' safety. They should be freed unharmed," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada asked the governments of the foreign hostages to be a
bit more patient as chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado
explores all peaceful avenues to secure the release of the
remaining captives.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Abu Sayyaf released German journalist Andreas
Lorenz and a Filipino preacher.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf kidnapped on April 23 two Filipinos and 19
foreign hostages from a resort island in Malaysia and later
brought them to Jolo, Sulu province in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group has also captured six journalists and 13
preachers in Sulu province since last month.
</P>
<P>
Of the 21 hostages abducted from Malaysia, a German woman and
six Malaysians have been released by the group while others are
still being kept in Abu Sayyaf's hideout in Jolo.

<P>
The GTS Katie, a U.S.-owned cargo ship, has been circling in
the Atlantic ocean about 600 nautical miles east of the Canadian
port of Halifax because of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The crew is reported to be under orders from the Katie's owners,
Third Ocean Marine Navigation of Annapolis, to remain at sea until
the financial dispute is settled.
</P>
<P>
The giant cargo vessel retrieved Canadian equipment from Kosovo
with 10 percent of the country's military fleet of armored
vehicles on board, including 580 tanks and armored personnel
carriers, as well as 390 sea containers.
</P>
<P>
The Department of National Defense is alleged to have already
paid 1.3 million Canadian dollars (about 883,350 U.S. dollars) to
SVD Logistics, an international shipping company, which
subcontracted with Third Ocean for use of the Katie.
</P>
<P>
The department said that it was unable to comment the dispute
between the two firms, believing it did not directly involve the
Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the department, Randy Mylyk, has said that
Defense Minister Art Eggleton "has requested that the department
explore all options that would bring a speedy and final end to the
present conflict and recoup the equipment that is presently being
held."
</P>

"Obviously all diplomatic and other means are being used to try
to bring an end to the impasse right now," said the spokesman.

WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Five members of the Magnificent
Seven backed to compete at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships in St.
Louis Thursday evening as the first steps to vye for the Olympic
berths in Syndey.
</P>
<P>
Amy Chow was magnificent once again, Dominique Moceanu wasn't
bad herself and Shannon Miller offered a 30-second thrill hailed
both by the audience and the judges, as they were veteran members
of the Seven, the group that took the Olympic gold medal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chow used a sparkling routine on the uneven bars to finish in
third place with a total of 37.700 in the preliminaries, and
Moceanu overcame an ankle injury in warmups to grit out a 10th-
place finish, well in the hunt for a spot on the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
Miller, recovering from a hairline crack in her right shin,
skipped the first three apparatuses before scoring a 9.650 in the
uneven bars, tying her for second among the 30 competitors.
</P>
<P>
Miller can withdraw from Saturday's finals and coach Steve
Nunno can submit a petition after the meet to get her into the
Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
Another comeback hopeful Dominique Dawes landed squarely on her
backside on her second vault. She finished with 36.512 points and
dropped from 10th to 13th.
</P>
<P>
Two-time defending national champion Kristen Maloney scored a 9.
825 on the floor exercise to take the lead with 38.262 points.
Elise Ray, the country's best finisher last year at the World
Championships, was 0.050 points back.
</P>
<P>
The top 12 finishers at the nationals will advance to the
trials where US coach Bela karolyi will head a committee that will
choose six members of the Olympic team. Performances at nationals
and trials will be used to rank the gymnasts, but they won't be

<HEADLINE> E-Commerce Not to Be Tax-Free: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China has no plan to exempt the
fast growing e-commerce from taxes, according to a top Chinese tax
official.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the news weekly Outlook, Jin Renqing,
director of the State Administration of Taxation (SAT), noted that
some people had misunderstandings about e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
"To put it simply, e-commerce refers to business transactions
conducted on the Internet. It is, in essence, the same as those
made in department stores," Jin was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce, featuring high technologies, reduces the cost of
doing business and expands the business coverage. It is expected
to hugely impact the world's economic development.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that tax exemption for e-commerce will appear in
countries with the fastest development of e-commerce dominated
markets.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official today
called for more diversified actions to encourage Chinese students
abroad to serve the motherland in ways that would aid the nation's
economic and scientific progress.
</P>
<P>
Song Defu, minister of personnel, said that overseas students
could choose to return and work in the motherland or serve the
motherland wherever they may be.
</P>
<P>
Such service could include joint or individual research,
setting up new ventures, or conducting lectures, academic
exchanges and consultations.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it will be a long and difficult task to
attract the overseas students and create a favorable environment
for them, adding that departments concerned should stick to the
state policy of "supporting students studying overseas,
encouraging them to return and let them decide for themselves
whether to come or go."
</P>
<P>
During the 1872-1978 period, China dispatched some 130,000
students abroad for schooling, while during the 1978-1999 period,
more than 320,000 Chinese went abroad to further their studies,
out of whom more than 110,000 returned home.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and his New
Zealand counterpart Philip Goff met here Friday, on establishing
diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the first formal ministerial-level meeting between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers, here attending the 7th ASEAN Regional Forum,
exchanged views on the development of bilateral relations and
international issues, said a press release issued by the DPRK side.
</P>
<P>
They reached "the unanimity of views" that the establishment of
formal state relations conforms to the international trend toward
reconciliation and cooperation, and is beneficial to the peace,
security and prosperity of the region, said the press release.

<P>
The two ministers agreed to hold on an early date working-level
negotiation between the foreign ministries for the establishment
of DPRK-New Zealand diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Paek and Goff also agreed "to develop the bilateral relations
positively and to continue dialogues and cooperation in regional

</P>
<P>
Goff said he conveyed to his DPRK counterpart that New Zealand

<HEADLINE> DPRK, U.S. Hold Historic Ministerial Meeting in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talking to the media after her meeting with Paek Nam Sun,
Albright said, "my meeting with Paek is substantively modest but
symbolically historic a step away from the hostility of the past
and towards more direct and promising approach to resolving the
differences and establishing common ground."
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held on the sideline of the meeting between the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its 10 dialogue
partners.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of Friday's meeting was to make the two foreign
ministers get acquainted and make the two countries realize their
interests in more normal bilateral ties and to touch on briefly
the core issues they have discussed on the other levels for some
time, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Albright told Paek the United States welcomes DPRK's decision
to participate in the ASEAN Regional Forum because DPRK has the
potential to contribute in an important way to a more stable Asia-
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
She voiced full support of the United States for the
intensified inter-Korean dialogue now under way, saying that the
process of mutual engagement can "do much to address the needs and
aspirations of all Koreans."
</P>
<P>
The United States is also encouraged by DPRK's efforts to
expand relations with other countries and its moratorium of long-
range missile launch, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Replying to the question whether the United States still
considers DPRK "an enemy," Albright said, "I made it very clear it
is very important to get past the 50 years of hostility and look
toward the future."
</P>
<P>
The United States and DPRK have taken some "modest steps" and
this meeting is a step in that direction, she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright said she remained realistic about the development of
the bilateral ties but had become "somehow more optimistic" than
before about the prospects of the long-term stability of the
Korean Peninsula and throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
Albright said she and Paek expected to meet each other at the
General Assembly of the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Urged to Join Mainland in Developing Western Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong investors and business
people are urged to join the Chinese mainland in developing China'
s vast western areas which have great development potentials but
are comparatively underdeveloped presently.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar held here Friday on the development of China's
west, participants from the mainland and Hong Kong said that Hong
Kong, as an international trade and finance center, has a pivotal
role to play in channeling in funds and technologies for China's
west.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Enzhu, director of the Liaison Office of the Central
People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,
said the development of the west offers Hong Kong industrial and
business circles unparalleled opportunities to participate in
China's domestic construction.
</P>
<P>
The development of China's west will stimulate demands for
capital, which will help solidify Hong Kong's position as an
international finance center since Hong Kong can serve as a fund-
raising base for domestic projects, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 18 years, Jiang said, the central government has
spent 17,000 billion yuan (2,073 billion U.S. dollars) on fixed
assets investment nationwide, among which 7,000 billion yuan (853.
7 billion U.S. dollars), or 40 percent of the total, has been
invested in the west.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of China's west development strategy,
more investments are needed, and more and more mainland projects
and enterprises will turn to the Hong Kong stock exchange or its
growth enterprise market for overseas capital.
</P>
<P>
This will not only help open up more capital-raising channels
for China's domestic construction, but also help develop Hong Kong
's financial market and cement its position as an international
finance center, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the development of the western areas will further increase
China's external trade, Jiang said, it will offer more room for
the development of trade between Hong Kong and the mainland and
help Hong Kong strengthen its role as an international trade and
transportation center.
</P>
<P>
Since the inauguration of China's opening up and reform policy,
trade between Hong Kong and the mainland has been surging forward,
from 117 billion HK dollars (15 billion U.S. dollars) in 1978 to 2,
776 billion HK dollars (356 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Exports from Hong Kong to the mainland have grown by 38.7
percent annually, and re-exports by 46 percent. For 14 consecutive
years, the mainland has been ranked the No.1 trading partner of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With its sound transportation infrastructure, wide-links with
the outside world and fine market information-gathering mechanism,
Hong Kong is facing a brilliant prospect in terms of developing
trade with the mainland, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The development of the west will create many business
opportunities and stimulate Hong Kong's industrial and business
sectors to make full use of its advantages and further cooperation
and exchanges with the Chinese mainland, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Hong Kong's cooperation with the mainland is mainly
focused on the Pearl River delta and the southern coastal areas,
and, after the implementation of China's west development strategy,
the cooperation can be extended to the western areas, since the
government is offering preferential policies for trail blazers in
the west, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Michael C C SZE, executive director of the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council, said that since the central and western areas
of China is a market full of potentials, Hong Kong entrepreneurs
with the intention to enter the mainland market would better move
their businesses to the vast western areas rather than flooding
into southeast coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong businesspeople can make use of the advantages of
China's northwest areas in technology, products and talents, to
carry out cooperation and jointly develop tourism, Chinese herbal
medicine processing and building material projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Development experts from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong
business leaders, including Fok Ying Tung, vice-chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, attended the half-day seminar co-organized by Hong
Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and several other
business organizations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Outlines Keys of Western Region Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China will take practical steps
in the western region development this year to get a good start of
the strategy, said an official in charge of the western region
development Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ning Jizhe, deputy director of the Western Region Development
Office of the State Council, said key areas have been outlined in
the western region development strategy for the following five to
ten years.
</P>
<P>
China will make marked progress in infrastructure construction,
environmental protection, and developing economy with western
characteristics as well as science and education, said Ning at a
seminar on business opportunities of China's western region
development held here.
</P>
<P>
He noted districts with fine economic basis, location
advantages and dense population along the main traffic lines will
be designated as key areas of the western region development.
</P>
<P>
A number of core cities will be first developed along the main
traffic lines so that their adjacent areas will grow along with
them, he said, adding that the western region development must be
conducted in steps with key areas.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the western region development requires the
study of new ideology, method and mechanism in accordance with the
changing situation, in particularly formulating practical measures
to accelerate the western region development.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the measures of infrastructure investment, Ning said
ten major infrastructure projects that are ripe for start-up will
be launched this year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will accomplish the investment of 32
billion yuan (3.86 billion U.S. dollars) to accelerate the pace of
some 78 on-going large and medium-sized infrastructure projects,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, preparation will be made for some key projects,
including the gas pipeline from the Tarim Basin in northwest China
's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to Shanghai in the east, the
railway to Tibet and the construction of hydroelectric power
stations in the southwest, he said.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accident Claims Nine Deaths in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 9 people were killed and
15 others wounded in a traffic accident in Gaziantep province,
southeast Turkey, on Friday, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place when a minibus was running into an
automobile with foreign plate in a province adjacent to Syria.
</P>
<P>
After the collision, fire broke out in the minibus which caused
the accident by overtaking the foreign automobile wrongfully.
</P>
<P>
Among the passengers in the minibus, 9 were burnt to death and
15 others were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
The injured were rushed to the hospitals in Gaziantep for
emergency treatment.
</P>
<P>
This is the second fatal traffic accident within two days.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a passenger coach ran into the back of a truck on
Balikesir-Izmir highway, west Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The bus driver died instantly and the coach went out of control,
rolling for a further 20 meters, causing six more dead and 39
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is known to be prone to accidents, which are largely
attributed to rough roads and careless driving.
</P>
<P>
To combat the mounting threat of the "traffic monster",
Parliament authorized a traffic accident probe group to prepare a
bill to be taken for debate when it resumes in October after its
summer recession.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Customs Officials' Meeting Opens in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of directors-general of
customs of member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) opened here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day eighth meeting is the first of its kind hosted by
Myanmar, attended by delegates from 10 ASEAN member nations and
Japan and officials of the ASEAN Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The directors-general will discuss the main objectives set in
the ASEAN Customs Agreement approved by finance ministers of the
ASEAN member countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the meeting, Myanmar
Minister of Finance and Revenue U Khin Maung Thein stressed the
importance of development which emerged during the recent years,
saying that the Northeast Asian countries -- China, Japan and
South Korea share a common destiny with ASEAN member states.
</P>
<P>
He anticipates that interaction between the ASEAN and these
three nations will be developed further in the future following
areas of cooperation between them were agreed upon at the first
meeting of ASEAN economic ministers and their counterparts from
the three nations held in Yangon last May.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ASEAN finance ministers met in the same month in
Chiang Mai, Thailand where the ASEAN +3 decided to establish
another important milestone called the "Chiang Mai Initiative"
designed to provide financial assistance to the ASEAN region as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar minister also emphasized that all endeavors for the
economic development of his country are being made from its own
resources, pledging that Myanmar will continue its dedication to
the economic development in the region and looking forward to
closer cooperation among ASEAN countries in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As a result, in a short span of just two decades, China has
scored tremendous achievements in its socialist modernization
drive and made historical progress in lifting its people from
poverty and ensuring them a more comfortable life, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Tang said, China's economic development has entered
a critical stage of shifting the growth mode and improving the
quality and efficiency of growth.
</P>
<P>
China will make strategic readjustment of the economic
structure, vigorously develop new and high technologies and high-
tech industries, build an information-based national economy,
continue to deepen the reform of the economic system, further
implement the strategy of revitalizing the country through science
and technology, the Chinese foreign minister noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, China will speed up its all-directional
opening-up endeavor, and take part in the process of economic
globalization in a wider spectrum of areas.
</P>
<P>
In the globalization process, which Tang said has both
advantages and disadvantages for his country, China will carefully
and properly handle three sets of relationships: firstly, the
relationship between participation in the globalization process
and independent development, secondly, the relationship between
participation in the process and maintenance of national interests,
and thirdly, the relationship between participation in the process
and safeguarding China's economic security.
</P>
<P>
In short, Tang told his counterparts from the ASEAN+10 that
China stands "ready to work with the people of other Asian
countries to meet the challenges of globalization and constantly
advance the development, progress and civilization of humanity."

<HEADLINE> "Human Error" Not Excluded in Concorde Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS,July 28 (Xinhua) -- Investigators have presented two
hypotheses, including a "human error," on the crash of an Air
France Concorde Tuesday,daily newspaper Le Figaro reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro said that experts of the General Direction of
Aviation recognized that a "human error" resulting in the "
introduction of a strange body in the motor system" was not
excluded.
</P>
<P>
It could be a thrown away part, a forgotten tool or even a bird,
the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Primary investigation results showed that engine No. 2 under
the left-wing of the Concorde failed and caught fire as the plane
was taking off from the runway.
</P>
<P>
Engine No. 1 under the same wing also broke down before the
plane crashed and the undercarriage of the plane did not come up,
according to record of the dialogue between the crew and the
control tower and data recordings by the two black boxes.
</P>
<P>
Some debris of tire were found on or near the runway,
indicating that a tire blew up during the take-off. This could
also be the cause of the fire, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Parisien said on Friday that an afterburning pump
of engine No. 2 under the left wing was replaced several hours
before the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
Air France sources close to the mechanics who repaired the
engine said that a team worked for a long time on the afterburning
circuit of the left-wing engines, said Le Parisien.
</P>
<P>
The afterburning pump sends kerosene under high pressure in the
last part of the turbine, giving a supplementary push which is
indispensable for a take-off.
</P>
<P>
Air France said on Tuesday that a reserver was replaced on
engine No. 2 shortly before the plane took off. A reserver serves
to slow down the plane when it is landing or to abort a take-off.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Tokyo District Court on Friday
handed down a death sentence to former senior AUM Shinrikyo cult
member Kiyohide Hayakawa for his role in two separate murder cases
and for building a plant to mass-produce nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the ruling, Presiding Judge Kaoru Kanayama said
Hayakawa played a leading role on his own initiative in the
November 1989 killings of a lawyer and his two family members in
Yokohama.
</P>
<P>
Hayakawa is the seventh person to be sentenced to death for a
series of crimes involving AUM.
</P>
<P>
The judge refuted Hayakawa's defense that he was only following
the orders of AUM founder Shoko Asahara, saying that he conspired
with Asahara to kill the family.
</P>
<P>
"It is unforgivable that he showed no hesitation to kill in the
interest of the religious group. There is no room at all for mercy.
We cannot see even a fragment of humanity in him," the judge said.

<P>
The lawyer had been aiding families of cult members who were
seeking their defection from the cult.
</P>
<P>
Hayakawa was also convicted for the February 1989 strangling of
a 21-year-old cult member who wanted to leave AUM.
</P>
<P>
Hayakawa assembled a sarin plant at an AUM facility in
Yamanashi Prefecture, west of Tokyo, after procuring equipment and
raw materials for it between 1993 and 1994, the court ruled.
</P>
<P>
Sarin gas was used in the 1994 attack in Matsumoto, Nagano
Prefecture, and the 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway system. The
two crimes claimed 19 lives and injured thousands.
</P>
<P>
Public prosecutors sought the death sentence last December for
Hayakawa, known among AUM followers as the cult's "construction
minister." Hayakawa has admitted to all seven charges against him.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Registers Surplus in Social Security System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's social security system
will have a surplus of 60 billion Belgian francs (1.38 billion U.S.
dollars) for the years of 2000 and 2001, local media reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The estimated surplus was attributed to the country's strong
economic growth. The system showed last year a deficit of 12
billion Belgian francs (about 276 million dollars), said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Social Affairs Minister Frank Vandenbroucke said that
the extra money will be used to increase certain benefits and to
save for less prosperous days.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says Over 120 Rebels Killed in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military said Friday
that its troops in the republic of Chechnya killed more than 120
rebels and repelled several attacks on federal units on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rocket and artillery strikes were delivered at rebel
concentrations in several communities after the federal troops
received intelligence reports on them, the Interfax news agency
cited the press center of the Russian forces in the North Caucasus
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-eight rebels were killed near Dargo, up to 50 in
Elistanzhi, 21 around Selmentauzen and 19 in Khatuni," the press
center said.
</P>
<P>
Another 12 wounded rebels were discovered in a hospital in
Shalazhi, and two of them died of their wounds in the hospital
Friday morning, the press center said.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen rebels surrendered to federal troops on Thursday, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Federal aviation carried out four combat missions in Chechnya
on Thursday while Mi-24 and Mi-8 helicopter gunships and Mi-26
transport helicopters made 28 flights, the headquarters of the
federal force in the North Caucasus told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Mi-24 helicopter gunships escorting ground forces prevented an
attack on a federal convoy, killing eight rebels by air raids,
said the headquarters, not naming where the battle took place.
</P>
<P>
Su-25 attack aircraft delivered rocket and bomb strikes on
rebel bases discovered earlier in Argun gorge and the mountainous
parts of Vedeno district.
</P>
<P>
Now Russian troops in Chechnya are conducting an operation
against a rebel group up to 200-strong in south and southwest of
Khankala, near the Chechen capital of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Judging by air reconnaissance reports, rocket and bomb strikes
targeted at the group have inflicted losses on the rebels, the
headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Russian forces also dispersed a rebel group
numbering up to 50 in the suburbs of Grozny and a rebel group near
the town of Serzhen-Yurt, said the military.

SHANGHAI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China's most advanced cold-rolled
steel production line goes into operation today in the Baoshan
Iron and Steel Company in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The production line costing 8 billion yuan (964 million US
dollars) is capable of producing 1.4 million tons of cold-rolled
steel a year. It is estimated that the company's sales income will
increase by 7 billion yuan (843 million dollars) a year. It will
become one of the company's major income sources.
</P>
<P>
Main equipment of the production line was imported from Japan
and Germany, and supporting facilities were made by Chinese
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The company is expected to supply cold-rolled steel used in
manufacturing cars for the Shanghai Volkswagen Corp. and the
Shanghai General Motors Co. Ltd..
</P>
<P>
However, the company's general manager Xie Qihua said that
although the production line can produce some 1,000 kinds of cold-

<HEADLINE> Grain Prices Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The prices of wheat, corn and rice,
the three major grains in China, have improved after falling for
four consecutive years, according to the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale
Market.
</P>
<P>
Wheat prices will be 1,000 to 1,200 yuan per ton in the near
future and rise further in two or three years. High-quality wheat
will score even higher growth, according to experts from the
market.
</P>
<P>
Corn prices are expected to increase. Recently, the purchasing
price of corn in northeast China, a major production area for the
grain, rose to 0.72 to 0.76 yuan per kilogram from 0.44 to 0.50
yuan per kilogram while the sales price of corn in south China
also increased to 0.96 yuan from 0.88 yuan per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The price of high-quality rice is also rising, while that of
low-quality rice remains low.
</P>
<P>
Authorities note that the improvement in wheat, corn and rice
prices is due to brisk sales of excellent grain and the decrease
of planting acreages of the three crops.

BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai composite index
advanced 16.45 points or 0.8 percent on Friday to 2,012.79 points
from last week's 1,996.34 points.
</P>
<P>
The turnover this week was 61.21 billion yuan, which was 3.1
percent less than that of last week's 63.18 billion yuan,
according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and
securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
After one week, the Shanghai Composite Index crossed 2,000-
point again on Wednesday and touched a new high of 2,025 points on
Thursday and ended over 2,000 points on Friday.
</P>
<P>
During this week, the government media released the China
Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) chief advisor Anthony Neoh
's talks about hotspots on the China's stock market. He said that
China's A-share market will be opened further and foreign
investors will be introduced into the market. He also mentioned
the second board and the combination of A share and B share.
</P>
<P>
Investors were excited by the prospect of more opportunities on
the China's securities market. In addition, the national economy
showed sound growth so far this year, so the whole markets
performed positively.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks and blue chips also helped lift the Shanghai
Composite Index to a new high of 2,025 points.
</P>
<P>
Pudong development Bank and Sichuan Changhong were the market
bellwethers, which had not performed actively in the past few
months.
</P>
<P>
However, investors were still concerned about the market as it
was on the historical high level. There are still pressures from
the profit-taking and the Initial Public Offering (IPO) market,
and risks from listed companies' interim reports still exist.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that the market will probably settle
at the high level next week.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen B-share Market Weekly Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market
mounted some real effort to regain ground this week from its
prolonged correction, triggered by the overall optimism with the
Shenzhen Component Index, a leading indicator for the broader
Shenzhen stock market, hitting three-year fresh highs.
</P>
<P>
The B-share index jumped 2.34 points or 2.08 percent to 114.79
at the end of the week, according to Homeway, China's leading on-
line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The five-day turnover was 729.34 million HK dollars, which was
401.11 million HK dollars or 122.20 percent more than the total of
last week.
</P>
<P>
The market's advance was resumed after the release of a heavy
batch of earnings reports that showed an overall strong growth in
listed companies. Luthai Textile reported it earned 0.27 yuan per
share during the first half of the year from 0.23 yuan apiece a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental support derived from the policy side. The
People's Bank of China, China's central bank, said Wednesday
financial leasing firms will be allowed to borrow hard currencies
from overseas, issue treasury bonds and invest in securities.
Foreign investors are also allowed to buy stakes in these non-
banking financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
On the Initial Public Offering (IPO) side, Shandong Zhonglu
Oceanic fishery Co. Ltd. listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A late wave of selling on profit-taking trimmed a small portion
of the gains after three consecutive sessions of rises, but still
no major disruption lay behind the week's bullish tone.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that the B-share market is likely to
go even further on the plus side next week, given the strong
momentum in the economy, the capital market and the corporate
earnings profile.

<HEADLINE> China's T-bond Market Weekly Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China's T-bond market ended this
week's trading mixed. Of the six current treasuries, three
extended the rise, one kept unchanged while the remaining two
dipped. The repurchasing interest rate continued to drift
downwards slowly.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009905 gained the most by closing up 0.29 yuan, with Bond
009704 next with a rise of 0.17 yuan, and Bond 009908 with an
increase of 0.14 yuan for the week. Bond 009905 has been buoyed up
by buying interest as its coupon payment day is approaching. The
gain of 009704 attributed to the bond's good intrinsic yield,
which is currently at 3.97 percent. Technical indicators show that
the three may maintain the positive trend next week, according to
Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory
company.
</P>
<P>
The two old bonds listed in 1996, 000696 and 000896, suffered
losses of 0.19 yuan and 0.22 yuan respectively this week. And the
floating-rate 010004, which was pretty active since its debut,
stayed unchanged at this week's close with comparatively thin
trade volume, indicating the decreasing investors' enthusiasm on
it.
</P>
<P>
With fewer new stock subscriptions compared to the earlier
weeks, the price of repurchasing transactions showed a slow
correction.
</P>
<P>
The China Three Gorges Project Development Corp issued China's
first floating-rate corporate bonds in China Wednesday. With the
annual coupon rate floating 1.75 percentage points above that of
one year fixed deposits in banks, the ten-year bonds are reported
to have met with a great deal of demand.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Company to restore Hydropower Station in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 28 (Xinhua)-- China will assist Cambodia to
restore a damaged hydropower station at Kirirom, a place 110
kilometers from here, under a contract signed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The project will begin in the middle of next year with a cost
of 20 million U.S. dollars and will be completed by early 2003,
according to Suy Sem, minister of industry, mine and energy.
</P>
<P>
China Electric power Technology Import and Export Cooperation (
CETIC) will carry out the project and transfer it to Cambodia 30
years later.
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed, it will produce 12 megawatts of
power which will also be distributed to Phnom Penh with a cable
connection of 115 kilo volts
</P>
<P>
The hydropower station was once operated in early 1969 with the
cooperation of former Yugoslavia, but it was erupted completely
since 1970 when the war started in this country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM on Efforts Needed in Globalization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its
10 dialogue partners meeting (ASEAN+10), Tang said it is important
for the Asian nations to take an active part in the economic
globalization, and to adapt to the international environment of
economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, he stressed, the Asian countries should give
full consideration to their own national conditions, development
levels and comparative advantages while pressing forward
readjustment and reform, upgrading industrial structures,
promoting scientific and technological advances. By so doing, they
would be able to steadily increase their aggregate national
strength, competitiveness and the capacity to protect themselves
from risks.
</P>
<P>
The Asian nations have learned an important revelation from the
financial crisis, that is, to gradually expand regional economic
cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Countries in the region should strengthen their cooperation in
finance, trade, investment and technology on the basis of equality
and mutual benefit so as to take advantage of each other's
strengths and attain common development, he said, stressing "This
is an important way for countries in the region to meet the
challenges of globalization."
</P>
<P>
Tang said countries should share the benefit of globalization
which, he believed, should be a process "leading to the common
prosperity of the South and North, rather than one of polarization
of the world."
</P>
<P>
In view of the growing accumulation of wealth by a few
countries or interest groups and the widening gap between the rich
and the poor in the world as a whole, Tang appealed to the
developed nations to fulfill their duties and obligations, further
open their markets to the developing countries, offer them
financial assistance, and work with them in the reform and
improvement of international financial structure and rules, and "
establish a just and reasonable new international economic order."
</P>
<P>
Finally, he asked for the democratization of international
relations. In the age of globalization, he said, different
cultural traditions, lifestyles, social systems and values of
nations should be respected and "the principles of sovereign
equality and noninterference in other countries' internal affairs
maintained."
</P>
<P>
He insisted that to impose a certain system, value or
development model on other countries does not represent the
progress of history. "On the contrary," he said, "it will only
aggravate injustice and inequality that may occur in the process
of globalization."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Treasuries Fluctuates Narrowly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Today current Chinese treasuries
fluctuated within a range of 0.10 percent. Trade value totaled 1.
48 billion yuan, up 67 million yuan from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The inactive 000896, an 8.56 percent bond due 2003, tumbled by
0.08 percent at 122.70 yuan to be today's biggest loser. The
turnover on the bond expanded remarkably to 260 million yuan, from
11 million yuan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast, the comparatively active ten-year 010004,
with a floating-rate at 2.87 percent this year, saw a thin volume
of 114 million yuan today, according to Homeway, China's leading
on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009704 picked up 0.08 percent to stand at 144.10 yuan,
pressing the yield down 0.01 percentage point to 3.97 percent.
Bond 009905 also extended its rise to close at 102.40 yuan.
</P>
<P>
As China's domestic A-share market keeps bullish and the
Renminbi interest rate shows no apparent signs of going up or down,
the T-bond market takes a quiet outlook with treasuries just
edging marginally around the present price levels.
</P>
<P>
The combined turnover of three-day, seven-day, 14-day and 28-
day repo transactions amounted to 8.17 billion yuan, up 2.86
billion yuan from the previous trading day. However, the close
price of the three-day transaction dipped 0.58 percentage points
to 2.40 percent.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai B Share Market Weekly Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- This week, the Shanghai B-share
market continued its strong performance in the past two weeks rose
over the key 60 points, the first time it crossed over the level
in the year.
</P>
<P>
The B-Share index rose 2.67 points or 4.58 percent to 60.92 at
the end of the week, according to Homeway, a Chinese leading
financial and security consulting company.
</P>
<P>
The bullish market was remarkable, driven by favorable comments
from top securities officials about the future of the Chinese
stock market, along with strong earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, said
Wednesday financial leasing firms will be allowed to borrow hard
currencies from overseas, issue bonds and invest in securities.
Foreign investors will be allowed to buy stakes in these non-
banking financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Buying was strong, and even low-priced stocks under the classes
of "Special Treat" and "Particular Transfer" began to attract some
bargain hunters, thanks to a broad-based upbeat sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Among the week's interim reports on the part of B-share
companies, the most notable one was Shanghai Huili, which scored a
sixfold net profit during the first half.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Lingyun Zhensheng Co, Ltd, a building material maker,
was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Friday. Active
trading of Lingyun was draining money away from other sectors, and
brought about some modest selling pressure.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analyst predicted that the B-share market will continue
to do a good job next week as the broader Shanghai stock market
has been provided with strong momentum of testing new historic
highs.

<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market index
went down 0.47 points, or 0.41 percent, to 114.79 at the close on
Friday, coming off its session high of 116 points scored in early

61 million HK dollars less than Thursday's total, according to
Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory
company.
</P>
<P>
The market opened on a strong note, but a modest wave of
selling on profit taking trimmed a small portion of gains after
three consecutive sessions of advances, and sent the index lower.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that the market largely traded on a
technical basis and will hold steady.

<HEADLINE> More Work to Be Done Before Introducing Inheritance Tax: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- More preparation has to be made
before the inheritance tax is levied in China, according to the
top official of the State Administration of Taxation (SAT).
</P>
<P>
"At present, a lot of preparatory work should be made before
the enacting of inheritance tax in our country," Jin Renqing,
director of the SAT was quoted as saying in the latest issue of
the "Outlook" news weekly.
</P>
<P>
Jin listed a host of issues such as how to define taxpayers
and their inheritances that should be settled before the
introduction of the tax.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the inheritance tax will not affect the
life of ordinary Chinese. The aim of the inheritance tax is to
curb the excessive growth of wealth among a small group of
individuals and redistribute social wealth.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1980s, there have been calls for the levy of
inheritance tax in China. The SAT has done a lot of research in
this area.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Liu Zuo, deputy director of the Taxation Science
Research Institute under the SAT said that China is now ready to
enact inheritance tax laws.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China in 1949 to 1990, China has
introduced inheritance tax twice, but failed to actually collect
it.
</P>
<P>
Things have changed a lot over the past decade with rapid
economic growth, and the per capita income of the Chinese people
is now more than 20 times than that 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The gap in income has also widened. Some 20 percent of the
population now holds more than 80 percent of all savings deposits
in the country, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the current economic situation also requires
that the government narrow the gap between rich and poor in order
to maintain social stability and stimulate consumption.

CAIRO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Culture Minister Farouq Hosni said preparations for
the "Aida 2000" opera show, to be staged on October 12-17, have
started. He said that this year's show will witness some surprises,

</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:

<HEADLINE> Former Israeli President Goes to Hospital for Pacemaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli President Ezer
Weizman Friday morning went to the cardiology ward of Haifa's
Ramban Hospital for an operation to fit his heart with a pacemaker.
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said that the operation is a regular one and
will take only a few hours. Doctors will decide whether or not to
allow Weizman, who resigned from his presidency earlier this month,
to go home immediately.
</P>
<P>
The hospital made the decision to install a pacemaker after the
former president underwent a series of preliminary tests earlier
this week, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Aryeh Shumer, Weizman's confidant and former director-general of
the president's residence, confirmed that the tests had been
scheduled two weeks ago because the former president experienced
some health problems recently, such as difficulties in walking.
</P>
<P>
After the tests, doctors diagnosed these problems as being
caused by irregular blood flow.
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old politician, whose health is out of condition in
recent years, underwent a gallbladder operation last November.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, who was elected president in 1993 and re-elected in
1998, should end his second term in 2003. However, he was forced to
leave the ceremonial post ahead of schedule after the revelation of
his financial irregularities with a French Jewish businessman and
the subsequent police investigation.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the scandal saga did damage to his
health further, one of the reasons behind his decision to resign
early.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Knesset (Parliament) will choose his successor in a
secret ballot next Monday. Weizman is expected to attend the
swearing-in ceremony for the president-elect next Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Upgrade Diplomatic Mission in Iraq Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will increase its level of
representation in Baghdad from the post-Gulf War charge d'affaires
to ambassador in a bid to improve bilateral relations, Turkish
Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Minister-Counsellor Mehmet Akat, who is
currently working at the Turkish Embassy in London, is expected to
be appointed as ambassador to Baghdad in the upcoming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has intensified its bid to upgrade the status of its
diplomatic representation in Baghdad in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Since Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Faruk Logoglu
visited Iraq last month, the two countries have stepped up their
efforts to improve bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and its close ally the U.S. have been exercising quite
different approaches towards Baghdad. While the U.S. wants to
topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Turkey wants problems
concerning Iraq to be solved within the country, not through
outside intervention.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has succeeded in suppressing the outlawed Kurdistan
Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a 15-year armed struggle for
self-rule in the Kurdish-populated southeastern Turkey, but it
fears that political turmoil in Iraq could lead to an independent
Kurdish state in northern Iraq with the potential to threaten
Turkey's stability.
</P>
<P>
The common concerns over an independent Kurdish state in
northern Iraq prompted the two countries to closer ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, stating on numerous occasions that it would not allow
the founding of an independent Kurdish state in the region, has
called on Baghdad to reinforce its administration over the northern
Kurdish-populated area.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Logoglu claimed that all problems in the
region must be solved by Baghdad, urging the regime to adopt an "
all-embracing policy" for its citizens in the north and realize
reconciliation with the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which has been isolated and subjected to the U.N.
sanctions since the 1991 Gulf War, told Logoglu that it wants
Turkey to appoint an ambassador and would be happy to see a Turkish
ambassador in Baghdad to further improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two neighboring countries have been soured
since the Gulf War, in which Turkey was part of the U.S.-led
coalition that forced Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Turkey lowered its diplomatic mission in Iraq to the
level of charge d'affaires due to worsening ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops had repeatedly crossed the border into northern
Iraq allegedly in pursuit of Kurdish separatists. Baghdad condemned
that Turkey, under the pretext of chasing elements of the PKK, has
invaded its territory.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad also accused Ankara of ignoring its humanitarian needs,
saying that Turkey could have helped in easing the U.N. sanctions
on Iraq long ago by exporting food and medicine to Iraq in exchange
for oil imports, as Jordan does, but it has chosen not to do so.
</P>
<P>
The decade-old U.N. sanctions against Iraq ban Baghdad from
exporting oil as punishment for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But
the United Nations has allowed Iraq since December 1996 to sell
oil, only under U.N. supervision, to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was Turkey's top crude oil supplier and third-largest
trading partner before the 1991 Gulf War. Ankara has since
purchased most of its crude from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been outraged that Turkey helps its Western allies'
planes to enforce a no-fly zone over northern Iraq by allowing
American and British warplanes to use its Incirlik air base to bomb
Iraq every day.
</P>
<P>
On water resources, Iraq said that Turkey, the upstream country
of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, was threatening the flow of the
rivers by building dams in violation of the rights of countries
downstream.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Meets U.S. Secretary of State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said here Friday since the beginning of this year, with
the joint efforts of China and the United States, the bilateral
relations between them have been stable on the whole and have made
some progresses.
</P>
<P>
Tang made these remarks during his meeting with U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright during the 7th Association of
Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum here.
</P>
<P>
Tang said in the second half of this year, China and the United
States should continue their efforts to strengthen dialogue and
cooperation, particularly to make good preparations for the Sino-
American leaders' meetings during September's U.N. Millennium
Summit and the informal APEC leadership conference in November, so
as to help the bilateral relations continue to be stable and make
improvements.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issues, Tang reiterated the Chinese government's
stand of principle. Noticing U.S. repeated expression of its
insistence in "One China" policy, its intention to stick to the
three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, and not to support Taiwan
independence, not to support "two China," "one China, one Taiwan,"
not to support Taiwan's entry of any international organizations
of sovereign states, Tang said China pays much attention to the U.
S. stand and promise.
</P>
<P>
But, what is more important, Tang added the U.S. side should
carry out its promise and take practical actions to enable the
Taiwan situation to move in the direction towards the improvement
of cross-Straits relations, peace and tranquillity in the Asia-
Pacific region and stability in Sino-American relations; and not
the opposite.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the two sides together expect the two important
meetings of U.S. and Chinese leaders this year, the U.S. side
agreed that the two sides should cooperate to make good
preparation in various areas.
</P>
<P>
She added the U.S.-Chinese relations developed smoothly in the
first half of this year, and the two countries should handle their
relations from a point view of strategic height.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government will continue to do its best towards the
development of the bilateral relations, she said, adding it is
also expecting a quick congressional acceptance of the bill on the
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China.
</P>
<P>
Of the Taiwan issue, she said the U.S. government has repeated
its support to "One China" policy and this stand has not changed a
bit.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the Chinese government resolutely opposes the U.S.
development of National Missile Defense (NMD) and opposes any
country to give assistance or protection of Theater Missile
Defense (TMD) to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the U.S. will seriously consider a possible series of
negative, serious international influence by developing NMD and
TMD, and not to make any decision of endless disasters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side made it clear that it will continue its exchange
of views with China on this issue.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views about other issues.

<HEADLINE> Pay Rises, Threat to Economy in Australia: Treasurer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Australian Treasurer Peter
Costello Friday warned against unsustainable pay rises, saying it
would be a threat to inflation and the economy, according to the
Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Figures released this week showed wages were growing at the
fastest rate in four-and-a-half years with inflation at a four-
year high of 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
"If we get to the situation where people are being offered wage
settlements in excess of productivity and improvement that won't
be good for our economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some economists warned that further interest rates rises may be
needed. The Australian dollar's interest rates raised four times
in the past six months, the last time in May to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a surge in imports is expected as
retailers stocked up ahead of the GST, the new tax system of The
Goods and Services Tax carried out since July 1, with worsening
oil prices and the lower dollar also having an impact.
</P>
<P>
The situation has made it clear that the nine-year-old pattern
of high expansion combined with low interest rates and low
inflation would reach its end.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Indonesia to be More Liberal in its Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) urged here
Friday the Indonesian government to open further its economic
system, saying a sustained economic growth is essential for the
country.
</P>
<P>
The economic liberalization will improve social conditions and
contribute to sustainable development, Chairman of an EC
delegation Pascal Lamy said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The European Union believes that further
liberalization can yield very substantial benefits and that many
of these could, indeed, should go to developing countries and
regions."
</P>
<P>
Lamy also believed that the next WTO (World Trade Organisation)
negotiations should not be limited to the narrow items of
agriculture and services left over from the late Uruguay round.
</P>
<P>
"The new round of negotiations must be more comprehensive,
covering both traditional topics and new issues, which will allow
all participants, and especially the developing countries, to have
an interest in the negotiations. This means the topics of most
interest to Indonesia must be included," Lamy said at a luncheon
organized by the country's strategic intelligence, adding the WTO
rulebook also needs to be overhauled to respond to the challenges
of today's trading environment.
</P>
<P>
Lamy also stated that the European community fully backed the
Indonesian government's bid to restore its economic situation,
urging President Wahid administration to create security situation
for conducive investment climate.
</P>
<P>
"Economic recovery, it seems to me, will clearly be sustained
only after a minimum of political stability has created confidence
in business circles. You may see this argument being supported by
a rise in the level of the rupiah, as it responds to a successful
transition to a democratic system," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
During the meeting, foreign ministers or representatives of

issues, such as the new international financial system, East Asia
recovery, impact of oil prices and the expansion of digital divide,
Kobsak Chutikul, director-general of economic affairs department
of Thai foreign ministry disclosed after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, participants urged for action on supervision of
speculative activities of hedge fund, monitoring of short-cut fund
flows, prevention of currency speculation, restructuring of
multilateral institutions.
</P>
<P>
Discussing oil prices impact on the world economy, participants
noted that high oil prices affect the developing countries, the
stability of global economy and expansion of global trade, and the
problem must be addressed in a reasonable manner.
</P>
<P>
They also talked about the impact of information technology,
recognizing that it brings about both challenges and opportunities
while agreeing that IT can help solve many problems though at the
risk of dividing further the world between the connected and the
unconnected.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they stressed that the problem should be solved
immediately before the gap widens into insurmountable obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Of the East Asian economy, they agreed that it is out of crisis
and on the road of recovery, and they are confident that the
region can again be the center of global economic growth.
</P>

continued reforms within the region and by continued market
opening of the developed countries.
</P>
<P>

was held here Thursday between ASEAN, its 10 dialogue partners and
Papua New Guinea, Mongolia and the Democratic People's Republic of

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan said Friday here that it is important for the ASEAN
members and its dialogue partners to adopt a human agenda in their
present and future meetings.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations (
ASEAN+10) meeting, Surin, chairman of the current ASEAN standing
committee, said that as the ASEAN members and dialogue partners
enter the new century, they should turn their attention more to
the human aspect of the development.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he said ASEAN and its dialogue partners can
play a key role in addressing issues such as poverty, social and
economic deprivation, transnational crime, trafficking in women
and children, drug trafficking, infectious diseases and the "
digital divide."
</P>
<P>
He noted that these problems, rooted in the development gap
between the rich and the poor that continues to widen with
globalization, are undermining human security and threatening the
well-being of society in the region.
</P>
<P>
"As part of the human agenda, we should take up the development
side of the issues that affect society, " he said.
</P>
<P>
He hereby called on ASEAN members and dialogue partners to
explore the ways in which they can work together in reducing the
developmental and technological gap within and between nations.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's dialogue partners include Australia, Canada, China, the
European Union, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea and
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Plunge in Tokyo, Nikkei Closes Below 16,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo Friday,
dragged down by information technology (IT) issues which were
dampened by Thursday's decline in New York's Nasdaq composite
index, with the benchmark Nikkei index hitting a 16-month closing
low.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 343.44 points, or 2.12
percent, from Thursday's close to end at 15,838.57, the lowest
closing since March 31, 1999, when it ended at 15,836.59.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, declined 24.90 points, or 1.68 percent, to 1,
452.93, setting a new closing low for this year for the second
straight day.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 570.11 million
shares from Thursday's 531.39 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Maruzen, a major bookseller, was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
High-priced IT-related issues were hit by the fall in the
Nasdaq, which lost 145.49 points to 3,842.23, leading overall
share prices sharply lower, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Banks and brokerage houses were also weak, with the Industrial
Bank of Japan, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank,
Daiwa Securities Group and Nikko Securities plunging to their
lowest levels for this year during the day.
</P>
<P>
Losers also included wholesalers, warehousing firms and nonbank
moneylenders.
</P>
<P>
Nonlife insurers drew buying, partly because they are not
heavily affected by the movement on Wall Street, while issues in
the land transportation sector were also up on expectations for
increase in travel demand in the summer holiday season.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers outpaced
gainers 912 to 353, with 125 issues closing unchanged.

<P>
SHENZHEN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Education, durable consumer
goods and leisure services have become the most popular products
in Shenzhen, one of China's special economic zones, in south China
's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
According to the municipal statistics bureau, Shenzhen's per-
capita spending on education and durable consumer items reached
445 yuan (53 US dollars) and 1,040 yuan (125 US dollars),
respectively. Cars and PCs have become new household necessities.
More than 21,000 cars were sold in Shenzhen in the first half of
the year, up 41 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts said household electrical appliances such as TV, air-
conditioners, refrigerators and washing machines, that were once
considered luxury items ten years ago, have become outdated. Most
families have now replaced them with new items.
</P>
<P>
With more money, Shenzhen people are spending more on houses,
international travel, advanced telecommunication gadgets and
household services. The upholstering industry in Shenzhen is
expected to turnover 3 billion yuan (361 million US dollars) this
year, up from 2 billion yuan (240 million US dollars) last year.

<HEADLINE> Horsefoot Crabs Protected in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A'Hai, a veteran horsefoot crab
diver in a southwest China fishing village no longer catches
horsefoot crabs since the Chinese government introduced a fishing
and trading ban on the crabs.
</P>
<P>
Cash-aquatic produce is shrinking rapidly in China due to
overfishing and sea pollution, said a fishing department official
in Beihai City, a southern sea outlet on the Beibu Bay.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 live horsefoot crabs and three tons of dead
ones were confiscated last month in Beihai in the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"If excess fishing continues, we will no longer see Chinese
horsefoot crabs," said a conservationist.
</P>
<P>
A'Hai said that people used to see numerous horsefoot crabs on
the beach. However, they will have to go further out to sea to
find them.
</P>
<P>
The ugly crab with its shell shaped like a horse's shoe and a
pointed tail emerged in the Devonian Period. The crab outlived
dinosaurs and have survived 400 million years. In the 1940s, its
blue blood was discovered to have high medicinal properties and
this triggered market demand for the crab.
</P>
<P>
The crab's blood is used to detect bacterial toxins that can
contaminate drugs and medical equipment. Blood is extracted and
shipped to labs and then the crabs are set free, said Shu Yuyan,
director of the Bio-toxicologist Committee under the Chinese
Society of Toxinology.
</P>
<P>
She explained that a horsefoot crab can survive after having
two thirds of its blood extracted. Protected fishing for medicinal
purposes can sustain the species.
</P>
<P>
However, in recent years, some illegal dealers bought the crab
and sold the meat to restaurants. In some coastal places, big
horsefoot crabs are presented at dinner tables, although the meat
is considered inedible in some western countries.
</P>

Shu said that it takes a horsefoot crab 15 years to reach
sexual maturity. Illegal trade of the crabs threatens its very
existence.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that horsefoot crabs return to the ocean, fishing
authorities in Beihai have dismantled 48 fishing net enclosures.
The city has been surveyed as the most ideal habitat for Chinese

<HEADLINE> China Discovers Genetically-Modified Ingredients from Rapeseed Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Administration of
Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine has announced that it has
discovered trans-genetic ingredients from a batch of rapeseed
imports from Canada, the first of such cases found in China.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last year, the Shanghai Quarantine Bureau was the first
quarantine bureau to report tests of biotech ingredients from rice
imports.
</P>
<P>
As the safety of genetically modified crops is controversial,
biotech products should be labeled according to international
treaties.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Customs handles one million tons of rapeseed imports
annually. None of them is labeled.
</P>
<P>
The administration said that in addition to improving its own
test measures on genetically altered crop imports, it will ask
foreign producers to voluntarily label their biotech crops exports.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jiahua, an expert with the administration, said that it
requires fairly high technology to screen rapeseeds that contain
genetically modified ingredients, because it is difficult to
abstract clear DNAs for analysis from the oil-bearing crop.
</P>
<P>
The detected ingredients in the batch of rapeseed imports
include pat and bar, barbase and barstar, he said.
</P>
<P>
The expert added that the acreage of biotech crops has
increased to 40 million ha. from 2 million ha. in 1996 worldwide
with 99 percent of the acreage in America, Argentina and Canada.
Nearly half of the main crop exports such as soybean and corn from
these three countries are genetically engineered.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai quarantine bureau has set up an special group of
experts to test biotech ingredients.

<HEADLINE> Grain-For-Green Project Will Cause No Grain Shortages: Experts (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A grain information website launched by China's largest grain
wholesale market, the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market in central
China's Henan Province, showed that more than half of the market's
grain purchase was signed by provinces and autonomous regions with
Hubei, Henan, Hebei and other grain-producing provinces.
</P>
<P>
China has begun adjusting crop growing structure and increasing
fine crop strains in grain-producing areas to maintain the country
's food "security line" which stands at 490 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture has selected 100 counties
nationwide to implement a "fertile land project" to improve
farmland quality by applying organic fertilizer to upgrade grain
output.
</P>
<P>
China has also made great efforts to develop fine crop strains,
including wheat, corn, and rice. Wang Guohua, chief of the grain
and edible oil division of the agricultural bureau of Chongqing
Municipality, said that Chongqing has applied high quality rice
strains to over 67,000 hectares this year, 10 times more than the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture said that
China will still import a certain amount of grain in order to
improve competition among Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
Another purpose of the grain-for-green project is to adjust
China's agricultural product mix in western region and help
farmers become rich.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture Chen Guangyao said that only when the
farmers who have returned their farmland to forests and grassland
become relatively well-off, can the returned forests and grassland
be guaranteed not to be returned to farmland again. Grain produced
by grain-producing areas can also sell well, he added.
</P>
<P>
The annul average per farmer's income at Qian Feng Village in
the Three Gorges Dam project area has increased five times since
farmers returned farmland to grassland and devoted their energies
to developing animal husbandry three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry is building seven agricultural production bases in
western China and developing an ecological agriculture in the area.

<HEADLINE> Grain-For-Green Project Will Cause No Grain Shortages: Experts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese agricultural experts
said that the large-scale returning of low-yielding farmland to
forests and grassland in western area will cause no grain
shortages in China.
</P>
<P>
Under the government-initiated "grain-for-green" program, China
's resource-rich, economically backward hinterland is expected to
be afforested with trees and grass in the upcoming decades.
</P>
<P>
Successive grain harvests over the past few years have provided
a solid foundation for the "grain-for-green" project that is
currently being carried out in China's vast western regions, said
Zhu Zijun, a professor with the Southwest China Agricultural
University.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that China's grain output increased at an
annual average rate of 2.7 percent over the past two decades, far
exceeding the population increase rate during the period.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, China has had grain harvests for five successive
years, reaching a record high of 500 million tons. The central
government had to spend more on building granary. At present, the
country's grain reserve stood at 194 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to improve the environment in western China, some 3.3
million ha of farmland on the slopes of mountains will be turned
into forests and grassland in the coming ten years. Farmers can
get 150 kg of grain in subsidy for returning one mu (one hectare =
15 mu) of farmland to forests and grassland.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Municipality in southwest China, for example, plans
to return 200,000 ha of farmland to forests. The city's grain
reserve now reached 2.1 billion kg, so farmers have no need to
worry about food shortages, according to Zhang Aoxiang, chief of
the planning division with the Chongqing Grain Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Professor Zhu said, China's main grain producers are
located in central and eastern China.
</P>
<P>
Excessive farming on slope land has not only posed threat to
the environment, but also affected production in some major grain-
producing areas, said Prof. Zhu.
</P>
<P>
But Qinghai, Guizhou, Yunnan provinces and the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, which have less farmland, have to import grain
after a great deal of farmland has been turned into forest and
grassland.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Intellectual Property in New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China's top intellectual property
official said today China will strengthen the implementation of
international covenants with effective protection measures.
</P>
<P>
China must strengthen its intellectual property legislation and
law enforcement as it soon to become a WTO member, said Jiang Ying,
commissioner of the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO).
</P>
<P>
Domestic enterprises and academic institutions are encouraged
to draw on patent strategies and improve patent protection. With
more patented technologies, the enterprises should become more
competitive internationally, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Bio-engineering and information technologies demand more
professional service and an advanced legal system for intellectual
property protection, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China's ongoing market economic restructuring provides Chinese
society with a basis for carrying out modern patent systems, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Since the adoption of the patent law in 1985, China has made
great progress. Up till February 2000, China received one million
patent applications both from China and overseas.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee revised
the patent law in 1992, widening the scope of patent protection.
</P>
<P>
The legislature is considering a second revision to patent law
amendments to make them conform to international covenants.

TEHRAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Italy have signed a
contract on the buy-back scheme to develop the 4th and 5th phases
of Iran's South Pars gas field in the Persian Gulf waters, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The contract worth 3.822 billion U.S. dollars was reached

Under the deal signed Thursday night, the investment will be
paid off in seven years through the sale of products from the
projects, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The 4th and 5th phases of the South Pars gas field have a daily
capacity to refine 50 million cubic meters of gas and to produce 1
million cubic meters of liquefied gas for exports.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States will send Assistant Secretary of State
Edward Walker to Arab capitals next week to brief Arab leaders on
the status of the peace negotiations and drum up support for the
type of peace deal that started to take shape at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. believes the backing of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia,
and other Arab states is crucial in enabling Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to make compromises on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a television interview to be broadcast in Israel,
U.S. President Bill Clinton is expected to outline measures to both
persuade Arafat to compromise and reward Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak for his flexibility in the talks. Clinton is seeking to
boost Barak ahead of next week's no-confidence vote in Israel's
Knesset (Parliament), U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A basis for continuing the peace talks with the Palestinians
exists and within the weeks ahead, it should become clear if it
would be possible to complete the process, perhaps via another
summit meeting, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to illustrate that the negotiations have not reached

</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy is considering quitting
the government - and possibly moving his Gesher Party back to the
Likud - because Prime Minister Ehud Barak insists on continuing his
efforts to strike a deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
After a "good, but frank" meeting Thursday night in Tel Aviv,
Levy refused to say whether he would vote for Barak in a no-
confidence motion that Likud is preparing with other right-wing
parties in the Knesset next week, the last week in the parliament's
summer session.
</P>
<P>
Levy and Barak, who developed a strong friendship during the
year before the elections in 1999 when they campaigned together,
are to meet again on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Late Thursday night, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak met
with opposition Likud party chairman Ariel Sharon for what the
prime minister's office referred to as an update on the Camp David
talks.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Sharon told reporters he was "very troubled,
and if I am troubled, it is worth your while and everyone's while
to be troubled."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether they discussed the possibility of forming a
national unity government, Sharon replied, " It did not come up at
all in the conversation... there is no national unity government."

<HEADLINE> Israelis Remain Different on Barak's Camp David Move: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- More than half of Israelis are
affirmative on Prime Minister Ehud Barak's decision to attend the
Camp David peace summit while a similar proportion of people think
he offered too much to the Palestinians, according to an opinion
poll published on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The "exclusive" poll, by the Israeli daily The Jerusalem Post,
of 513 Jewish and Arab Israelis showed that 59 percent of the
respondents said Barak was right to go to Camp David, while 37
percent opposed the move. Four percent had no reply.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the negotiations that took place at the
failed summit, 53 percent of those polled said Barak offered too
much while 28 percent said he offered the right amount. Eight
percent had no reply.
</P>
<P>
In response to the question as to how Barak should handle the
shaky coalition government which has a minority 42 seats in the
120-member parliament, 41 percent of the respondents held that
Barak should call new elections in the aftermath of the abortive
summit, while 32 percent said he should form a national unity
government and 13 percent said he should build a left-wing
coalition with the pro-peace Meretz, the Arab parties and others.
</P>
<P>
Only six percent said the prime minister should rebuild the
coalition he had earlier by bringing back the rebellious ultra-
Orthodox Shas party, the Yisrael Ba'aliya and the National
Religious Party, which deserted it on the eve of his departure for
the summit.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which had a margin error of 4.4 percent, also revealed
that 60 percent of the respondents did not believe the Palestinian
truly wanted peace, while 32 percent thought the opposite. Eight
percent made no comment.
</P>
<P>
"In all polls, we always see that the Israeli people
overwhelmingly want peace. " The paper quoted the pollster, Rafi
Smith, as saying. "When you get into the details, the numbers go
down, but everyone supports peace."
</P>
<P>
"Here, we see the full tragedy of the conflict. Despite the
prime minister's major concessions, the Israeli people do not
believe the Palestinians truly want peace." the pollster asserted.

<HEADLINE> China Discovers 6,000 Years Old Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
unearthed a Neolithic site dating back to 6,000 years ago in
northeast China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaodongshan site, located in Chaoyang city, provides new
evidence that Chinese civilization originated not only in the
Yellow River valley but also in some remote areas.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have excavated three house sites and unearthed
more than a dozen pottery and stone vessels inscribed with
colorful patterns.
</P>
<P>
The site belongs to the Hongshan Culture, which was named in
1935 after the finding of a 5,000-year-old site in the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The culture developed advanced agriculture and showed some
signs of the formation of a state, archeologists say.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, archeologists excavated some temples, altars and tools
near Chaoyang, all belonging to the same culture.
</P>
<P>
For many years Chinese and Western anthropologists and
historians had widely believed that Chinese civilization emanated
in the Yellow River valley and its environs and then spread to
other parts. However, recent excavations of some Neolithic sites
in the Yangtze River valley as well as in the southern and the
northeastern provinces have changed all this.

XI'AN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed a
new garment which is able to prevent human body from ultraviolet
and electromagnetic waves radiation.
</P>
<P>
The garment was made from a kind of fiber interwoven with anti-
radiation material, said Yang Jianzhong, a scientist at the Xi'an
New and High-tech Development Zone in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The anti-radiation material is dissolved in fiber. It is

waves, and will not irritate the skin. The material can be used
for making shirts, skirts and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
However, China's research on nano technology is still in its

<P>
NANNING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Hordes of dugongs have come back
to the natural reserves in Beihai, a port city facing the Beibu
Gulf in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The endangered sea mammal has been listed as a state protected
animal. They were rarely seen in Beibu Gulf years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Dugong Reserve in Beihai was set up in 1996. The tropical
protection area covers some 300 sq km and has focused on growing
the dugong's favorite seaweed. Dugongs have been returning in
droves.
</P>
<P>
Dugong populations have decreased considerably due to hunting
and other factors. There are only five dugong populations survive
in the world, mainly in the sea off southeastern Africa, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Australia and some Pacific islands.
</P>
<P>
Dugongs are sensitive to the cold and they will die if water
temperature drops below 15 degrees Celsius, according to experts.
They are therefore found warmer areas such as the Beibu Gulf and
sea areas around Hainan and Guangdong provinces.

BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China's leading life and property
insurance firms, China Life and the People's Insurance Company of
China (PICC), may soon start bold reforms to transform themselves
into share-holding firms.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xianzhang, the general manager of China Life, told a

Industrial sources said the expected reform will help stated-
owned insurers to raise new capital that will make them
financially much stronger, which is very important as China is

BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The news media should play a
bigger role in the nation's drive for clean government, said a
senior official of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Cao Qingze, executive deputy secretary of the CPC's Central

The official praised the reporters and editors for their
contribution to the anti-corruption and clean-government campaigns
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Rave Parties Face Having to Be Licensed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A licensing system for rave
parties is expected to be introduced in Hong Kong as part of a
clampdown on drug abuse amongst youngsters.
</P>
<P>
The message came from Professor Lee Shiu-hung, chairman of the
Action Committee Against Narcotics who disclosed the figures of
drug abusers in the first three months at a media briefing on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Local officials believed that Hong Kong is following the
worldwide trend of chalking up a rapid increase in the number of
people under the age of 21 taking drugs. They said the rising
popularity of rave parties is responsible though there is no
concrete evidence to back their view.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the Central Registry of Drug Abusers,
the number increased from 765 in the last quarter of 1999 to 1,057
in the first quarter of this year. The increase in the number of
cases of people abusing the "party drug" ecstasy rose from 170 to
465 over the same quarterly period.
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed that abusers of ketamine, an anesthetic
used by veterinary surgeons that has also become synonymous with
raves, rose from 10 to 141.
</P>
<P>
The licensing system will be discussed next month when police
anti-drugs officers and members of the Action Committee Against
Narcotics meet owners of premises used for rave and party
organizers.
</P>
<P>
More youngsters are taking psychotropic drugs as the "rave"
culture makes it easier to obtain party drugs such as ecstasy and
ketamine, local officials said. They estimated that about five
large "rave" organizers were running events for up 4,000 party-
goers as well as dozens of small "raves" in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Six Chinese cities, namely
Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Shantou, Guiyang, Lanzhou and Xining,
reported slight air pollution today, with the highest pollution
reading at 150 in Shijiazhuang.
</P>
<P>
According to a daily air quality report issued by the China
Environmental Monitoring Center, level-two or fairly good air
quality was recorded in the following 28 cities: Beijing, Tianjin,
Hohhot, Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou,
Nantong, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Hefei, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Nanchang, Jinan,
Yantai, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Changsha, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu,

Kunming, where sulfur dioxide was the major air pollutant.
</P>
<P>
Eight cities, namely Changchun, Qingdao, Shenzhen, Zhuhai,
Zhanjiang, Nanning, Haikou and Lhasa, reported excellent air.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Many Unhappy About High Tuition Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese education experts and
families are complaining about the recent tuition-hikes by local
colleges.
</P>
<P>
By increasing tuition fees, universities could increase their
revenue by 24 billion yuan (US$100=RMB827.93) and contribute as
much as 100 billion yuan to the economy annually.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the average income of local urban residents, 5,
854 yuan per capita, and that of the rural residents, 2,210 yuan,
average college tuition fee costing between 4,000-5,000 yuan is
beyond most families, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
"I would have lost the chance to enter college without
financial assistance," said Chen Shengsheng, a Beijing University
freshman from a poor rural family who received the highest marks
in the college entrance exams in his home province of Shanxi last
year.
</P>
<P>
"My parents won't be able to afford to put me through college
if my brother is admitted into college this year. This will
increase the family's total schooling expenses to 17,000 yuan,"
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Almost 60 per cent college students in China come from rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
"Education needs to be market-oriented, but overemphasis on the
role of market would turn the higher education into a patent for
the minority rich families," said Jiang Minghe, a researcher with
the Shanghai Education Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance have been
working to provide financial assistance and preferential policies
to university students in financial difficulties such as reducing
tuition fees or offering loans and scholarships for these students.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Interim Cabinet Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's new Interim Cabinet was
sworn in Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian Broadcast Company (ABC), in the
interim civilian government there are no representatives of the
hard-core members of the group headed by coup leader George
Speight.
</P>
<P>
When Fiji President Josefa Iloilo swore in Prime Minister
Laisenia Qarase and his ministers, George Speight and more than
300 supporters were locked up at a military headquarters.
</P>
<P>
George Speight and his three supporters were arrested on
Wednesday night and more than 300 other supporters were arrested
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Qarase said the new interim civilian administration will run
the affairs of the country until an elected government takes over
in two to three years.
</P>
<P>
He said the next step would be returning Fiji to "parliamentary
democracy and a new constitution."
</P>
<P>
Australia and New Zealand imposed sanctions against Fiji,
forcing it to reinstate the toppled Chaudhry government and warned
tougher sanctions if Speight and his supporters were included in a
new government.
</P>
<P>
According to a Fiji webside Fijilive, Qarase ruled out the
possibility of reinstating Chaudhry government and asked the
international community to come to terms with the reality in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new prime minister asked the deposed People's
Coalition government to fall into line with and support the
interim government and stop thinking about forming a government in
exile.

<HEADLINE> World Marine Output to Top One Trillion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese economist
predicts that the global marine development output will for the
first time top a record one trillion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
"The global marine output value this year is expected to double
the 1990 figure of 500 billion U.S. dollars," says Chen Qingtai,
deputy director of the Development Research Center under the State
Council, in his key-note speech to be delivered at the coming
International Forum on Marine Science and Economy scheduled Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chen says that all coastal nations attach great importance to
marine development, gradually making it a major part of their
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The marine economy has been developing in leaps and bounds
over the past two decades, during which the world has been facing
such problems as overpopulation, shortage of resources, and
pollution," Chen adds.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the world marine output was 250 billion U.S.
dollars in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chen says that international cooperation has been increasing in
developing maritime resources and marine environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"Many areas such as marine oil and gas development, and marine
bio-engineering, have become a high-tech arena for an increasing
number of countries," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Oceans cover over 70 percent of the earth surface.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Draws More Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province,
which ranks second in the country in terms of GDP, has seen a
rapid growth in overseas investment in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show the province approved the
establishment of 995 overseas-funded businesses during the January-
June period, with a combined contractual overseas capital of 3.11
billion U.S. dollars, up 42.7 percent and 98.7 percent
respectively over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Of these new enterprises, 95 involved an investment of more
than 10 million U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
An official with the provincial government attributed the
upward trend in overseas investment to China's anticipated entry
into the WTO and an improved business environment.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has approved some 23,000 overseas-funded businesses
over the past two decades. Over 16,000 are operational.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 of the world's top 500 corporations have already
opened subsidiaries in the province. These businesses are engaged
in a wide variety of industries such as information technology,
machinery, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial statistics bureau, overseas-funded
companies in Jiangsu generated 25.52 billion yuan (about 3.07
billion U.S. dollars) in industrial added value in the first half
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by growing economic returns, about 600 of the
overseas-funded businesses in the province have increased their
investments by 2.13 billion U.S. dollars since last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 28 (Xinhua)-- The Cambodian government
announced Friday that the number of tourists since this year has
increased by 40 percent comparing with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
"Within 6 months this year, the number of tourists who visited
Cambodia was 166,256, while in the same period last year there
were 120,000 tourists," said Minister of Tourism Veng Sereivudh.
</P>
<P>
The minister, meanwhile, speculated that the number of tourists
will increase up to 330,000 by the end of the year while in 2003
will boom up to one million.
</P>
<P>
In its efforts to promote tourism industry, the minister said
his ministry has appealed to the government to promote
infrastructure to Angkor Wat as well as to Cambodia's northeastern
provinces such as Rattanakiri and Mondulkiri where many ethnic
minorities are living so that foreign tourists can enjoy their
stay.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia is considered one of the countries where is rich in
potential tourism, but due to lack of infrastructure and decades
of civil strife, tourism destinations are limited in this country.
</P>
<P>
Thong Khon, secretary of state for tourism, said last year more
than 30,000 Chinese tourists visited Cambodia while he expected
that next year the number will increase up to 100,000 to 200,000.
</P>
<P>
In their tourism promotion, Cambodia announced its cooperation
Friday with Thailand to attract more tourists.
</P>
<P>
Angkor Wat, the temple complex built in 12th century is an
ideal tourist destination.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM on Effects of Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese foreign minister Tang
Jiaxuan said Asia's development process over the past half century,
especially in the recent 30 years clearly tells us that "the
success and failures or ups and downs of Asia are always closely
related to the process of economic globalization."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ASEAN+10 meeting here Friday, Tang said
economic globalization has obviously brought Asia opportunities
and benefits.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries, especially those in east Asia, have seized
such opportunities as market openness, commodity exchanges,
capital interflow and technology transfer, he noted.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, they have achieved a rapid economic
growth, gradually improved the lives of their people and built
Asia into one of the most dynamic and promising regions in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Undeniably, he pointed out, economic globalization has also
presented Asia with risks and challenges. The extensive and close
links of the world economies have increased the vulnerability of
Asian economies to fluctuation. The disorderly flow of short-term
capital is impairing and even ravaging economic stability and the
unequal international economic order has exacerbated the
development gap between the South and North.
</P>
<P>
And moreover, he warned his audience, the erroneous theories
such as "human rights overriding sovereignty", "humanitarian
intervention knowing no boundary" have "eroded the foundation of
the norms governing international relations and threatened the
sovereignty and security of developing countries."
</P>
<P>
All in all, he noted, economic globalization is a double-edged
sword. "For most developing countries, it means challenges and
pressures more than opportunities and benefits."

WELLINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- An immunization program, partly

has reduced levels of hepatitis B infection in 10 Pacific island
nations by 81 percent, the New Zealand Press Association (NZPA)
reported recently.
</P>
<P>
It quoted New Zealand public health physician Dr. Nick Wilson
as saying that a recent report shows all participating countries
have benefited from the program.

<HEADLINE> Poor Coverage Holds Back Wireless Internet in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Although the U.S. wireless
subscribers have reached 100 million, a study released Thursday
said that the quality of coverage remains a paramount concern
among the country's wireless Internet users.
</P>
<P>
According to the study by the U.S. research firm Yankee Group,
two-thirds of U.S. wireless Internet subscribers would be
interested in changing service providers for better coverage.
</P>
<P>
The Yankee Group compared the U.S. to Japan, U.K., Germany and
Finland, all of which have high wireless penetration and usage
rates, to see why wireless coverage in the United States seems to
be lacking.
</P>
<P>
The huge U.S. land mass and major-city spread has led to a low
cell-site density of 2.3 sites per 100 square miles (less than one
site per 100 square kilometers), compared to 3.8 in Finland, 9.4
in Japan, 20 in U.K. and 35 in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. population density is 75 per square mile,
about one-ninth that of the U.K. and Germany. Finland has more
than three times the number of cell sites per 10,000 people,
indicating a more comprehensive investment in wireless
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Only 41 percent of the U.S. population lives in an urban area
compared to 78 percent in Japan, 87 percent in Germany, and 76
percent in the U.K. Americans travel an average of more than 14,
000 miles (22,400 km), more than twice that of people in the U.K.,
and five times that of Japanese citizens. Thus, the average U.S.
user requires a coverage area of 1,330 square miles (3,445 square
km), which is 14 times what a user in Japan would need, five times
that in Germany and 3.5 times that in the U.K. and Finland.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yankee Group, the more than 80,000 cell sites
in the U.S. are spread across 10 major carriers, using different
air interfaces and incompatible networks, resulting in a
misallocation of resources.
</P>
<P>
However, the Yankee Group said, recent merger activity among
wireless operators, the development of extensive affiliate
partnerships, long-term roaming agreements and technologies such
as repeaters, smart antennas and multimode phones are all helping
to alleviate coverage issues and move the industry in a positive
direction.
</P>
<P>
This development is important because the number of people in
the U.S. accessing the Internet through wireless devices is set to
explode. One recent research indicated that the number of
individuals using cell phones for wireless data applications among
the U.S. Internet population is set to increase from the current 3
percent to an estimated 78 percent in the next 12 months.

<HEADLINE> Serious Diarrhea Bacteria Detected in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A bacteria called Shigella which
causes serious diarrhea and is resistant to many common
antibiotics has been found in the Kathmandu valley, the Tropical
Infectious Disease Hospital in the capital said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The patients found with Shigella are mainly from Patan, a
municipality 10 km south of Kathmandu, said the hospital, but it
declined to give the number of patients infected with such
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
"This is extremely serious, as it may lead to deadly diarrheal
epidemic. To my knowledge, this type of case has emerged for the
first time in our country," said Dr. Achyut Bhattarai with the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Shigellosis is an infectious disease caused by a group of
bacteria called Shigella. Most of the people who are infected with
Shigella suffer from diarrhoea, fever and stomach cramps, within
one or two days after they become exposed to the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
As the bacteria is multi-drug resistant, special antibiotic
drugs are required for treatment, which could be very expensive,
said Bhattarai, adding that the poor and low-income groups, who
are most vulnerable to the disease, may not be able to afford for
the treatment.
</P>
<P>
With the start of monsoon season in mid-June every year,
infectious diseases such as diarrhoea and kala-azar become
prevalent in Nepal due to rampant garbages and unclean drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks, about 50 people suffering from acute
diarrhea were admitted each day to the Tropical Infectious Disease
Hospital alone, while in the month of June, about 500 diarrheal
cases were registered in the hospital, according to the hospital
statistics.

<HEADLINE> Record Remittances From Sri Lankan Migrant Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's migrant workers have
remitted a record 43 billion rupees (580 million U.S. dollars) in
foreign exchange during the first six months of this year, a 19.4
percent rise in rupee terms over the same period last year, the
official Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said remittance from migrant workers is important for
this cash-starved Indian Ocean island. Sri Lankans working abroad
have topped the list of foreign exchange earners in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, the
total number of Sri Lankan workers abroad is estimated to be
around 788,000, of whom 65 percent are females mostly in the
Middle East countries as housemaids.
</P>
<P>
Some 150,000 Sri Lankan workers annually seek employment abroad
through agents or friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
There were lucrative employment opportunities for Sri Lankans
in Cyprus, Singapore, Malaysia, China's Hong Kong and South Korea
where salaries are better than those paid in the Middle East
countries. Wages in the Middle East have been declining gradually
due to the influx of housemaids and other domestics from Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the government was encouraging more male
employees to seek employment abroad as many a problem in society
has been traced to the absence of the housewife in the household.
</P>
<P>
There was an increasing demand for Sri Lankan skilled laborers
such as welders, painters, electricians and plumbers in the Middle
East countries.

<HEADLINE> Rave Parties Face Having to Be Licensed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A licensing system for rave
parties is expected to be introduced in Hong Kong as part of a
clampdown on drug abuse amongst youngsters.
</P>
<P>
The message came from Professor Lee Shiu-hung, chairman of the
Action Committee Against Narcotics who disclosed the figures of
drug abusers in the first three months at a media briefing on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Local officials believed that Hong Kong is following the
worldwide trend of chalking up a rapid increase in the number of
people under the age of 21 taking drugs. They said the rising
popularity of rave parties is responsible though there is no
concrete evidence to back their view.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the Central Registry of Drug Abusers,
the number increased from 765 in the last quarter of 1999 to 1,057
in the first quarter of this year. The increase in the number of
cases of people abusing the "party drug" ecstasy rose from 170 to
465 over the same quarterly period.
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed that abusers of ketamine, an anesthetic
used by veterinary surgeons that has also become synonymous with
raves, rose from 10 to 141.
</P>
<P>
The licensing system will be discussed next month when police
anti-drugs officers and members of the Action Committee Against
Narcotics meet owners of premises used for rave and party
organizers.
</P>
<P>
More youngsters are taking psychotropic drugs as the "rave"
culture makes it easier to obtain party drugs such as ecstasy and
ketamine, local officials said. They estimated that about five
large "rave" organizers were running events for up 4,000 party-
goers as well as dozens of small "raves" in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Portugal to Intensify Combat Against Juvenile Delinquencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Portuguese government adopted a
package of measures Thursday to prevent and intensify the fight
against rampant juvenile delinquencies.
</P>
<P>
The government has instructed competent authorities to
formulate plans of action against junior criminal activities in
crime-ridden areas including Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
It plans to increase the budget for judiciary organs and reform
rehabilitation centers for young convicts.
</P>
<P>
The government also passed the draft of a special criminal law
on juvenile delinquents aged between 16 and 21, which breaks
through the tradition of underlining education rather than legal
punishment in dealing with juvenile delinquencies.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, juvenile delinquencies have become wide-spread
in major Portuguese cities, which has brought citizens a strong
sense of insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Increasing illegal immigration and drug addiction are blamed in
part for the phenomenon.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A three-member expert panel, led by
former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari, arrived here on Friday
to probe the Austrian political situation before a possible end to
the EU's political sanctions against the country.
</P>
<P>
During their three-day visit, the three "wise men" will meet
with Austrian Federal President Thomas Klestil, Austrian
Parliament President Heinz Fischer, representatives of the
Austrian government, leaders of political parties, religious
groups and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
The three men will present a formal report based on their
findings in Austria to the EU presidency in September, reported

</P>
<P>
Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel was quoted by Die Presse
saying that he is fully confident of the report and the lift of EU
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
On June 29, Portugal, then holding the rotating EU presidency,
worked out a plan to set up a three-member panel to study Austrian
adherence to common European values on minority, refugees and
immigrants' rights. The EU will then decided whether to lift the
sanctions based on the panel's report.
</P>
<P>
On July 12, The European Court of Human Rights named Ahtisaari,
former Spanish Foreign Minister Marcelino Oreja and German
professor Jochen Frowein as the three wise men.
</P>

The EU imposed political sanctions on Austria after the country
included the far-right Freedom Party into the coalition government
in February.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian government meanwhile called on the EU to lift the
sanctions, saying that it plans to hold a referendum if the
political ban is still in effect in autumn.

<HEADLINE> Village Built on China's Largest Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers have built a
village on the northern edge of the vast Taklimakan Desert, known
as the "sea of death" over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Most of the residents of the 70-household village near Aksu, in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region moved here from
Sichuan and Henan provinces, hoping to gain from the local
government's new preferential policies for desert developers.
</P>
<P>
Those who have contracted to open up the desert do not have to
pay any fees related to the process for 10-20 years. The local
government has also provided easy access to the village, building
roads and canals, and set up power systems, said Zhang Bing,
deputy head of the Aksu City Forest Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Taklimakan Desert is the largest desert in China and one of
the largest in the world. Located in the center of the Tarim Basin
south of Xinjiang's Tianshan Mountains, it is 1,000 kilometers
from west to east and 400 kilometers from north to south, covering
a total area of 327,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
To date, the villagers have turned 333 hectares of desert into
cultivated land on which they grow crops, cotton and fruit.
</P>
<P>
Lu Xiaoshun settled in the village last year with his wife and
son. The family has built a house and planted windbreaks, alfalfa
and pears on the 1.2-ha desert. They also raise cattle, pigs and a
large flock of chickens.
</P>
<P>
"Life here is not always so convenient -- we have to travel to
Aksu to buy vegetables and meat. But we have high hopes for the
future," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The village school has 200 pupils and eight teachers.

</P>
<P>
The officials participated in a regional drug enforcement

"Using comprehensive approaches to control illicit drug use
including legal, administrative, cultural, educational, medical

<HEADLINE> Chinese Youth Files Lawsuit Against Canon Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A man from Chongqing
municipality in southwest China has filed a lawsuit against Canon
(Hong Kong) Co. Ltd., saying the Hong Kong-based company implied
in a promotional CD that Hong Kong and Taiwan are separate states
of China.
</P>
<P>
Tang Weijiang, 29, borrowed the CD, a free gift for all Canon
laser printer buyers, from a friend to learn more about the
products of the company. Contained on the disc is a segment titled
"100 Changes of Zhao Wei," which describes various countries the
popular young Chinese actress has visited, naming China, Hong Kong
and Taiwan individually.
</P>
<P>
Zhao was named best female lead at the 17th China Gold-Eagle
Awards last year for her performance in the TV series "Princess
Huanzhu." She became the spokeswoman for Canon laser printers last
year.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that Hong Kong and Taiwan are inalienable parts of
China, a fact which has been recognized by the international
community. The action of the Canon (Hong Kong) Co. Ltd. showed
contempt for China's sovereignty and seriously hurt the feelings
of the Chinese people, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
An angry Tang appealed to the Chongqing Municipal Supreme
People's Court, urging the Canon company to stop producing the CD,
which infringes upon the rights of consumers, and to recall and
destroy all similarly offensive discs.
</P>
<P>
Tang also asked Canon to apologize to the Chinese people and
pay 100 million yuan for psychological distress. Tang urged that
the illegal gains of the company be confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the 100 million yuan will be used to fund 500
Hope Project schools in China. These charity schools help young
dropouts in poor regions return to the classroom.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Lu Lei said that when consumers buy products they form
a relationship with manufacturers based on trust, and in return
the manufacturers have a responsibility to provide good-quality
and safe products and services to consumers.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the Canon CDs are a threat to all people who buy CDs.
The company has committed contract violations and infringed upon
the rights of consumers.

TAIYUAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Wu Baoming, a farmer in Dingxiang
County, north China's Shanxi Province, recently got 1,064 yuan (
about 128 U.S. dollars) of compensation from the local police.

Wu charged the local police at the beginning of the year for
invading his personal freedom. Wu was detained by the local police
as a suspect in a gambling and bombing case in June after he
gained 313 votes, for a seat in the village administrative
committee.
</P>
<P>
Wu was bailed out of detention on July for 5,000 yuan. He was
declared innocent on October 28, and was paid back all the bail
money.
</P>
<P>
Wu asked the police to make a public apology. There has been no

<HEADLINE> Fiji Interim Cabinet to Swear in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's new Interim Cabinet will
be sworn in later Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Fijilive, a Fiji website the adjusted line-up is
almost the same as the one which was to be sworn in last week, the
only change is that members of coup leader George Speight's team
have been excluded.
</P>
<P>
Speight had challenged the initial formation of the Interim
Cabinet announced by president Ratu Iloilo last week. He had put
forward his own list and forced the military authorities to accept.
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Filipo Tarakinikini reportedly said on
Thursday that "Ratu Iloilo was warned that if he didn't agree to a
certain cabinet line-up then further instability will take place
around the country and that his own very life will be under threat.
"
</P>
<P>
Speight was arrested along with several supporters Wednesday
night on the charge of breaching the martial law.
</P>
<P>
However, Tarakinikini said the arrests were made after Iloilo's
life was threatened.
</P>
<P>
He said George Speight and his supporters may be charged for
the act of treason, a crime that carries the death penalty in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a new round of unrest spread around the country.
Tens or hundreds of young Fijian Indians had been taken hostage on
the northern island, Vanua Levu. The Military phoned to the
hostage takers later and threatened to use force to free the
hostages. The rebels released the hostages only after a short time.
</P>
<P>
In other developments, two New Zealand pilots have been kept
and a farm house owned by Fiji's former president Ratu Kamisese
Mara is reported to have been burned down.
</P>
<P>
The Military arrested 369 supporters of Speight and killed one
during an operation in the capital city, Suva in the early morning
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This crisis has dragged on for too long and there have been so
many excuses used in the name of indigenous Fijians that has
really embarrassed and brought shame to Fijians," Tarakinikini
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The British parliament approved a
bill on Thursday to stop soccer hooligans from travelling abroad,
clearing the way for it to become law before England's World Cup
qualifying matches this autumn.
</P>
<P>
But the House of Commons agreed to an amendment by the House of
Lords limiting the bill to a two-year life. After two years, if
the government wants to continue the provisions of the law, it
will have to reintroduce legislation.
</P>
<P>
Under the measure, police will be able to keep suspected
trouble-makers from travelling abroad to matches, even if they
have not been convicted of any crime.
</P>
<P>
The bill was introduced by the Labor government earlier this
month and rushed through parliament after hundreds of English
hooligans were deported from Belgium in June following shocking
scenes of drunken violence at the Euro 2000 tournament.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Capital Steps up Relics Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- While a number of ancient cities
are running roughshod over their relics during urban facelifts,
Beijing has taken new measures to protect its abundant cultural
treasures.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Beijing Cultural Relics Bureau revealed the
city will issue a new regulation stipulating that the construction
of big buildings will be prohibited in the relics zones.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, 25 urban areas were located as the
relics zones in Beijing, which cover 37 percent of Beijing's old
city proper.
</P>
<P>
They said that Beijing recently publicized the findings of more
buried relics, including tombs of different dynasties, to raise
the public awareness of strengthening relics protection.
</P>
<P>
The delicate balance between relics protection and economic
growth has stirred up a controversy here in recent years: A number
of important historical cities are losing their cultural identity
to accommodate urban development.
</P>
<P>
One of them is Anyang in central China's Henan province, where
the capital of the Shang Dynasty was located and the earliest
Chinese characters on animal bones were discovered there. However,
the local government built a highway that has done irreparable
damage to some historical sites.
</P>
<P>
Another is the eastern city of Dinghai, where the first battle
of the Opium War was fought in 1840. Most of the old buildings
have been demolished to clean up the area, despite local
complaints.
</P>
<P>
Criticism has even targeted the Chinese capital, which is
erecting more skyscrapers that overshadow its time-honored hutongs,
or back alleys, and imperial palaces.
</P>
<P>
One of the worst injuries to Beijing's heritage occurred in the
1950s, when the city pulled down the 400-year-old wall surrounding
the capital.

WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Former Wimbledon and U.S. Open
champion Stan Smith was named coach of the U.S. Olympic men's
tennis team on Thursday after John McEnroe turned down the job.
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team, declined the offer
due to personal reasons as he didn't want to seperate from his six
children who will start school during the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"It's a real honor and a bit of a surprise to be asked to do
this," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
Smith, 53, played Davis Cup for 11 years and was a member of
seven championship teams. He has won 39 singles titles and 61
doubles titles during his career, including the singles titles at
the U.S. Open in 1971 and at Wimbledon in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Smith has a tough task ahead in persuading Pete Sampras to
join the team as Sampras didn't play in the 1996 Games at Atlanta
and has said he won't make the trip to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi, gold medalist in the Atlanta Games, has agreed to
play again, Michael Chang and Todd Martin also accepted the
invitations to play the singles.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. men's and women's teams will be announced by Tuesday.
Billie Jean King was earlier chosen to coach the women's team.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Loan to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will get a three-year loan
amounting to 198 million U.S. dollars under a new deal approved by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kenyan finance ministry
announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is finally back on the International Monetary Fund
assistance list after a three-year lockout. The IMF suspended a
loan of 205 million dollars to the east African country in July
1997 due to poor governance and official corruption, which has
brought Kenya's economy on the decline.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a quick-disbursing aid of 18 million
dollars will now be available immediately while the rest will be
given in a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
A total of 40 million dollars will be advanced during the 2000/
2001 financial year starting from July of this year to next June.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo said the country's success
in securing an IMF loan would clear the way for grants and loans
from other donors .
</P>
<P>
"It is an important step toward restoring confidence in our
country. It opens the doors for other development partners to
resume their development aid," he told the press in Nairobi on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is expected to get a 150-million-dollar concessional loan
from the World Bank for implementing the budget, which comes up
for approval on August 1 when the bank's board meets.
</P>
<P>
Kenya will also receive other funds, including some 50 million
dollars from the African Development Bank, and funds from the
European Union and Britain's Department for International
Development, according to Okemo.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the money would now be available for the
government's poverty reduction program and projects in health,
education and infrastructure development as spelt out in the
country's main economic policy document.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Renews Mandate of U.N. Mission in Georgia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Friday renewed the mandate of the United Nations
Observer Mission in Georgia(UNOMIG) for a further period of six
months until January 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution unanimously adopted, the Security Council
strongly supported the sustained efforts of the U.N. Secretary-
General and his Special Representative to promote the
stabilization of the situation and the achievement of a
comprehensive political settlement, which includes a settlement on
the political status of Abkhazia within the State of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council underlined the responsibility of the
parties to the conflict to engage in negotiations on the key
outstanding issues in the United Nations-led peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Council welcomed the commitment of the parties not to use
force for the resolution of any disputed questions, which must be
addressed through negotiations and by peaceful means only, and to
refrain from propaganda aimed at the solution of the conflict by
force.
</P>
<P>
The Council called on the parties to the conflict to implement
earlier agreed confidence-building measures and develop further
measures on the basis of the relevant document signed in Sukhumi
on July 11, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Council reaffirmed the unacceptability of the demographic
changes resulting from the conflict and the imprescriptible right
of all refugees and displaced persons affected by the conflict to
return to their homes in secure and dignified conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Council deplored all violent incidents, as well as the
development of criminal activities, in the conflict zone, and
called on the two parties to take urgent measures to cooperate
with each other in the fight against crime of all sorts and in
improving the work of their respective law enforcement organs.
</P>
<P>
It demanded that both sides observe strictly the Moscow
Agreement of May 14, 1994 on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Demonstrators Burn Public Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of demonstrators against
the government of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori Friday
torched public institutions and some private buildings in the
center of the Peruvian capital during protests against the
permanence of Fujimori in power.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government deployed more than 45,000 agents to
guarantee the order during the re-assumption of President Fujimori,
but they were overwhelmed by the furious demonstrators who are
unsatisfied with the continuation of this government.
</P>
<P>
Some of the most important buildings in the capital of the
country, like the former Education Ministry and the present Palace
of Justice, a few blocks from the Palace of Government, have been
burned, while Peruvian Air Force planes fly overhead.
</P>
<P>
Anti-riot police has launched an impressive amount of tear gas
and another substance that induces vomiting, to control the mob,
but has been unable to stop the thousands of demonstrators who try
to reach the Presidential Palace to prevent Fujimori from
continuing in power.
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen of the Archbishop Loayza Hospital, located in Lima's
downtown, report to have given first aid attention to almost one
hundred injured demonstrators and policemen.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori was sworn in for his third presidential mandate before
the National Congress some hours before the start of the violent
confrontation between the sympathizers of former presidential
candidate Alejandro Toledo and the thousands of policemen.
</P>
<P>
Police fought running battles with marchers in the colonial
city center just blocks away from the swearing-in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Opposition lawmakers, some wearing gas masks in a comment on
the way Fujimori deals with opponents, shouted insults at the 62-
year-old leader then staged a protest walk-out from the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Alejandro Toledo, who lost April's first
round of voting then boycotted May's run-off charging it was
rigged, led marchers towards Congress before being forced back by
gas.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori returned to the presidential palace as protesters
gathered outside. Central Lima was under a cloud of smoke after
fires broke out in several government buildings, including the
national election body's headquarters, during the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Protesters from the Andes, the jungle, the Pacific coast and
Lima moved on the city center for the protests.

<HEADLINE> Annan Voices Concern Over Declining Aid to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Friday that in spite of the fact that the
occupied Palestinian territory remains one of the largest
recipients of international development assistance, it is
nonetheless of concern that the past several years have seen a
continuing decline in donor commitments and disbursements.
</P>
<P>
In a report on assistance to the Palestinian people, Annan
cited figures provided by the Palestinian Authority's Ministry of
Planning and International Cooperation, saying the total of funds
disbursed by 48 donors during the period 1993-1999 was just over 2.
75 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Annan said this included donor commitments of 1.41 billion and
disbursements of 900.5 million in 1994-1995, and commitment of 789.
9 million and disbursements of 511.6 million through 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Over the three-year period from 1997 to 1999, a general trend
of decline has been noted," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"Commitments have fallen yearly, declining from 789.9 million
in 1996 to 546.8 million in 1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
Just under 90 percent of the disbursements were in the form of
grant aid and the rest in loans, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"No single factor can be identified as the principal cause of
the overall decline, or for the significant decline in
disbursements for public investment," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said a document called the Tripartite Action
Plan of 1999 listed the following underlying reasons for this
decline, as cited by donors:
</P>
<P>
-- the frequent shifts in the peace process and delays in the
implementation of singed agreements over the years which have
engendered an atmosphere of uncertainty;
</P>
<P>
-- The transition to an increasing number of economic
development projects, which necessarily involves the preparation,
appraisal and coordination of more complex project with longer
time horizons for implementation;
</P>
<P>
-- internal difficulties in donor countries that result in
commitment and disbursement delays;
</P>
<P>
-- conflicts or natural disasters in other parts of the world
which make strong claims on limited donor resources;
</P>
<P>
-- difficulties of consensus building between donors and
Palestinian stakeholders;
</P>
<P>
-- growing pains of the nascent Palestinian governance system;
</P>
<P>
-- complex Israel measures governing permits for roads, water
projects, industrial estate development and physical planning.
</P>
<P>
Annan called upon the international community to provide the
necessary resources and to demonstrate flexibility in their
support for the development program for the Palestinian people.

<HEADLINE> East Timorese Play Active Role in Decision-Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The eight portfolios, sworn in mid-July and half of them taken
by East Timorese and the other half by U.N. Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), cover internal
administration, infrastructure, economic affairs, social affairs,
finance, justice, police and emergency services and political
affairs, Annan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet enables the Timorese to assume government
responsibilities for the first time," U.N. Assistant Secretary-
General for Peace-keeping Operations Hedi Annabi told the Security
Council Friday, highlighting Annan's latest report on UNTAET.
</P>
<P>
Annabi said the National Council of Timorese Resistance (CNRT),
the largest and most representative coalition of political forces
in East Timor, will hold its conference next month, expected to
advance the debate on the key issues of the new constitution and
the timetable for political elections.
</P>
<P>
In his six-month report covering the period from January to
July, Annan said UNTAET "has established the foundation of an
effective administration" in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
In exercising U.N. authority over East Timor, UNTAET "has
chosen to proceed only in the closest possible consultation with
the East Timorese and with their full consent," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Terming the security situation in East Timor as "generally
stable", Annan said UNTAET's military component has 8,032
personnel from 31 countries, plus a civilian police force of 1,270
officers from 38 countries.
</P>
<P>
East Timor broke away after 24 years with Indonesia following a
U.N.-sponsored self-determination ballot in August last year,
which resulted in favor of independence.
</P>
<P>
Violence followed the ballot, prompting the U.N. to send
peacekeeping force to the territory. The UNTAET was established in
October last year to help East Timor to transit to independence in
a period of two to three years.
</P>
<P>
Local people in East Timor "are increasingly impatient to take
responsibility for their affairs and do not wish the transition
period to continue for too long," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, meeting Friday on East Timor, is expected
to adopt a presidential statement expressing its strong support
for UNTAET to strengthen the involvement of the East Timorese in
the administration.

<HEADLINE> Fifteen Global Challenges Identified by Futurists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the past four years, over 700 futurists, scholars,
business planners, scientists and decisionmakers in dozens of
countries were involved in a research program called Millennium
Project, initiated by Jerome and Gordan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 challenges identified and discussed, the first
five are: achieve sustainable development for all; secure
sufficient clean water for everyone without conflict; bring
population growth and resources into balance; genuine democracy
emerge from authoritarian regimes; make policymaking more
sensitive to global long-term perspectives.
</P>
<P>
Some of the concerns are related to globalization of
information technology, the gap between rich and poor, the threat
of new and reemerging diseases and viruses, improvement of
capacity to decide in accordance with the change of the nature of
work and institutions, and reduction of ethnic conflict, terrorism,
and the use of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Other challenges include woman status, organized crime, growing
energy demand, the development of science and technology, and
global ethnics, Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
To address the global challenges, experts who contributed to
the report suggested establish new alliances, agreements and
treaties; engage in social marketing and promotion of viewpoints
that benefit the society; create new international standards,
extend research and development, and enforce or modify laws and
regulations. Other suggestions can be found in the book.
</P>
<P>
"The challenges are transnational in nature and
transinstitutional in solution. They cannot be addressed by any
government or organization acting alone," said Gordon.
</P>
<P>
"These require collaborative action among governments,
international organizations, corporations, universities, and NGOs,
" Gordon added.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Urgent Actions Needed to Bridge Technology Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Friday that the new information technologies must
not become another resource that divides rich and poor nations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the United Nations Economic and Social Council(
ECOSOC) today as it prepared to conclude its 2000 substantive
session, Annan said information has tremendous potential for
development work, but may become a divisive force if not shared
equally among the world's population.
</P>
<P>
"Countries in which most people do not have access to IT
cannot play a full part in the new global economy. And the longer
they remain outside the global economy, the harder and costlier it
will be to catch up," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"What is the value of Internet connection to those who cannot
read or write?" he asked, stressing that the first step towards
technological literacy was basic education, followed by the
development of human capital and health services, and the
strengthening of democratic institutions and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
"Only healthy people, living in free, open and transparent
democracies which provide for their basic needs, will be able to
take full advantage of IT," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief renewed his call for debt relief, especially
for countries recovering from years of conflicts or natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
Wiping away the debt for such countries would give them a real
chance to rebuild their society and start again, he said, adding "
Pledges are no longer sufficient, we need concrete and immediate
measures."

WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush started his campaign in six Democrat-
leaning states Friday with his running mate Dick Cheney on the way
to the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
Bush kicked off his bus tour from President Bill Clinton's home
state of Arkansas, and then on to Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, West
Virginia and Pennsylvania in a bid to win back these states in
November election.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to states that Republicans haven't won in a while,
" Texas Governor Bush said upon arriving in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
"Our first stop is a place that will send a resounding signal
to America that Arkansas is Bush-Cheney country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton won those states in 1992 and 1996, but former
Republican President George Bush won all but West Virginia in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a rally at a local school, former defense
secretary Cheney said he and Bush were embarked upon "a great
crusade to restore dignity and integrity to Washington."
</P>
<P>
Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes told reporters that Arizona
Senator John McCain, who withdrew from Republican primaries, would
campaign with Bush on the West Coast after the Republican
convention and before the Democratic convention in Los Angeles in
mid-August.

The Republican national convention is scheduled to be held in

the crime, the court said.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Broadly On Fear Of Rate Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell broadly
Friday as a new report of the unexpected strong economic growth in
the second quarter sparked fears of more hike in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 74.96 at 10,511.17,
erasing its gain of 69.65 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 179.23 at 3,
663.00. The index lost 145.49 points Thursday and 41.85 points
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 29.73 at 1,419.89.
</P>
<P>
The market plunged as the Commerce Department reported that the
U.S. gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 5.2 percent
in the second quarter from a revised 4.8 percent advance in the
first quarter. The strong growth rate runs against a majority
belief that the U.S. economy is slowing after six rate hikes in
the past 13 months.
</P>
<P>
Investors were uncertain about whether the Federal Reserve will
raise rates again at the August 22 meeting after the release of
the report in spite of tame inflation.
</P>
<P>
The economy accelerated in the second quarter mainly because
strong business investment offset a slowdown in consumer spending.
Prices, however, rose at an annual rate of just 2.3 percent in the
second quarter, down from a 3.5 percent increase in the first
quarter, indicating that inflation remains under control.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 8.04 at 639.16 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 8.04 at 939.16. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 11.39 at 490.22.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers at a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,877 down, 951 up and 509
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 974.62 million shares from 1.14 billion
in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Telmex Claims Losing 40 Pct Long Distance Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Telecom giant Telefonos de
Mexico (Telmex) refused to admit that it is a dominant firm in the
long distance market of this city, as denounced by the United
States, saying that it has lost 40 percent of its market since its
opening to the competence in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Telmex became a private enterprise at the start of the 1990s
and maintained the control of the telephone industry in Mexico
until 1997, when the process of openess started.
</P>
<P>
The United States accuses Telmex of controlling 80 percent of
the long distance telephone market and of hampering, by means of
high tariffs, the connection of international calls.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Commercial Representative Office filed a claim with the
World Trade Organization (WTO) Friday to pressure Mexico to open
even more its telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
Telmex spokesman Arturo Eliasa Ayub rejected the demands of the
U.S. firms MCI and AT&AMP;T which insist on the application of a
specific regulation to Telmex, as a dominant firm in the market.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government called the U.S. complaint "inadmissible
and unfounded."
</P>
<P>
It refused to admit that Telmex had hampered the development of
the telephone industry and explained that 52 percent of the users
pays a rent of some 13 dollars a month, one of the lowest in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The Telmex spokesman said that the number of telephone users in
the United States cannot be compared, since Mexican households
have an average of five persons, and in the United States there
are two persons for every telephone.

<HEADLINE> First U.N. peacekeepers Deployed Along "Blue Line" Between Israel and Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations began
Friday the deployment of its first peacekeeping units along the"
line of withdrawal", also known as the "blue line," between Israel
and Lebanon, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This morning, platoons from the Irish and Ghanaian battalions
of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon took position at
Yaroun and Manara respectively," Eckhard told the press
</P>
<P>
During the day, platoons from the Fijian, Indian, Nepalese and
Finnish battalions were expected to be deployed at four more
points along the line, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Once this initial phase of the deployment is completed, we
expect to have approximately 150 peacekeepers in position along
the line. These positions will be reinforced with more soldiers
and equipment as time goes on," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese security forces were expected to deploy in the
south in the next few days, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeeping forces should have been deployed in
southern Lebanon Wednesday. The deployment was delayed due to the
constant Israeli violations of the line of withdrawal which was
set by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced the complete withdrawal of its troops from
southern Lebanon on May 24, thus ending 22 years of its occupation
of the area.

<HEADLINE> Wildfire Strikes Near Another Nuclear Facility in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reports quoted lab spokesman Jason Bohne as saying that
about 1,800 employees were ordered out of three buildings at the
sprawling eastern Idaho complex as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
No widespread damage has been reported at the facility, but
Bohne said a small fire "went into" a reactor test area before it
was contained.
</P>
<P>
The blaze, which began Thursday and was fanned by 45-kph wind
gusts, is the third to threaten a facility with nuclear material
in as many months. Fire struck the Los Alamos National Laboratory
in New Mexico in May and a huge fire swept across the Hanford
nuclear reservation in southeastern Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
Both raised concerns about the release of radioactive material,
from rain washing contaminated soil into New Mexico's streams to
airborne particles in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Federal officials have said there has been no danger,
though air samples showed an increased --but not harmful --
concentration of plutonium in public areas outside the Hanford
reservation.

LAGOS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has applauded the current drive for transparency and
accountability in the Senate, saying that "it is the only way we
can bring about the Nigeria of our dreams".
</P>
<P>
In a speech read by former President Alhaji Shagari on Saturday

capital appropriation for the upper house of the assembly, in form
of contract allocation.

They include the self-allocation of 35.9 million naira as "
welfare" package for Senate President Chuba Okadigbo and his
deputy, Haruna Abubakar, inflation of a street lighting contract
from 55 million naira to 173 million naira and the award of
contracts to unregistered companies, some of them owned by the
