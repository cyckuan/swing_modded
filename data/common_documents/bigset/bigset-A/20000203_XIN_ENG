<HEADLINE> Unity, Human Resources Biggest Challenges for East Timor: Xanana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Political unity and qualified
human resources are needed for East Timor after its independence,
Xanana Gusmao, leader of East Timor's independence movement, said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when being asked to name five challenges
East Timor faces during a speech in the Foreign Correspondents
Club of Thailand Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Xanana said the challenges include building up political unity,
lack of well-trained human resources, development of agriculture,
carrying out obligations and putting the health system to work.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to build a strong, democratic and civil society,
establish an independent judicial system and fight corruption and
other woes in East Timor after its independence.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of people in the former Portuguese colony voted
for independence in a referendum last August after 24 years'
Indonesian rule in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Xanana also noted that East Timor welcomes foreign investors
who bring capital and technology to the territory so that it is
able to walk on its own feet in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
As for East Timor's relations with the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), Jose Ramos-Horta, the Nobel peace prize
laureate, said the territory is considering joining the ASEAN or
the South Pacific Forum out of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
He said an East Timorese Congress will meet in August to debate
this strategic issue.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the possibility of East Timor joining both
organizations as a result of its unique geographic position and
political status.
</P>
<P>
Surin Pitsuwan, foreign minister of Thailand and the rotating
chairman of the ASEAN this year, had said East Timor will be
granted observer status and later full membership in the 10-member
regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
Xanana and his six-member delegation including Ramos-Horta is
on a six-nation Asia tour, which has taken him to China, South
Korea and Singapore and will also take him to the Philippines and
Malaysia after Thailand.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramos-Horta, the goals of this trip are to open
dialogue between East Timor and countries in the region and to
express East Timor's gratitude to the countries which have granted
support and aid to the territory.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Xanana also addressed the Reporters'
Association of Thailand, expressing thanks to Thailand for
contributing troops to the multinational peacekeeping force and
extending food and medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 Thai troops were stationed in East Timor as
part of the International Force in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Xanana also said East Timor would like to participate as an
observer in the upcoming U.N. Conference on Trade and Development
to be held in Thailand between February 12 and 19.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Criticizes Anti-China Move by U.S. House of Representatives (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese government and people have, from the very beginning,
expressed their utter condemnation of and firm opposition to such
a act, the commentary says, adding that China has repeatedly made
representations with the U.S. government on this matter.
</P>
<P>
China strongly demands the U.S. government pay great attention
to the Chinese government's just stance and prevent the act from
becoming a law, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It emphasizes that if the U.S. government wants to avoid the
deterioration of the Sino-U.S. relations, it must adhere to the
three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and its relevant commitments,
fully understand the deviousness of the act, and immediately stop
selling advanced weapons and technologies to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-U.S. relationship is very important to peace and
stability in the Asian-Pacific region and the world, and people
everywhere are expecting a world of peace and stability in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
The article reiterates that China's reunification is the common
will of the Chinese government and people, including those
compatriots in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It is a historical trend, the article stresses.
</P>
<P>
The attempts of the 'Independence of Taiwan' forces to stop the
advance of the Chinese people to reunification of their motherland
are doomed to failure, the article concludes.

<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's leading
official newspaper, tomorrow will carry a commentary protesting
the move on the part of the U.S. House of Representatives to
infringe on China's sovereignty by passing the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act.
</P>
<P>
The article says the Taiwan issue is an internal affair of
China, and the U.S. Hourse of Representatives approval of the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act on February 1 was a rude
interference in China's internal affairs, and a severe attempt to
create "one China and one Taiwan" or "two Chinas."
</P>
<P>
The nature of this move is to build up a legal basis for the U.
S. to expand military contacts with Taiwan and provide all kinds
of advanced weapons to it, the article says.
</P>
<P>
This action arouses the strong protest and indignation of the
Chinese people, and it will never succeed, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
It points out that such attempts pose a "serious threat" to the
"relationship across the Taiwan Straits, the peace and stability
of the Asia-Pacific region, and Sino-U.S. ties."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- An international partnership
designed to reduce the human and economic costs of natural
disasters in the developing world was launched here Thursday by
the World Bank and an international coalition of governments,
international organizations, private insurance companies,
universities, and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the ProVention Consortium, as the partnership will
be known, will be to equip developing countries with the means to
better cope with natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes
and floods, and reduce the loss of life and destruction they cause.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, natural disasters killed more than 50,000 people and
destroyed 65 billion U.S. dollars worth of property and
infrastructure. Some 95 percent of disaster-related deaths
occurred in developing countries, where the poorest of the poor
are the worst affected.

<P>
ATHENS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem arrived here on Thursday evening to begin an official three-
day visit to Greece.
</P>
<P>
During the visit here, Cem will on Friday hold talks with Greek
President Costis Stephanopoulos, Prime Minister Costas Simitis,
and sign with his Greek counterpart, George Papandreou, five more
agreements for bilateral cooperation on science and technology,
economy education, sea transport as well as on avoiding customs
violations.
</P>
<P>
Cem, along with Papandreou, will on Saturday attend a
conference of Greek and Turkish journalists and open a cartoon
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Late January, Papandreou paid an official three-day visit to
Turkey, the first by a Greek foreign minister since 1962, and
signed with Cem four bilateral cooperation agreements on tourism,
investment, security and the environment.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have closely
gone to war three times over their territorial dispute in the
eastern Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem, but the two neighboring
countries have since last June taken effective steps to improve
their strained relations.
</P>
<P>
Greece has reportedly refused a recent proposal by Turkey for a
joint military-diplomatic committee to explore military
cooperation in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Greece has insisted that the 1988 memorandum signed between the
two countries concerning building confidence in the Aegean is the
best basis for the rapprochement of bilateral relations.

follows the increasing deadlock between Ulster Unionists and Sinn
Fein following the Irish Republican Army's failure to decommission
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street stressed the step was being taken "as a
contingency" and no date would be set for suspension once the
necessary legislation had been rushed through the Commons in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly would mean "
direct rule" being re-introduced from Westminster.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said the
legislation could go through in the next few days but stressed
that the government was preparing to reassume direct control of
the province only in case there was no progress on scrapping
guerrilla arms.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Mandelson, who would make a statement, would
stress that there was no sign of the IRA returning to violence but
there had not been enough progress on arms destruction or
handovers.
</P>
<P>
Blair's official spokesman said there was still a chance the
prime minister could meet his Irish counterpart at a special
summit in south west England on Thursday night to assess the on-
going crisis.
</P>
<P>
Urgent meetings were taking place in London, Dublin and Belfast
throughout Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
A pre-dated resignation letter signed by Trimble will come into
effect over the next few days unless the IRA begin handing in
their guns.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before confirmation that Britain would start moves to
suspend N.Ireland executive, Martin McGuinness, a senior member of
IRA political ally Sinn Fein, said: "If the institutions are
suspended, it's the greatest disaster to befall Ireland in the
last 100 years and I hope that doesn't happen."

NAIROBI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea's National Assembly has
decided to hold the national elections at the "earliest opportune
time" and entrusted the Election Laws Committee to monitor the
situation closely, the Eritrean News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The national elections scheduled for last year had been
postponed because "Eritreans at home and abroad have been
preoccupied with challenges of defending their nation's peace and
freedom", the report quoted a statement issued at the end of a
two-day meeting of the Eritrean parliament as saying.
</P>
<P>
The meeting noted that the Eritrea-Ethiopia border war had
slowed the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, the National Assembly expressed its satisfaction at
the normalization of relations between Eritrea and Sudan and the
close relations developed between Yemen and Eritrea following the
peaceful and legal resolution of their dispute over some islands
in the Red Sea.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Denies Alleged Foreign Campaign Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit on
Thursday dismissed foreign press reports to the effect that he got
donations from a German party during elections.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit issued a statement rejecting a news report Thursday that
claimed that some part of the illegal donations made to the German
Christian Democrat Union (CDU) was transferred to himself or his
party during election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Former German Chancellor and CDU Chairman Helmut khol admitted
that he received 1 million U.S. dollar donation in campaign funds
during his 16 years in office. The scandal also involved his
successor, CDU Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble, who is facing calls to
quit after confession.
</P>
<P>
"This news report is entirely fictitious and very ugly," Ecevit
said. "Neither me nor the Democratic Left Party (DSP), got donation
or a proposal for donation from a foreign source."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister declared that "for a long time, I oppose the
parties to get any donation from abroad. In the 1970s, I declined
to accept a proposal of a German fund to donate to my then party
the Republican People's Party."
</P>
<P>
Ecevit pointed out that "I request Turkish and foreign press
organs, which published this slander, to correct this fictitious
news report immediately."

<HEADLINE> Iran, Cyprus Cooperate in Combatting Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Thursday expressed its
willingness to cooperate with Cyprus in controlling drug
trafficking from its territory to the island.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Iranian embassy here said that
an official from the Iranian airport authorities had visited Cyprus

in January to discuss the issue, and another delegation will arrive
in the next few weeks for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus police often capture persons with hard drugs coming
from Iran. A court in Cyprus' southern coastal town of Larnaca on
Thursday issued an eight-day arrest warrant against an Iranian
citizen who tried to bring in four kilograms of heroin hidden in
three carpets.
</P>
<P>
Fereidoon Bajelani was arrested Wednesday afternoon on his
arrival in Cyprus. The heroin was hidden in plastic tubes glued on
the three carpets he brought with.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian embassy said Iran had expressed its firm will to
cooperate with Cyprus to check the trafficking of narcotics by
dispatching one official of the Iranian airport authorities on
January 28, 2000, to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Another delegation is due to arrive in Cyprus in the next few
weeks for the same purpose and the two sides' cooperation will
continue," it adds.

<HEADLINE> Swiss National Bank Raises Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss National Bank (SNB)
has again raised interest rates, following concerns about the
weakness of the Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar and the euro.
</P>
<P>
The SNB move on Thursday immediately strengthened the franc
against those two currencies.
</P>
<P>
The SNB said it was raising its key LIBOR (London Interbank
Offered Rate) target range by half a percent. It now lies at 1.75
to 2.75 percent. The range, introduced in December, was previously
1.25 to 2.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The anticipated economic recovery is continuing," said the
central bank in a statement. "At the same time the weak trend of
the Swiss franc, notably vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, is leading to
an undesirable relaxation of monetary conditions in Switzerland."
</P>
<P>
"This poses a threat to price stability," continued the
statement. "By increasing the target range, the National Bank aims
to counteract such a risk."
</P>
<P>
The SNB said it aimed to keep the LIBOR rate in the middle of
the target range for now.
</P>
<P>
The rate rise had been widely anticipated after a decision two
weeks ago to aim towards the upper end of the LIBOR rate failed to
stem losses against the U.S. currency. In the past week, the franc
fell to its lowest level against the dollar for a decade, tracking
the Euro's plunge.
</P>
<P>
The rise came shortly after the European Central Bank in
Frankfurt decided to hike Euroland's interest rates by a quarter
percent to 3.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
That decision in turn followed Wednesday's quarter point
increase by the United States Federal Reserve.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Rise Sharply in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report said that a big jump in demand for airplanes and
electronic equipment helped propel December's overall factory
orders to their best showing since 1992.
</P>
<P>
December's gain in factory orders, bigger than many analysts
estimated,followed a 1.4 percent increase the month before.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1999, new factory orders surged 6 percent, giving
manufacturers their best year since a 7.5 percent rise in 1995. In
1998, new factory orders rose 2.1 percent, showing the effects of
a global financial crisis that severely depressed foreign demand
for U.S. goods.
</P>
<P>
In December, the transportation sector saw orders rise a huge
20 percent, the largest increase since November 1997. Gains in
this sector were widespread but were led by a big boost in demand
for airplanes and aircraft parts. Transportation orders fell 4.1
percent in November.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile transportation category, factory
orders picked up just 1 percent in December, following a 2.2
percent increase the month before.
</P>
<P>
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, the
category that includes household appliances and communications
equipment, increased a strong 6 percent in December. Orders for
this category have been up six of the last seven months.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods rose a solid 5.5 percent in December
while orders for nondurable goods, such as fuel and food, grew by
0.5 percent, with orders for petroleum and coal products showing
the largest increase.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for industrial machinery, including computers,
down six of the last eight months, fell 3.2 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The report said that U.S. manufacturers continue to recover
from the global financial crisis, which dampened overseas demand
for U.S. goods. But at the same time, they still faced competition
from a flood of cheaper imports.
</P>
<P>
For primary metals, including steel, orders fell 1.2 percent in
December.
</P>
<P>
A separate report showed consumers continued their yearlong
shopping spree in January despite some bad weather that forced
many stores to close. The nation's retailers said sales surged to
better-than-expected levels, finishing off what has been strongest
fiscal year for storeowners since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Economists said both reports show that the U.S. robust economy
continues to power ahead, fueled by consumer and business spending
and justify the Federal Reserve's decision Wednesday to boost
interest rates to slow growth to a more sustainable pace so as to
not trigger inflation.

<HEADLINE> UK's Gold Sale Set To Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The British Government has all
but dashed hopes that it will abandon the second stage of its
controversial gold reserves sale.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the Treasury was quoted Thursday as saying "
the four auctions held had been 'well covered' and would almost
certainly be continued".
</P>
<P>
"There has been no problem with the control of the auctions, so
there is no reason to think we would want to change it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government announced last July that it would cut the UK's
715-tonne gold inventory by 415 tonnes. It is committed to selling
125 tonnes through a series of five auctions, the last of which is
to be next month.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury said that it will decide how to sell the remaining
290 tonnes after that.

<HEADLINE> Car Prices In Britain Start To Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Car prices in Britain dropped
last December as the motor industry was claiming that the
government's "rip off Britain" campaign had unfairly targeted the
industry.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance &AMP; Leicester's monthly car price index showed an
average 2.4 percent drop in the price of a new car for December
1999 against a previous year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders said its members would not cut prices despite a fall in
the number of new cars bought.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be waiting for the delayed report into
pricing practices to be published by the competition commission
before sanctioning cuts.
</P>
<P>
But Audi, Daewoo and Mitsubishi have all announced price cuts,
while other car makers have dropped prices on selected models.
</P>
<P>
Sellers of small cars such as the Ford Ka or Volkswagen Lupo,
cut prices most dramatically, by an average of 10.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> ECB Raises Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB)
Wednesday decided to raise its major interest rates after the
governing council meeting at its Frankfurt headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The rate increase, the second one in the ECB's one year
history, came following the same move by the U.S. Federal Reserves
one day before.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued after the meeting, the ECB said the
rate of refinancing, the bank's most important interest rate,
would be raised by 0.25 percentage to 3.25 percent from 9 February
2000.
</P>
<P>
The other two key rates, namely the interest rate on marginal
lending facility, and the rate on deposit facility, will also be
raised by 0.25 percentage each, with effect of 4 February.
</P>
<P>
Thus the two rates will be 4.25 percent and 3.25 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Wim Duisenberg, President of the ECB, said the governing board
of the bank was concerned about the inflation pressure in the
eurozone.
</P>
<P>
"These decisions were taken on the basis of an assessment of
the risks to price stability in the medium term," said Duisenberg
at a news briefing after the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Remain Firm Despite January Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- British retailers enjoyed their
best January for four years, according to the first survey in 2000
for the sector.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry said that 47 percent of
retailers reported increased sales last month, with 18 percent
reporting a fall, representing a positive balance of 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fall since last month, the three-month average
edged higher, suggesting that sales growth is remaining steady but
not accelerating.
</P>
<P>
The positive outlook was compounded by a separate survey of the
construction industry that showed the sector expanded for the 12th
month in a row last month, on the back of booming property prices.
</P>
<P>
Most economists expect the Bank of England to raise rates by 25
percentage points next week to 6 percent to fight growing
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times, Chancellor Gordon Brown
declared his support for an interest rate rise next week as he
delivered his strongest warning yet of the need to counter the
threat of a consumer boom.

<HEADLINE> Annan "Deeply Saddened" by Attacks in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Thursday that he was "deeply saddened" to learn
that two civilians were killed and five others wounded Wednesday
in an attack on a U.N. bus in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in a statement issued by his spokesman, said that he "
expresses his sympathy to the victims' families and calls on all
the people of Kosovo to join him to denounce this heinous crime."
</P>
<P>
"It is the Secretary-General's deep conviction that, for as
long as any single community of Kosovo lives in fear because of
their ethnic or religious background, none can resume their normal
life for which they have waited for so long," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. chief also renewed his appeals to the
international community to "urgently contribute directly needed
resources and police" to the U.N. Mission in Kosovo, known as
UNMIK, the statement said, adding that "the dignity and safety of
human life is preserved for all communities" in the Serbian
province.
</P>
<P>
Attackers fired an anti-tank rocket at a United Nations bus
with 49 Kosovo Serbs on board Wednesday, killing two elderly
people and wounding five other passengers, U.N. refugee agency
officials reported.
</P>
<P>
The bus was travelling between two Serb enclaves when the
attack took place on a foggy road, some 15 kilometers southwest of
the northern city of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
Most of Kosovo's remaining Serbs now live in enclaves to
protect themselves from revenge attacks by the province's ethnic
Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
A wave of revenge attacks against Serbs and other non-Albanian
ethnic groups swept across Kosovo after the Yugoslav Government
pulled its military forces out of the Serbian province last June
to make way for the U.N. Mission and the international peace-
keeping forces, which Belgrade said failed to provide security and
safety to all ethnic groups in the province.

<HEADLINE> Russia Demands Immediate Release of Its Tanker Detained by U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia strongly demanded
Thursday that the United States immediately release its oil tanker
"Volgo-Neft-147" detained by an American warship near the coast of
the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Moscow "is taking all necessary steps to find out as soon as
possible all the circumstances surrounding the detention of the
tanker and to guarantee security for the captain and crew of the
vessel," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It says, "the incident with the Russian tanker is causing
bewilderment" in Russia and Moscow is conducting intensive
consultations with the U.S. side over this incident.
</P>
<P>
The Russian embassies in Washington and Abu Dhabi, capital of
the UAE, have already remonstrated with the U.S. and UAE
governments, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told the press Thursday
that the U.S. State Department and the UAE Foreign Ministry have
been requested to supply Russia with detailed information related
to the incident.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the U.S. warship Monterey detained the Russian oil
tanker "Volgo-Neft- 147" in the Persian Gulf international waters
near the UAE coast to examine the cargo, suspecting it of
smuggling contraband Iraqi oil. Informed of this, the UAE side
refused the tanker to dock to its port for unloading.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry has officially denied assertions
that the Russian tanker stopped was loaded with contraband Iraqi
oil.
</P>
<P>
The tanker was hauling Iranian fuel oil and did not enter
either Iraq's territorial waters or any Iraqi ports, Deputy
Foreign Minister Vasily Sredin said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Russia insists that the tanker be immediately
released and has "expressed its surprise" over the incident
through its ambassadors to Washington and Abu-Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the tanker carrying about 4,000 tonnes of
fuel oil is owned by SFAT, a Russian private shipping company
registered in Cyprus, and is rented by a British company. At the
time it was detained, the tanker was being operated by Russian
Transpetro-Volga company.
</P>
<P>
Following Iraq's invasion into Kuwait in August 1990, Baghdad
was sentenced by the United Nations to international sanctions and
was banned to supply oil to world markets.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the U.N. Security Council started the "Oil for Food"
program, which enabled Iraq to export oil at limited value of 2
billion U.S. dollars every half year to purchase food and
medicines, but set strict punishing measures for shipping
companies violating the embargo restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Evidence of Early Human Presence in West Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- French and Angolan
archaeologists have found the evidence of human presence in West
Africa tentatively dated as 700,000 years old, it was announced
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Calling it a ground-breaking finding, Manuel Gutierrez,
professor of Paris-I University and head of the joint
archaeological team, said that if the dating were confirmed, it
would be the first proof of human habitation on the west African
coast during the early paleolithic period.
</P>
<P>
The expert said that his team had succeeded in digging out some
stone implements alongside a debris of skeleton of a whale at the
Dungo excavation site, some four kilometers from the Atlantic, in
central Angolan province of Benguela.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time in the history that the archaeologists
found the remains of whale with characteristics proving that they
were food of our ancestors," said Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, earliest evidences of human existence had been found
 exclusively in East Africa, said the expert.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
relocated Joseph Kony, leader of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA),
the main rebel group operating in northern Uganda, said a Ugandan
official.
</P>
<P>
"We know that he was relocated to somewhere else within Sudan.
But we don't know whether that is good news or bad news to
Ugandans," Barigye Bahoku, press assistant to Ugandan State
Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma, told Xinhua Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations over the relocation of the rebel leader are still
going on and we will send a team of monitors to Sudan very soon.
Of course, relocating Kony within Sudan is not in agreement with
terms of the Nairobi peace accord," Bahoku said.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace accord signed by Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in Kenyan capital
Nairobi last December, Sudan should relocate Kony to a third
country.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan-backed LRA rebels used to launch attack on northern
Ugandan regions from their base in Jabeleni, southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries have agreed to stop backing each
other 's rebels and normalize relations severed in April 1995.

<HEADLINE> Russia Expects Full Control of Grozny in Coming Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After nearly five weeks of bloody building-to-building battles,
the federal army has reportedly seized major strategic sites in
the Chechen capital, including the downtown Minutka Square, city
administration buildings, railway and bus stations, main streets
and bridges as well as most resident districts.
</P>
<P>
The federal army has controlled over 50 percent of Grozny and
encountered hardly any organized resistance, according to the
General Staff.
</P>
<P>
Rebel snipers, most of them mercenaries from the Baltic
republics, Ukraine and a number of Arab countries, have reportedly
inflicted the largest damage on the federal army.
</P>
<P>
The staff is aware of reports of the serious injury of Chechen
field commander Shamil Basayev, who tried to escape from Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who is visiting the
troops participating in the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya,
said Wednesday that the Chechnya rebels lost up to 600 men during
a night fight for breaking out of Grozny.

"The operation of wiping out the bandit formations in Grozny

<HEADLINE> Canadian Company Develops New Prostrate Cancer Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian biotech company in
Quebec City has developed an accurate test for early signs of
prostrate cancer, the Gazette newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The uPM3 urine test proves 80 percent correct in detecting a
gene maker of prostrate cancer, while avoiding the need for
painful biopsies, which call for injecting a spring-loaded needle
into the prostrate gland to remove cells for examination, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"At the present time, there are still a significant number of
biopsies that are done needlessly," Dr. Yves Fradet, pioneer of
the test, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
If the uPM3 test is used widely, it could cut in half the
number of biopsies performed each year, according to the company,
which expects the test to be approved for use in about two years.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, doctors must still perform the standard PSA
blood test to confirm their suspicions, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The disease is the second most wide-spread cancer in men, after
lung cancer. It's also the second leading cause of cancer deaths
among men, killing more than 4,000 Canadians a year.

<HEADLINE> European MPs Slam Austria's Far-Right Road to Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
legislators Thursday adopted a resolution condemning the inclusion
of the far-right Freedom Party in any Austrian coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted by 406 votes for, 53 against and 60
abstentions in the European Parliament, the legislative body of
the EU.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged the European Commission, the EU executive
body, and the European council of ministers to get ready to
suspend Austria if there were any serious and persistent breaches
of EU principles as set forth in the Amsterdam Treaty regarding
democracy, freedom and human rights.
</P>
<P>
The members of the European Parliament cited Article Six of the
Amsterdam Treaty as the basis for suspension.
</P>
<P>
The resolution condemned all the insulting, xenophobic and
racist words said by Freedom Party chief Joerg Haider last year
and described the admission of Haider's party into the coalition
government as factually legitimating the extreme rightists in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The EU legislators called upon Wolfgang Schuessel, who will
serve as the federal chancellor in the coalition government, to
take the responsibility in guaranteeing that the coalition
government respect the spirit of the fundamental principles of the
15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The far-right Freedom Party has signed an agreement with the
conservative People's Party allowing it to enter the coalition
government. But the deal has yet to be approved by Austrian
President Thomas Klestil.
</P>
<P>
The president did not approve the new government as scheduled
for Thursday, saying that he still wanted to study the program of
the new government. He may delay his decision till Friday.

Brussels, February 3 (Xinhua) -- European officials and
information industry leaders Wednesday discussed Europe's e-
commerce strategy at a meeting, calling for promoting e-commerce
to fully embrace the benefits of globalization and technological
transformation.
</P>
<P>
They agreed the regulatory and market conditions are needed to
speed up Europe's e-commerce, saying that it is time for
enterprises to give up their "wait-and-see attitude" and join the
world competition in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day E-Commerce Conference titled "Picking
Winners in On-line Europe", the participants acknowledged that
European consumers have lagged behind those in the United States
in terms of Internet penetration and e-commerce, but they are
quickly catching up and turning to online solutions for goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
They said as more Europeans are going online everyday, the
services on the Internet must be improved.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the race is on to exploit the European e-
commerce interface -- from PCs to cellular phone to digital TV.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, although the ground work has been laid with the
liberalization of telecom in 1998 and the development of several
directives, an internal market of the European Union (EU) must be
set up to turn e-commerce into a mass market, they added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Two days ahead of the Spring
Festival, or the Chinese Lunar New Year, which falls on February 5
this year, the whole country is stirring with excitement.
</P>
<P>
In the early dawn, Shenzhen in south China's Guangdong Province
next to Hong Kong was awakened by heavy trucks fully loaded with
live chickens, ducks, geese, pigs, sheep, seafood, and fresh
flowers and fruits heading for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We will be working during the Spring Festival in order to
guarantee a stable supply of commodities for the Hong Kong market,
" said Man Kun, a Customs officer at Wenjindu port in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to keep busy so Hong Kong residents can enjoy a
wonderful Spring Festival," said the young man.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 trucks have been passing the port every day,
transporting 10 percent more goods to Hong Kong than on other days
of the year.
</P>
<P>
In Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, trucks carrying
furniture and electrical appliances are now frequently seen on the
local streets, as people who have bought new apartments are busy
moving in to celebrate the new Year of the Dragon, which means
good fortune to the Chinese, in their new homes.
</P>
<P>
The housing market in Guangzhou witnessed a historic volume of
over 38.4 billion yuan (about 4.6 billion U.S. dollars) last year,
with private purchases making up 90 percent of the total.

Another hotel is offering "Net rooms" in which people can surf
the Internet free of charge and send festival greetings to friends
and relatives via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
In the northwest city of Yinchuan, capital of the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, hotel and restaurant managers are trying to
make profits out of the festival in the same way.
</P>
<P>
The Ningxia Gonghui Hotel was completely booked for the New
Year's Eve dinner a month ago, and had to add a dozen additional
tables to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
In Hainan, China's southernmost island province, the provincial
government is inviting people to have dinner away from home by
promoting the idea of "Eat New Year's Dinner Out."
</P>
<P>
This is designed to encourage tourists to eat at local hotels
and restaurants, and then stroll around the island and shop.
</P>
<P>
The city of Sanya, a focus of this idea, will host a grand
festival feast along the seashore tomorrow afternoon.

While deep southern China is still lush green, the north is a
silvery world after the recent heavy snowfalls. Fresh flowers,
however, are still very popular in Ningxia, in north China's
Tianjin Municipality near Beijing, and Urumqi, capital of the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The fresh flowers, mostly flown to the north from the southern
provinces of Guangdong and Yunnan, are rather costly, but they
find a ready market.
</P>
<P>
"My flowers just sell briskly and quickly," said Li Ping, a
flower store manager in Urumqi. It is estimated that more than two
million pots and bunches of fresh flowers will decorate households
in this city of 1.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
For school children in east China's Fujian Province, however,
the best New Year gift could be "equity." Lin Xiaoming, a primary
school student, receives the gift of cash and New Year greetings
from his parents each year. But what he wants most is to be
treated equally at home by his parents.
</P>
<P>
"I wish they could listen to what I'm thinking of, and say '
thank you' or 'I'm sorry' to me when it is necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
As guardians of their child, parents in China are used to being
superior at home. Madame Lin, mother of a 13-year-old child, said
she has never thought of making an apology to her child. "Why
should a head of the family say 'sorry' to a child? " she wondered.
</P>
<P>
But children should not be hurt even a little bit, according to
provincial educators who suggest that all parents and teachers
respect the personalities of children, have dialogues with them on
an equal footing, and create for them an equal and free
environment.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Quality of Irrigation Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
has called on people in the water conservation sector to make
unremittingly efforts to prevent flooding and combat drought.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that irrigation works, complicated
projects, require overall planning, systematic control, and
guaranteed quality, after he heard the work report presented by
Minister Wang Shucheng of Water Resources yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wen has required the Ministry of Water Resources to map out a
comprehensive plan for the country's irrigation construction and
flood prevention, and plans for harnessing a number of major
rivers across the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that serious floods, a shortage of water resources,
soil erosion, and water pollution have become today's most
pressing problems. He urged that flood prevention be combined with
water conservation, ecological protection, and pollution control.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation works should stand the test of time, and every
project should be fully reviewed before construction begins, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier stressed that the quality of all projects must
be guaranteed, since that is key to strengthening the supervision
over irrigation construction.
</P>
<P>
He said that flood prevention and combating drought are
essential for safeguarding people's lives and property, and one
should be as cautious in this work as if one were walking on thin
ice.
</P>
<P>
He also warned of possible future ice-melting floods in the
north since this winter has been exceptionally cold.

</P>
<P>

He made the remarks during a meeting with the foreign experts
who are involved in Chinese revolution and economic construction,

period in China, and contributed to the Chinese revolution and
economic construction and to the economic, scientific and cultural

As China becomes increasingly open, Zhu said, more foreign
friends are coming to China, and the Chinese government and people

<HEADLINE> Summit Between Arafat, Barak Fails to Narrow Gaps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EREZ CROSSING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- In a key summit on
Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat failed to narrow
their gaps over the interim and final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
Arafat decided to cancel a scheduled joint news conference after
the summit which lasted for two and a half hours at the Erez
crossing between Israel and the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip. He
returned to Gaza without speaking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said earlier there would be a major
announcement at the news conference. It had reported that the two
leaders would announce to put off the self-imposed February 13
deadline for reaching a framework agreement on the final-status
issues.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that one of the major differences between the two
sides was over a coming Israeli troop withdrawal from 6.1 percent
of the West Bank, which was to have taken place on January 20 but
is now slated for next week.
</P>
<P>
Danny Yatom, senior aide to Barak, told reporters after the
summit that the two leaders did not reach agreement over the troop
withdrawal, and Arafat asked for more time to study the maps
presented by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, who also attended the
summit, said after the meeting that it is possible that Israel
makes some adjustment to the withdrawal, but he stressed that
Israel will oppose any outside intervention.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security cabinet approved the maps of the withdrawal
Wednesday. Barak's office has confirmed that the Palestinians will
not be given Arab villages in suburb Jerusalem as part of the
transfer.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, however, have been demanding that Israel
relinquish Abu Dis and other Arab villages surrounding Jerusalem in
this stage of the Israeli troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Palestinians want to get a foothold around
Jerusalem, a city hotly contested by the two sides, before the
final-status talks end.
</P>
<P>
The difference over who has the rights to decide which areas to
be handed over was the main reason for the delay in the
implementation of the troop withdrawal, the third and last stage
of land transfers stipulated in the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement
signed by Barak and Arafat last September.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side have insisted that Israel consult with it
before deciding on the areas involved, but Israel says it has the
sole right to determine the areas it will withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Yatom denied a major crisis has emerged as a result of the
dispute, saying the two leaders discussed all the issues related to
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to answer questions as to whether the two sides
can still meet the February 13 deadline set in the Sharm el-Sheikh
agreement for reaching a framework deal on a permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
With only 10 days left, hope is fading that the target date can
be met. Little progress has been made in the new round of intensive
talks launched Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and Palestinian officials have said the deadline
might be postponed.
</P>
<P>
After separate meetings with Barak and Arafat late Wednesday
soon after his arrival in the region with an aim of pushing forward
the negotiations, U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross said it would
be "a formidable task" to meet the target date.
</P>
<P>
Washington has said Barak and Arafat need to consider what to do
if the deadline passes without a deal.
</P>
<P>
A local daily, the Jerusalem Post, reported Thursday that the
two leaders might come out of the latest summit with an official
statement deferring the February 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have proposed that a Camp David-style summit be
held with close supervision of President Bill Clinton. But Israel,
which wants to reduce U.S. intervention, has rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet minister Haim Ramon told Israel Radio Thursday
that the gap between the two sides is so wide that such a summit is
not realistic at this stage.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations at Camp David in 1978 between Israel and Egypt led
to the signing of the first Israeli-Arab peace treaty in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks between Israel and the Palestinians deal
with the thorniest issues such as the status of the Palestinian
entity, the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and Palestinian
refugees.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 39 Injured in Manila Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- One student was killed and 39
others were injured in a grenade explosion at the gate of the
Technological Institute of the Philippines (TIP) in Quezon City of
Metro Manila Thursday afternoon, police said.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Aglipay, director of the National Capital Regional Police
Office, said an initial report put the number of the grenade blast
victims at 40.
</P>
<P>
Aglipay said the fatality was a 20-year-old TIP student.
</P>
<P>
He said other grenade blast victims are now being treated in
various hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Aglipay pointed out that the explosive used was an MK hand
grenade, based on its lever recovered by investigators at the
blast scene.
</P>
<P>
He said police crime technicians collected the MK 2 hand
grenade lever for laboratory examination.
</P>
<P>
This dismissed earlier reports that a homemade pillbox was used
in the explosion, Aglipay noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier police reports also said the bombing was executed by at
least three suspects. The bomb thrower was allegedly seen by an
eyewitness who is expected to give investigators sketches of the
suspect.
</P>
<P>
Aglipay said investigators are looking into reports that prior
to the blast, some students were refused entry by security guards
at the main gate of the TIP. Later the explosion took place.
</P>
<P>
He said investigators are now interviewing witnesses, including
victims of the explosion, on how things really happened.

<HEADLINE> Devastating Pest Set to Advance into S. African Maize Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The borer's spread should be a gradual development with the
Larger Grain Borer (LBG) likely to enter the country via
consignments of maize, Theyse said.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot keep it out. In particular the border with
Mozambique is difficult to control," Theyse said.
</P>
<P>
"LGB is a threat and we are taking it very seriously," said
Jan Viljoen who serves on South Africa's LGB Coordinating
Committee.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa the LGB is not expected to spread as quickly as
the rest of Africa because appropriate grain storage and
transport methods are in practice.
</P>
<P>
Most of South Africa's subsistence farmers occur in the
Northwest, Northern and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.
</P>
<P>
Some people in the maize industry say that the pest is
unlikely to spread to KwaZulu-Natal but others counter that the
LGB has adjusted well to a number of variety environments in
Africa and can live on indigenous plants other than maize.
</P>
<P>
"This grain borer has a devastating effect on small-scale
grain farmers, " said Tanya Saayman from the Agricultural Research
Council (ARC).
</P>
<P>
"Farmers in the rural areas supply a great deal of food to
their families and the LGB could destroy this source of food,"
said Theyse.
</P>
<P>
The LGB has long been a pest of stored grain in Mexico and was
 introduced to Africa in Tanzania in about 1979.
</P>
<P>
Since then the insect has spread to other African countries
like Kenya, Togo, Burundi, Guinea, Malawi, Ghana, Benin, Burkina
Faso, Nigeria and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia LGB first appeared in 1993 and by 1997 it was
ravaging the grain crop in the country.
</P>
<P>
The pest is also known to have entered Zimbabwe and Mozambique
but the governments of these two countries have not officially
recognized the LBG.
</P>
<P>
LGB was found in Namibia's Caprivi Strip in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The LGB's destruction is enormous as the borer can cause
40-percent loss in the weight of a consignment of stored maize.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the LGB's arrival, South African
small-scale farmers are being trained and made aware of this
grain borer.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing we can really do other than create
awareness," said Theyse.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Private Financial Business Makes Headway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Private financial business
has been booming in Ethiopia following the implementation of
economic reform sponsored by the government in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Six private banks with a paid capital of over 264 million birr
have been operating in the country for the past five years, said
Getahun Nana, supervision section head with the National Bank of
Ethiopia (NBE).
</P>
<P>
The banks have 68 branch offices in the capital of Addis Ababa
and other state towns. The initial capital of the private banks
has been increased from 10 to 75 million birr (about 9.2 million
U.S. dollars) beginning from last year, Getahun said, noting the
establishment of the banks had helped boost investment activities
in the country.
</P>
<P>
While the number of private banks increasing, private insurance
 companies have also become active in the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
Currently eight private insurance companies are operating in
property and life insurance investment fields, according to NBE
officials.
</P>
<P>
NBE acting manager of insurance supervision section Dagne
Bolosala said Wednesday that the insurance companies have an
aggregate paid up capital of over 109 million birr (about 13
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The insurance companies have now expanded to 58 towns all over
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The banking and insurance investment fields are exclusive areas
of business for Ethiopian entrepreneurs. The insurance service had
earlier been restricted to a sole government company, Dagne said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of initial investment capital needed to set up
private insurance companies is a minimum of three million birr
(about 370,000 U.S. dollars) for property and four million birr
(nearly 500,000 dollars) for life insurance.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia will deploy a permanent
and strong 42nd motorized infantry division of more than 15,000

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Jobless Claims Drop Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of new claims for
unemployment benefits in the United States fell last week, said a
report released by the U.S. Labor Department Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said 274,000 people filed new claims for jobless
benefits for the week ending January 29, down by 5,000 from the
previous week, the lowest level since January 15 when the claims
were estimated at 264,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the four-week moving average for claims, which
smooths out week-to-week volatility and has been below 300,000
since last July, also dropped last week to 282,000, the lowest
level since December 25,1999.
</P>
<P>
Economists consider jobless claims levels below 300,000 an
indication of an extremely tight labor market, in which it is
difficult for employers to find workers to fill job emptiness.
</P>
<P>
They fear that employers will lure workers with higher wages
and benefits, and as a result the increased costs could lead to
wage and price inflation down the road.
</P>
<P>
The report said for the week ending January 22, 45 states and
territories reported decreases in new jobless-claims applications,
while seven reported increases. The state data lag a week behind
the national figures.
</P>
<P>
The state with the biggest decline was Tennessee, down 10,001,
while that with the biggest increase in claims was Massachusetts,
up 835.

<HEADLINE> Economic Confidence Hits Record High in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The confidence of member
states of the European Union (EU) in their economy rose to a 10-
year high in January as against the depreciation of euro, Eurostat
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the European
Community said a 0.4-point boost in the euro zone increased the
economic sentiment indicator in the 15-nation bloc to 105.7.
</P>
<P>
The confidence in the industry rose further in the past month
thanks to orders for domestic and export-oriented products.
</P>
<P>
With 2-point increase each, Germany and Britain were the most
significant contributors to the improvement of the economic
confidence, while Denmark and Finland recorded the biggest
increases with 1.2 point and 0.8 point respectively.
</P>
<P>
In most EU member states, according to Eurostat, improvement
was evident in the construction sector that registered a 6-point
increase in both the EU and the 11-nation single currency zone.
Spain, Finland, Italy and France posted the most significant rises
in this sector.
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence indicator remained steady in the euro
zone but rose in the European Union area, pushing up the consumer
confidence to an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
The healthy development was partly attributable to the
expectation for improvement in employment in the EU, Eurostat said,
with unemployment rates going down in both the euro zone and the
EU last December.
</P>
<P>
In January, the jobless rate dropped from 9.8 percent of last
December to 9.6 percent in the euro zone and from 9.0 percent to 8.
8 percent in the EU.

<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Minister Hails Crucial Turn in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia's military operation in
the breakaway republic of Chechnya is facing a crucial turning
point after the latest successful efforts by the federal troops in
the Chechen capital of Grozny and southern parts of Chechnya,
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"An irreversible breakthrough has been made in the final stage
of the counter-terrorist operation in Chechnya," Sergeyev declared
to the Russian federal forces' headquarters in the North Caucasus
during his visit there.
</P>
<P>
"This success should be expanded by concentrating efforts in
the main directions: Argun gorge and, naturally, Grozny," he said,
urging the troops to completely clear the rebels out of Grozny and
then the Argun gorge.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said the main task of the Western Group Army Commander
Vladimir Shamanov currently is to fight against the remaining 586
rebels who attempted to break out of Grozny Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebels have suffered great losses, while the
federal troops achieved dramatic improvement on both the western
and eastern fronts in Chechnya with minimum losses.
</P>
<P>
However, Sergeyev warned that the "change is still tentative
and we need to enhance it," as in some places "the situation
remains tense."
</P>
<P>
He said the duration of the operation will be reduced by two to
three times, as the federal troops, with high morale, are moving
at an increased speed.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident that all the tasks assigned to the federal
troops will be fulfilled. I have no doubt about that," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hepatitis E Vaccine to Be Tested in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 3 (Xinhua) -- American and Nepali
researchers are going to test a vaccine against jaundice causing
the Hepatitis E virus in the Kathmandu Valley, The Kathmandu Post
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The researchers are going to start sampling volunteers from
Patan area (near Kathmandu) from February 18 and 3,000 volunteers
will receive the "efficacy trials," according to Dr. Robert Scott,
head of station of Walter Reed/AFRIMS Research Unit Nepal (WARUN),
which is conducting the test.
</P>
<P>
"Nepal was chosen for the trial of the new Hepatitis E vaccine
due to the high prevalence rate of jaundice in the country," said
Dr. Mrigendra Shrestha, one of the principal investigators of the
new vaccine, at a press conference for the local reporters
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, one or two out of every 100 people contract hepatitis
every year and Hepatitis E kills 1 to 2 percent of its victims.
</P>
<P>
"Volunteers are being screened before being administered with
the new vaccine," said Dr. Robert McNair Scott, another principal
investigator of the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
"We will know the success of the vaccine only after two years
time and it will take more than five years for the vaccine to hit
the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Developed at the U.S. National Institute of Health, the protein
vaccine similar to the Hepatitis B vaccine was recently tested in
the United States and was found to be tolerant to Americans.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The McLaren Mercedes-Benz
Formula One team unveiled their new MP4-15 car on Thursday with a
warning they will be faster, stronger and more reliable than ever,
according to reports from Jerez, Spain.
</P>
<P>
Team chief Ron Dennis announced that the DaimlerChrysler group,
which owns Mercedes-Benz, has purchased a 40 percent stake in the
McLaren group, substantially boosting the funding and strength of
the British-based outfit.
</P>
<P>
McLaren's world drivers' champion Mika Hakkinen of Finland and
British team mate David Coulthard declared themselves to be fitter
and more motivated than before.
</P>
<P>
The new car, powered by a Mercedes-Benz V10 engine, was an
evolution of last season's vehicle in which Hakkinen claimed his
second title, said technical director Adrian Newey.
</P>
<P>
Newey added that among the most significant detail changes were
a new exhaust system and modified gearbox, hydraulics and rear
suspension.
</P>
<P>
The aerodynamics on the car were also modified but the greatest
change was the introduction of a new V10 power unit which is more
compact and lighter than its predecessor, providing greater speed.
</P>
<P>
Dennis said: "The investement from Daimler-Chrysler is terrific
news for us. It is a historic milestone and it will increase the
strength of our team and the close co-operation between us. I
think it will make us stronger than ever."

<HEADLINE> Barak Meets Arafat On Permanent Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EREZ CROSSING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak held key talks here Thursday with Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat to discuss ways of advancing
the permanent peace negotiations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian officials said earlier that the meeting
centers on whether the two sides can meet a self-imposed February
13 deadline for reaching a framework agreement on a permanent
peace.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders shook hands warmly and smiled for the cameras
before entering a white two-story building for talks near the
border crossing between Israel and the Palestinian-ruled Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came as the two sides have only 10 days left to
reach a framework agreement on the thorniest issues such as the
final status of the Palestinian entity, the fate of Jerusalem, and
the future of Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators for the final-status talks
launched a new round of intensive negotiations Sunday in a bid to
meet the approaching time limit, set in the Sharm el Sheikh
agreement signed last September.
</P>
<P>
But hope is fading that the two sides will meet that deadline
since no much head-away has been made in the negotiations.
Officials from both sides have suggested that the deadline might be
postponed.
</P>
<P>
After separate meetings with Barak and Arafat late Wednesday
soon after his arrival in the region, United States Middle East
envoy Dennis Ross said the two sides are facing "a formidable task"
to meet the target date.
</P>
<P>
Washington has said that Barak and Arafat will need to consider
what to do if the deadline passes without a deal.
</P>
<P>
This is the second meeting between Barak and Arafat in 20 days.
They held an unexpected late-night meeting on January 17 at an
undisclosed place in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have denied reports that Barak asked Arafat at that
meeting to put off the February 13 deadline by two months.
</P>
<P>
A local daily, the Jerusalem Post, quoted a top Palestinian
negotiator as saying Thursday the leaders will come out of the
latest meeting with an official statement deferring the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat are also expected to discuss a coming Israeli
withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank, which was to have
taken place on January 20 and is now slated for next week.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security cabinet Wednesday approved the maps of the
withdrawal, the third and last stage stipulated in the Sharm el
Sheikh interim agreement.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office has confirmed that the Palestinians will not be
given Arab villages in suburb Jerusalem as part of the land hand-
over.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians said that, however, they are still pushing for
the transfer to include the land around Jerusalem with an aim of
getting a foothold around the contested city before the final-
status talks end.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Foreign Investment Drops in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's foreign
investment in 1999 was valued at 480 million U.S. dollars, the
lowest amount since 1994, but the best in terms of implementation.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC)
show that a total of 98 projects worth 480 million dollars were
approved in 1999, compared with 145 projects worth 855 million
dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, government figures indicate that the implementation
rate of foreign investment in 1999 was the highest of the past six
years. The ratio of project implementation in 1999 exceeded 85
percent, while in previous years it only reached between 11
percent and 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Officials blamed the sharp decline of foreign investment on the
lingering impact of the Asian financial crisis and the internal
problems on capital investment.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, officials attributed the dramatic increase of
the implemented investment to a new measure carried out by the
government in mid-1998, which requires investors to deposit 1.5 to
2 percent of their investment amount upon approval.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1999 investment statistics, Cambodia's
industry, including garment manufacturing, wood processing and
mining, dropped 63 percent from 654 million dollars in 1998 to 239
million dollars in 1999.

<P>
JAKARTA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Major factions in Indonesia's
House of Representatives (DPR) on Thursday urged the government to
pay more attention to the country's security situation in order to
secure its economic growth target for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government submitted a draft of state budget last month,
targeting the economic growth rate in 2000 at 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The economic growth (of about 4 percent) can be reached if
security and political problems can be tackled well," spokesman of
the National Awakening Party (PKB) faction Andi Najmi Fuaidi told
a plenary session deliberating on the government-proposed draft of
state budget for the fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spokesman of the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI P) faction Ni Gusti Ayu Eka Sukmadewi Jaksa
underlined that security situation could boost the country's
economic growth as well as jeopardize the target of economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
While Golkar Party faction said that the target of an economic
growth of 3.8 percent in the year 2000 is too optimistic, the
Reforms faction said that assumptions used by the government in
drafting the state budget for the fiscal year 2000 were realistic
enough.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Value Peace, Harmony: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysians of various
races and religions are a rational people who valued peace and
harmony among them, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians can take pride in their long standing spirit of
tolerance which has brought success to the country, Mahathir said
in his message to mark the Chinese New Year which falls on
February 5 this year.
</P>
<P>
He said even though the country's administration was led by
Muslims, the government had never restricted the followers of
other religions from practicing their faith or cultures.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said, "Celebrations to mark the Year of the
Dragon will no doubt be more joyful and meaningful this time not
only because it is being observed in the new millennium but also
because the country is now free from economic pressures."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysians should be thankful that their country
was not very badly affected by the economic downturn which hit the
region as most of them were still able to lead a comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of major Chinese-based political parties,
such as Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) and Gerakan (the
People's Movement Party), urged the country's Chinese community to
continue to cooperate with the government in its efforts to
implement the various policies for the good of the country.
</P>
<P>
MCA President Ling Liong Sik, who is also the country's
transport minister, said in his message that he was happy that the
Chinese community had played a positive role in helping the
government revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that even though the economy was gaining strength, the
people should continue to support and cooperate with the
government in its efforts to implement the various policies for
the good of the country.
</P>
<P>
He hoped Malaysians would continue to strengthen their unity
and value the social stability and peace which Malaysians have
been enjoying so long.
</P>
<P>
Gerakan President Lim Keng Yaik, also the primary industries
minister, urged Chinese Malaysians to continue to work harder and
more closely with the government to explore the great potentials
of the new century.
</P>
<P>
"The recent economic crisis seemed to be a great challenge.
However, the government together with the support of the people
has managed to overcome such odds," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the overwhelming mandate given by Chinese Malaysians
for the 14-party Barisan Nasional (National Front) in last year's
general election was a sign that they wanted the nation to
continue to be forward-looking, progressive, democratic, stable
and harmonious.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Opposes Arms Inflow to Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi said here Thursday that Kenya strongly opposed arms inflow
into the region of Horn of Africa and any other forms of external
intervention into the regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that arms used in conflicts such as Somali civil war
were from Europe and America and these weapons could only further
fuel the conflicts and prolong human suffering.
</P>
<P>
Some of the arms have already found their way across the
Somalia's borders to neighboring countries such as Kenya, said
Moi, who is also head of the Inter-governmental Authorities of
Development (IGAD).
</P>
<P>
"With conflicts between Eritrea and Ethiopia, in southern Sudan
and within Somalia, the situation in the Horn has continued to
worsen," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Those who want to be partners in the search for peace must
respect leaders in the region and channel their efforts through
the IGAD, the United Nations and the Organization of African
Unity," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ongoing conflicts in the Horn of Africa include Ethiopia and
Eritrea border dispute, civil war in Somalia and southern Sudan
conflict, which have claimed thousands of lives of civilians.

LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Senator Joseph Waku was
Wednesday suspended from the higher chamber of the country's top
legislature for inviting the military to take over the
government.
</P>
<P>
The senator was quoted in the current Tell magazine as calling
for the military to stage a coup to end the dictatorship of
President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives after deliberations referred the
issue to the Information, Ethics and Privileges Committee to
further probe the veracity of the story, according to the
Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The committee is to submit its report within one week.
</P>
<P>
Senators Wednesday unanimously agreed that the suspension as a
 punishment was inevitable since a precedent had been set with the
 suspension late last year of Senator Femi Okurounmu for alleging
that senators were planing to impeach President Olusegun
Obasanjo.

<HEADLINE> Prices of Petroleum Products Skyrocket in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The sale prices of the petroleum
products in the country will be elevated immediately by a large
margin in a bid to alleviate the crunch over the Angolan financial
authorities, Angola's oil sector announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Angola's monopolist oil company SONANGOL, the
price of gasoline will hike by 1400 percent from the current 0.26
kwanzas (0.04 U.S. dollars) per liter to four kwanzas (0.67
dollars) per liter, while the price of diesel oil will reach two
kwanzas (0.33 dollars) per liter, marking a 1900 percent increase
as compared with the current price of 0.1 kwanzas (0.017 dollars)
per liter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prices of propane gas will also be raised by 243
percent from the current 14 kwanzas per bottle (12 kilograms) to
48 kwanzas.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan population will also see a remarkable elevation of
other petroleum products, including light fuel, kerosene and
asphalt, which will respectively hit 1.6 kwanzas, two kwanzas per
liter and1.1 kwanzas per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Angola, the second-largest oil-producing country in Africa, has
given allowance to the oil price for a long time, which exerted
strong pressure upon the national treasury.
</P>
<P>
Considering the significance of the revenue from the oil sector
for the national defense, the Angolan government has been keeping
the annual oil production a top secret.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai's Disaster-Struck People Get Relief Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.5 million disaster-
plagued people in Qinghai Province in northwest China have been
given basic daily necessities in the days leading up to the Spring
Festival, China's traditional lunar new year which falls on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Recently the local government distributed 200,000 kg of flour
to 33 towns and villages that were worst hit by natural disasters
last year, bringing the province's urgently-needed grain for local
people to 9.445 million kg.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Qinghai was struck with its most severe natural
disasters in 50 years, including drought, floods, hailstorms and
heavy snows.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.5 million people in 385 villages have been affected by
the natural disasters which cut grain production by 200 million kg.
</P>
<P>
The civil affairs department of Haidong Prefecture has given
out 2 million kg of grain to people in the counties of Ledu, Minhe
and Longhua, which suffered most from Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
After the Spring Festival, the provincial civil affairs
department will allocate another 15 million kg of flour for the
handicapped, and childless and infirm old persons who are
guaranteed food, clothing, medical care, housing and burial
expenses by the government.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the famous Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the "roof of the
world," Qinghai is among the provinces which are most vulnerable
to natural disasters such as floods, snow storms and drought.

<HEADLINE> Large Oil-Gas Field Discovered Off China's Eastern Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China has verified an oil and
gas field on the East China Sea, which is believed to be the
largest ever discovered in the ocean area.
</P>
<P>
Located 450 km off the eastern coast, the Chunxiao No.3 Field
has been proved by the China National Star Petroleum Corp. as a
high yield oil and gas-bearing structure.
</P>
<P>
A trial exploration of the well showed a daily yield of 1.4
million cubic meters of natural gas and 880,000 cubic meters of
crude oil, a company officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The company started exploration of the field last October,
expecting the seabed structure to have large oil and gas deposits.
The total reserve has not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
Offshore oil and natural gas were produced from the East China
Sea in 1998. There are seven oil and gas fields in the sea now,
which have been mainly used to supply the Pudong New Area in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 local households in Pudong have had their
fuelstuff replaced by natural gas from the fields. The new oil as
field will guarantee continuous consumption of the environment-
friendly energy in Shanghai and neighboring areas in east China.

<HEADLINE> Fireworks Allowed in Part of Rural Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Municipal Public Security
Bureau in Beijing has okayed 23 sites in areas outside the Chinese
capital's suburbs where local residents can light firecrackers
during the Spring Festival holiday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local authorities are reminding the public of the
six-year-old ban on fireworks in downtown Beijing, a measure aimed
at preventing firecrackers-related injuries and fires and
protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
The specially-designated spots are open to fireworks only from
January 29 to February 19, and the designation is only in effect
for this year, according to the police.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they will review the situation on a year-by-
year basis.
</P>
<P>
Chinese believe that lighting firecrackers in the lunar New
Year, which falls on February 5 this year, can drive away evil
spirits for the entire year to come.
</P>
<P>
Beijing launched the ban on December 1, 1993, in accordance
with a bill passed by the municipal people's congress, following
similar orders in coastal, developed cities including Guangzhou
and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Before that, surveys were conducted among local residents, in
which 86 percent of the respondents said they were in favor of the
ban for security and environmental reasons.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, during the Spring Festive
holidays in 1992, 544 local residents were injured by firecrackers
and eight were blinded, 238 fires were reported around the city,
and both the air pollution and noise caused by the firecrackers
far exceeded state standards.
</P>
<P>
Since the ban was enacted, no fireworks-related injuries or
fires have been reported in the urban areas of Beijing, according
to city government officials.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Off To Athens For Historic Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem is flying to Athens Thursday for an official visit to Greece,
the first ever by a Turkish foreign minister in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Cem will reportedly sign five agreements with his Greek
counterpart George Papandreou to add to the four accords the two
ministers signed during Papandreou's visit to Ankara last month.
</P>
<P>
The five new agreements cover cooperation in the fields of
science and technology, economy, education, customs and maritime
affairs, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
During the past 25 years, Greece and Turkey, both members of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, have been on the brink of war
three times over disputes on the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have cashed in on the mutual sympathy produced
by devastating earthquakes in the two countries last summer, a
process dubbed as "earthquake diplomacy," to improve bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
The new rapprochement gained momentum during the landmark visit
by Papandreou to Ankara, where the two sides signed accords on
environment and tourism, fighting illegal immigration, terrorism,
organized crime, and preventing dual taxation.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Greece, Cem is expected to meet Greek
President Costis Stefanopoulos and Prime Minister Costas Simitis,
and deliver speeches at the Turkish-Greek Journalists' Conference
on February 5.
</P>
<P>
Before the official opening of the meeting, Simitis will receive
the 50-odd Turkish journalists attending the conference.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Creates Commission to Monitor War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
created a commission to monitor the ongoing Balikatan joint
military exercises between Filipino and American troops, the
Presidential Palace said Thursday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the commission was created by President
Joseph Estrada in a bid to ensure the military exercises comply
with Philippine laws and the provisions of the Philippines-U.S.
Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA).
</P>
<P>
Military leaders from the Philippines and the United States
opened January 28 the Balikatan 2000 joint military exercises,
which will last more than one month in the Philippines and involve
close to 5,000 servicemen from both countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the presidential commission "shall ensure
respect for Philippine laws, state policies, public morals,
customs and traditions and strict compliance with the provisions
of the VFA."
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Senate, in ratifying the VFA last year,
recommended the creation of the presidential commission to monitor
the implementation of the VFA and determine whether it continues
to serve the national interest.
</P>
<P>
Named chairman of the presidential commission is the secretary
of the Department of Foreign Affairs, with the secretary of the
Department of National Defense as co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
The secretaries of other concerned departments were named
members of the commission. The private sector and non-government
organizations are also encouraged to participate the commission in
carrying out its task.
</P>
<P>
The commission will be under the control and supervision of the
president, and will be directly responsible to him, said the
statement.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Govt Insists on Constitution Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Despite opposition, the
Zanzibar government has reiterated the need to change the
constitution to allow President Salmin Amour to run for an
unprecedented third term, media here reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to restate that we will go ahead with the amendments,"
Iddi Pandu Hassan, Minister of State in the Chief Minister's
Office for Legal Affairs and Constitution, was quoted as saying
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iddi revealed that groundwork on the changes had been completed
and a bill seeking the amendment will be moved during the next
ordinary session of the House of Representatives to begin on March
21.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that calls for the amendment was the wish of the
Zanzibaris, aimed at tuning the islands to achieve its
socio-political goals.
</P>
<P>
"We see nothing wrong with the idea," the official said. "After
all, the government has previously changed the Constitution
several times and there was no uproar."
</P>
<P>
He rejected claims that the change was specially tailored by
the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party to favor President
Salmin to contest for a third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Iddi explained that the amendments would benefit the islanders
and cover several aspects of interests including reforms of the
Isles' electoral commission, the judiciary and presidential
powers.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar government's stand had come less than four days
after Vice- President of Tanzania Omar Ali Juma said that top
leaders should adhere to the country's constitution and vacate
their posts at the end of their tenure.
</P>
<P>
The semi-autonomous Zanzibar region in the Indian Ocean joined
with mainland Tanganyika to form the United Republic of Tanzania
after a revolution in 1964 that ousted the Sultan and Omani Arabs
who ruled the island.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Holds U.S. Responsible for Power Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States should be
responsible for the current power shortage in the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) because Washington failed to
provide two light water reactors to Pyongyang on time, DPRK Vice
Premier Jo Chang Dok said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented power shortage in the DPRK has hampered the
country's economic development, Jo told the Korean Central News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK should not be blamed for the current difficulty in its
national economy, Jo said. Rather, it is entrirely attributable to
the failure of the U.S. to honor its commitements on the provision
of two light water reactors after Pyongyang froze its own nuclear
power plan.
</P>
<P>
"If the bulding of an atomic power plant to be equipped with
graphite-moderated reactors relying on locally available abundant
fuel had been promoted as scheduled, the problem of electricity
would have already been solved successfully and electricity would
not have been in such short supply as today," Jo said.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed between the DPRK and the U.S.-led
Korean Peninsular Energy Development Organization in New York in
October 1994, Washington agreed to provide two light water
reactors and heavy oil as fuel energy to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
In return, the DPRK promised to phase out its graphite reactors
capable of producing materials that can be used to make nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the unreasonable U.S. delaying tactics, the LWR (light
water rector) construction is not likely to be completed even in
2010, to say nothing of 2003, the deadline," Jo said.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also demanded U.S. compensation for economic
losses incurred.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. should own responsibility for having caused such
acute shortage of electricity in the DPRK and brought enormous
economic losses to it, and make compensation for them in any form.
"
</P>
<P>
He warned that "the DPRK will be left with no option but to go
its own way" if the U.S. does not fulfill its commitments.

The Daily Telegraph:

<HEADLINE> Aziz Calls on Neighboring Countries to Break Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz has called on Iraq's neighboring countries to break the
10-year-old U.N. embargo on Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency INA
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remarks Wednesday evening at a meeting with a
delegation of the Jordanian National Mobilization Committee in
Defence of Iraq which arrived here Sunday carrying 3.2 million
penpils for Iraqi school children.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi deputy premier called on the adjacent countries to
make use of Paragraph 50 of the U.N. Charter which permits dealing
with Iraq, said INA.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. and Britain of impeding the approval of
contracts Iraq signed under the oil-for-food program, citing the U.
S. representatives' opposition to Iraq's import of pencils under
the pretext of using them in manufacturing weapons.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. claims of non-impediment of supplying Iraq with
pencils has come after the One Million Pencils campaign launched by
the Jordanian mobilization committee to support Iraq," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian committee launched the One Million Pencil campaign
last December because pencils are one of the items whose entry into
Iraq is banned for its dual usage under the U.N. sanctions imposed
on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The committee announced earlier this month in Amman that "this
campaign is the largest popular activity in Jordan to publicly
break the sanctions imposed on Iraq for the past 10 years."
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the Jordanian delegation, Aziz also
slammed the U.N. resolution 1284 on Iraq adopted last December,
describing it as "a malicious diplomatic game aiming at rewording
the Security Council resolutions in order to keep the embargo in
place."
</P>
<P>
The resolution 1284 creates a new arms control regime for Iraq
and calls for Iraqi cooperation with it in exchange of possible
suspension of the sanctions imposed on it.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Life Sciences Industry Expands in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's life sciences
industry grew to 6.3 billion Singapore dollars (about 3.7 billion
U.S.dollars) in 1999, a 60 percent increase over the previous year,
the Economic Development Board (EDB) said Thursday in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
The life sciences, a new industry cluster which EDB expects to
grow as the fourth pillar of Singapore's manufacturing sector,
contributed 7.0 percent of Singapore's total manufacturing output
last year,according to the press release.
</P>
<P>
The cluster's contribution to the total output was, however, 17
percent, which is significantly higher than the proportion of its
output, the press release says.
</P>
<P>
Life sciences registered an value-added growth of 5.2 billion
Singapore dollars (about 3.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999, a 74.5
percent increase over the previous year, the press release says.
</P>
<P>
With the inclusion of the food and agribiotechnology industry,
the manufacturing output of the cluster grew by 34 percent to 9.3
billion Singapore dollars (about 5.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lagos Police Kill Seven Robbers in Street Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Police shot dead seven gangsters
at a sight of an armed robbery on Wednesday in Maroko market of
Lagos, Nigeria' s largest city.
</P>
<P>
The seven bandits shot and wounded three persons including a
pregnant woman, a commercial bus conductor and a passenger before
they were killed by the police, reported the Guardian, a leading
Nigerian newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The hoodlums reportedly came in a white mini bus without any
registration number. But when they noticed the heavy presence of
policemen in the bank they intended to rob, they resorted to
robbing motorists and residents on a nearby road.
</P>
<P>
The police barricaded the road and a gun fighting followed.
</P>
<P>
Some of the gangster, in their desperate try to escape, jumped
into a nearby lagoon, and were stopped by the police with the
help of local swimmers.
</P>
<P>
After last year's ethnic turmoil in Lagos, which killed several
hundred people, police presence was significantly strengthened on
the streets of Nigeria's economic capital. The security situation
in Lagos is also on the graduate improving.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Relatives Accuse Crash Victims Bodies Poorly Kept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian victims' relatives
Wednesday in Cote d'Voire's capital Abidjan accused Cote d'
Ivoire authorities of poorly keeping the body of the victims of
the Kenya airways A310 crash and making them beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
The family members of the victims, mostly from Nigeria, were
currently in Abidjan to identify their dead, after which the
bodies would be flown home for burial, reported the Guardian, a
leading Nigerian newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The families, however, accused the country of keeping the
bodies in an unrefrigerated room, and complained that the stench
therefrom was nauseating.
</P>
<P>
It is not normal. How can anyone recognise the bodies? The
paper quoted one of the relations as saying in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, accident investigators are,
however, continuing the search for the wreckage of the plane.
They hope to find the two flight recorders for clues about why
the plane crashed minutes after taking off for Lagos.
</P>
<P>
French troops taking part in the search say they are optimistic
the black boxes will be found with the help of sophisticated
sonar equipment.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Kenya Airways and Airbus corporation, plus
an investigation team from France, are in Abidjan to probe the
crash.

<HEADLINE> Delayed SADC Trade Pact Cost Zimbabwe Dearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Delays in the implementation of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Trade Protocol
has dampened Zimbabwe's hopes of increasing its regional export
and boosting its dwindled foreign exchange, the Business weekly
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce,
Nhlanhla Masuku, said lately that delays in the implementation of
the trade protocol would be a major blow particularly to the
manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
If the anticipated trade pact was implemented as scheduled for
January this year, Zimbabwe, comparatively strong in
manufacturing, would benefit from its increased export of
manufactured goods to other SADC members, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
With thousands of workers losing jobs, the sector was also
seriously hit by the high interest rates and the rising inflation
which had contributed to a bad macro-economic environment in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zimbabwe needs a minimum of 500 million U. S.
dollars to deal with an acute shortage of foreign exchange which
has resulted in lack of fuel.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority imports about 55
percent of the country's power needs from Mozambique, South
Africa, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, costing
more than five million dollars each month.
</P>
<P>
However, it might cost Zimbabwe less in fuel purchase after the
 implementation of the SADC trade protocol, the analysts noted.
</P>
<P>
The trade protocol has now been postponed indefinitely owing to
 differences among SADC countries on how it should operate, the
weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The major sticking points are centered on the rules of origin
of products in the clothing and textile and footwear sectors.
</P>
<P>
Some countries are opposed to stringent rules of origin for
clothing and textiles.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is proposing a compromise three-year grace period
during which poorer SADC members such as Mozambique, Malawi and
Tanzania would export for three years under preferential terms,
clothing made from fabrics imported from outside the region.
</P>
<P>
Now, the implementation of the protocol hinges on a meeting of
the 14 SADC member countries later this month.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt's Plan for Elections Premature: Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Given the lingering civil war
and the need for a electoral reform, the initiative of the
government on general elections in 2001 is premature, the Angolan
opposition parties said.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said here Thursday that the Angolan opposition
parties are unanimously opposed to the polls plan put forward by
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
In an unexpected announcement last week, dos Santos said he
planned to call the presidential and legislative elections in 2001
but did not specify the dates.
</P>
<P>
Widespread destruction of infrastructures and the necessity for
a constitution reform were also listed as the explanation for
their opinions by the parliamentary leaders of the four opposition
parties including the pro-peace faction of UNITA, the Renovated
Commission of the National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Abel Chivukuvuku, the repentant UNITA leader who enjoys the
trust of the Western countries including the United States, said
that dos Santos' announcement was "positive", but merely "a
declaration of intent".
</P>
<P>
The general elections would require peace and stability,
Chivukuvuku said, stressing that they demanded "an immensity of
political measures", not only the simple "silencing of weapons".
</P>
<P>
Legislative leaders of the Social Renovation Party, the
National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) and PAJOCA
echoed similar concerns and scepticism.

<HEADLINE> Hutu Militiamen Kills Tutsi Refugee in Tanzanian Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 3 (Xinhua) (C A gang of Hutu militia
from neighboring Rwanda last Wednesday night crossed the border
and kidnapped a Tutsi tribesman in a village in Tanzania's western
Kagera Region, Tanzanian media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kagera Regional Police Commander Eliyuko Elihaki was quoted as
saying that after kidnapping Mwamakasha, the gangsters forced him,
at gun point, to show them five other Tutsis, whom they robbed and
injured some of them.
</P>
<P>
The assailants, who were armed with sub-machine guns and
machetes, attacked two Tutsi women, the African newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the police commander, the Hutu militiamen
eventually killed Mwamakasha, slicing his body into pieces. They
later fled through the same route.
</P>
<P>
Eliyuko said the motive for the killing has not been
established yet. However, he said, it could possibly be linked to
political differences in the neighboring country. Nobody has been
arrested in connection with the incident.
</P>
<P>
Security in Tanzania's western border villages was erratic
because illegal immigrants have established settlements in the
area, said Eliyuko.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kagera Regional Commissioner Tumainieli Kiwelu said
some refugees did not obey orders to stay in the camps. Some were
engaged in criminal activities like ambushing vehicles, robbing
and killing innocent people.
</P>
<P>
 In Rwanda, an estimated 800,000 people, most of them minority
Tutsis, were killed in the Hutu-sponsored genocide that began
after the downing of the then Rwandan President's plane in April
6, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Since then, hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees fled
into Tanzania and settled in the western area.

NANCHANG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- An African lion wandered
through a suburb of Nanchang, the capital of east China's Jiangxi
Province, for six hours on Wednesday before being captured by
police.
</P>
<P>
The three-year-old lion, weighing 150 kg, along with a tiger,
was being hauled by truck to the city of Fuzhou for a show, when
it escaped through the bars of its cage and ran off. The driver
did not realize the animal was gone until he reached Fuzhou.

A local resident named Hu Wangbao saw the lion strolling down
the No. 320 National trunk highway at about 10 am yesterday and
immediately dialed emergency police number 110.
</P>

Officers rushed to the area and sealed off the region where the
lion was spotted. When the lion appeared in a rice field, a
veterinarian shot it with four anesthetic pellets from a distance
of eight meters.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Record Number of Chinese Travel Abroad in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A record-breaking 4.3 million
Chinese traveled overseas during 1999 for personal matters, a jump
of 50.8 percent over the previous year, the Ministry of Public
Security announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The figure includes 2.88 million going to other countries, up
52.2 percent year on year, and 1.32 million heading for Hong Kong
and Macao, up 48.6 percent.

<P>
A total of 92,000 people from the Chinese mainland went to
Taiwan during the past year, almost 40 percent more than the

</P>
<P>
Tourists took the lion's share of the number of Chinese
citizens traveling abroad last year, totaling 1.93 million, up 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who immigrated overseas continued to drop,
with ministry-approved immigration applications declining 6.5
percent year on year to 58,000 people.
</P>
<P>
About 536,000 people visited their relatives and friends abroad

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Half Finished with Int'l Genome Research Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists
participating in an international genome research project
announced today that they have accomplished a half of their quota
to sequence 30 million base-pairs of the human chromosome 3.
</P>
<P>
They are confident the job will be finished by the end of March,
the scientists told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, an international program was initiated to decipher
human genomes, each containing 60,000-100,000 genes and some three
billion base-pairs, which determine the health and longevity of
the human being.
</P>
<P>
In September, Chinese scientists were admitted into the project
to work with their counterparts from the United States, Japan,
Germany, France and Britain. China has been the only developing
nation to participate in the project.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese scientists have been asked to decipher one percent
of the three billion base-pairs of human genomes.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Chinese scientists handed over their data from a
study on 14 million base-pairs to the international data bank of
genes so as to make their findings available to the world.
</P>
<P>
Some local experts said Chinese scientists who have been
sequencing genomes in a large scale show that China is capable of
protecting, developing and utilizing its unique biological
resources.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the chromosome 22 was deciphered by the
international research group.

<HEADLINE> Forbidden City Has Better Environment Than Downtown Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A year-long environmental
monitoring project indicates that the air quality inside the walls
of the Forbidden City, the former residence of ancient emperors,
is better than the average level in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The air quality in the 720,000-square meter city, also known as
the Palace Museum which attracts millions of worldwide visitors
every year, meets the state environmental requirements, experts
who were responsible for the monitoring work said here today.
</P>
<P>
"It parallels the air quality in adjacent suburbs and seems
much better than that in busy streets," said an expert from the
Palace Museum's science department.
</P>
<P>
As the largest complete structure in China remaining from
ancient times, the Forbidden City is circled by a 52 meter-wide
moat.
</P>
<P>
The researchers collected ten major pollutants, including
sulfides, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, chlorides, hydrocarbon
and total suspended particles, at five spots in the museum in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the pollutants were controlled under the state-
designated safety ceiling. However, the hydrocarbon level was
comparatively high because of long-term use of paint used for
museum repairs.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has worked diligently to fight against
urban pollution, especially focusing on key sites such as the
Palace Museum, which is included on the World Heritage list
released by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Tensions flared up between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Labor Party Secretary-General Ra'anan Cohen Wednesday after
Cohen announced the party would not petition to the High Court
against the fine imposed by State Comptroller Eliezer Goldberg for
its violation of campaign financing regulations.
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing the news, Barak, reportedly angry about the
decision, called Cohen to a meeting to complain and demand an
explanation.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Cohen quickly altered his position, saying
that he and the prime minister are both of the opinion that it is
necessary to soon amend the Campaign Finance Law.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Likud Chairman Ariel Sharon met Wednesday with Knesset
(parliament) member Dan Meridor and asked him to rejoin the Likud,
but Meridor's response was that "I'm in the Center Party."
</P>
<P>
Meridor quit the Likud approximately one year ago, against the
backdrop of strained relations with then Likud Chairman and Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
However, Sharon wishes to bring back to the Likud those senior
members who left the party on the eve of last year's general
elections, in order to strengthen both his personal standing and
the Likud.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel will recall its ambassador to Vienna for "an unlimited
period of time" if, as expected, Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom
Party joins the Austrian government, Barak and Foreign Minister
David Levy announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This measure, in itself an extreme move, should be seen as "
nothing but a first step," said a Foreign Ministry official, who
added that Israel will permanently remove its ambassador if Haider,
who has made remarks sympathetic to Adolf Hitler's regime, is
included in the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are to meet
Thursday afternoon at Erez checkpoint to discuss the troubled
permanent-status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
A top Palestinian negotiator said the leaders would come out of
the meeting with an official statement deferring the February 13
deadline for a framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel's security cabinet, meanwhile, approved the maps of the
next West Bank withdrawal Wednesday, paving the way for a
redeployment of 6.1 percent next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Once that withdrawal takes place, the interim agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians will have basically been fulfilled, and
the sides would be free to concentrate on the final-status
agreement.

spoiled the economic structure of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Keep Door of Change Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Thursday that the task of
governing Malaysia in the 21st century will have to take into
account the demands of a more educated and better informed
populace.
</P>
<P>
The growth of a knowledgeable society and the unfettered access
to information will open the people's mind to countless ideas,
ideologies and dogmas, he said at a luncheon in conjunction with
the one-day conference on "Malaysian Politics in the 21st Century"
here organized by the Malaysian Strategic Research Center.
</P>
<P>
"While we must always guard and insulate our society from modes
of thinking that can undermine our nation-building efforts, we
must be receptive to ideas which can strengthen the institutions
of governance," the deputy prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
To have a dynamic political structure underpinned by a living
constitution, he said, "we must always keep the doors of change
open."
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said governments were legitimized by the fiduciary
relationship, or trust, that it had with the people, and Malaysia
must strive to
find a stable equilibrium for this relationship in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian politics in the new century would have to continue to
grapple with the question of nation-building, he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said that one of the greatest threats
to the nation-building effort would come from exclusionary
political doctrines.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Send Monitors to Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan will send three
monitors to Sudan to verify the registration of the Ugandans
rescued from rebel captivity, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua on Thursday morning,
Director of Regional Cooperation in the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs James Boliba Baba said: "We are organizing three people
to go to Sudan. They are making preparations and will leave the
country as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of
Gender, Labor and Social Development as well as the President's
Office will provide one monitor each.
</P>
<P>
"These people will facilitate the return of Ugandans abducted
by the rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) who are
operating in southern Sudan," the official added.
</P>
<P>
The long process of documenting, screening, interviewing and
other technicalities may delay the return of the next batch of
Ugandans handed over to the United Nations Children's Fund in
Khartoum and Juba in southern Sudan. This team is to help the
U.N. agency do some of the technical work.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace accord signed between Sudan and Uganda in
Nairobi in last December, both countries should stop hostility
and release all prisoners of war. Uganda released the last batch
of Sudanese POWs in January and Sudan began to release abductees
held by the LRA rebels based in Juba.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has set free more than 100 Ugandan abductees. However,
thousands more are suspected to be held by the LRA rebels who
have enjoyed supplies from Sudan government troops.
</P>
<P>
In a recent press conference, Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni urged Sudan to release more abductees to show their
sincerity in implementing the Nairobi peace agreement and work
towards restoration of diplomatic relations severed since April
1995.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Ex-Mayor Back Home From U.S. Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Ex-mayor of Kampala, Uganda's
capital city, Nasser Sebaggala arrived home Wednesday evening
after serving a 15- month jail term in a United States prison for
bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
The ex-mayor, escorted by three U.S. policemen, arrived in the
country aboard Sabena Airlines at 8:15 p.m. and was warmly
received by his ecstatic supporters, the New Vision daily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala's return ended speculations in which his supporters
have long accused both the National Resistance Movement (NRM)
government and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
government of unnecessarily holding their man from coming back
home.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala, who was elected Mayor of Kampala in April of 1998
and arrested in the U.S. two months later for eight accounts of
bank fraud and falsifying Customs forms, was convicted in
November of that year and sentenced to a 15-month jail term,
depriving him of the mayorship under Ugandan laws.
</P>
<P>
His relatives have accused the government of not trying to
facilitate his return because he is a member of the Democratic
Party, one of key opposition parties to the ruling NRM headed by
President Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala stories hit headlines here and make him very popular
due to the reported delay in going through deportation
formalities.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour said that his government respects the rule of law, the
Guardian newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president of the semi-autonomous Zanzibar region in the
Indian Ocean off mainland Tanzania made the pledge when addressing
the treason case of 18 opposition activists.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the 18 activists of the opposition Civic United
Front party now on treason trial will be decided by the High
Court, said Amour, Salmin said.
</P>
<P>
The 18 defendants were arrested on charges that they conspired
to overthrow President Salmin Amour.  Four of the suspects are
members of Zanzibar's 50-seat Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Interfering with the proceedings of the treason trial would
amount to contempt of the court which must be respected as
provided for in the constitution, Salmin noted.
</P>
<P>
The government could not interfere with court proceedings, the
Zanzibar president told visiting British High Commissioner to
Tanzania Bruce Dinwiddy Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Salmin said opinions expressed by academics and the civil
society concerning the treason trial were welcome but they could
not hold water because the case was already under the court.

<HEADLINE> WFP Appeals for Aid for Hungry Kenyans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program has appealed to donors for 43.4 million U.S. dollars for
over two million Kenyans who need food aid after the dire effects
of drought in large parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
A new release available here Thursday from WFP said that the
money needed for 75,000 tons of food for 2.7 million Kenyans over
the next five months was in response to an appeal by the Kenyan
government in December.
</P>
<P>
WFP noted that the situation remains most critical in the
northern and eastern regions in Kenya where inhabitants are
suffering from the effects of three successive crop failures and
drought and flood.
</P>
<P>
The funds will also underwrite the expansion of WPF's
school-feeding program, raising the number of school children
currently fed from 257,000 to over one million in the
drought-stricken areas, WPF said.
</P>
<P>
Turkana District in northwestern Kenya is the worst hit area,
where over 50 percent population suffer severe food shortage and
malnutrition rates among children are rising.
</P>
<P>
"Families have lost either their corps or livestock year after
year," said Holdbrook Arthur, WFP Country Director for Kenya,
adding that "the food aid is critical to stop the situation from
getting worse, help families stay alive and keep hold of their
remaining cattle and food stock."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Faces Huge Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has suffered big
deficit in its foreign trade reaching 670 million U.S. dollars in
1998/99 fiscal year, the Monitor newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In 1997/98, Ethiopia's export revenues dropped from 4.2 billion
birr (one U.S. dollar equals 8.1 birr) to 3.5 billion birr while
imports grew from 8.1 billion birr to 8.9 billion, the state-run
Ethiopian Export Promotion Agency was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit was mainly due to falling global coffee
prices, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is the major foreign exchange earner for Ethiopia,
accounting for 63 percent of total foreign exchange income.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia earned 2.1 billion birr through coffee export in
1998/99.
</P>
<P>
To curb trade deficit, the Ethiopian government has pledged to
diversify the country's export market while implementing new
export strategy, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to officials, textile, leather and meat industries
will play a better role in the country's export.

White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said at a news briefing on

that this would increase or enhance the security of Taiwan, "we

entire East Asian region. Meanwhile, State Department spokesman

<HEADLINE> Taiwan-Related Bill Enhances Insecurity, Berger Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. National Security
Advisor Samuel Berger Wednesday discredited the Taiwan-related
legislation adopted by the House of Representatives for
erroneously formalizing U.S.-Taiwan relations, which he believes
would break up the "balance of peace" between the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"I think that this bill should be renamed the 'Taiwan
Insecurity Enhancement Act' rather than 'the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act'," Berger told a group of scholars and journalists
at a seminar held at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in
Washington D.C. Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States has enjoyed a good relationship
with Taiwan over the years, but "that has all taken place within
the construct of a one-China policy, in which our relationship
with Taiwan is unofficial, not official."
</P>
<P>
Berger billed the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which passed
the House with a 341-to-70 vote on Tuesday, as "a very risky
undertaking", since it would be for the first time to make the
military-to-military relationship between Washington and Taipei "
official and formal".
</P>
<P>
"It certainly does formalize the relationship, military-to-
military, and it is not necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the normalization of U.S.-Taiwan relations
would upset "the very delicate and successful balance" that has
existed for 25 years across the Taiwan Straits and has contributed
to peace, stability and growth both in Taiwan and China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
Berger warned that on the eve of an election in Taiwan -- a
time of great sensitivity -- the United States should not upset
the balance "that for 25 years has created stability and peace in
the island".
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that at this point enacting the law, which is
clearly directed at developing a more formal relationship,
formalizing the relationship, between the United States and Taiwan
can be anything other than increased danger," he said.
</P>
<P>
Berger attributed the adoption of the bill by the House to
insufficient debate as Congress just came back from its winter
recess.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the Clinton Administration now will have an
opportunity to conduct "a more deliberate conversation" with the
Senate, where the bill is to go under consideration.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we will be able to convince most senators that
we should not upset the delicate balance of peace, that we should
continue to maintain the one-China policy, we should continue to
insist upon a peaceful resolution of the dispute," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
"We ought not to upset that apple cart," he added.

<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed strong
opposition to the reported visit to Japan by Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui,
saying that it will have a serious political impact on Sino-
Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Lee's reported
visit to Japan, no matter what form or name it takes, will become
a serious political matter in the relations between China and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is firmly opposed to the visit, Zhu said
when answering a question at a press conference this afternoon
about Lee's reported visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
"We are highly concerned about such reports," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Japanese government will strictly abide by
its commitments on the Taiwan issue, and pay close attention to
the matter, and properly deal with it," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Steps up Goldmine Inspection in Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Gold Corps of the Chinese
People's Armed Police, the leading gold-mining operation in China,
is working hard to find gold resources in the country's
underdeveloped areas.
</P>
<P>
The move conforms with the State's strategy to develop the
poverty-stricken provinces in the remote western part of the
country, according to the headquarters of the corps.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, major breakthroughs were made in goldmine inspection
in these areas as high-quality goldmines were found in the Tibet
Autonomous Region, and Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces.
Meanwhile, some other new mining sites were also discovered in the
Xinjiang and Ningxia autonomous regions, and Yunnan and Qinghai
provinces.
</P>
<P>
This year, the specialized gold-mining wing of the armed police
plans to give priority to speeding up goldmine inspection in the
western areas, by increasing funds, introducing advanced
technology, dispatching more personnel and launching more projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A record-breaking 1.93 million
Chinese tourists traveled abroad in 1999, a jump of 60 percent
over the previous year, the Ministry of Public Security said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian nations, Russia, Australia, New Zealand are
among the major tourist destinations for China's growing legion of
tourists.
</P>
<P>
An official from the ministry attributed the rapid growth to
people's higher income resulting from the country's fast, healthy
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government also put Australia, New Zealand on its
official tourist destination list last year, which also encouraged
more Chinese tourists to take trips abroad.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Mainlanders Travel to Hong Kong, Macao in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of Chinese
mainlanders traveling to Hong Kong and Macao in 1999 jumped by
nearly 80 percent over the previous year to hit 774,000, the
Ministry of Public Security said here today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, which is responsible for approving related
procedures, attributed the sharp increase to the Chinese
government's move last year to boost the tourism industry in Hong
Kong and Macao by making it easier for more mainlanders to go
there.
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 376,000 Chinese mainlanders reportedly
traveled to see relatives in Hong Kong last year, and 10,000 went
to Macao.
</P>
<P>
And 82,000 and 25,000 Chinese mainlanders traveled to Hong Kong
and Macao respectively on business.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 50,000 residents in the mainland were allowed to settle
down in Hong Kong, while 2,214 relocated to Macao to become
residents.
</P>
<P>
About 92,000 people from the Chinese mainland went to Taiwan
for personal affairs during the past year, almost 40 percent more
than the year before.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 80,000 were visiting families, accounting for 87
percent of the total, and 1,892 moved permanently to the island
province.

<HEADLINE> Political Feature: Thai Policy Toward Myanmar  Refugees Backfires in Hostage Dramas (1) By Xu Haijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's first Armed Forces
Day in the new millennium on January 25 was greeted by a hostage
crisis in the western province of Ratchaburi where 10 Myanmar
ethnic Karen gunmen stormed a hospital and took some 500 people
hostage a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
After a 22-hour standoff, the drama was brought to an abrupt
end as elite Thai commandos stormed into the hospital, killing the
10 gunmen and rescuing all the hostages, before dawn broke for the
special day for Thai servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Applause and cheers were presented to the commandos and the
Thai government. An opinion poll showed that more than 70 percent
of Thai people backed the government's decisive action to bring an
end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The latest hostage drama ended, but the discussions about the
siege are far from over. In the past week, newspapers and
television programs put weight on the coverage of the aftermath of
the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
A little retrospect brought back Thai people's recent memory of
a similar incident last October when five heavily armed Myanmar
students seized their country's embassy in Bangkok, taking 38
people hostage and trapping dozens of others inside the embassy
compound.
</P>
<P>
Then, the hostages were freed unharmed, but only after the
students were given safe passage to the Thai-Myanmar border by the
Thai government.
</P>
<P>
The "success" of the five students apparently inspired the
Karen gunmen to storm the hospital in the first place.
</P>
<P>
In fact, two of the 10 gunmen killed by Thai commandos during
the action were students who launched the embassy siege.
</P>
<P>
The students, calling themselves "Vigorous Burmese Student
Warriors," were given shelter after fleeing to the Myanmar side of
the border by God's Army, a 100-strong Karen fringe group, to
which the hospital hostage takers belonged.
</P>
<P>
The two hostage crises in Thailand in less than four months
appeared to show that Thailand's lenient policy toward Myanmar
students and ethnic minorities has backfired, which is threatening
the country's national security, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar students and ethnic minorities living along the Thai-
Myanmar border have been two major obstacles to the further
development of bilateral relations between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has long been providing shelter for Myanmar students,
numbering at about 3,000.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government and the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees established refugee camps for the students, among
them the largest is called Maneeloy Holding Center in Ratchaburi
province, bordering Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
However, the camps and holding centers are not very well
managed and the control of the students is so lax that they could
leave freely and travel to Bangkok and other provinces to launch
demonstrations against the Myanmar government.
</P>
<P>
The five "Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors" were from the
Maneeloy Holding Center, which shelters about 1,500 Myanmar
students.

<HEADLINE> Political Feature: Thai Policy Toward Myanmar  Refugees Backfires in Hostage Dramas (2)  By Xu Haijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Myanmar's ethnic minorities, especially the Karens, are another
headache for the Thai government.
</P>
<P>
The Karens have been fighting the Myanmar government for more
than 50 years. Whenever there is a fighting between the government
troops and the Karen fighters, there will be a large number of
Karen refugees fleeing to the Thai side of the border, causing a
series of problems to Thailand and resulting in souring Thai-
Myanmar relations, observers said.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Myanmar government troops began a dry-season
campaign against the Karen armed guerrillas, causing heavy
casualties to the Karens, including the God's Army.
</P>
<P>
The Thai army also shelled the military base of God's Army and
tightened border control to prevent the fighting from spilling
over to Thai soil.
</P>
<P>
The cornered God's Army fighters therefore chose the radical
way to raise the world's attention to their conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to a famous Thai columnist, the hospital crisis in
Ratchaburi is a "disaster that was waiting to happen."
</P>
<P>
Suthichai Yoon said in The Nation newspaper that the real cause
of the crisis is "the culmination of the long history of the Thai
government's murky policy toward the armed minorities along the
border."
</P>
<P>
During the Cold War era, the Thai government had been
supporting the armed minorities so that a cushion area could be
formed between Thailand and its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Even now, the Thai government's policy over the armed
minorities remains ambivalent despite the end of the Cold War and
Myanmar's entry into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (
ASEAN), he said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai-Myanmar relations have experienced ups and downs in
the past months.
</P>
<P>
After the embassy siege, bilateral relations plummeted to rock
bottom as the Myanmar government, angered by the Thailand's
release of the students, closed its border with Thailand for two
months and shut out Thai fishing boats from its waters.
</P>
<P>
The fence was gradually mended especially after Thai Foreign
Minister Surin Pitsuwan's visit to Yangon last year.
</P>
<P>
The lethal action against the gunmen in the Ratchaburi hospital
is another catalyst for the warming Thai-Myanmar relations.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the crisis ended, the Myanmar government issued a
press release, saying it "commends the Thai government for its
decisive way in handling and protecting its citizens from the
perils of terrorism and making it a glaring example that under no
pretext of guise can terrorism be accepted."
</P>
<P>
The latest hostage crisis also raised another concern over
Thailand's national security.
</P>
<P>
Thai people are worried that the God's Army would take revenge
on the killing of their gunmen by launching more terrorist attacks
in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
After the hospital crisis, Ratchaburi province has received
several anonymous phone calls threatening bomb attacks. A group of
Thai soldiers patrolling the border in the same province were
attacked by unknown gunmen and several were seriously injured
after stepping on landmines.
</P>
<P>
As for the government, analysts said, the most urgent task is
to tighten the control of the 2,400-kilometer-long border with
Myanmar and to make sure the United Nations officials and heads of
state and government attending the U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD), to be held in Bangkok on February 12 to 19,
are safe and sound.
</P>
<P>
After the two hostage crises, the Thai government can not
afford another embarrassment especially during the UNCTAD meeting,
which Thailand has vowed to make a showcase of its achievements,
analysts said.

<HEADLINE> ADB Plans to Borrow 4.2 Bln Dollars in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Thursday that it will borrow 4.2 billion U.S. dollars
equivalent from the capital markets in 2000, compared to actual
borrowings of 5.2 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said in a press release that the lower borrowing
requirement for 2000 reflects the bank's robust liquidity position
at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
All borrowings will be used for loan disbursements and debt
redemption relating to its ordinary capital resource (OCR)
operations, said the ADB.
</P>
<P>
The ADB plans to raise 2 billion dollars through large global
and/or benchmark public bond issues in key currency debt markets,
said the release, adding that 1.2 billion dollars would likely be
raised through opportunistic financing and private placements.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said a further 1 billion dollars will focus on
benchmark public bond issues in regional debt markets, especially
where contributions to the development of local-currency domestic
bond market can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The borrowing program will be reviewed and possibly adjusted in
midyear depending on changes in OCR loan commitment and
disbursement projections, exchange rates and other factors
affecting ADB's funding requirement, said the release.

ISLAMABAD, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Almost 200,000 children up to
five years' age in Pakistan die annually by drinking impure water
which causes various diseases.
</P>

This was disclosed by District Health Officer Muhammad Anwar
Chaudhry at a recent workshop held with the cooperation of UNICEF

</P>

He warned this number could increase in the future if
unfavorable conditions were allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry said that the issue of provision of safe drinking
water in poverty-striken areas needed to be solved on war footing,
as stagnant water bred fatal diseases of liver and kidney, such as
hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
He urged parents and NGOs to create and spread awareness in
this regard, and play their role in preventing the untimely death
of countless children.

<HEADLINE> Zambian NGOs Urged to Cherish National Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has urged
two non- governmental organizations (NGOs) to work with it to
promote democracy for the interests of the nation, the Zambia
Daily Mail newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chief government spokesman and Information Minister Newstead
Zimba said here Wednesday that the Zambia Independent Media
Association and the Inter- Africa Network for Human Rights and
Development (AFRONET) are behaving like a shadow cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"Government accommodates dissenting views but these must be
channeled in a proper manner, in the interests of the nation,
above anything else," the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The warning came against a backdrop of tiffs between the NGOs
and the government.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government accusing the NGOs of pandering to the
whims of the donor community while the NGOs criticized many areas
of governance.
</P>
<P>
Zimba also accused donors supporting the NGOs of meddling in
the affairs of the government.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said his government is ready and willing
to work with "forward-looking and progressive NGOs" to develop the
southern African country.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Public Debt on Rise: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's public debt increased
by 500 million shillings (around seven million U.S. dollars) for
the first five months of the 1999-2000 fiscal year (from July to
November 1999), the Central Bank of Kenya said in the January 2000
issue of its monthly economic review.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the east African country's public debt
was 574. 8 billion shillings by the month of November 1999,
compared with 574.3 billion shillings at the end of last June.
</P>
<P>
The external debt is estimated at 5.6 billion dollars at the
end of November 1999, representing 73.1 percent of the public
debt, while 154.6 billion shillings for domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the debt increase to the servicing
obligations and budgetary financing requirements by the
government.
</P>
<P>
According to the Treasury and the central bank, the government
net debt service during the first five months of the 1999-2000
fiscal year declined to 208.2 million dollars from 331.3 million
dollars in the same period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The government overdraft at the central bank increased by one
billion shillings to 6.7 billion shillings, outstanding government
securities increased by 22.5 billion shillings to 155.8 billion
shillings and commercial bank advances to the government increased
from 2.7 billion shillings to 2.8 billion shillings.
</P>
<P>
However, the public debt represented 71.6 percent of Kenya's
gross domestic product (GDP) compared with 77.6 percent of GDP in
June 1999, the central bank noted.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Rebels Enlist Schoolchildren to Ease  Manpower Shortage: Rights Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan human rights group
has alleged that Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels
have been conscripting schoolchildren to ease the manpower
shortage in their separatist war.
</P>
<P>
The University Teachers for Human Rights in Jaffna said in its
latest information bulletin that the LTTE rebels need at least 2,
000 new recruits a year to maintain its members.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly the rebels have to recruit 30 percent or more of
those coming of age annually in schools, said the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The population under LTTE control, estimated at around 200,000,
is expected to sustain a LTTE fighting force of around 7,000 to 10,
000 against a 100,000-strong army sustained by a population of
more than 12 million people.
</P>
<P>
In recent months recruitment had been regularized as the LTTE
rebels lost a large number of fighters after bloody encounters
with government troops in the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Army's former Jaffna Commander Major General Sarath Munasinghe
said last week that the LTTE had lost nearly 1,200 cadres in their
fierce attacks on the strategically important Elephant Pass camp
near Jaffna since December 10 last year.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also showed that 10,581 LTTE rebels were
killed between April 1995 and July 1999.
</P>
<P>
In LTTE-controlled areas, the older schoolchildren have to
undergo compulsory physical training three days a week. They are
later forced to march with poles and later with guns, said the
human rights group.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Gives Upbeat Message of Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Thai economy has shown
increasing signs of recovery, with the baht stable, foreign
reserves increasing, exports strengthening and interest rates down
sharply, the Bangkok Post reported Thursday, quoting Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai.
</P>
<P>
Chuan told 63 top multinational executives at Wednesday's Board
of Investment CEO Forum that the recession has been one of the
most severe in Thailand's history, but there are increasing signs
of a recovery now.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand's international reserves at the end of last
year stood at 34.8 billion U.S. dollars, equivalent to 10 months's
imports, and inflation was below one percent last year, down from
8.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings rose by 7.4 percent compared with a fall of
nearly seven percent in 1998. The country's GDP grew by four
percent last year and was forecast to top four percent this year.
</P>
<P>
"The glimmering rays of our tropical sun have indeed started to
shine through once again," Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai prime minister also said his government was committed
to a free market and transparent policies, adding that the new
constitution passed in 1997 enshrined an economy based on market
forces while ensuring fair competition, protecting consumers and
preventing direct and indirect monopolies.
</P>
<P>
Chuan urged the executives to help develop and support
improvements in Thailand's production technology and management.
</P>
<P>
He said industrial restructuring was under way in Thailand to
increase production while moving from the manufacture of low-cost
goods and services to value-added ones in areas including the
agribusiness, automotive, electronics and tourism industries.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Wants to Make Air Quality a National  Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangkok Metropolitan
Administration has urged the central government to make air
quality management in the capital a priority in efforts to slash
pollution levels, the Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Governor Bhichit Rattakul has proposed six pollution
control measures to the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The measures include making air quality management a priority
item under the environment plan in the ninth National Economic and
Social Development Plan and ordering the Finance Ministry to give
precedence to the issue in its major investment policy.
</P>
<P>
The governor also asks for banning the import and distribution
of two-stroke engine lubricants which are high burning, and
banning the manufacture of two-stroke motorcycle engines this year.
</P>
<P>
He also asks for assigning the responsibility for monitoring
high exhaust emission vehicles to the National Police Bureau and
setting up a joint operation plan between the police and the
metropolitan administration.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok is preparing for its declaration as a "model city in
Asia" for pollution control efforts. It was ranked the 13th best
city in Asia by Asiaweek magazine, an improvement on 26th in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Reduce Troops in East Timor: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will reduce its troops
in East Timor from the current 1,500 to 950, Thai Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai told visiting East Timor leader Xanana Gusmao
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Government Spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart, Thailand
is expected to make the move after the United Nations force takes
over the peacekeeping mission in the territory from the
International Force in East Timor (INTERFET), in which Thai troops
participated.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Xanana, Chuan also agreed in principle
to East Timor's request of allowing a Thai military medical team
to stay longer in the territory, given a U.N. approval.
</P>
<P>
The Thai prime minister also said that his country was willing
to extend assistance to East Timor in the reconstruction of the
former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
Xanana thanked Thailand for its support and aid, especially for
the presence of Thai troops in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Through their presence and their good relations with the local
population, East Timorese people have learned that Thailand is
country which has close ties with East Timor, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xanana and his six-member delegation including Jose Ramos-Horta,
a Nobel Peace Prize winner and the de facto foreign minister, is
on a six-nation Asian tour, which has already brought him to China,
South Korea and Singapore and will also take him to the
Philippines and Malaysia after Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Thailand on Tuesday and will leave for the
Philippines on Friday.

<HEADLINE> 160,000 Sri Lankans Get Foreign Employment in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Bureau of Foreign
Employment (SLBFE) said Thursday that 160,000 local people had
left the island for foreign employment in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A SLBFE spokesman said that over 77,500 went as housemaids and
others left for various other employment categories such as
clerical work, supervisory and labor work in garment factories and
other industrial establishments.
</P>
<P>
He said 983 local professionals had also obtained employment
abroad last year, serving as doctors, engineers, accountants,
computer programmers, nurses and qualified teachers.
</P>
<P>
Of these professionals, nearly 70 percent are employed in the
Middle East countries while the others had obtained jobs in Asian,
African and Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Most of Sri Lankans seeking employment abroad have themselves
channeled through the bureau as they are offered a number of
benefits and other facilities such as free air tickets and medical
facilities, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In addition family members of those overseas workers are given
priority in obtaining loans from state banks and are issued
special insurance cover.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tea Production Hits Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The increase came mainly from high growns which rose to 81
million kilograms from 77 million kilograms in 1998, said the
board.
</P>
<P>
Production of low growns, which make up more than half the crop,
fell last year to 149 million kilograms from 150 million kilograms,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Tea brokers Asia Siyaka Commodities said Sri Lankan teas have
been reaching record levels since 1994 when only 242 million
kilograms were produced.
</P>
<P>
"There is a 17 percent increase during the six-year period,"
the brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The brokers have predicted another record crop this year as
well.
</P>
<P>
They said the production for this year is expected to reach
between 288 and 292 million kilograms due to continual improvement
of agricultural practices and inputs by the corporate sector.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Destroys Illegal Firecrackers Before Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 200,000 yuan-worth of
illegal firecrackers were destroyed recently in Beijing in a move
to keep the city and its residents safe during the Chinese New
Year, which falls on Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
Beijing kicked off its ban on firecrackers on December 1, 1993,
hoping to protect the people who like to use them as well as the
local environment.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, however, there has been an increase in
the number of people using firecrackers as part of their
celebration of the Spring Festival, the most important holiday in
China.
</P>
<P>
More than 215 people were injured by firecrackers during the
1999 Spring Festival, 17 more than in 1998. Fireworks were also
responsible for 278 fires, 3.7 times the number of 1994. Five
people reported blindness caused by the exploding fireworks.
</P>
<P>
According to the city's public security department, Beijing has
uncovered 48 cases involving illegal transportation and sale of
firecrackers since last Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Firecrackers valued at 200,000 yuan were seized. Most came from
neighboring Hebei Province.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Signs Air Services Arrangement With Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said today it has signed
an air services arrangement with the General Administration of
Civil Aviation of China in a bid to promote their operations in
air services.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement, which was signed Wednesday in Beijing, grants
airlines of both sides equal opportunity to operate scheduled
services.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement also provides for ample capacity for airlines
of both sides to increase services to meet the traffic demand of
the market.
</P>
<P>
The regular charter services operated by airlines will be
converted to scheduled services. Passengers, shippers, the tourist
sector and the cargo industry will all benefit from the
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
"Economic, trade, tourism and other links between Hong Kong and
the mainland have been increasing since July 1997. The demand for
air services between Hong Kong and the mainland is very strong and
growing steadily. The conclusion of the arrangement is very
important to the development of air services between the two
places," said Stephen Ip, secretary for economic services of HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
"It will also help to strengthen our linkages and cooperation
in various sectors and promote the economic development of both
Hong Kong and the mainland," added Ip.
</P>
<P>
At present, a total of seven airlines operate scheduled and
regular charter services, providing some 400 services per week
between Hong Kong and about 40 cities in the mainland. The seven
airlines are Dragonair, Air China, China Southern, China Southwest,
China Northern, China Eastern and China Northwest.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Administration Opposes Taiwan Security Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration has
threatened to veto a bill approved by the House of Representatives
on Tuesday calling for enhanced security cooperation between
Washington and Taipei.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said at a news briefing on
Wednesday that although the proponents of the legislation argue
that this would increase or enhance the security of Taiwan, "we
believe just the opposite."
</P>
<P>
He said that the bill would decrease rather than enhance Taiwan
security and the stability of the entire East Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James Foley also said
that the legislation "would seriously diminish Taiwan security and
undermine overall U.S. objectives of stability in Asia."
</P>
<P>
While putting out a veto threat, Foley promised to work hard to
persuade the Congress not to enact the bill into law.
</P>
<P>
National security spokesman David Leavy said at the White House
that the bill "would decrease rather than enhance Taiwan security
and risk the stability of the entire East Asian region."
</P>
<P>
If it is adopted by the Congress in its current form, he added,
"the president's senior advisers would recommend that he veto it."
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act has aroused utmost
indignation among the Chinese people. The Chinese government has
lodged solemn representations on the House move, calling it "a
serious encroachment on China's sovereignty, a gross interference
in China's internal affairs, and an attempt to make 'one China,
One Taiwan', or 'Two Chinas'."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Internet Retailer Posts Wider Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Amazon.com posted a larger-
than-expected loss in its fourth quarter Wednesday, but said its U.
S. book business turned a profit.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-based U.S. Internet retailer posted a pro forma net
loss of 185 million U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter. Its net
sales for the quarter totaled 676 million dollars, up from 253
million dollars for the same quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Customer accounts increased by 3.8 million during the quarter
to more than 16.9 million, said the company, adding that repeat
customer orders represented 73 percent of its orders.
</P>
<P>
The online retailer said that its fourth-quarter operating loss
was at the high point and would come down throughout 2000.
</P>
<P>
Amazon's U.S. book business generated 317 million dollars in
revenue for the quarter, up 66 percent from the previous year. But
the company did not state a figure for the bottom line, nor did it
explain how the business became profitable.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of last year, Amazon launched its toys,
consumer electronics, home improvement and software stores. But
some products of these categories were sold for less than cost.
</P>
<P>
One area where Amazon has shown marked improvement is in its
auctions launched last year. The combined number of registered
users for Amazon's auction sites surpassed one million, and total
number of items listed on those sites reached 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
The company launched a flurry of new stores last year and
expanded its distribution network to handle all of its new
products. Despite consecutive losses, the company said that it
will continue to expand in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the company said that it will add health and
beauty products and home furnishings to its site. Although no more
distribution centers will be added in the United States this year,
the company said that it has plans to continue expansion overseas.

JAKARTA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net foreign
exchange reserves increased by 361 million U.S. dollars to 17.06
billion dollars in the week ending January 31, from 16.7 billion
dollars a week earlier, the Jakarta Post reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mostly due to disbursement of the World Bank's

<HEADLINE> Minister Says Defending Sovereignty Tops Yugoslavia's Foreign Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Defending the state
sovereignty and territorial integrity is the top priority of
Yugoslavia's foreign policies, Foreign Minister Vladislav
Jovanovic reiterated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to anti-fascist veterans on the current
international situation, he noted that since the U.S.-led NATO
stopped air strikes on Yugoslavia last June, it has continued to
exert pressure on this sovereign state in political, economic and
public opinion fields.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the Yugoslav people will withstand
the pressure so long as they are united as one, rely on their own
efforts in reconstruction and cooperate with all countries that
respect the sovereignty of Yugoslavia on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic also said that the U.S. has always advocated to
establish a uni-polar world under its hegemonism and power
politics, but more and more countries have realized the harm it
will bring to mankind and become firmer in the belief of a multi-
polar world on the basis of equal and democratic international
relationship.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Researchers Date Origin of Human AIDS to 1930 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. researchers said on
Wednesday that the first group of people that may have been
infected with the AIDS virus occurred around the year 1930.
</P>
<P>
At the seventh Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic
Infections in San Francisco this week, Bette Korber and colleagues
at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico reported the
above finding.
</P>
<P>
They assumed that the genetic changes or mutations in HIV-1,
the most common type among AIDS viruses, take place at a constant
rate. Then they used a supercomputer to calculate the mutations
found in the virus and estimate when it would have jumped from
chimpanzees to humans.
</P>
<P>
Korber and colleagues traced the epidemic back to a small group
of infected humans around 1930.
</P>
<P>
It is important to establish the onset of the AIDS epidemic in
understanding the possible routes and circumstances of animal-to-
human transmission, Korber's team said,
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that HIV-1's ancestor is a virus that
ordinarily infects chimpanzees. Somehow it spread to people in
west tropical Africa.

LOS ANGELES, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales of interactive
console and PC games in the United States reached a new high with
7.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, according to figures released
Wednesday by PC Data.

This represented a 20.7 percent increase over 1998 with most of
the growth coming in the videogame market, the U.S. market
research firm said.
</P>

PC Data breaks up the industry into console video game software
and hardware, and PC game software. Of the three segments, sales
of console video game software were 3.75 billion dollars and
accounted for half of the industry's total revenues.
</P>
<P>
The Sony Playstation remained the dominant console platform and
accounted for 47.4 percent of all video game hardware and software
units sold and 43.2 percent of revenues.

<HEADLINE> Light Winds Force Postponement of America's Cup Tiebreaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A tiebreaker in the
challenger finals of the America's Cup yachting race was called
off on Thursday because of light winds.
</P>
<P>
Race director Vince Cooke postponed for 24 hours the seventh
race in the best-of-9 series, which is to decide whether
AmericaOne or Italy's Prada will take on New Zealand in a best-of-
9 regatta for yachting's most coveted trophy, which is set to
start on February 19.
</P>
<P>
The decision to cancel the day's race came after over an hour
waiting for the breeze to pick up.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules for the challenger series, races won't start
until there is a continuous breeze of at least five knots.
</P>
<P>
The wind speed was some four knots at the scheduled starting
time and it dropped to only two knots during the waiting hour
before the postponement was announced.
</P>
<P>
AmericaOne and Prada are tied 3-3 in the finals after the U.S.
recovered a 3-1 deficit for a strong show in the last two races.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's delay is the third in nine days because of weather
conditions on Auckland's Hauraki Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Germany Says Austrian Far-Right Coalition Dangerous for Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Germany said Wednesday it is
concerned about the political developments in Austria and will
join other European Union members to isolate the country if the
far-right Freedom Party enters the government.
</P>
<P>
The German Foreign Ministry said an Austrian government
including Joerg Haider's Freedom Party would constitute a danger
for the process of the European integration.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer urged leader of the
Austrian People's Party Wolfgang Schuessel not to form a coalition
government with the Freedom Party. Otherwise, he warned, Germany
will share the European Union's stance to isolate Austria.
</P>
<P>
Claudia Roth, chairman of the parliament's human rights
commission, speaking on Berlin-based German Radio, asked the
European Commission to examine the intents of the new Austrian
coalition to see if it obeys the EU law and to what extent in
order to decide whether to revoke its EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Paul Spiegel, new chairman of the German Jewish Central Council,
told a radio station in Munich that all Jews are concerned about
the political development in Austria, saying that now only the EU
has the power to exert pressure upon Austria.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Austrian People's Party reached a deal with the
Freedom Party to form a coalition government. Austria's 14
partners in the European Union (EU) threatened to cut off official
bilateral contacts.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Are Partners But Disagree on Chechnya, ABM: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin said here Wednesday that Russia sees the United
States as a partner, but disagrees with U.S. views on Chechnya and
the ABM.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with visiting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Putin said the relationship between Russia and
the United States is of a "global character" and Russia views the
U.S. as a partner.
</P>
<P>
However, Putin said the Russian-U.S. relations have experienced
ebbs and flows over the past 18 months. "We have been under
certain pressure from the U.S. administration over the operation
in the North Caucasus lately," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In a later briefing, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
the two sides paid great attention to the disarmament problem and
discussed the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty as well as the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty-2 (START-2).
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Russia views major changes in the ABM treaty as
unnecessary and favors armament cuts to be written into the future
START-3. "We will work towards ratification of START-2 by the
State Duma".
</P>
<P>
The three-hour talks continued behind closed doors. Ivanov
called the meeting "very frank, benevolent and constructive
despite certain natural differences between the sides."
</P>
<P>
The meeting confirms "a special significance attached to the
Russian-U.S. relationship that is bound to play a key role in the
21st century," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The role of Russia and the United States in the non-
proliferation of nuclear weapons was another item on the agenda,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Albright also discussed bilateral trade and economic
relations. Russia noted the readiness of the U.S. administration
to make the Russian market more attractive to foreign investors,
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Albright praised the outcome of the Moscow conference
on the Middle East held on Tuesday. The conference was another
confirmation of the abilities of Moscow and Washington to serve as
co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Putin told Albright in details Russia's measures in
the North Caucasus and stressed that the Russian leadership "is
open to a search for a political settlement."
</P>
<P>
In addition, Moscow plans to pay more attention to the
humanitarian problems in Chechnya and the whole Northern Caucasus,
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"A policy of double standards applied to conflicts in various
parts of the world has always existed and will remain," said
Ivanov, calling for joint efforts to abandon such practices.
</P>
<P>
At the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Foreign Ministry on
Wednesday, Albright also set a positive value on her talks with
Putin.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Russia have enough common interests to
overcome their differences and to meet the greatest challenges
together, she said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Russia continue to disagree over Chechnya,
Albright admitted, describing Russia's military operation in
Chechnya as "riding a tiger."
</P>
<P>
She said Putin reaffirmed to her that Russia is fighting
terrorism in Chechnya, which is threatening the regional stability.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Moscow on Monday to attend the ministerial
conference of 15 countries on the Middle East peace progress.
</P>
<P>
She wound up her three-day trip here and left for Zagreb late
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Austrians Demonstrate Against Far-Rightists' Bid to Enter Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people demonstrated
in Vienna Wednesday against the coalition between the Austrian
People's Party (OEVP) and the ultra-right Austrian Freedom Party (
FPOE).
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators, waving banners and shouting slogans, gathered
outside OVEP's headquarters in the afternoon, calling for the
resignation of Wolfgang Schuessel, chairman of OEVP and accusing
OEVP for dragging Austria into the biggest crisis since 1945 by
racism.
</P>
<P>
They then moved to the presidential palace and stayed until 7:
30 pm (1800 GMT). Demonstration organizers said that they would
continue to do the same in the following two weeks.
</P>
<P>
A group of demonstrators Tuesday occupied the OEVP headquarters
in protest and remained there till Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After the October 3 election, the Social Democratic Party, the
largest party in parliament, failed to form a cabinet. The OEVP
afterwards negotiated with the FPOE, the second largest party for
a coalition.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-right FPOE stands for expelling all foreigners from
Austria. Its leader Joerg Haider is an ultra rightist.
</P>
<P>
On Monday the European Union warned that it would impose
sanction against Austria if the FPOE enters the government. The
United States and Israel did the same while Belgium decided on
Wednesday to freeze contacts with Austria.

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty Commuted for Former Guatemalan Paramilitiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Three former Guatemalan
paramilitiamen on massacre charges had their death penalty
commuted to 50 years in prison on Wednesday for lack of direct
evidence, an official report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The three men, identified as Fermin Lajuj, Pedro Gonzalez Gomez
and Carlos Chen, of the now dissolved Civilian Self-Defense
Patrols, were accused of participating in the killing of 70 women
and 107 children in two towns in Baja Verapaz, Guatemala, on March
13, 1982.
</P>
<P>
They had been sentenced to death through lethal injection at
the first trial in 1998 and the second in October last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Court of Appeals commuted that sentence on the
ground of lack of evidence. "According to penal law, death penalty
cannot be given without solid evidence," Judge Carmen Ellguter
said.
</P>
<P>
In Guatemala, the maximum jail term is 50 years.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Sports Council to Closely Watch Badminton Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Olympics
Committee (KONI) is to keep a close eye on the badminton team for
its training progress since the sport -- compared to others -- is
regarded to be Indonesia's best medal prospect at the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"All disciplines will of course get the same attention, but our
biggest chance of bringing home medals hinges on badminton," Arie
Sudewo, the chief of the nationaltraining camp, was quoted by
Thursday's newspaper The Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
"So, I think, it is still impartial if we pay more attention to
badminton than other sports," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia plans to compete in 10 disciplines in Sydney. The
athletes have now begun centralized training since early this
month.
</P>
<P>
The other sports are weightlifting, track and field, archery,
swimming, windsurfing, taekwondo, judo, tennis and boxing.
</P>
<P>
Arie did not elaborate on what special treatment will be given
to badminton. He did however mention the importance of the
involvement of science and technology in the game.
</P>
<P>
According to Arie, by giving extra attention to the badminton
squa does not necessarily mean overlooking other teams.
</P>
<P>
"All deserve to be supervised, according to their own
specifications," Arie was quoted by the newspaper as saying.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Shuttlers Told Not to Let Down by Poor Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian shuttlers must not
let faltering performance discourage them, especially with the
recent poor performance by the women players.
</P>
<P>
Motivator Andrie Wongso said in a meeting with the Thomas and
Uber Cups teams on Wednesday that Indonesia used to be known as a
power in badminton but the image was declining recently,
especially with the absence of Susi Susanti and Mia Audina.
</P>
<P>
"You must prove to other countries' shuttlers that you can
contribute a great achievement to Indonesia, especially with the
worsening situation here. You must be able to refute every
prediction saying that the Uber Cup team cannot bring back home
the trophy," he was quoted by Thursday's Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The women shuttlers' failures in the last two tournaments, the
South Korea and Chinese Taipei Opens, is no longer a problem. The
most embarrassing thing is when you don't have motivation to win
and don't understand at all about motivati
on," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Women's doubles specialist Elysa Nathanael said that she hoped
Indonesia could repeat the successes of 1994 and 1996 when the
team brought home the trophy despite being underestimated by most
people.
</P>
<P>
"At that moment, we were at the lowest point with our
international performance, but we had motivation and good teamwork
to make our dreams come true. I ask you friends to repeat that
moment, to prepare yourselves better for the Uber Cup
qualifications in New Delhi this month," she said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, competing in the same group with Chinese Taipei and
Hong Kong, will compete in the qualifications from February 16 to
20.
</P>
<P>
The Uber Cup team consists of Cindana Hartono, Lidya
Djaelawidjaja,Ellen Angelina, Niniek Masrikah, Elysa, Deyana
Lomban, Etty Tantri and Cynthia Tuwankotta.
</P>
<P>
The Thomas and Uber Cups teams' training executive director
Sumaryono said he was optimistic that the Uber Cup team would be
able to qualify for the final in Kuala Lumpur in May.
</P>
<P>
"Having a meeting on motivation like today's (Wednesday) helps
the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) to motivate athletes
to reach their best in important moments," he said.
</P>
<P>
PBSI has set targets this year to qualify for the Uber Cup
final this month, earn titles in the All England in March, retain
the Thomas Cup and bring home the Uber Cup in May and win gold
medals in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney this September.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Takes Measures to Ensure A Peaceful Holiday: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Public Security authorities
stepped up crackdown on crimes and warned people to be more
careful as the Chinese lunar New Year, Spring Festival, approaches,
China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Beijing police seized members of two out-of-town gangs recently.
One of them stole 350,000 yuan (about 42,000 U.S. dollars) worth
of goods. The other gang carried out at least one robbery.
</P>
<P>
Police in the Chinese capital, also stepped up fight against
auto thefts and performed massive education programs among farmer
workers before they return to their hometowns for family reunion.
</P>
<P>
Han Jinxing, a police officer from the Beijing Public Security
Bureau, said that police will increase the number of patrols along
streets before and during the Spring Festival, which this year
falls on February 57.
</P>
<P>

BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Internet companies are
offering varieties on-line services to cater people's holiday
needs during the traditional Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
China's biggest on-line retailer 8848.net is presenting all
kinds of holiday goods ranging from flowers to mobile phone, China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, the English newspaper noted that foreign-based
Internet providers seem less interested in the festival. The Yahoo
Chinese website attached nearly nothing about the Chinese Spring
Festival, which falls on February 5 this year.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China's Internet provider eachnet.com is
conducting an on-line bid for a dinner cooked by famous chefs.
</P>
<P>
Major Chinese sites like Sina.com, Sohu.com and Netease.com are
offering a variety of discounted items for the estimated 100,000
on-line consumers in China.
</P>
<P>
Seas of on-line parties or chat rooms are entertaining Chinese
Internet users who throng to the web during the 7-day holiday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese websites are using snappy slogans and bright visuals to
attract newcomers during the public holiday. Brilliant red colors
and flying dragons on homepages remind people of the coming year
of the dragon.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.S. Fed Move Unlikely to Shake Asia  By Chen Hegao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve raised
its short-term rates again by 25 basis points Wednesday to cool
the economy, but the move is unlikely to have knock-on effects on
Asia, which is recovering quickly from a regional financial crisis,
analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
Under the shadow of the rate rise in the past week, the U.S.
and European markets experienced ups and downs. However, in Asia,
most markets were relatively calm.
</P>
<P>
Although the Fed move is a big test of Asia's flexible exchange
systems, its huge current account surplus and steady growth will
help markets in the region escape the negative effects of the U.S.
rate rise, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, any U.S. rate rise could affect the stability of
Asian currencies which were pegged to the U.S. dollar, and Asian
countries would have to raise their rates accordingly.
</P>
<P>
But now Asia is in a different situation. As most Asian
countries abandoned their pegs to the U.S. dollar in 1997 when the
regional crisis broke out, their currencies are now able to bear
the brunt of the adjustments of U.S. rate rises.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for Asian countries to maintain stable rates is
that they have been reluctantly to let their currencies appreciate
further.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, local economists said the country's monetary
authority will chart a steady interest rate policy in the early
months of this year to boost weak loan growth and temper the
already strong Singapore dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore's interest rates will not go up too high. They
should hover around current levels because the Singapore dollar is
still strong and overall export performance is good," said Chua
Piang Sze, economist at Vickers Ballas.
</P>
<P>
In other Asian countries, such as South Korea and Thailand, the
governments are trying to prevent their currencies from rising
further for fear that strong currencies will dent their export
competitiveness and stall their economies' recoveries.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of the Philippines said it would maintain a
low interest rate environment for as long as domestic and external
development would allow it.
</P>
<P>
"If U.S. Fed rate goes up and local inflation and peso are also
going up, then we have no choice but to allow interest rates to go
up," said Central Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura.
</P>
<P>
But he said that as much as the central bank can afford it, it
"will try to keep it low."
</P>
<P>
Late last month, despite the pressure of a U.S. rate rise, the
Philippine central bank lowered its overnight lending rates to 11
percent from 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts still fear that Asia's positive
fundamentals and flexible exchange rates may not be enough to
counter the negative impact of the U.S. Fed move.
</P>
<P>
They said that if the rate rise shakes the U.S. equity market
and affects Asia, the flow of capital will start shifting out of
Asia and drive up the interest rates in the region.
</P>
<P>
But other economists said the U.S. rate rise had been so widely
expected that the U.S. stock market would probably not react badly,
thus helping keep Asian markets calm.
</P>
<P>
They said that even a slowing U.S. economy may not cripple the
export boom in Asia because overall U.S. demand for electronics
will remain strong.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the restructuring and upgrading of information
technology in the United States and Europe will make electronics
the last area to be cut back. Therefore, the rate rise is unlikely
to slow the economy to the extent that will hurt Asian exports of
electronics in the coming months, experts said.
</P>
<P>
While the Fed move may rock the world markets in the days ahead,
the reactions will not last too long, especially in Asia, they
added.

BRASILIA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Common Market (
Mercosur) is trying to expand export to other markets because
trade within the bloc has already become saturated, Brazil's
ambassador extraordinary to Mercosur Jose Botafogo Goncalves said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official highlighted that it is necessary for Mercosur to
cut the cost of production. The more costs are cut, the more
successful an associate bloc will be in exporting to other markets
and financing the development of a specific region.
</P>
<P>
Botafogo added that another priority for strengthening
Mercosur is to insure a free trade agreement with countries of the
Andean Pact, which includes the countries of Ecuador, Peru,
Colombia and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, with Bolivia and Chile as associate members, is
composed of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Reaffirms Support for Colombian Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Cuba supports the
ongoing peace process between the Colombian government and the
country's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC), Cuban Vice-Foreign Minister Jose Bolanos said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bolanos said the Colombian peace process is showing encouraging
signs for eventual success, and Cuba will continue to offer
impetus to the process after hosting two meetings between
representatives of the Colombian government and the second biggest
rebel group, the Army of National Liberation (ELN).
</P>
<P>
The official led a Cuban delegation for talks on bilateral
cooperation with his Colombian counterpart Clemencia Forero.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, which ended Wednesday, the two sides
discussed ways to strengthen bilateral cooperation on anti-drug
efforts, public health, tourism, education, immigration as well as
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"One of the questions we have taken on is the confirming of an
accord between Cuba and Colombia for the fight against drug
trafficking, agreed upon by presidents Fidel Castro and Andres
Pastrana and subject to approval by both congresses," Bolanos said.
</P>
<P>
The accord seeks to step up cooperation between the countries
in control of routes used by drug traffickers through Caribbean
zones.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says 500 Rebels Killed in Grozny in Last 2 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops killed up
to 500 rebels in the past two days of fighting for Chechen capital
of Grozny and stopped several attempts by militants to rip through
the federal trap, the Russian General Staff said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels incurred heavy losses after a large group of them
were surrounded under an overpass and caught in a crossfire by the
federal troops, said Colonel-General Valery Manilov, deputy chief
of the General Staff.
</P>
<P>
Manilov attributed the imbalance in the losses of the two sides
to the Russian troops' "having full initiative in their hands."
</P>
<P>
However, Chechen rebels are still struggling to break away from
Grozny by all means, the Inerfax news agency on Wednesday quoted
Colonel-General Viktor Kazantsev, Commander of the Russian
Combined Grouping in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
A rebel unit of up to 150 members made a strong escape attempt
Tuesday night. They ran into a minefield on the southern outskirts
of Grozny and about 70 of them were killed. "The remaining rebels
are staying in the area of Alkhan-kala and will be destroyed,"
Kazantsev said. The police are combing that district, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are around 2,000 rebels in Grozny and the figure was 7,
000-10,000 at the beginning of the anti-terrorist campaign, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chechen capital would be free from rebels in the
next few days since the federal army has controlled all strategic
points in the city.
</P>
<P>
Rebels in Grozny were ordered to demolish all apartment houses
and administrative buildings they had used in defense and to leave
the town in small groups, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez on Wednesday urged respect for the sovereign decisions of
his country, one day after his foreign minister slammed a top
ranking U.S. State Department official for "unfriendly" comments
on the Venezuelan government.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Saturday in the Madrid daily ABC, U.S.
Under-Secretary of State for Latin America Peter Romero was quoted
as saying that in Venezuela "you don't see a government operating,
only plebiscites, referendums, more elections."
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicent Rangel demanded an
explanation from the United States on Romero's remarks, which he
termed as "unfriendly" and "threatening."
</P>
<P>
Attending a wreath-laying ceremony at the grave of the national
hero Simon Bolivar, Chavez said his government, both "autonomous
and sovereign," obeys "only the command of the Venezuelan people."
</P>
<P>
"In this first year of government, one of our strategic lines ..
. has to do with consolidating the sovereignty," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said his country's foreign policy is of peace, cooperation
and the search of international justice, based on the sacred
principle of self determination of sovereign states.

STOCKHOLM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Finnish cross-country skiing
world champion Mika Myllyla seemed to be back in form when he won
a 10 km World Cup race in Trondheim, Norway, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was his first victory in a injury-plagued season.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Norwegian spectators cheered the Finn, who became

</P>
<P>
He won in a time of 24 minutes 53.3 seconds on Wednesday, 2.8
seconds ahead of Sweden's Per Elofsson and 9.9 seconds ahead of
Italy's Pietro Piller Cottrer.
</P>
<P>
Overall World Cup leader Thomas Alsgaard finished the race 13th,
which allowed Spain's Johann Muehlegg, the fifth finisher, to
close the gap on Alsgaard. The German-turn-Spanish is second and
just 14 points off the overall lead.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canadian Firm Launches Online Kits to Thwart Child Predators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Symantec Canada, an Internet
security company, launched a Missing Project on Wednesday to
hinder child predators.
</P>
<P>
The Toronto-based company said the Missing Project comes in the
form of an educational kit, which includes a computer game and a
workbook for teachers and parents to start a dialogue with their
children.
</P>
<P>
This interactive computer game will take the child through a
real life abduction scenario, where the parent, teacher and child
will be educated to protect themselves against Internet predators.
</P>
<P>
Over 18,000 Missing kits are being distributed to schools and
libraries across the country with the backing of the Mounted
Police Foundation, said the company in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Almost 800 children went missing in North America in 1998, when
child predators turned to Internet for victims. Internet
predators' easy targets are those aged 11 to 14 as the latter are
already able to use computers both at home and at school.

<HEADLINE> Ten NOC/Cities Submit Application to Host 2008 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of ten National Olympic
Committees and cities have submitted their applicationa to the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) to host the Games of the
XXIX Olympiad in 2008, the IOC announced in Lausanne on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ten cities, in alphabetical order, are: Bangkok (Thailand),
Beijing (China), Cairo (Egypt), Havana (Cuba), Istanbul (Turkey),
Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Osaka (Japan), Paris (France), Seville (
Spain) and Toronto (Canada).
</P>
<P>
National Olympic Committees (NOCs) had until midnight, 1
February, to notify the IOC that a city within their jurisdiction
was interested to apply.
</P>
<P>
The host city election procedure was radically overhauled
during the 110th IOC Session in December 1999. Interested cities
will have to go through a bid acceptance procedure that will
review their organizational capacity before accepting them as
candidates. This new system, currently being finalized by the IOC,
will be formally reviewed at the IOC Executive Board in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Full details will be given in Lausanne on 24 February. No city
will become a candidate until it is selected as such by the IOC
Executive Board later this year.
</P>
<P>
After being accepted as candidates, cities and their NOCs will
sign a contract. The candidates would then be required to submit
their candidature file and prepare for the visit of the IOC
Evaluation Commission. Individual visits by IOC members and vice
versa, will not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
The host city of the Games of the XXIX Olympiad in 2008 will be
elected in July 2001 in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> China Squashing Snakeheads: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) -- China captured more than 9,000
stowaways in foiling 1,300 illegal migration cases last year,
China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the frontier police also arrested more than 800
stowaway agents known as "snakeheads," according to the English-
language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of Frontier Administration Bureau of the
Ministry of Public Security Guo Xiqin was quoted as vowing to
strengthen its strike against illegal emigrations, including the
notorious snakeheads.
</P>
<P>
China has sentenced 105 of the snakeheads to prison. Guo said
that the police will continue to step up international cooperation
to hunt down snakeheads.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Canada, Japan and Australia are among main
destinations for stowaways, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
While pledging stricter petrol along borders and coastlines, he
asked the destination countries to repatriate any stowaway they
find.
</P>
<P>
"If most stowaways captured are allowed to stay, it is very
difficult to cool down others' desire to sneak into another
country illegally," Guo said.

<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- One late goal from Teddy
Sheringham gave Manchester United a 1-0 victory over Sheffield
Wednesday in a English Premier League match on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The defeat was another major blow for Wednesday, a side who
have spent most of the season rooted to the bottom of the league
but who had hoped for a vital point at Hillsborough.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday had the better of the early exchanges but then found
themselves up against the determined English and European
champions, who came close repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
Sheringham finally killed off the home side's hopes in the 74th
minute with a left-footed shot off a volleyed Ryan Giggs cross.
It was his third goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
United have 50 points, three more than Leeds United who have
now played the same number of matches.

<HEADLINE> Vialli Attacks Foreign Quota Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League soccer
club Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli has attacked the idea of
introducing a quota for non-EU players in the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association, the Premier League and the Football
League are concerned that homegrown talent is being stifled due to
the import of foreign players, in particular questioning the
standard of those brought in from non-European union countries.
</P>
<P>
They believe a quota system would restrict Premiership clubs to
importing only the best non-EU players.
</P>
<P>
But Vialli is adamant that restrictions would hinder English
clubs' chances of succeeding in European competitions.
</P>
<P>
"If you want to protect the English game and the English young
players then that might be the right thing to do," said Vialli.
</P>
<P>
"But if we want to compete when we play in Europe, there's no
way we can do that against the European clubs if we don't allow
continental players or non-EU players to join us. The other teams
would simply be too good for us."
</P>
<P>
The Chelsea manager also added that it is difficult for young
homegrown players to get a first team chance at Stamford Bridge
and that it is in their best interests to gain experience
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to do that at Chelsea unless you're really
special, so perhaps it's better to get experience somewhere else
and come back when you are a better player and then play regularly
in the team," he said.

<HEADLINE> English Football Bodies Call for Import "Quotas" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Football League, the FA Premier League and the Football
Association all demanded reform of the current work permit system
in evidence to the Commons Employment Select Committee.
</P>
<P>
Senior figures in the game, including England manager Kevin
Keegan, have recently voiced concern that foreign players may be
pushing out home grown talent.
</P>
<P>
Mike Foster, the FA Premier League secretary, told Members of
Parliment: "I think we are all agreed on this: the quota system is
our preferred way forward.
</P>
<P>
"We still feel it would be a better system than that that
exists at the moment."
</P>
<P>
The FA's head of competitions and regulation Graham Noakes,
also giving evidence, said: "One of the major advantages would be
a ceiling on the number of players that could come into the
country.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment there is no limit providing they (players) meet
the criteria as they stand."
</P>
<P>
He added: "We need to see a sufficient number of talented young
players come through in order to enhance the performance of the
England team on a world stage."
</P>
<P>
The cross-party committee is carrying out an investigation into
the current rules for work permits and their impact on the sport.
</P>
<P>
Although current Premiership rules prevent clubs fielding more
than three non-European Union players per game, clubs can sign
unlimited foreign players providing they meet the criteria for
work permits.

CAIRO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The first gas-powered car will come into use in Saudi
Arabia next March, El-Iktesadia daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The project to replace petrol with gas was adopted by the
Chambers of Commerce Council (CCC) in cooperation with the Saudi
ARMACO in order to reduce fuel costs and protect environment.
</P>
<P>
The experimental operation of the car will start at the Riyadh
premises of the CCC, said Munir Abdul-Hadi Bin-Tami, board member
of the CCC Transport Committee and an advocate of the idea.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- The Syrian-Jordanian Free Trade Zone will go into
operation next month, said Director General of the zone Hassan
Mer'e Al-Khairat.
</P>
<P>
Half of the zone will be based in Jordan's southeastern Dar'a
town and the other half in Syria, Al-Khairat was quoted on Thursday
by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two parts of the zone will be connected with highways and
linked to Syrian and Lebanese seaports and the Jordanian Aqaba
seaport with railways. It will also be connected with all the Arab
Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
Syria's exports volume to Jordan nose-dived from 140 million U.
S. dollars in 1996 to 40 million dollars in 1998 while its imports
from Jordan retreated from 57 million dollars to 21 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance tilted in favor of Syria by 413.7 million
liras (8.274 million dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- EgyptAir, Egypt's national air carrier, will be turned
into a holding company with a number of affiliating privatized
firms, said Minister of Transport Ibrahim el-Demiri.
</P>
<P>
The daily operations of EgyptAir will be undertaken by 16
affiliates that work in the areas of passenger transport, cargo,
maintenance, free markets, land services, depots, land transport,
travel and medicare.
</P>
<P>
The decision on separating Cairo International Airport (CIA)
from Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is a prelude to the formation
of the holding company and other CAA-run firms will operate
Egyptian airports except CIA, he added.
</P>
<P>
The CIA development plan was aimed at expanding the airport
capacity and raising its annual revenues to 1 billion Egyptian
pounds (289.9 million U.S. dollars), he noted.
</P>
<P>
The area of the airport that amounts to 1,500 feddans (630
hectares) will be covered with investment projects, the minister
pointed out, adding that a tourist complex including entertainment
and golf facilities will be launched on a plot of land of 50
feddans (21 hectares).
</P>
<P>
The plans for building a new airfield at CIA are ready. The
project will cost 3 billion U.S. dollars, el-Demiri added.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish mobile phone GSM network operator Turkcell has
signed an 850 million U.S. dollar deal with Ericsson to improve its
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Turkcell subscribers, numbering more than 5.7 million, will
enjoy up-to-date technology on the improved infrastructure,
allowing their access to the internet, interactive television,
video-conference,and personal multimedia systems.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israeli-Palestinian Talks Suffer Setback by Tan Xinmu, Qi Deliang, Lou Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Whether it was called a
serious crisis or a temporary dispute, the breakdown of a summit
between Israeli and Palestinian leaders Thursday constituted a
setback in the peace talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat ended a two-hour meeting
with no agreement on any of the issues discussed. Palestinian
officials declared that a major crisis had occurred, while the
Israeli side denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians were angered by what they called the Israeli
attempt to dictate the peace talks with no respect for its partner
in the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
One of the contentious issues was the overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank, which should have
taken place on January 20 under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum but
is now set for next week.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians accused Israel of failing to consult them
before deciding the areas involved. They had wanted Arab villages
surrounding Jerusalem, a holy city claimed by both sides, to be
included in the transfer, but Israel said no such areas would be
handed over at this stage.
</P>
<P>
This kind of dispute had delayed a previous stage of troop
withdrawal for seven weeks last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinians accused Israel of trying to postpone
the February 13 deadline for reaching a framework agreement on a
permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat pointed out after the
summit meeting that it was Barak himself who proposed the deadline
in the negotiations for the Sharm el Sheikh agreement signed last
September. He criticized Barak for conducting the talks at his own
will.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian anger sounds justifiable. They are the weaker
side in the negotiating table, with Israel controlling most of the
West Bank occupied in the 1967 Middle East war while the
Palestinians having few cards to play.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have made efforts to seize the opportunity
provided by the election victory of Barak last May to resolve the
decades-old conflicts between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
They made painful compromise in the negotiations, such as
accepting the Israeli proposal on revising the Wye agreement signed
in last October and postponing the declaration of an independent
Palestinian state. They certainly hope that the Israeli side would
reciprocate with the same spirit of partnership.
</P>
<P>
Besides, since Israel and Syria resumed peace talks last
December, the Palestinians have worried that their peace track
might be sidelined. They feared Barak would try to delay the
Palestinian talks in order to focus on the talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Although Barak declared that he would move ahead on both tracks,
all the signs indicated that he was giving priority to the talks
with Syria since he faces a self-imposed July deadline to pull
Israeli troops out of south Lebanon, which would require Syrian
consent.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians would certainly regard the latest disputes as
an evidence of the inequity.
</P>
<P>
For these reasons, the Palestinians pin their hopes on
Washington to pressure Israel to concentrate on the Palestinian
track. They proposed a Camp David-style summit, similar to the
Israeli-Egyptian talks prior to the 1979 peace treaty, to be under
close supervision of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
But sticking to its position that Washington should reduce its
role in the talks, Israel rejected the Palestinian idea. Foreign
Minister David Levy stressed after the summit that Israel would not
accept any outside intervention.
</P>
<P>
Such an attitude made the Palestinians worry that their track,
which has entered the final stage of a seven-year-long process,
would move on totally according to the Israeli pace, thus leaving
them with no say.
</P>
<P>
The latest dispute also came at an awkward time when the
Palestinian leadership body, the Palestinian Central Council, met
in Gaza to decide on future Palestinian statehood. Arafat faces
rising cry among the Palestinians to declare an independent state.
</P>
<P>
The Council decided Wednesday to postpone setting a date for the
declaration, partly in order to avoid derailing the peace process.
The disappointment over the impasse, however, might cement the
position of those who oppose the postponement.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the two sides did not sever contacts and the
intensive talks on the final-status issues launched Sunday would
continue next week. But the talks would not move forward if the two
sides could not rebuild mutual trust by showing a spirit of
partnership and readiness to listen to the other side.

JERUSALEM, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Staff and workers at all
Israeli airports began a general strike Thursday evening, bringing
the airport's operations in the whole country to a standstill,
Israel Airport Authority announced.
</P>
<P>
The staff and workers demand getting their increased bonus,

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects U.S. Allegation on Production of Unconventional Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Defense Ministry on
Thursday denied the allegation by the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) that Iran was manufacturing unconventional weapons
with the aid of a number of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the remarks made by the CIA head at the U.S. Congress
on Wednesday, the Iranian Defense Ministry spokesman Keyvan
Khosravi said the U.S. and Israel regime have not offered a single
piece of evidence to support their "unfounded allegations"
concerning Iran's defense activities.
</P>
<P>
He said that the allegation was only an unworkable plot by the
U.S. to distract international attention from the massive
participation of the Iranian people in the forthcoming
parliamentary elections on February 18.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, the CIA chief
claimed that Iran was manufacturing unconventional weapons with the
aid of a number of other countries.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the U.S. has repeatedly accused Iran of
trying to get access to weapons of mass destruction and imposed
sanctions on Iran on the pretext.
</P>
<P>
Khosravi said that the U.S. allegations and suggestions by
certain mass media affiliated to Israel were not new topics at all,
but had been aimed at misrepresenting Iran's commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
The unfounded ness of those suggestions is more than clear for
impartial observers of political and defense matters worldwide, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Iran's defense policy is to attain
self-sufficiency in conventional defense needs and Iran's defense
relations with other countries are also based on respect to all
internationally accepted norms and conventions.

peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 2000 session of the Committee on the Exercise of
the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, Annan said at
the outset of the millennium, there were real reasons for optimism
for the peace process in the Middle East: the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations were back on track and they were in fact in the midst
of a crucial phase, with the prospect of further progress in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
Annan commended Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestinian
Authority, and Mr. Ehud Barak, Prime Minister of Israel, for their
courage and their commitment to the cause of peace and
reconciliation, saying their work had rekindled the hopes that
peace, based on relevant Security Council resolutions, might be
within reach at last.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, however, indicated that the situation on the
ground was not without problems. "There is much anxiety among
Palestinians over the construction and expansion of settlements
and roads, and the impact this might have on the permanent status
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
He called on the parties concerned to preserve and build,
instead, on the fragile accomplishments of the peace process, and
to refrain from actions that might prejudice the outcome of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General also urged the parties not to lose sight
of the need for a just solution to the refugee questions. "Without
which peace and stability cannot take hold."

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Exports to Chile Up 26 Pct in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian exports to Chile grew 26
percent in 1999 and its imports from that country went up 6
percent, the Peruvian government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Peru sold to Chile 174 million dollars worth of commodities in
1999 and bought 283 million dollars worth of goods from that
country, said the government in a report published Thursday in the
press.
</P>
<P>
About the request of the Chilean businessmen to shorten the
time for the elimination of some customs tariffs, the report said
that the appropriate accord foresees such possibility.
</P>
<P>
The delegations of the two countries will analyze the theme in
February or March, when the accord administrating commission meets.
</P>
<P>
The governments of the two nations signed Wednesday an
agreement to promote and protect each other's investments, that
guarantees the free transference of payments, establishes
compensations and expropriations, and creates an arbitration
agency as a mechanism for the solution of controversies.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has an initial duration of 15 years, that can be
extended indefinitely at its maturity.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Talks of Setbacks in Mideast, N. Ireland Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Thursday attributed setbacks of the peace process both in the
Middle East and Northern Ireland to lack of love between neighbors
because of their different backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual National Congressional Prayer Breakfast,
Clinton called on people of different religions and ethnic
backgrounds to get along with each other.
</P>
<P>
"Our dazzling, modern world is witness to a resurgence of
society's oldest demon, the inability to love our closest
neighbors as ourselves if they look or worship differently from
the rest of us," the president said.
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East, talks between Israel and Syria are in
suspension as the two sides are at odds over the Syrian Territory
of Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967 Mideast war. And
Israel and the Palestinians have just ended their talks in a
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
"In the Middle East, with all its hope, we are still having to
work very hard to overcome the profoundest of suspicions between
Israeli Jews and Palestinians and Syria Arabs," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's peace process -- have been
plunged into crisis over Irish Republican Army's refusal to give
up its weapons. The lack of progress on weapons could lead to
London suspending Belfast's fledgling coalition government.
</P>
<P>
"Today, the Irish peace process is strained by a lack of trust
between Republican Catholics and Protestant Unionists," said
Clinton, who has taken an active role in the peace process there.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also mentioned the troubles in South Asia, saying it
was "perhaps the most dangerous place in the world today" due to
tension between India and Pakistan over the disputed Kashmir
region and a budding nuclear weapons race.

<HEADLINE> German President Apologizes for "Free Flight" Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 BERLIN, February 3 (Xinhua)--German President Johannes Rau
Thursday apologized for his personal usage of company jets, saying
he had "been unwise and made mistakes."
</P>
<P>
Rau, elected President last May, was reported to have accepted
free flights on board jets of Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) in
early 1990s, when he served as premier of North Rhine-Westphalia
state.
</P>
<P>
Disclosed after ex-Chancellor Helmut Kohl's secret donation
scandal, the "flight affair" has become the second major scandal
in recent German media. This time the image of ruling Social
Democrats (SPD) is dented, especially in populous and wealthy
North Rhine-Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Thursday's ARD television reportage, Rau said, "I
have nothing but apology for that."
</P>
<P>
"I should have kept distance with the WestLB, even the usage
of planes," said Rau. The WestLB, one of Germany's largest 10
banks, is partly held by the North Rhine-Westphalia state
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rau rejected the accusation that he had used WestLB
jets for private trips, "I have checked my diary and come to the
conclusion, that the accusation is not true."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he would stay in office albeit the "flight
scandal," Rau answered, "of course I will be glad to stay in
office, I was elected to that post, I will keep the post free of
suspicion."

<HEADLINE> American Continent's Finance Ministers Meeting Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Third Western
Hemisphere Finance Ministers Meeting was inaugurated Thursday in
the Mexican Caribbean resort city of Cancun.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 34 countries and multilateral organizations
such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was inaugurated by Mexican Finance and Public
Credit Minister Jose Angel Gurria, who defended the need of
advancing in the integration and cooperation processes to achieve
an overall economic development.
</P>
<P>
"The economic policy must expand the freedom of the individual,
promote social cohesion and support those who need assistance to
raise, with their own effort, their living standard," said Gurria
in his opening speech.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country has an open attitude and a clear
social commitment in its answer to the globalization process. "We
want to play an active role in this process, not to remain in the
sidelines," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has established an economic policy that conciliates the
efficiency that results from the market laws, with the social
responsibility that derives from the central goal of the State,
said the Mexican official.
</P>
<P>
That is why in Mexico the combat against inequality and poverty
is a moral imperative and at the same time an eminently practical
action, said Gurria.
</P>
<P>
An account of the American continent economic situation, the
efforts to combat poverty in the region and the integration of the
hemisphere economies will be made at this ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ministers of the American countries will discuss in Cancun,
Quintana Roo, southwest of Mexico City, the financial crimes,
especially money laundering, tax evasion, fiscal paradises, and
corruption.
</P>
<P>
They will also analyze the different banking regimes followed
in the continent, the management of public debt and the
participation of the private sector in the solution of the
financial crises.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM on His Visit to Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem Thursday stressed the importance of his current visit to
Greece, saying that one of the visit's purposes is to create a
proper environment for possible exchange of visits by ministers of
the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Athens airport, Cem, on an official
three-day visit, said that his visit is the first official one of
a Turkish foreign minister in the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Cem believed that the governments of the two countries
accomplished within the last six months more than in the last 40
years, adding that both countries are trying to catch up and make
up for the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Cem described the four bilateral agreements he signed with his
Greek counterpart George Papandreou in Ankara last month as "
substantial and crucial."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for the easing of strained bilateral
relations and the growing sense of security on both sides of the
eastern Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing can be more substantial than our two flags waved
together. Nothing can be more substantial than joint economic
cooperation already initiated. We shall work for the future
together," the Turkish minister said.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have closely gone to war
three times in the past 26 years over their territorial dispute in
the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem, but the two neighbors have
since last June begun to take positive steps to improve their
relations.
</P>
<P>
Late January, Papandreou paid an official three-day visit to
Turkey, the first by a Greek foreign ministry in 38 years, and
signed with Cem four agreements for bilateral cooperation on
tourism, investment security and the environment.
</P>
<P>
During Cem's visit here, he will also sign with Papandreou five
more bilateral cooperation agreements on science and technology,
economy education, sea transport as well as on avoiding customs
violations.

<HEADLINE> Russia Announces Killing of Hundreds of Chechen Rebels in Special Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 3 (Xinhua) -- A large group of rebels
numbering "several hundred" was destroyed at the Alkhan-Kala
village near the Chechen capital of Grozny during a carefully
planned operation by federal troops, announced the Russian command
in Chechnya Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the Western Grouping of the Russian Combined
Forces in North Caucasus General Vladimir Shamanov described this
triumph as "a little fragment of a huge operation coded "the Wolf
Hunt."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Russian ORT television station
Thursday evening, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said that
over 1,500 Chechen militants were killed in all during the well
worked-out operation.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Russian NTV television station
Thursday evening, Shamanov reported some details of the
accomplished operation.
</P>
<P>
According to the general, "the essence of this plan" was "to
create (among the rebels) the illusion of a corridor from Grozny,"
by which "the groups of Arbi Barayev (rebels' field commander)
were infiltrated."
</P>
<P>
"In agreement with the Federal Security Service and other
structures, an officer was assigned to get in touch with the
militants and promise the corridor for a lump sum of around 100,
000 dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, we did not expect bandits to swallow the bait, least
of all did we expect them to be in such a quantity," he admitted.
</P>
<P>
The federal command also confirmed the deaths of several
prominent Chechen field commanders, including Lecha Dudayev,
Khunkarpasha Israpilov, Turpal Atgeriyev and Aslambek Ismailov.
</P>
<P>
In a Thursday interview with ORT television, spokesman for the
federal headquarters in the North Caucasus Alexander Veklich said
that Shamil Basayev had lost a leg and been operated on by a
former Chechen health minister.
</P>
<P>
He denied reports of rebels breaking out of Grozny for Khankala,
saying federal troops conducted a planned operation there
Wednesday to lure the separatists out of the city so as to
minimize federal losses.
</P>
<P>
He said 60 rebels were killed and another 129 captured in the
operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the federal troops have been fighting Chechen rebels
in central Grozny over the past 24 hours, mostly near the cannery
and oil refinery, said the headquarters of the Russian combined
forces Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400 rebels surrendered in Grozny and about 60 rebels
were killed in the fighting, the headquarters said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican President Calls for Respect of Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Thursday urged political parties in the country to
respect the constitution and those institutions set up in
accordance with laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
He made the call at a rally to celebrate the Heroes' Day in
memory of the first president of the former Mozambique Liberation
Front Eduardo Mondlane, who was assassinated in the Tanzanian
capital Dar es Salaam on February 3, 1969.
</P>
<P>
The country can not be split, the president said, stressing
that the Mozambican people will neither tolerate any separatist
activity nor admit any co-existence of two regimes in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chissano was re-elected for another five-year term of office as
 president by winning a majority 52.29 percent of the total votes
during the general elections held between December 3 and 5 last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Mozambique Liberation Fronte (Frelimo)
won the parliamentary elections by securing 48.8 percent of the
total votes.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's main opposition party, the former rebel
movement Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo), refused to
accept the results, accusing Frelimo of malpractice in the general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Renamo Chairman Afonso Dhlakama on Tuesday even threatened to
proclaim a Renamo government later this month to rule the six
provinces where Renamo took a majority of the votes in the general
elections if his demands, either recount of votes or fresh
elections, are rejected.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian Government Urged to Achieve Balanced Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Centre for Policy Analysis
(CEPA) in Ghana has asked the government to ensure that the coming
budget is devoid of unnecessary loans in order to achieve a
balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
If this is not done, it will raise the country's indebtedness,
leading to excessive borrowing and therefore the postponement of
satisfying critical social needs.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joe L.S. Abbey, executive director of the centre, an
independent think-tank in the country, said this at a pre-budget
seminar organized jointly with the Institute of Economic and
Financial Journalists (IFEJ) in Ghana's capital Accra on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said: "There is , indeed, the need for us to incur debt
cautiously so that we can easily handle them, especially against
the background that we do not have a high degree of savings
culture in this country."
</P>
<P>
Abbey also urged the government to use aid wisely so that money
raised from other sources could be used for the maximum
development of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"In order to ensure real growth in the domestic market, we must
ensure high investment in that sector, and where these private
sector institutions are not able to raise their own funds,
government can come in to support them to raise the required
capital," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abbey expressed the belief that Ghana has the ability to manage
crisis it is facing through tough negotiations with donors and
Ghanaians.

NEW YORK, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose
Thursday as investors came back to the market a day after the
Federal Reserve raised interest rates to cool off the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 10.24 at 11,013.44.

Wednesday that its sales doubled in the final quarter of 1999 and
losses will narrow significantly after the worst suffering ever in
the fourth quarter, last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States and South
Korea will discuss South Korea's request for clearance to develop
more powerful missiles in Hawaii next Wednesday and Thursday, the
State Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman James Foley said the talks would be to discuss "
issues related to the nonproliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and their delivery system," including "technical
missile issues."
</P>
<P>
The United States and South Korea have a 20-year agreement that
strictly limits Seoul's ability to deploy powerful missiles, but
media reports have said Washington might be willing to slightly
extend the permitted range.
</P>
<P>
South Korea wants to extend the range beyond the current 180 km,
arguing that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has
developed more powerful missiles and that it wants to be less
dependent on Washington for defense.
</P>
<P>
Foley said the United States "shares the Republic of Korea's
concerns about the threat."
</P>
<P>
"We have always stressed with the South Koreans, and will
continue to, our desire to cooperate with South Korea to ensure
adequate Republic of Korea defense and deterrent capabilities," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Foley declined to comment on a South Korean press report that
the two governments agree in principle to limit the deployment
range of South Korean missiles to 300 km.

<HEADLINE> Russian Cargo Ship Docks With Orbiting Space Station Mir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian "Progress M1-1"
cargo spacecraft, launched by a Soyuz booster from Kazakhstan's
Baikonur cosmodrome Tuesday, successfully docked with Russia's
orbiting Mir space station at 11:02 a.m. Moscow time (0802 GMT)
Thursday, said the Russian Space Mission Control Center outside
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Progress M1-1 brought to Mir everything necessary for a 28-day
space mission starting on March 31. Mir has been circling the
Earth without a crew since last August, said the center.
</P>
<P>
Progress M1-1 is an improvement on the previous version of the
cargo spaceship, and experts call it "a space tanker," which
brought two tons of fuel to Mir instead of the 1.1 tons the
previous Progress vessels used to carry.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Progress M1-1 is fitted out with equipment for
raising the air pressure inside the station, which is plagued by
constant air leaks.
</P>
<P>
The cargo ship also delivered spare parts for onboard avionics
and equipment needed for resuming work on the station, drinking
water and other life-support necessities.
</P>
<P>
After testing the Mir-Progress link-up for a short time,
Mission Control is planning to raise Mir's orbit considerably next
Monday. During the docking, it was between 305 to 326 kilometers
above the Earth, although the station's designed altitude is 400
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Mission Control experts said normal pressure will be created in
the station before the 28th expedition's departure for the station.

<HEADLINE> Vodafone, Mannesmann Merge in Record-High Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 3 (Xinhua) -- British mobile phone giant
Vodafone Airtouch PLC and Germany's Mannesmann AG Thursday evening
announced their merger in a record-high deal of 400 billion marks
(200 billion U.S. dollars.)
</P>
<P>
Vodafone Chief Executive Chris Gent and his German counterpart,
Mannesmann Chairman Klaus Esser, publicized the deal jointly in
Duesseldorf, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The deal, coming after a special Mannesmann supervisory board
meeting agreed on a "friendly merger" with Vodafone, will create
the world's mobile communications powerhouse with over 40 million
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Before the merger, Vodafone is already the world's No.1 mobile
carrier with over 30 million customers worldwide, while Mannesmann
is the largest in the European continent.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the German group said, "Mannesmann has
agreed on a merger with Vodafone Airtouch so that we are on the
way toward a common enterprise. According to Mannesmann's
assessment, this decision is on the willing of shareholders."
</P>
<P>
"We are both winners," said Gent at the press conference in
Duesseldorf. And Esser projected a formal approval of Mannesmann's
supervisory board Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement between the two companies, Mannesmann
shareholders will keep 49.5 percent of stake in the new company
through share exchange.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday evening, Gent raised his offer by about 5 percent
over the base of last year. His new offer is 58.96 Vodafone shares
for each Mannesmann share. The new offer makes every Mannesmann
share valuing 340 dollars (353 euros.)
</P>
<P>
That means the deal, valuing some 198 billion dollars (400
billion marks), will be the largest in the industry's history,
breaking the record of American OnLine's acquisition of Time
Warner in January.
</P>
<P>
In the new company, Mannesmann will be able to keep its
divisions in France and Italy, namely Arcor and Inforstrada, and
go on with its strategy in data communications and electronic
commerce, while Mannesmann's headquarters in Duesseldorf will
become the new company's center for business in Europe.
</P>
<P>
But Mannesmann's traditional departments for engineering and
automotive will be dispatched and go on stocks market separately,
the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
The takeover war around Mannesmann had lasted for three and a
half months before the last-minute meeting between Gent and Esser.
Vodafone announced a hostile bid last December, when Esser
rejected its offer of 54.7 Vodafone shares for each Mannesmann
share.
</P>
<P>
Gent flew to Duesseldorf Wednesday evening with his new offer
for a "friendly solution" and held a close-door meeting with
Mannesmann management. Though no information had been disclosed,

<HEADLINE> France Condemns Austria's New Gov't With Extreme Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 3 (Xinhua) -- France has condemned the forming
of a new government in Austria Thursday with the extreme right
Freedom Party of Joerg Haider and is taking measures of sanction
immediately against Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The French government said in a communique that "the forming of
the government has gravely changed the image and situation in
Austria and Europe."
</P>
<P>
"France regrets that the warnings addressed to the Austrian
leaders by the (European Union) rotating president Portugal, in
the name of 14 partners of Austria, has not been understood," said
the communique issued by the French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The French presidential palace said that for the first time, a
party with extremist and xenophobic ideology has taken over the
responsibility of a government in a European Union member country.
</P>
<P>
"Europe is first of all a community of values, which give
foundation to its civilization. To jeopardize the principles of
humanism and respect for the dignity of human being amounts to the
same thing as putting into question its reason to be," said
spokeswoman of the Elysee presidential palace Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
France will immediately implement the measures of sanctions
against Austria, which was decided by the European Union on
January 31.
</P>
<P>
The measures include a suspension of official meetings with
Austria on bilateral level, reduction to the technical level of
any reception of the Austrian ambassadors, and refusal to support
Austrian candidates for posts in international organizations.
</P>
<P>
France could take supplementary measures of sanctions,
including a recall of its ambassador from Vienna, said the French
government.
</P>
<P>
The French Defense Ministry has canceled a bilateral
consultation with Austria on European defense scheduled for next
week.

<HEADLINE> Records Show Previous Problems for U.S. Crashed Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The total of 44 service problems reported since 1992 is about
average, FAA spokesman Paul Takemoto said, adding that there was
nothing unusual in the history of the plane.
</P>
<P>
No survivors has been found following the Monday crash of the
Alaska Airlines jet with 88 people from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
The plane, which plunged into the ocean about 65 kilometers
northwest of Los Angeles, was en route to San Francisco, and then
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most serious problem recorded in the FAA Service
Difficulty Reports involving the plane -- serial number N963AS --
was an engine failure on August 11, 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the plane experienced two incidents of electrical
smoke odor in the cabin. Replacing a phone handset and cradle
cured the problems.
</P>
<P>
In August 1997, a maintenance inspection found a broken bolt on
a landing gear retraction mechanism. The bolt was replaced.
</P>
<P>
By far the largest number of maintenance reports dealt with
various lighting troubles -- 23 out of the 44 maintenance problems
listed.
</P>
<P>
The most recent difficulty was last October 22, when the crew
had trouble opening the main passenger door on the left from the
inside after landing in Seattle. Mechanics adjusted the door. The
same door had jammed once a year earlier, when moisture in the
seal turned out to be the problem.
</P>
<P>
The crew reported trouble opening one of the sliding windows in
the cockpit last September 11, when the window's upper guide pin
was found out of its track. That was only the most recent problem
with the co-pilot's side window on this plane, though. It was
fixed seven times over two years for jamming and being hard to
open.

<HEADLINE> Economic Development Must Go With Peace, Justice: WB Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 3 (Xinhua) -- World Bank (WB) President
James Wolfensohn said Thursday in the Mexican resort city of
Cancun that economic development must be accompanied with peace
and social justice in Latin America, since the level of poverty
has not been sufficiently diminished.
</P>
<P>
The head of the international credit institution described
during the Third Meeting of Finance Ministers of the Western
Hemisphere the dramatic picture caused by poverty in the Latin
American countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the poverty problems are not given attention,
there will not be growth in the long term, because social
instability will end with it," since 36 percent of the population
of the region survive in the threshold of poverty and 15 percent
are in extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said in Cancun, in the Mexican Caribbean state of
Quintana Roo, that the number of the poor has grown by 40 million
in the last 20 years, "and we are no better today than in the
1970s."
</P>
<P>
The banker said that the highest rate of poor live in countries
like Mexico, Ecuador, Guatemala, Bolivia and Peru, because those
countries have 80 percent of the indigenous people of the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian unmanned supply
spaceship "Progress M-42" completed its flight mission and burnt
down in atmosphere Wednesday, said the Russian Space Mission
Control Center outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The space tug undocked from the Mir orbital station at 06:14 a.
m. Moscow time (0314 GMT) Wednesday. Then, following orientation
in space and deceleration with the Progress M-42 jet, the
spacecraft switched to a descent trajectory, entered dense
atmosphere layers and burned out with various wastes out of the
space station in it, said the control center.
</P>
<P>
In compliance with the flight program of the Progress M1-1
cargo ship, two maneuvers were carried out for its rendezvous with
the Mir station. The spacecraft are to dock Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Progress M-42" was launched on July 16 last year for sending 2.
5 tons of life necessities to the two Russian and one French
astronauts in Mir. During the mission it raised and corrected the
orbit of the station through its power system for two times.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians to Declare Independent State This Year: Central Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The Central Council of the
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) has decided to declare an
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital this year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Council, which ended its two-day session here
Thursday, also decided that Palestinian sovereignty must be
exercised over the areas under Palestinian self-rule by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The statement, read out by Palestinian National Council chairman
Selim Zanoun, said it was the natural right of the Palestinian
people to establish their own, independent state.
</P>
<P>
"All necessary steps must be taken to realize this goal," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Palestinian Central Council entrusted the PLO
Executive Committee to work out the constitution for the future
Palestinian state and necessary legislation in the fields of
politics, economy, law and social construction.
</P>
<P>
The Central Council session, attended by 110 members, deemed
that the Israeli-Palestinian final status talks have fallen into a
real crisis after the breakdown of the summit between Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The council demanded that Israel commit itself to all the signed
agreements and the set timetables.
</P>
<P>
It urged the international community, especially the United
States and Middle East countries, to exert pressure on Israel and
force it to implement the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The council reaffirmed Palestinian stand on final status issues
- the Palestinians must have Jerusalem as their capital, Israel
must retreat to the 1967 borders, all Jewish settlements must be
scrapped and Palestinian refugees' right to return to their
homeland must be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have set February 13 as a deadline
for reaching a framework agreement and September 13 for concluding
a final accord on permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
A unilateral statement by the Israeli side to postpone the
February 13 deadline for the framework agreement on all outstanding
issues, including the thorny questions of Jerusalem and the future
Palestinian state, is invalid, a senior Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks suffered a major setback
Thursday as Barak and Arafat failed to resolve any problems during
their two-hour meeting at Erez checkpoint at Gaza-Israeli border.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Claim to Have Longest Hockey Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian players claimed to have
the world's longest hockey game Thursday morning, when a total of
180 players ended their three days of pick-up hockey in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the puck dropped Monday morning in an outdoor rink
at the city hall, the marathon game lasted 92 periods between a
blue team and a white team, which scored 380 goals over the blue's
340 to win the continuous event of 71 hours and 52 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"The last group hung in there and played hockey for almost 19
hours, 26 periods total," according to sponsor of the event
Michelle Noble.
</P>
<P>
Organizers say they have videotaped the event to submit to the
Guinness Book of World Records for certification as the longest
game of hockey.
</P>
<P>
The players were on five squads from all over Ontario, with
each team playing as long as possible before the next squad takes
over.
</P>
<P>
They could eat and rest in the 15-minute break between periods
when the ice was cleaned.
</P>
<P>
The event, as part of the National Hockey League All-Star Game
festivities, has also raised 10,000 Canadian dollars (about 6,945
U.S. dollars for charity.

<HEADLINE> Germany's CDU Set to Present Secret Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 3(Xinhua)--Germany's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) has decided to present further information about its
illegal secret donations Friday, the party's leadership said.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made after CDU leaders' special meeting
Thursday at its Bonn headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The party "is on the right way," Angela Merkel, CDU's general
secretary, said after the 6-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
The CDU officials, led by party chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble
and Merkel, decided to hold a presidium session Friday and then
inform the publicity at a press conference, she said.
</P>
<P>
As Thursday's Bild Zeitung daily reported, the CDU has known
at least one name of the secret donors who had given ex-chancellor
Helmut Kohl 2 million marks in cash.
</P>
<P>
Horst Weyrauch, former CDU finance and tax advisor, spelled
out the name after intensive inquiry by the party on Wednesday,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who is facing a criminal investigation into the scandal,
was called to Thursday's meeting for a party inquiry over his
secret bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
The ARD television news said that Kohl had stayed in Konrad
Ardenauer Haus, the CDU headquarters building in Bonn, for over
two hours.

<HEADLINE> IMF Forecasts 4 Pct Growth for L.America in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 3 (Xinhua) -- Latin America will reaffirm
this year its economic recovery and will close 2000 with a 4
percent growth, said International Monetary Fund (IMF) General
Director Michel Camdessus Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Latin America closed the last quarter of 1999 with growth, said
Camdessus before the third meeting of the Western Hemisphere
Finance Ministers, that opened Thursday in Cancun, Mexico's
southwestern state of Quitana Roo.
</P>
<P>
"Almost all the economies of the region have grown again" after
a serious recession in the first semester of 1999 in Latin America,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The factors that contribute to the growth, according to
Camdessus, are the careful monetary actions of the countries, as
well as the dynamism of the economies of North America, the Asian
recovery and the price rise of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The governments of the region are courageous and prudent to
take measures "frequently unpopular in difficult political context,
in search of the macroeconomic equilibrium and the confidence of
the markets," said Camdessus before the representatives of 34
countries of the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is necessary to be cautious in the external
plane, given the uncertainty about the availability and weaknesses
that the economies of the region still show. He mentioned among
these weaknesses problems of structural nature, such as the tax
collection systems, the inefficiency of the spending, and in the
financial area the insufficient capitalization of the banks and
their obsolete and weak regulatory systems.
</P>
<P>
The IMF general director underscored the theme of poverty,
saying that it is possible to reduce the inequality of
opportunities by means of efficient social policies that permit
the countries to acquire a higher and more stable rhythm of growth.
</P>
<P>
"There exists then an interconnection between growth and
social well-being that frequently has been neglected, and that we
can and must use better," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed the IMF support to the region, which reaches an
amount in pledges that will surpass the 35 billion dollars,
including the 7.3 billion dollars to be granted to Argentina.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Arms Crisis Deepens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson told the House of
Commons he is taking the formal powers necessary to suspend the
eight-week old Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The emergency statement followed the failure of the
paramilitaries to start decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
A date to resume direct rule would be decided if there was no
progress in solving the key issue of Irish Republican Army
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson called on the IRA to start disarming immediately to
save the peace process which ended three decades of guerrilla war
which claimed 3,600 lives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern arrived for a
crisis summit with Prime Minister Tony Blair at a hotel in St
Austell, in Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
A bill to enable Northern Ireland institutions to be suspended
will be published on Friday and the parliament will debate its
proposals next week.
</P>
<P>
This will aim to offer valuable breathing space for last minute
efforts to resolve the deadlock over the handover of paramilitary
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"If it becomes clear that because of a loss of confidence the
institutions cannot be sustained the government has to be ready to
put on hold the operation of those institutions," said Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
The government had to preserve the assembly and executive from
collapse, he explained to MPs.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came the day before a post-dated resignation
letter by Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble, who leads
the Ulster Unionists, comes into force.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly would mean
direct rule being re-introduced from Westminster.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson has decided not to release the report by General John
de Chastelain into weapons decommissioning by Northern Ireland's
paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
But he told MPs that without decommissioning, confidence in the
peace process would "ebb quickly".
</P>
<P>
He said the report by General de Chastelain had welcomed the
IRA's continued cease-fire as important and vital to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
But there had been no handover of weapons, it concluded.
</P>
<P>
Trimble expressed his disappointment at the lack of progress on
decommissioning, saying he was "astonished" so little had happened.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said the statement was a slap
in the face to his party's leadership who were trying to save the
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Irish analysts said Mandelson's open-ended legislation was a
gamble for time to give Ahern and Sinn Fein more time to persuade
the IRA to at least make a gesture towards disarmament.
</P>
<P>
It also allows Trimble not to go ahead with his threat to
resign if IRA disarmament does not start by Friday.

PANAMA CITY, February 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government will
supply Panama, according to a binational agreement, with two boats,
an undetermined number of vehicles and 160 weapons to combat drug
trafficking, the Panamanian Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Panama will reinforce with this assistance the mechanisms and
strategies of coordination among its state institutions to raise
the levels of the fight against the criminal organizations
trafficking drugs.
</P>
<P>
The security organizations that will benefit from the U.S.
assistance are the National Maritime Service , the Judicial
Technical Police, the Police Investigation and Information
Department, and the Customs General Direction.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said that the antidrug assistance that the
United States will give to the government of President Mireya
Moscoso does not foresee the presence of foreign military
personnel in Panama.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said that the government requested from
the United States at the end of 1999 assistance to reinforce the
war against drug trafficking, so it agreed to give Panama certain
pieces of equipment that can be used in this effort.
