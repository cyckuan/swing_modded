<HEADLINE> Cyprus Satisfied With Extension of U.N. Peacekeepers' Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus on Thursday expressed
satisfaction with the U.N. Security Council decision on Wednesday
to renew the mandate of the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP) for a further six-month period until December 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The government is satisfied with the way things developed in
New York (where the U.N. headquarters is based) and is
concentrating its attention to the third round of the talks,"
government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou told reporters at his
daily briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council approved the renewal of the UNFICYP mandate
after the Cyprus government gave its consent as the United Nations
agreed not to include in Secretary General Kofi Annan's report an
addendum regarding a Turkish Cypriot demand for separate
consultations with UNFICYP.
</P>
<P>
UNFICYP has been in the island since 1964, aimed to help
maintain peace between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled
south and Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the Mediterranean island
after a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway republic
in northern Cyprus in 1983, which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou warned that "if any approach aims at a direct or
indirect recognition of the illegal regime, it will be confronted
with the same firm resistance from our side."
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored indirect talks have been held
between the two communities to prepare the ground for negotiations
leading to a comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
A third round of the indirect, or "proximity", talks is due to
begin on July 5 in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldiers' Firing Balks Withdrawal Verification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The process of verifying the Israeli
withdrawal on the Lebanese side of the border with Israel stalled
on Thursday after Israeli soldiers' firing to Lebanese and U.N.
inspection teams, Lebanese National News Agency (LNNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The firing came when eight U.N. and four Lebanese officers, who
were verifying the withdrawal line near Abbassiyeh Gate, walked
about 150 meters toward a barbed wire fence that Israel had built
during its occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers shot four bullets over their heads and several
at the land near their legs. Lebanese officers immediately decided
to cease verification and their U.N. counterparts went back to the
U.N. headquarter in Naquora.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army's northern front commander Gabi Ashkenazi
apologized to the U.N. commander in Lebanon and promised he will
investigate the incident thoroughly, Israeli radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio added Israeli soldiers opened fire after they "saw a
group of civilians and journalists try to cut through the fence."
</P>
<P>
LNNA pointed out the fence is in Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
Amin Hotait, who heads the Lebanese army team working with the
U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon on the process, earlier
Thursday said his team has established there were six Israeli
violations of the Lebanese border along the 75 kilometers that have
already been covered.
</P>
<P>
He said there are still 55 kilometers of border left to be
verified, adding mines near the border pose a threat to the
verification teams.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud has instructed the Lebanese
officers to examine every meter of the border before a Lebanese
endorsement of the withdrawal is rendered.

<HEADLINE> Italy Pleased With Korean Summit </HEADLINE>

<P>
ROME, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini expressed his delight Thursday at the progress of the
reconciliatory Pyongyang summit between President Kim Dae-Jung of
South Korea and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-il.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here in Rome, Dini said that the Korean
talks had "exceeded every possible expectation we could have hoped
for."
</P>
<P>
The minister has been following the developments of the summit
with particular attention since Italy was the first of the G-7
countries to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea in
January and Dini subsequently visited Pyongyang in March.
</P>
<P>
The desire of the North Korean authorities to re-establish
links with the South was obvious even then, said Dini, but added
that it was "a real surprise that the summit took place so soon,
and with such cordiality."
</P>
<P>
Dini concluded that the long-term aim of the process of
reconciliation is peaceful reunification without resorting to arms.

JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States government
Thursday pledged 35 million rand (about 5 million U.S. dollars) to
develop community programs to curb HIV/AIDS in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a signing ceremony in Soweto district here,
visiting U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the money
will be used to fund research into the disease.
</P>
<P>
"By attacking people in the most productive years, the death
and illness caused by HIV/AIDS is affecting economic prosperity
and threatening South Africa's reconstruction," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the agreement is part of the Leadership and
Investment in Fighting an Epidemic Initiative between the U.S. and
South Africa governments.
</P>
<P>
The disease is projected to reduce average life expectancy in
South Africa from 60 years to around 40 years by 2010 if current
trends continue.

JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United States
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers Thursday called in Pretoria
for debt relief to impoverished African states, but added
assistance should be carefully monitored to ensure it reaches
those in need.
</P>
<P>
Providing unconditional assistance, as was sometimes done in
the past, led to a misuse of loans and aid money, said Summers,
who is touring the region to talk about helping poor nations.
</P>
<P>
"We owe it to Africa's poorest citizens to ensure that this
time our assistance works for them by targeting it to countries
that deliver results," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that many African countries and other
developing nations have misspent their wealth.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Phones Putin on Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 15 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Thursday phoned Russian President Vladimir Putin, who are visiting
Germany, on bilateral relations and global strategic stability,
said the Kremlin press service.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the conversation, "Jacques Chirac expressed his
sincere gratitude to Vladimir Putin for contributing to the
release of French journalist Brice Fleutiaux," who had been held
hostage by Chechen rebels for eight months, said the press service
here.
</P>
<P>
Putin expressed the hope that Fleutiaux will soon regain his
strength after bandit captivity in Chechnya, and conveyed his best
wishes to him and his family.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Chirac also discussed future Russian-French top-level
contacts and a planned meeting within the framework of the Group-8
summit due in July in Japan's Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
While exchanging opinions on Russia's relations with the
European Union, which France will chair from July 1, Putin "
positively assessed France's initiative on improving economic
assistance to reforms in Russia," the press service said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders "pointed out with satisfaction that their
positions on issues of strategic stability are close and
reiterated the need to preserve and improve the Anti-Ballistic-
Missile treaty," stressed the press service.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says It Will Soon Ease Sanctions on DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. officials are working to
ease sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (
DPRK) following a historic summit between the DPRK and South Korea
in Pyongyang, the Associated Press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said details
could be announced within a week, according to AP.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced in September the easing
of a half-century of restrictions on trade, travel and banking
against the DPRK after the latter agreed to a moratorium on
testing of long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
With the three-day summit between DPRK leader Kim Jong Il and
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung ending in an atmosphere of
unprecedented good will, U.S. officials said Thursday they would
announce soon the procedures for implementing Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
The end of the sanctions would allow the DPRK to export raw
materials and goods to the United States and would open air and
shipping routes between the two countries. The White House has
said Clinton's order would not affect a ban on exports of military
and sensitive dual-use items or most types of federal assistance.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President to Meet Mbeki on DRC Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni will visit South Africa this weekend for talks with his
South African counterpart, Thabo Mbeki, on the situation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Foreign Affairs Department
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The department's deputy director-general for Africa Welile
Nhlapo told reporters in Pretoria that it was necessary for Mbeki
and Museveni to exchange views
</P>
<P>
Museveni, Mbeki and the presidents of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, and
Tanzania, Benjamin Mokapa, met last year to discuss the DRC issue
and reached certain agreements in terms of a plan for the
disengagement of fighting groups in the Congo. A few days later
fighting again flared up in the Kisangani area.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki had been in contact with the three presidents to try and
find the best way to get all sides to adhere to the agreements,
Nhlapo said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Organization Mission in the DRC (MONUC) was
asked to help since "the plan was not necessarily totally adhered
to," Nhlapo said.

<HEADLINE> Summers Urges World to Help Africa Combat AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers Thursday called on the international
community to help Africa combat AIDS, saying the fight was too
important to be left to African governments to tackle by
themselves.
</P>
<P>
No national economic policy, however well devised, would yield
significant results unless a more effective approach was found
against HIV/AIDS and other diseases, Summers said in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the world has to be doing more, not simply as a
moral imperative but as an economic and strategic one," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we are committed to mobilizing global resources
and expertise for the development and dissemination of vaccines
for the infectious disease that afflict this region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Summers, who is on a five-nation visit to the region to discuss
economic assistance to poor nations, was speaking at the
University of Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. was working to ensure that debt relief to the
poorest countries would bring tangible improvements in the field
of basic health.
</P>
<P>
"We owe it to Africa's poorest citizens to ensure that this
time our assistance works for them -- by targeting it to countries.
.. that deliver results and by applying appropriate conditions,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said the assistance could only be given under certain
conditions.
</P>
<P>
To provide assistance unconditionally would amount to ignoring
the lessons of the past, Summers said.
</P>
<P>
The history of countries such as Nigeria, Venezuela, Zambia and
others also proved the danger of external finance without
conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Again and again, natural resource windfalls have financed
presidential planes, palaces and corruption, while producing very
little economic benefit for ordinary people," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
The debt relief initiative for heavily indebted poor countries,
known as HIPC, also focused on strengthening countries' investment
in education.
</P>
<P>
"It is no exaggeration to say that Africa will not progress
economically in the first few decades of this century without
major investments in education, especially for women," he added.
</P>
<P>
No country had ever succeeded economically with a literacy rate
of well above 50 percent, Summer said. At present, almost half of
Sub-Saharan women could not read.
</P>
<P>
Education was also vital for the fight against HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"All the public advertising and information campaigns in the
world will not educate people about HIV/AIDS if they cannot read,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Economic integration was the third compelling priority for
Africa, Summers said. Rapid labor-intensive growth was especially
important for South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"That is why I welcome President Thabo Mbeki's determination to
make openness and integration a key element of South Africa's
economic reforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Summers said he agreed with Mbeki's approach that regional
economic integration would enhance Africa's closer integration
with the global economy.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's New Budget Targeted on Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The budget for the next fiscal
year from July 2000 is aimed at improving infrastructure and
rebuilding investment confidence in a bid to reverse the economic
slowdown and reduce poverty, Kenyan Finance Minister Chrysanthus
Okemo said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The budget that Okemo read before the National Assembly put the
annual growth rate at over three percent for the next three years
from July 2000 to June 2003.
</P>
<P>
"In order to achieve this, we need to create a stable and
efficient macroeconomic environment which attracts both foreign
and domestic investment and to improve public sector performance,"
Okemo said.
</P>
<P>
The war against poverty and unemployment can not be won unless
we improve infrastructure in a very effective way, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"During this fiscal year, the restoration and development of
physical infrastructure, such as roads, communications and energy,
will constitute a primary objective," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prudent fiscal and monetary policies will be essential to reach
the three percent economic growth rate, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Such policies include sound monetary policy to keep inflation
at or below five percent and ensuring foreign exchange reserves
for four months of import cover, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy has declined for three consecutive years since
the International Monetary Fund suspended aid in July 1997, with
the economic growth rate for 1997,1998 and 1999 standing at 2.3,
1.8 and 1.4 percent respectively, compared with 4.3 percent in
1996.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Proposal on Forming Group Representing G-15 at WTO Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from the Group-15 nations
welcomed Thursday a Malaysian proposal aimed at boosting the
organization's clout as they prepared for next week's meeting of
their leaders in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's International Trade Minister Paduka Rafidah Aziz
suggested to her G-15 counterparts meeting here that they form a
ministerial group to represent them at the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in Geneva, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The group would stay in contact with international economic
forums, coordinate stands on world trade and promote trade among
the G-15 states, the news agency quoted Egyptian Minister of
Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros Ghali as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ghali said the Malaysian proposal was well received by the G-15
trade and economy ministers who started meetings earlier in the day
in anticipation of the two-day G-15 summit starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
The G-15, founded in 1989 to promote economic cooperation among
developing countries, actually groups 17 nations, namely Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Jamaica,
Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Venezuela and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said here on Wednesday that
the G-15 will try to forge a common stand at the summit to combat
the negative effects of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will contact the G-
8 industrial countries' leadership to convey the G-15 position once
it is adopted. The G-8 will hold a meeting in Japan in July.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials said the meeting here will discuss support
for small and medium-sized enterprises, which they termed as "real
locomotives for employment and growth," in the G-15 group.
</P>
<P>
The summit will also study means to develop economic and trade
cooperation among member countries facing geographic and other
barriers.

<P>
CAIRO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- In a bid to contain the runaway unemployment rate,
which is as high as 16 percent, the Iranian government has decided
to send unemployed physicians, including specialists, abroad to
find jobs there, a senior Health Ministry official announced here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting between Iranian Health Minister Mohammad Farhadi
and his Saudi counterpart Osama Abdel-Majid on the sidelines of a
recent International Health Conference held in Mexico city,
preliminary agreements in this regard have been reached, said Dr.
Mansour Safaei Farahani, director-general for international
relations at the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said that negotiations are also under way with some other
countries in this regard, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Islamic Development Bank has pledged to fund 16
projects in Arab, African and Islamic countries with a total
investment of 203.7 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The projects include one for setting up an engineering faculty
in Yemen, a second one for establishing an electricity grid, a
third one for building waste-collecting facilities in Algeria and
expanding a power plant in Oman, a fourth one for building a
southern coastal road extending from Tripoli, Libya as far as the
Syrian-Lebanese borders.
</P>
<P>
They also cover other enterprises in Indonesia, Malaysia, Mali,
Zambia, Pakistan, Gabon, Kazakhstan, Somalia, Thailand and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The number of newly registered plants in Lebanon has
reached 168 in the first five months of this year, with a total
investment of 15.2 million U.S. dollars, according to statistics
issued by the Ministry of Industry.
</P>
<P>
In May, the number of newly registered plants hit 46, while 31
factories were licensed last April.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Ha'el Company for Agricultural Development has
finalized its feasibility and technical studies on cultivating and
processing olives with a view to setting up a plant for squeezing
olives.
</P>
<P>
The plant is expected to be the largest of its kind in the
Middle East region, at an initial cost of 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi company has started to cultivate large areas with
olives in the context of its future blueprints, which meant to have
varied farming production to be integrated with food processing and
to maximize the utilization of resources available to the company.
</P>
<P>
The company is contacting with olive production companies to
hammer out contracts for buying certain sorts of olives, said the
company in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon, U.N. Half Finish Withdrawal Verification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. and Lebanese teams have
finished over half of the process of verifying the Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon, having demarcated 75 kilometers of
the 130-meter-long Lebanese-Israeli borders, Oriental radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Col. Amin Hotait, who heads the Lebanese army team working with
the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon in the process, said
his four-officer team has established there were six Israeli
violations of the Lebanese border along the 75 kilometers section
already demarcated.
</P>
<P>
The last recorded violation was in the area of Meiss Jabal in
the central sector of the Israeli-vacated zone, where Israeli
troops had carved a road and set up an observation post, a 200-
meter-long strip that runs 14 meters deep into Lebanese territory,
Hotait said.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent response to United Nations' complaint that the
Lebanese officers were purposely dragging their feet in the
verification process, Hotait said "the distance we cover is not the
issue. The issue is the violations we register."
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud has instructed the Lebanese
officers to examine every meter of the border before a Lebanese
endorsement of the withdrawal is rendered.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters in New York Wednesday
that Secretary General Kofi Annan expected the verification
exercise to be completed by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, An Nahar newspaper quoted an unnamed source close to
the Lebanese team as saying they can not say how long it will take
to verify the remaining 55 kilometers because some of the areas are
mine fields. Local papers predicted that Annan will postpone his
visit to Lebanon to June 19.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Salim Hoss stressed Thursday morning
that his country will fully cooperate with the U.N. in a bid to end
the verification process. Hoss said he hopes the U.N. peacekeeping
force will be deployed quickly after the verification period in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government is scheduled to convene Thursday evening
to finalize a plan under which a joint force of 1,000 Lebanese army
troops and policemen will be deployed in south Lebanon, As Safir
paper reported.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hails Historic DPRK-South Korea Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Thursday welcomed the
positive outcome of the first summit between the leaders of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters that the
summit will "create a suitable climate" for enhancing mutual
understanding between the two sides of the Korean Peninsular.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was optimistic that the historic summit will lead to the
realization of a lasting peace on the peninsular and help safeguard
stability in Northeastern Asia.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the efforts exerted by DPRK leader Kim Jong
Il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung to reduce tensions on
the peninsula and boost mutual understanding for future cooperation
in the economic and trade, cultural and social fields.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung ended a three-day visit to Pyongyang, DPRK's
capital, on Thursday, the first ever since the division of the
Korean Peninsular after the World War II in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Following intensive and extensive talks and meetings, Kim Jong
Il and Kim Dae-jung signed a joint communique late Wednesday aimed
at carrying out exchanges and improving relations between the two
sides and realizing national reunification.

<HEADLINE> U.S Industrial Production Rises 0.4 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. industrial production at
the nation's factories, mines and utilities increased 0.4 percent
in May after a 0.7 percent gain in April, the Federal Reserve
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production has climbed continuously for 17
months. Analysts were expecting industrial production to decline
by 0.3 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
At utilities, output rose 1.4 percent in May. Output at
factories and at mines each rose 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Operating capacity at the nation's factories, mines and
utilities stood at 82.1 percent in May, the same rate as in April.
Many economists predicted operating capacity would fall a bit to
81.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In another report, new claims for unemployment benefits fell
last week, after posting a sharp jump the week before, suggesting
that businesses continue to scramble for workers.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported Thursday that 296,000 Americans
filed new claims for jobless benefits for the week ending June 10,
down by 16,000 from the previous week. That was the lowest level
since May 27 when claims were at 290,000.
</P>
<P>
Economists consider claims below 300,000 an indication of a
tight labor market, meaning employers are having trouble finding
qualified workers to fill job openings.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times since
last June to slow the economy and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Recent economic data, including home sales, retail sales,
factory orders and unemployment, indicate a slowing in the red-hot
economy. Given that, a growing number of economists believe the
central bank will leave rates unchanged when it meets June 27-28.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Holds Open Meeting on DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday began an open session to debate on the latest
developments in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with the
participation of foreign ministers and representatives of the
countries involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
DRC Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia, Rwandan Foreign
Minister Andrew Bumaya, Angolan Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge
Chicoti and Ugandan Foreign Minister Amama Mbabazi are among the
participants at the Council meeting, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Both Namibia, a Security Council member, and Zimbabwe are
represented by their respective U.N. ambassadors, Martin Andjaba
and Tichaone Joseph Jokonya.
</P>
<P>
The rival rebel groups also have representatives at the
Council meeting, but the U.N. officials did not identify them.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is present at the meeting,
at which the Ugandan and DRC foreign ministers and U.S. Ambassador
Richard Holbrooke will speak.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan foreign minister is the chairman of the Political
Committee, which groups foreign ministers of the signatories of
the Lusaka Agreement. Holbrooke headed a Security Council mission
to the DRC and its neighboring countries in May.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place as the Security Council is considering
a draft resolution, which, expected to be adopted Friday, is
expected to threaten unspecified measures if fighting does not
stop, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Council's resolution would culminate two days of talks, on
Thursday and Friday, with a committee of senior representatives
from countries and rebel groups participating in the war.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also came after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
Tuesday asked the Security Council to demand a halt to fighting
between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in Kisangani, a diamond trade
center in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and their prompt
withdrawal from the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also called on the 15-nation body to demand the
early withdrawal of all other foreign forces from the country, the
former Zaire, as foreseen in an accord signed in Lusaka, capital
of Zambia, which is intended to end the many-sided conflict in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In both cases, Annan said, the Council should act under the
mandatory provisions of Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which
provides for possible sanctions or other punitive measures in the
event of noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
Annan also urged the Council to invoke Chapter VII of the U.N.
Charter "to demand the subsequent early withdrawal of all other
foreign forces" in the DRC, as foreseen in the Lusaka accord.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the U.N. chief suggested sanctions or other
punitive measure be considered if they refused to leave.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council Tuesday, Annan said the
situation in the DRC and prospects for further progress in the
peace process "have become particular uncertain."
</P>
<P>
Referring to fighting between Rwandan and Ugandan troops last
week in Kisangani, Annan said, "I invite the Security Council,
acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, to
demand that the governments of Rwanda and Uganda order their
respective armed forces to desist forthwith from further fighting
and withdraw from Kisangani immediately and from the territory of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo promptly thereafter."
</P>
<P>
The two forces "should be held accountable for the loss of
life and the property damage" they had inflicted on the civilian
population of Kisangani, he said. The report said an estimated 150
civilians had been killed and more than 1,000 wounded, despite
repeated efforts by Annan and others to secure a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the continued fighting, Annan cited the
government's decision not to take part in the preparatory meeting
for an inter-Congolese dialogue, its attempts to block
participation of the unarmed opposition, and "the chronic shortage
and delays" in providing resources for the facilitator of the
national dialogue appointed by the Organization of African Unity (
OAU), former Botswana President Ketumile Masire.
</P>
<P>
"These difficulties have been compounded by the government's
announcement, on June 9, of its withdrawal of confidence in Mr.
Masire," and its request to the OAU to nominate a new neutral

<HEADLINE> London Still Best For Financial Business: Says A Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, JUNE 15 (Xinhua) -- London is still regarded as the
best city in the world in which to conduct financial business, a
survey by the London Chamber of Commerce has found.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 100 foreign banks released Thursday showed that
London still scored best on the factors that matter, notably the
depth of its financial markets and its tradition as an
international financial center.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of foreign banks -- 83 percent --
expect London to retain this position over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The survey said political stability, high-quality
telecommunications and a stable economy were other important
elements in London's success.
</P>
<P>
Simon Sperryn, chief executive of the London Chamber of
Commerce, said: "The foreign banking community has given a clear
indication that, for the next decade at least, London is set to
remain the world's pre-eminent international financial center."
</P>
<P>
"We must work with policy makers to ensure that the political
and commercial climate here remains as attractive as it has been
over recent years," he added.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Holds Open Meeting on DRC EDS-Updated with more information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday began an open session to debate on the latest development
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with the participation
of foreign ministers and representatives of the countries involved
in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
DRC Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia, Rwandan Foreign
Minister Andrew Bumaya, Deputy Angolan Foreign Minister Jorge
Chicoti and Ugandan Foreign Minister Amama Mbabazi were among the
participants at the Council meeting, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab and Zambian
Minister for Presidential Affairs were also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe was represented by Machizenyika Tobias Mapuranga,
permanent secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Also at
the meeting was Abdelkader Messahel, special envoy of Presidential
Bouteflika for the DRC and the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The rebel groups were also represented at the meeting.
Dominique Kanku represented the Movement for the Liberation of
Congo (MLC) at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is present at the meeting,
at which the Ugandan and DRC foreign ministers, and U.S.
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said that the implementation of the
Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement fell behind the calendar.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan foreign minister is the chairman of the Political
Committee, which groups foreign ministers of the signatories of
the Lusaka Agreement. Holbrooke headed a Security Council mission
to the DRC and its neighboring countries in May.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place as the Security Council is considering
a draft resolution, which, expected to be adopted Friday, is
expected to threaten unspecified measures if fighting does not
stop, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Council's resolution would culminate two days of talks, on
Thursday and Friday, with a committee of senior representatives
from countries and rebel groups participating in the war.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also came after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
Tuesday asked the Security Council to demand a halt to fighting
between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in Kisangani, a diamond trade
center in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and their prompt
withdrawal from the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also called on the 15-nation body to demand the
early withdrawal of all other foreign forces from the country, the
former Zaire, as foreseen in an accord signed in Lusaka, capital
of Zambia, which is intended to end the many-sided conflict in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In both cases, Annan said, the Council should act under the
mandatory provisions of Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which
provides for possible sanctions or other punitive measures in the
event of noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
Annan also urged the Council to invoke Chapter VII of the U.N.
Charter "to demand the subsequent early withdrawal of all other
foreign forces" in the DRC, as foreseen in the Lusaka accord.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the U.N. chief suggested sanctions or other
punitive measure be considered if they refused to leave.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council Tuesday, Annan said the
situation in the DRC and prospects for further progress in the
peace process "have become particular uncertain."
</P>
<P>
Referring to fighting between Rwandan and Ugandan troops last
week in Kisangani, Annan said, "I invite the Security Council,
acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, to
demand that the governments of Rwanda and Uganda order their
respective armed forces to desist forthwith from further fighting
and withdraw from Kisangani immediately and from the territory of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo promptly thereafter."
</P>
<P>
The two forces "should be held accountable for the loss of
life and the property damage" they had inflicted on the civilian
population of Kisangani, he said. The report said an estimated 150
civilians had been killed and more than 1,000 wounded, despite
repeated efforts by Annan and others to secure a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the continued fighting, Annan cited the
government's decision not to take part in the preparatory meeting
for an inter-Congolese dialogue, its attempts to block
participation of the unarmed opposition, and "the chronic shortage
and delays" in providing resources for the facilitator of the
national dialogue appointed by the Organization of African Unity (
OAU), former Botswana President Ketumile Masire.
</P>
<P>
"These difficulties have been compounded by the government's
announcement, on June 9, of its withdrawal of confidence in Mr.
Masire," and its request to the OAU to nominate a new neutral
facilitator, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Organization mission in the DRC (MONUC), in its
current phase, comprises only about 228 military observers and
military liaison officers in and around the DRC, including 200 in
that country itself.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in the DRC pits the government of President
Laurent Kabila, backed by Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, against
rebel groups supported by Rwanda and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> GA President: States Bear Primary Responsibility for Security of U.N. Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Theo-Ben Gurirab, president
of the United Nations General Assembly, said Thursday that the
Member States bear the primary responsibility to take all
appropriate measures to ensure the safety and security of United
Nations and other international personnel within their territory.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the third Summit on the Security and Independence
of the International Civil Service, Ben Gurirab said each Member
State which accepts to have a peacekeeping operation deployed in
its territory must guarantee the safety and security of all United
Nations personnel, whether civilian or military, whether
internationally or locally recruited.
</P>
<P>
If crime is committed against United Nations personnel, the
country concerned has the obligation to do the utmost to bring
those responsible to justice, without delay, Ben Gurirab said.
</P>
<P>
The president said it is the obligation to the United Nations
and other personnel carrying out activities in fulfillment of the
mandate of a U.N. operation to be properly informed about the
conditions under which they are called upon to operate.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly has played a central role in this effort
aimed at ensuring the protection of U.N. personnel, and to this
end, it adopted the landmark 1994 Convention on the Safety of
United Nations and Associated Staff, he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 33 countries out of 188 have ratified the Convention.
Ben Gurirab urged all the other States that have not yet ratified
this Convention to do so.
</P>
<P>
The summit is aimed to address the increasing security problem
faced by the United Nations and associated personnel around the
world and to mobilize action to ensure their safety and security.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest U.N. statistics, between 1992 and
January 31, 2000, 184 civilian staff members were killed and 228
taken hostage or kidnapped. In addition, there were 292 reported
violent incidents against United Nations staff throughout the
world, including violent robbery, physical assault and rape.

<HEADLINE> Greece Refuses to Have Dialogue With Ex-King Over Property Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government Thursday once
again refused to have dialogue with the country's ex-king
Constantine over the latter's demand to reclaim his property in
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that there was no chance of dialogue
commencing between the Greek state and former king Constantine
over property lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
The former king, who now lives in London, Britain, and his
relatives Wednesday asked the European Court of Human Rights to
order Greece to return property seized after he was ousted in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The former king argues that the seizure violates the right to
ownership guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights
while the Greek government has long argued that the property,
thousands of hectares of land and two residences, never belonged
to the royal family but was put at their disposal by the state
while they ruled.
</P>
<P>
The former Greek king and eight members of his family filed
their claim three years ago after Greece's Supreme Court upheld
the constitutions of a 1994 law seizing the former monarch's
property.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Momentum is building for
the upcoming Millennium Summit of the United Nations, with over
100 heads of state and government indicating their intention to
take part in forum, the latest figures released at the U.N.
Headquarters in New York Thursday showed.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which is likely to be the largest-ever gathering of
world leaders, will be held from September 6 to 8 to focus on the
role of the United Nations in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the forum stems from the conviction that
the turn of the century presents a unique and symbolically
compelling moment to articulate and affirm an animating vision for
the United Nations in the new era.
</P>
<P>
In addition to making formal speeches at the summit, heads of
state or government will have the opportunity to participate in
one of four interactive round tables, each to be chaired by a head
of state or government nominated from a different region.
</P>
<P>
In preparing for the summit, Secretary-General Kofi Annan
launched his Millennium Report on April 3, 2000, which contains
numerous specific goals and program initiatives that he is asking
world leaders to consider.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state or government have also been invited by the
secretary-general to take the opportunity of the summit to sign or
deposit instruments of ratification for multilateral treaties they
may not yet have joined, especially 25 core treaties representing
key U.N. objectives.

ATHENS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday launched a
campaign to bolster the traffic police and monitor the dangerous
stretches of the national road network in a bid to tackle the
country's high rate of road accidents.
</P>

The surveillance radar at four sites along the highways went

</P>
<P>
Trucks are also banned from traveling on sections of the

killed and 30,000 others injured annually in accidents.
</P>
<P>
Police attribute the high accident rate mainly to Greeks'

<HEADLINE> British Troops Withdraw From S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The British troops have withdrawn
from Sierra Leone where they had helped to bolster the U. N.
peacekeeping operations and police Freetown, the capital of the
war-torn of the west African country.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held Thursday afternoon at the
headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping forces, known as UNAMSIL, UN
spokesman David Wimhurst expressed the gratitude to the British
troops that were deployed in Sierra Leone in the past five weeks.
</P>
<P>
The mutual cooperation between UNAMSIL and British troops
during the period was beneficial to both sides, said Wimhurst in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the withdrawal of the British troops would not
 adversely affect the security situation in Sierra Leone, as
UNAMSIL had substantially increased its forces over the past six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that security forces in Freetown have increased,
and more troops have been deployed to the Lungi Peninsula as well
as the Pepel and Tasso Islands. Lungi International Airport is now
under the control of UNAMSIL.
</P>
<P>
"We now have more than 12,000 men on the ground, with new
artillery and helicopters gunships," he said, adding more troops
and equipment will be arriving in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
British troops arrived in Freetown early May to help evacuate
its nationals residing in the capital, but its mission later
expanded to provide military and logistic support to Sierra Leone
army in fighting against the rebel Revolutionary United Front in
the front lines.
</P>
<P>
Early reports said that the British troops will, after its
withdrawal, left behind a team of 180 officers to help train the

FREETOWN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Renewed fightings between the U.
N. peacekeeping forces, known as UNAMSIL, and the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) soldiers broke out early Thursday
morning near the areas of Lungi and Lunsar.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the UNAMSIL headquarters in

She said that fighting was also reported in Lunsar areas and
the road leading to the city remained unsafe.

<P>
As to the questions about the U.N. detainees by the RUF rebels
in eastern areas of the country, she said the United Nations

<P>
YANGON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Thursday rejected a
resolution regarding the country's labor issue passed on Wednesday
by the current session of the International Labor Conference (ILC)
being held in Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Foreign Ministry said in a press release here that
"the resolution is unfair and unjust and the process flawed."
</P>
<P>
The ministry's statement argued that there are no practices of
forced labor in Myanmar, saying that necessary administrative,
executive and legislative measures are being implemented to
prevent occurrences of forced labor in the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement charged that the action was politically motivated
and spearheaded by a group of western nations who the statement
said have a hidden agenda with regard to Myanmar, pointing out
that it was also a blatant misuse by the Western Industrialized
countries of the tripartite nature of the International Labor
Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
The statement also warned that such arbitrary actions could
only impede the process of democratization and would prolong
rather than hasten the emergence of a democratic society.
</P>
<P>
The statement vowed that Myanmar will continue to promote the
cause of labor but will never bow to political pressure.

<HEADLINE> Over 1.2 Billion People Affected by Desertification Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.2 billion
people, who depend on the land for most of their needs, live in
areas affected by desertification, and this degradation of the
land is closely linked with poverty, famine, armed conflicts and
recurrent drought, Theo-Ben Gurirab, president of the 54th session
of the General Assembly, said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in his message on the World Day to Combat
Desertification and Drought, which falls on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Desertification affects more than 110 countries, occurring in
arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas as a result of various
factors, including climate variations and human activities," he
said. "The problem is global, and it is only through concerted
efforts that we will rid the world of this major environmental and
developmental problem."
</P>
<P>
To promote awareness of the need for international cooperation
to combat desertification and its devastating consequences, the
General Assembly, in 1994, proclaimed June 17 as the World Day to
Combat Desertification and Drought.
</P>
<P>
That date marked the adoption, in Paris, of the United Nations
Convention to Combat Desertification in those countries affected
by desertification and/or drought, particularly in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Convention went into force in 1996, and China signed the
Convention in October 1994, and ratified it in February 1997.
Today, there are 167 country Parties to the Convention, including
all African, European and most Asian, Latin American and Caribbean
countries.
</P>
<P>
"That high number is an indication that States are setting a
fine example for the rest of the international community to get
involved in confronting desertification, recurrent drought and
land degradation -- all of which are hampering concerted efforts
of many countries to overcome serious problems relating to
economic growth, wealth creation and sustainable development," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation at all levels, including the strong involvement
of civil society, is a key element in the fighting against
desertification and drought," he said. "I, therefore,
wholeheartedly endorse the many activities and initiatives at the
local, national, subregional and inter-regional levels to
elaborate and implement Action Programs, in the framework of the
Convention."
</P>
<P>
"Today, I appeal to the remaining 26 Member States of the
United Nations that have not yet done so, to join the rest of the
international community in becoming parties to the Convention," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be neither sustainable development, nor
environmental protection, nor improvement in the climate for
future generation, nor preservation of the biodiversity if we do
not protect the earth from desertification and its political,
moral, economic and social consequences," he said. "In this
undertaking, all levels of society must actively participate."

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Troops to Resume Withdrawal From Kinsangani, Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan troops will resume on
Friday their withdrawal from Kisangani, a northeast city of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), following six days of fighting
with the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA).
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal of the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF)
from Kisangani resumes on Friday. It is expected to end in seven
days from that day," Ugandan army spokesman Phinehas Katirima told
Xinhua Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal was disrupted by the RPA's attack on the UPDF,
or this phase two withdrawal would have been completed by now,"
said Katirima.
</P>
<P>
"We will leave Kapalata, seven kilometers north of the
Kisangani city center," he said.
</P>
<P>
After Ugandan and Rwandan troops clashed in early May, the two
countries agreed on the demilitarization of Kisangani, the third
largest city in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
A month later, the two armies clashed again. This time the
fighting was triggered by attacking and destroying a UPDF's
vehicle. The fighting lasted six days leaving at least 150
civilians dead and 1,114 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has asked the
Security Council to consider sanctions against Uganda and Rwanda
if their armies refuse to leave the war-torn Kisangani city.
</P>
<P>
Annan called on the council to insist that troops from Rwanda
and Uganda withdraw immediately from Kisangani and from the whole
of the DRC "promptly thereafter."

WUHAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- British investment in China has seen
a sharp rise in the first five months of the year, a senior
official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of the year, another 91 British-funded

<P>
According to official statistics, by May, more than 2,600
British-funded enterprises with an investment of 8.9 billion U.S.
dollars have been set up in China.

<HEADLINE> Feature: More HK People Want to Migrate Northwards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong people have always
complained about the unbearable high housing price and living cost,
but now they have new choices to live much cheaper but comfortable
outside the city.
</P>
<P>
Just few miles away and cross the border, there is the newly
rising city of Shenzhen, where the housing price is only about 10
percent of that in Hong Kong and living expenses there are also
much lower than that in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, it was only a few years ago that some Hong Kong people
started to go there to enjoy their weekends but no one thought it
was a good place to live.
</P>
<P>
Things are quite different now, said a senior official from the
Shenzhen Municipal People's Government. With the rapid economic
development and improvement of living conditions in the Chinese
inland areas, more and more Hong Kong people began to resettle
northwards in the newly rising inland cities, the official added.
</P>
<P>
A recent sample survey conducted by the Shenzhen city property
development department in individual interviews with over 1,000
Hong Kong residents showed that about 15 percent of Hong Kong
residents intended to resettle in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicated that many of the giant Hong Kong
property developers have made their plans to invest in Shenzhen's
property market.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to buy a larger flat to live in Shenzhen
because housing is much cheaper there," said Ng, who was at the
2000 Shenzhen Property Fair, which opened at the Hong Kong
Exhibition and Convention Center Thursday and organized by the
Shenzhen Property Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, you know we have to live on the small sum of pensions,
and we can't afford the high living expenses in a densely
populated city like Hong Kong," said Ng, a retired accountant in
her fifties who declined to give her full name.
</P>
<P>
Like Ng, hundreds of Hong Kong buyers flocked to the big
exhibition hall on the fifth floor trying to find their new homes
they have dreamed.
</P>
<P>
Among the buyers, there were also many young people. The
improved customs services and short distance enabled the working
population to travel easily between the two cities. "We can work
or do business in Hong Kong in the daytime and enjoy our life at
night and weekends in Shenzhen," said Anita Cheung, a public
relations manager in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A total 50 property projects were on display at the fair and
the preferential policies were formulated to lure investors,
according to the organizer of the fair.
</P>
<P>
As China's first special economic zone, Shenzhen has made great
achievements in every aspect including urban construction and
living conditions with an average GDP per capita of 4,300 U.S.
dollars in 1999, ranking the first in the nation.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the city sold a total 559,300 square meters of
commercial houses and flats to outsiders including Hong Kong
people, an increase of 54.1 percent compared with that in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, Shenzhen is not the only choice for Hong Kong people
to resettle. Many of them would like to migrate further northward
or to move into other inland cities to live since commodities in
further inland areas are much cheaper than in Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 3G Mobile Technology Round the Corner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The third generation mobile
phone technology is to be commercially available in the near
future and the much-hyped 3G mobile phone with high-speed Internet
access may be not far from people.
</P>
<P>
This message was conveyed at the 5th Annual CDMA Congress
concluded here Thursday, the largest telecommunication conference
in Asia which drew industry leaders from all over the world to
discuss the future of wireless telecommunications, particularly
the development of CDMA.
</P>
<P>
CDMA, or Code Division Multiple Access, is a continuous digital
transmission technology traditionally based in the United States
but now widely applied throughout the world with an estimated 60
million of CDMA subscribers to date.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the 5th Annual CDMA congress was CDMA industry' s
new darling, the third generation cdma20001x., which is said to
be the world's first 3G mobile technology to the market.
</P>
<P>
"CDMA is preparing to take a giant step along its development
path with the introduction of the world's third generation
services later this year using IMT-2000 Multi-Carrier1x technology
(1x)," said Perry Laforge, executive director of CDMA development
group (CDG).
</P>
<P>
Unlike the 2.5G solutions which just gets packet data at faster
speeds than the current 9.6/14.4 kbps of the 2G network, cdma2000
1x meets the ITU specification for 3G vehicular data speeds for
144 kbps., Laforge said.
</P>
<P>
As a striking feature which differentiates the 3G from the 2G
or the 2.5G, the 3G CDMA system will enable much faster wireless
transfer rate than current systems for things like video images
and other multimedia applications.
</P>
<P>
CDMA has been a huge success in Asia and the growth trend will
continue well into the future, CDMA experts attending the
conference said.
</P>
<P>
"Asia is the fulcrum for CDMA development," said Don Schrock,
president of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, a U.S.-based wireless
company which owns most of the CDMA patents. "Asian markets are
the most advanced and define most new features and applications
for CDMA," he said.
</P>
<P>
As statistics show, the Asia Pacific region has nearly 30
million of CDMA subscribers by December 1999. The Republic of
Korea and Japan are in a leading position in the use of CDMA,
with ROK boasting 23 million subscribers by end of 1999, and Japan
expecting a subscriber's poll of 10 million by next March.
</P>
<P>
ROK will also be the arena for the debut of the 3G CDMA.
Cdma2000 1x third generation system is expected to be commercially
available by the year-end in ROK.
</P>
<P>
Third Generation CDMA technology is also knocking at the door
of the Chinese market, which is the fast growing market in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Irwin Jacobs, Qualcomm's chairman and chief executive officer,
agreed that the Chinese market "is very exciting" and has much
room for the development of wireless business.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom, the second largest telecommunications provider in
China, has confirmed it would use cdma20001x for its third
generation system and the trials would begin next year.
</P>
<P>
On the manufacturing side, Qualcomm has recently signed
licensing deals with eight top Chinese manufacturers to develop
CDMA handset and infrastructure prototypes based on IS-95 A/B and
3G cdma20001x standard.
</P>
<P>
The 5th Annual CDMA Congress was organized by the CDG, a non-
profit trade association formed by 100 wireless operators and
equipment manufacturers to foster the worldwide development,
implementation and use of cdmaOne, the flagship technology of the
CDG.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Market Exciting: CDMA Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Qualcomm Incorporated, the
pioneer and world leader of CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)
technology, has expressed interest in the fast growing Chinese
market.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese market is already very exciting, it is growing very
rapidly and it will continue to grow rapidly," said Irwin Jacobs,
chairman and chief executive officer of Qualcomm who is attending
the 5th Annual CDMA Congress here from June 12 to 15.
</P>
<P>
"Use of wireless internet access in China is increasing, and for
people's business, education, leisure, there will be more and more
use of internet," the chief executive said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I believed that much of the usage will be wireless, which will
surely cause the business to grow even faster than it is already
growing which is rapidly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qualcomm, the San Diego-based wireless company which owns more
than 10000 CDMA patents, is actively pushing its CDMA technology
in China, according to Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
Qualcomm's China expansion plans centered on China Unicom, the
second largest telecommunications provider in China, which has
been solely authorized by the Chinese government to construct and
operate a CDMA network in the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, China Unicom confirmed that it would use
CDMA20001x, the third generation CDMA technology developed by
Qualcomm for its next generation mobile phone systems and the
trials would begin next year. "Qualcomm will help China Unicom
with information about how the technology is evolving and how they
will be able to start their networks, and any other help they wish,
" Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
On research and development side, Jacobs said his company is
focusing on helping Chinese manufacturers build equipment and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
At present, much of Qualcomm's activities in China will be with
Chinese manufacturers, he said. Those activities include helping
Chinese manufacturers understand "how to build the equipment that
operate with CDMA and easily evolve to the third generation that
will be commercial this year."
</P>
<P>
Focusing on local CDMA production, Qualcomm has signed research
and development deals with eight leading Chinese equipment
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
As licensees of Qualcomm, those companies are expected to
develop CDMA handsets and infrastructure prototypes based on IS-95
A/B and 3G cdma20001x standard.
</P>
<P>
CDMA, a continuous digital transmission technology, is
traditionally a U.S. technology, but a lot of its first-class
technologies have been put into use in Asia, primarily in the
Republic of Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The 3G CDMA technology, or cdma20001x, is entering the Asian
market with a 3G CDMA system expected by be commercially available
by the year end in the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Compared with second generation GSM and CDMA network, the 3G
Telecom system will enable much faster wireless transfer rate than
current systems for things such as video images and other
multimedia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China will soon establish a large
nature reserve in Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in northwest
China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve will protect the ecology, wild animals and
plants, and ensure sufficient water supply in the middle and lower
reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
"We should have an overall plan for the nature reserve," said
Liu Jiyuan, director of the Institute of Geographical Sciences and
Natural Resources of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"A few zones under key protection should be set up in important
sections of the Yellow River," he added.
</P>
<P>
The environment has worsen in Yushu prefecture, causing the
loss of grasslands, desertification in some areas, and the illegal
hunting of rare animals.
</P>
<P>
"The protection of the source of the three rivers, namely the
Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Lancang River, is
conducive to the development of western China, guaranteeing the
growth of national economy and the living quality of people in
southeast Asia," said Chen Jianwei, deputy director of the
Protection Department of the State Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
The Lancang river originates in the Tangula Mountain in Qinghai
and is named Mekong after it enters into Laos, Myanmar, Thailand
and Cambodia.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Under Secretary of State
Thomas Pickering has said that the United States is much concerned
and worried over the terrorism issue in South Asia and if these
concerns are not addressed then Washington would be compelled to
consider other sanctions, a newspaper here reported Thursday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Supports Manila's Handling of Hostage Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia reassured the Philippines
here Thursday that it would continue to support ongoing efforts by
the government to secure the safe release of 21 hostages, mostly
foreigners, now being held by the Abu Sayyaf in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Datuk Serisyed Hamid Alvar said he
relayed this to Philippine President Joseph Estrada during their
meeting in the presidential palace Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I think the visit gives us the opportunity to exchange views
and look at the various constraints, the difficulties we are
facing in trying to find a solution that will take into account
and give important emphasis to the safety and well-being of the
hostages," Alvar said in a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian foreign minister said they are thankful to the
Philippine government "for the manner in which it has executed its
responsibilities, and trying to find ways of ultimately resolving
and getting the hostages free."
</P>
<P>
"So I think in whatever way we can support the Philippines'
efforts we can do so," Alvar said, citing the visit of Malaysia
Red Crescent volunteers who are now in Sulu to tend to the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
According to Alvar, Malaysia does not consider paying ransom
for the release of the hostages. "I do not think ransom at present
is one of the matters seriously discussed or considered," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his meeting with Estrada, he realized that
no efforts are being spared by the Philippine government in
securing the safe release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Alvar also said the Malaysian government considers the Abu
Sayyaf's demand of creating a Sabah Commission to look into the
problems of undocumented Filipinos in Sabah a "non-negotiable"
issue.
</P>
<P>
"It is not something that is to be talked about or debated
during this hostage crisis. The hostages have been taken from a
Malaysian resort and they should be released," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alvar also belied reports that Malaysia is sending its own
negotiators to Sulu, saying Malaysia recognizes the authority of
Philippine officials to handle the matter.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever we do it is in support of the Philippines' effort. We
will not do anything that will jeopardize or undermine these
efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said
the government is now working for more frequent humanitarian
missions by the Red Crescent.
</P>
<P>
Siazon also said during their talks, the president assured
Alvar of the government's emphasis on the safety of the hostages.
</P>

He also said a military solution was not taken up during the

big success," saying that it will do its utmost to help settle the
Korean problem and promote dialogue.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung returned to Seoul Thursday

DPRK's capital.
</P>

Describing the summit as "the start of a dialogue between
Pyongyang and Seoul" and "a very positive step," Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov told reporters in Moscow that
Russia is "optimistic" about the agreements reached at the meeting.
</P>

If the dialogue between Pyongyang and Seoul "develops further,"
he said, "This will contribute to detente in this part of the
world and conditions might appear for reuniting the Korean nation.
"
</P>
<P>
The two sides "must undoubtedly come a long way toward
overcoming mutual prejudices and mistrust and setting up economic
links," Losyukov stressed.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a very difficult thing to do," he added, "But a
first step is important. And it is well that it has been made.

<HEADLINE> North Ireland Secretary Says Police Bill "Open to Change" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary Peter
Mandelson said on Thursday that the government would listen to "
justified concerns" from all sides about legislation to reform the
police force.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson also tried to reassure unionists and nationalists --
who both want to see changes to the Police Bill during its
committee stage -- that there will be "no secret deals or crumbs
thrown to one side, then another."
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland secretary repeated his suggestion that the
police service's new name should change, while the Royal Ulster
Constabulary (RUC)'s name should be retained in the "title deeds."
</P>
<P>
Unionists have particularly opposed the prospect that the RUC's
name and emblems could be dropped, while nationalists and
republicans have said the name must go, as part of changes to the
Protestant-dominated force.
</P>
<P>
The nationalist Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP) said
it will continue to fight to ensure the Bill is brought into line
with the Chris Patten proposals.
</P>
<P>
At a public meeting on policing in west Belfast on Wednesday,
the SDLP said it intended to campaign in the community as well as
on the Commons committee at Westminster.
</P>
<P>
"We want to take our argument into the community, not just into
the House of Commons, to promote our position on Patten and the
Police Bill. We want people to understand when we call on them to
participate in police structures. We want them to be informed so
they can sign up to that with conviction," said SDLP policing
spokesman Alex Attwood.
</P>
<P>
The party has organized more similar meetings across Northern
Ireland for the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The SDLP and Ulster Unionists have two seats each on the
Commons committee, which is working on the Bill.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Unionists have one seat while the two Sinn Fein
MPs do not take their seats in the Commons.

<HEADLINE> South African Official Urges U.N. to Strengthen Peace Mission in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior South African
official on Thursday urged the United Nations to strengthen its
peacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
rather than halt the process.
</P>
<P>
The lack of deployment of the U.N. peacekeeping force could
create a temptation for people to doubt the Lusaka Cease-fire
Agreement again, said Welile Nhlapo, South African Deputy Director-
General of Foreign Affairs in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The full complement of the U.N. Organization Mission for the
DRC must be deployed, and even increased, said Nhlapo, adding that
"we would favor an increase in the numbers.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want people to start saying the Lusaka agreement must
be reviewed," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It was fortunate that up to now there had not been a
generalized undermining of the agreement, Nhlapo noted. The
implementation of the U.N. resolution on the DRC and the Lusaka
agreement was slow, thus leaving gaps for temptation, he said.
</P>
<P>
That is why there has been no disengagement of troops at
certain spots in the DRC, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far only about 200 of the planned 500 military observers are
in place. The U.N. has authorized sending 5,537 military
personnel for its peacekeeping mission in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
DRC President Laurent Kabila earlier had a problem with South
African participation in the peacekeeping mission on the basis of
the country's alleged support for the rebels, but has since
approved it.
</P>
<P>
"Our presence there is not a problem," Nhlapo said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Criket Captain Quits Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- South African criket captain
Hansie Cronje announced in Cape Town on Thursday that he would cut
all ties with the game, apologised for the shame, pain and
humiliation he had caused his family, his country and his teams
mates.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted to the King Commission that he accepted money
from either bookmakers and punters out of greed and stupidity but
denied he had ever fixed a match or performed below his ability.
</P>
<P>
Reading from a prepared statement after taking the oath before
judge Edwin King, Cronje admitted being approached to throw games
soon after becoming captain in 1995 and told of his involvement
with people associated with sports betting until earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
An austere and stressed looking Cronje explained to the
commission how he had been drawn into the murky world of sports
betting by the lure of easy money which later proved to be a trap.
</P>
<P>
Cronje said his fate should serve as a lesson to other players
who are subjected to "exaggerated levels of temptation".
</P>
<P>
"Once the money is accepted you become compromised and it is
difficult to turn back," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that younger players should be educated to the
dangers of sports betting and the "hard realities of commerce".
</P>
<P>
He described how he had been snared by the advances of various
people who he was not sure were bookmakers or sports gamblers.
</P>
<P>
Cronje said he had first been approached in 1995 by a person
called "John". It was suspected that it was the same person who
had offered cash to Australians Mark Waugh and Shane Warne.
</P>
<P>
Reading from a long statement, Cronje admitted he had misled
the public and cricket officials in his earlier statements in an
attempt to protect some of the players he had implicated in his
dealings with bookmakers.
</P>
<P>
However, he also admitted that he had also been motivated by a
degree of self interest.
</P>
<P>
He said he was now telling the truth in order to repair the
damage that had been done to cricket and to himself.
</P>
<P>
Conje's testimony was adjourned to Tuesday next week. Cronje
will face cross examination when the hearing resumes on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Globalization Key to World Economy: U.S. Consul General (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's experience with
globalization was the creation of a vigorous cycle of growth and
higher living standards, said Michael Klosson, U.S. consul general
in Hong Kong, here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at a luncheon hosted by the Hong Kong
General Chamber of Commerce, Klosson said that the world economy
of the next decades will see the same combination of growth, which
features better environmental protection, safer factories,
stronger labor protection and job creation.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it must be taken into concrete consideration
on how to shape globalization if people want to sustain the global
process of liberalization and integration.
</P>
<P>
He also outlined the three main tasks that the experience of
recent decades suggested.
</P>
<P>
First, individual economies must create open, market-based,
competitive environments supported by good macroeconomic policies,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Second, economies must put in place sound institutions,
governed by law and unhindered by corruption, to help the benefits
of growth reach all levels of society, he continued.
</P>
<P>
"Third, working through international economic institutions, we
must find ways to ensure a strong global economic framework that
facilitates trade, investment, and capital flows, sets clear rules,
promotes transparency, responds quickly and effectively to crises,
provides policy guidance and, where appropriate, financial
assistance," he added.
</P>
<P>
He lauded Hong Kong for its outstanding performance in the
three aspects, noting that Hong Kong is now a leader in free trade
and budgetary responsibility, and Hong Kong sets positives
examples in combating corruption and weathering financial crisis.

<P>
Klosson said that trade liberalization is essential and that
economies can benefit fully from globalization if market signals
are fully reported, and not distorted by trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
"Since the last time the U.S. unemployment rate touched 4
percent, in January of 1970, our economy has grown to more than 9
trillion U.S. dollars, manufacturing output nearly tripled, and 50
million men and women joined the work-force," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Similarly in Hong Kong, during the same 30-year period, the
economy grew from 4 billion U.S. dollars to 158 billion U.S.
dollars, and average per capita income grew from 959 U.S. dollars
to more than 23,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Again, trade and free trade policies were an important engine
of this growth: trade went from 143 percent of GDP in 1970 to 223
percent now," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Klosson stressed the benefits of liberalization and a policy of
relying on markets are the best response to globalization, with
governments providing legal and regulatory frameworks that
facilitate rather than impede the development of markets.
</P>
<P>
The May 24 vote of the U.S. House of Representative on the
Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status for China has put
in view China's accession to the World Trade Organization, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was an enormously helpful development for the U.S.-China
relationship as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Klosson also voiced the expectation that globalization will
bring out the best in the U.S.-Hong Kong relationship by building
on their shared commitments to the rule of law, clean government,
open flow of information and free market economics.

<HEADLINE> WCO Revised Treaty Gets Five More Signatories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Five more countries became
signatories to the revised World Customs Organization Convention
on Thursday, which is aimed at facilitating customs procedures.
</P>
<P>
China, the Congo, Lesotho, Latvia and Slovakia joined Algeria,
Sri Lanka, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Australia are the countries that
have signed the Kyoto Convention since its revision in June last
year.
</P>
<P>
The WCO still needs 30 more countries to sign the revised
customs convention in order for it to take effect.
</P>
<P>
The revised convention has established modern international
standards in customs procedures. Designed to enable more rapid
clearance of goods, people and conveyances, the new procedures are
expected to maximize the use of new information technology and
modern clearance techniques based on risk analysis.
</P>
<P>
The signatory nations will facilitate international trade,
stimulate economic growth and provide targeted customs control at
their borders and frontiers after they have incorporated the
revised convention into national legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels-based World Customs Organization now has 151
members, of which 61 signed the previous Kyoto Convention that
took effect on September 25, 1974.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian President Vladimir
Putin and German Chancellor Gerhard agreed to improve bilateral
political and economic relations during their talks here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In spite of differences over Chechnya and Kosovo, the two
leaders both stressed that Russia and Germany should promote
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed we want to make a substantial new start in bilateral
relations," said Schroeder at a joint news briefing with Putin.
</P>
<P>
"Germany is the most important economic partner for Russia in
Europe," Putin noted.
</P>
<P>
Putin is expected to seek a reduction in Russia's 75 billion
mark (37 billion U.S. Dollars) debt to Germany, Russia's largest
foreign creditor.
</P>
<P>
Trade is also a top issue in the talks. Putin is scheduled to
meet with some CEOs of big companies such as Volkswagen AG.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Germany both are opposed to the U.S.-proposed
National Missile Defense (NMD) system for fear it will destroy the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and open a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
Putin will also meet with German President Johannes Rau, former
chancellor Helmut Kohl and members of the opposition.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankans Play Cricket Despite Ongoing War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Cricket crazy Sri Lankans continue
to play cricket despite the ongoing conflict in the northern
Jaffna peninsula. Their 100th test match is being played against
Pakistan in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The match commenced here Wednesday moments after a suicide
bomber made an unsuccessful attempt on an airforce bus carrying
injured airmen. The suicide attack was carried out at a town close
to Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Since the country was put on a war footing in early May,
musical shows and other entertainment related activities have been
put on hold. But the game of cricket will continue. No one has
suggested to put off or cancel cricket match.
</P>
<P>
Nothing stops the people of the island nation from playing or
watching cricket. It is their national past time. They play the
games in the paddy fields, on the beach and on the roads.
</P>
<P>
Two people have died of heart attacks watching the game of
cricket. It is reported that they could not live the anxious
moments of the game.
</P>
<P>
Some people would say Sri Lankans gets disheartened when a
wicket of countrymen falls than a soldier dying of a terrorist
bullet. Many refuse to admit it but the country has become so
passionate about the game.
</P>
<P>
Volleyball is recognized as Sri Lanka's national game. However
cricket is considered as the country's unofficial national game.
It receives more government patronage than volleyball.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka won the cricket world cup in 1996 beating Australia
and received world recognition. The national team was awarded the
country's highest honors for their victory. The country received
international test status in 1982. Sri Lanka played their first 5-
day test match against England in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Many political leaders both past and present have held high
office in the country's cricket administration. Late President J.
R. Jayawardane was one of them. He even declared a holiday in Sri
Lanka when the country won a match against India and became the
Asian Champions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- East Asia has re-emerged as the
fastest growing region in the world, the World Bank said in a
report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The "East Asia: Recovery and Beyond" report said that recovery
has begun and is going steadily in the region. However, recovery
will depend on the success of restructuring the industrial,
commercial, public and social sectors in East Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
World Bank economist and chief author of the report Richard
Newfarmer said that conditions have improved greatly since
September, 1998 when the World Bank released "East Asia: Road of
Recovery" Report.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank also praised China for maintaining the stability
of its currency during the Asian financial crisis, saying that
China played a very active role in the region during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank official said that China's move to develop the
western areas of the country provides a new opportunity of
cooperation between the World Bank and China. He said that the
Bank is looking forward to providing economic studies, and
expertise on project development and loans.

<HEADLINE> PNG Ruling Party Leader Reiterates One-China Policy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A ruling party leader of Papua New
Guinea said today that it values the one-China policy, and is
fully prepared to develop its relations with China and the
Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow it (former Papua New Guinea government's
establishing diplomatic relations with Taiwan) to happen again, as
long as our party is in government," said Jamie Graham, vice-
president of the ruling People's Democratic Movement (PDM), in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Beijing, Graham, who is on his first visit to
China, visited Shanghai for an international city conference, and
attended celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of sister-city
relations between Moresby, capital city of Papua New Guinea, and
Jinan, capital of east China's Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of my trip to Beijing is to meet officials of
the ruling party in the Chinese government, and to understand how
the government functions, and the party machinery operates behind
the government," he said, adding his visit is also a part of
preparations for a visit to China by Prime Minister Mekere Morauta
early next year aiming at formalizing cooperation for the two
parties. Morauta is president of the PDM.
</P>
<P>
Calling his China visit "a fact-finding mission and eye-opening
", Graham said that he was happy with party-to-party exchanges to
promote understanding and cooperation between them.

<HEADLINE> Dai Calls for Effective Supervision over Short-term Capital (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank governor Dai
Xianglong today urged the international community to carefully
monitor the flow of short-term capital.
</P>
<P>
The international community "should establish necessary rules
and standards as soon as possible to restrain the irregular flow
of capital, and strengthen supervision over highly-leveraged
institutions and off-shore centers," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ongoing 21st Century Forum -- Conference 2000
here, the governor put forward several suggestions to reform the
international monetary system.
</P>
<P>
"The violent movements of exchange values among the major
currencies bring along huge risks for BOPs and the stability of
currencies in developing countries," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Major developed countries should assume a responsible attitude
toward coordinating their macroeconomic policies to minimize
exchange fluctuations of major currencies.
</P>
<P>
Dai maintained that that regional integration is the foundation
for economic globalization.

"We hope that the U.S. dollar would stay stable. We welcome the
launch of the Euro and support the agreement signed by ASEAN (the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations) members, China, Japan and
the Republic of Korea to initiate currency swaps," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
The governor emphasized that the monopoly by a handful of
developed countries in making rules must changed.
</P>
<P>
The international community should establish a new system of
coordination and ensure that the interests of developing countries
not be sacrificed, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome informal dialogues such as G-20," Dai said, adding
that China will continue to support and take part in G-20-
initiated activities, support IMF (International Monetary Fund)
reforms and contribute to the establishment of a new international
monetary and financial system.
</P>
<P>
On the role of the IMF, Dai suggested that the world
organization focus on two issues. First, IMF should have an early
warning mechanism to effectively prevent financial crisis. Second,
it should provide liquidity assistance in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference attracted over 500 participants,
including statesmen and leaders from nearly 20 countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bankers Support Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese bankers attending the 2000
Conference of "21st Century Forum" here have voiced their support
for globalization in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar today, the bankers urged to improve the
country's financial system and accelerate financial reform to meet
the challenges of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Yi Gang, a deputy secretary-general of the Monetary Policy
Committee of the People's Bank of China, said that opening-up in
the banking industry has helped China attract huge foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Yi said that China's role in becoming increasingly part of the
global financial system will be beneficial to China and help speed
up the reform and development of the country's banking industry.
</P>
<P>
Opening-up should bring local financial businesses into
increasingly fierce international competition and lead to greater
challenges to China's macro-control and supervision in the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xuebing, president of the China Construction Bank, said
that China's financial industry must "keep in touch" with the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
China should opening up its banking markets and play a part in
the restructuring of the international monetary system, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China must step up bank reform focusing on the reforms
of property and personnel systems, while reducing government
interference in the banking system and easing control over the
industry.
</P>
<P>
He also called for strengthening the rule of law in the
industry.

<HEADLINE> Inequality in Globalization Highlighted at Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Economists from developing
countries have urged the world to be aware of the issue of
inequality in economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by the economists here today at the 2000
Conference of the 21st Century Forum.
</P>
<P>
Globalization will surely clash with state sovereignty and
demands that part of the sovereignty be abandoned, mainly the
limitation on the circulation of commodities and production
factors, said Zhu Gaofeng, a vice president of the Chinese Academy
of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
While globalization is speeding up the economic development of
the world, some of the poorest countries may become so-called "
marginalized" nations, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Virabongsa Ramangkura, a former deputy prime minister of
Thailand, cited his country as an example of how developing
countries could fall victims in the hands of international brokers
and investors in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. The
Crisis exposed the unfavorable status of developing countries in
the process of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Fan Gang, director of the China National Economy Institute
pointed out that the international financial system is based on
the interests of industrialized nations and does not reflect the
interests of developing countries which are "more vulnerable to
risks in the international financial market.
</P>
<P>
Participants reached a consensus that developing countries do
not oppose the globalization, but only seek for a balanced
development and equal opportunity to enter the market of developed
countries. Developed nations must be willing to integrate with
developing countries, they held.
</P>
<P>
Ketumile Joni Masire, former president of the Republic of
Boswana, stressed that a sustained development of the global
economy can not be realized without international cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Cross Border Efforts Urged to Combat Pollution, Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The business and Industrial
sectors in China's inland areas and Hong Kong were urged to expand
the cross-border cooperation to further strengthen environmental
improvement projects, an environmental conference here was told
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the fast economic growth in the past decades, China is
placing more emphasis on environmental issues, as the demands
placed on the environment are gradually increasing, Wang Jirong,
vice minister of the State Environmental Protection Administration,
said when addressing the opening ceremony of the conference.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve the environmental goals that we have set is a
difficult task," Wang said, adding "We feel particularly torn
when funds are needed for the construction of environmental
infrastructure or when advanced technologies are needed for the
control of industrial pollution."
</P>
<P>
Through mutual efforts, the inland areaas' environmental market
could be further developed, thus contributing to the improvement
of China's environment and protection of the global environment,
Wang added.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, between 1991 and 1995, foreign capital used
on environment projects amounted to 1.117 billion U.S. dollars and
the figure between 1996 to 2000 is expected to reach 4 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"There is a bright future for the market," Wang said, adding
that the pollution treatment business in inland areas is estimated
to value at 5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Denise Yue, acting financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, said at the conference that the
participation of multinational corporation would no doubt
accelerate the engine for international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The conference is another example of the private sector taking
the lead in an endeavor which has full government support, Yue
said.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 environmental officials and business executives
from the inland areas and Hong Kong attended the 9th annual
business and industry environment conference, which is organized
by the Private Sector Committee on the Environment.
</P>
<P>
This year's conference will focus on the financing of
environmental business and the achieving of cross-border
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Calls for National Unity Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy Thursday called for the formation of a national unity
government with the opposition Likud Party in light of the
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Levy said the difficulties
with the Palestinians make it imperative for Israel to have a
national unity government.
</P>
<P>
He added that no government would be able to get everything it
wanted in a peace settlement with the Palestinians and it was time
for the nation to stand united.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the situation makes it necessary for all of us
to find the way to national unity at a difficult time like this,"
said Levy. "This is a responsible approach."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian talks, Levy said: "I
think there is a very wide gap between what the Palestinians want
to achieve ... and our position." He said the Palestinians have
exaggerated expectations in talks that already cannot be wrapped up
on schedule.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said Israel wanted to hand over another 1
percent of the West Bank in the third interim withdrawal, due by
June 23, but the Palestinians sought a much wider land transfer.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians now have full or partial control over 40
percent of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in line with interim peace
deals signed since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat is
scheduled to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton Thursday in a bid to
boost the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from both sides resumed talks near Washington on
Tuesday, aiming to reach a permanent peace agreement before
September 13 on final status issues such as the status of
Jerusalem, the future of Jewish settlements, water resources,
border and refugees.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his meeting with Clinton, Arafat expressed pessimism
over the talks, saying that no progress was made.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Saudi Arabian Okaz daily in the West Bank city
of Ramallah shortly before leaving for Washington Wednesday, Arafat
said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak would use a dispute with the
ultra-Orthodox religious Shas party which has decided to quit
Israel's coalition government as an excuse for "more
procrastination in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Barak telephoned Clinton Wednesday night, hoping the president
can persuade Arafat to postpone the "third withdrawal" until a
framework agreement for the final status arrangement is reached.
</P>
<P>
Israel has threatened that if the Palestinians reject its
request and insist on the withdrawal being carried out on time, it
will stick to a decision by the previous government that the third
withdrawal will include only 1 percent of the West Bank territory.
</P>
<P>
Justifying the Israeli stand, Levy said "They interpret (the
third withdrawal) as almost all areas except for certain security
installations."
</P>
<P>
"That means Israel would give up all its security, political and
national assets -- and then if it didn't meet their demands later
on issues like (the return of Palestinian) refugees or Jerusalem,
it would be left without peace and without assets."
</P>
<P>
Levy said he would not be surprised if the Palestinians resorted
to violence again in the West Bank and Gaza to pressure Israel to
make concessions.
</P>
<P>
Last month, six Palestinians were killed and more than 1,000
wounded by live ammunition or rubber-coated metal bullets in
clashes with Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israel said 40 Israeli soldiers and 22 civilians were hurt in
nine days of violence, which began with Palestinian demonstrations
for prisoner releases.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Defense Force has been preparing for another round
of violent clashes with the Palestinians once the current round of
peace talks ends without achieving the targets.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian negotiators have been insisting on settling the
interim issues first before setting about the framework on the
final status issues.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the Israeli positions on the third withdrawal and
prisoner release, they turned down the Israeli "good-will" gesture
to release three Palestinian prisoners and suspended talks with
their Israeli counterparts in Washington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Domestically, Israel's ruling "One Israel" headed by Barak is
having tense negotiations with coalition partners in a bid to end
the long-running coalition crisis.
</P>
<P>
Likud Leader Ariel Sharon Wednesday rejected the possibility of
forming a national unity government with "One Israel," citing
Likud's positions on the peace process are "incompatible" with "One
Israel."

<HEADLINE> Iran Ready to Export Carpets to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran is ready to export 4 million U.
S. dollars worth of hand-woven carpets to the United States in the
current calendar year starting March 20, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The decision has been made following a series of negotiations
with U.S. businessmen," said Mohammad Reza Kamali, managing-
director of the Union of Carpets Cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. has recently voiced its readiness to import 1
billion dollars worth of Persian carpets.
</P>
<P>
Washington declared the lifting of bans on major Iranian non-oil
exports -- carpets, pistachio and caviar -- in March as an overture
to Iran for thawing relations. The two countries severed relations
20 years ago following the Islamic revolution and the hostage-
taking incident in the U.S. embassy in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Kamali said the export of Persian carpets faces many hurdles,
including the government's foreign exchange certificate requirement
for exporters, which in the past years "has boosted its domestic
market, but struck a heavy blow to its exports."
</P>
<P>
He said other main hurdles include insufficient marketing for
Iranian carpets in the developing countries of Africa, Southeastern
Asia and the Far East and lack of a single organization responsible
for running the carpet industry.
</P>
<P>
He also called on officials to pave the way for introduction of
Persian carpets to new markets in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.

than 30 percent is exported officially, the daily quoted the
managing director of a saffron export company as saying.
</P>
<P>
Saffron exporters are required to submit foreign exchange
certificates, which is one of the main factors behind illegal
exporting, the official said, adding that the high price of this
product in the international market is also encouraging smuggling.

dollar equivalent grant for the project would be extended through
the Global Environment Facility, and 3.35 million dollars would be
provided by the Turkish government.

<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China is to build a museum to
display the cultural relics found in the world-famous "Sutras Cave
" of Mogao Grotto in Dunhuang, west China's Gansu province.
</P>
<P>
The museum, scheduled for opening in July, will be built on the
former residence of Taoist Wang Yuanlu, who found the Cave by
chance about 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang, located on the ancient Silk Road, has recorded and
pictured the social life, people's ideology, belief of China in
the Middle Ages (from the 3rd to the 9th century). It gathers the
civilized results in philosophy, arts, literature, history,
science, politics, economy and military affairs.
</P>
<P>
The "Sutras Cave," actually a small stone room, contained
thousands of cultural relics, priceless manuscripts, documents,
Buddhist instruments through the ages.
</P>
<P>
Discovery of the room immediately attracted many foreign
careerists and explorers, who came and stole hundreds of hand-
copied sutras and printed sutras, exquisite embroidery objects,
colored sculptures. A considerable portion of the cultural relics
from the "Sutras Cave" have been found in museums, cultural
organizations and individuals in more than 10 countries.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yanke, best known Chinese scholar, described the history
of the discovery of the "Sutras Cave" as "a heartbreaking history.
"
</P>
<P>
Peng Jingzhang, researcher with the Dunhuang Academy, said that
the purpose of the museum is to remind Chinese people that the
heartbreaking history of Dunhuang should not happen again.
</P>
<P>
The museum is to exhibit about 1,000 pieces of cultural
antiques found in the "Sutras Cave" together with other replicas,
introduction charts and graphs, video materials and computer
search service.

<HEADLINE> IMF Applauds Thai Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The board of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed "great satisfaction" with Thailand's
economy recovery, but urged the country to make more efforts on
corporate and banking restructuring to sustain the momentum.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, we are very pleased with the progress Thailand has
made in the last three years," IMF's Asia-Pacific division chief
Ranjit Teja said at a press conference here Thursday
</P>
<P>
Thailand, one of the countries hit the hardest by the 1997
economic crisis, is set to graduate from the IMF-led program on
June 19.
</P>
<P>
Teja said the Thai recovery has been proceeding very well,
recording a four percent growth in gross domestic products (GDP)
in 1999 and expecting to achieve four to five percent GDP increase
this year.
</P>
<P>
He listed exports, consumption, investment and low inflation as
drivers behind the recovery.
</P>
<P>
"Our assessment is that the progress has been made, and the
recovery will not be interrupted," Teja said, adding that to make
the recovery sustained the Thai government should give full
attention to corporate and banking restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The non-performing loans (NPLs) in Thai banking sector still
remain large, and corporate debt has been restructured. "(Whether)
the glass is half full or half empty depends on how you look at it,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand stopped drawing funds from the 17.2 billion U.S.
dollars package last June. The country received a total of 14.2
billion dollars in credits from multilateral and bilateral
contributors under the program.
</P>
<P>
To qualify the fund, Thailand had to adhere to strict IMF
economic performance standards, with its compliance periodically
reviewed.
</P>
<P>
The IMF was accused of applying inappropriate conditions on the
package, including placing stringent curbs on government spending
and miscalculating the depth of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The fund was also criticized for applying the same solution to
the very different crises occurring in Thailand, South Korea and
Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> SADC Experts Propose Creation of Regional Diamond Technical Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Technical advisors from the
southern African countries have proposed to create an "
international technical committee" of diamond production and sales
with the aim of supervising and controlling diamond production and
trading in the region, said a document issued here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was made on Wednesday by a meeting of experts
from the member countries of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) and international specialists, which started on
Tuesday in the Angolan capital city Luanda.
</P>
<P>
According to a source of the Angolan Geologic Institute, once
the committee is founded, it should be a supervisor of diamond
production and commercialization and be responsible for the issue
of certificates of diamond produced in the region. The control
over illicit sales and purchases of diamond without certificates
should be also a task of the planned committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee should be financed by the producers and salesman
of the product. The members of the committee should meet at least
once a year. A central database supporting the function of the
committee will also be created, in a bid to realize the
internationalization of the technique in the diamond sector,
according to the document.
</P>
<P>
This proposal will be put forward at the SADC ministerial
conference on the diamond sector, which will be held in South
Africa in August or September.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Angola, South Africa, Belgium, United Kingdom,
Namibia and Botswana, some enterprises and non-governmental
organizations attended the two-day meeting.

<HEADLINE> Swiss National Bank Raises Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss National Bank (SNB)
Thursday announced an interest rate rise of 50 basic points.
</P>
<P>
The bank increased the target range for the three-month Swiss
franc LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) from a range of 2.5-3.
5 percent to 3.0-4.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase should help the Swiss economy stem a risk of
inflation as the domestic economy continues to boom, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
First quarter economic growth in Switzerland came in at a high
of 4 percent year-on-year, with the unemployment rate falling to
1.9 percent, an eight-year low.
</P>
<P>
The move, economists said, following a similar increase by the
European Central Bank last week, will help maintain a stable Swiss
franc-euro exchange rate, one of the SNB's key objectives.
</P>
<P>
The bank has just lifted its target range for interest rates on
March 23.
</P>
<P>
As Switzerland's central bank, the SNB forecast a 3-percent
economic growth in 2000 and warned that inflation would probably
push above 2 percent in 2001 despite of this hike.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the bank said that inflation should again
fall below 2 percent in 2002 and 2003.

China Urges Cultural Advancement in Western Region
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Culture recently urged localities to do
more for promoting cultural advancement in the country's western
region. The ministry will provide special funds for building
cultural facilities in rural areas, such as libraries, museums,
movie theaters and cultural centers. Meanwhile, the ministry plans
to organize well-known writers and artists to plunge themselves to
the thick of life in the west.
</P>
<P>
More Developed Countries Open Consulates in West China
</P>
<P>
As more and more multinational corporations extend their
business to west China, an increasing number of developed
countries have been setting up consular establishments in the
region. To date, Japan, Canada, Britain, the United States and
several Southeast Asian countries have already opened consulates
or consulates-general in the municipality of Chongqing, Chengdu,
capital of Sichuan Province, and Kunming, capital of Yunnan
Province. Germany and Australia have recently sent study teams to
make preparations for setting up their consular establishments.
</P>
<P>
Economists Predict Narrower East-West Economic Gap
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), a government
think tank, predicted that the disparity in east and west China's
economic development will be substantially narrowed by the year
2030. The per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in China's
western areas would reach 3,000 to 5,000 U.S. dollars between 2020
and 2030. Infrastructure for industry, education and information
transmission will be perfected; rational urban planning will give
rise to a network of closely and conveniently linked cities; the
current manufacturing industry that is heavily dependent on
natural resources will be transformed into a technology-intensive
one; and modern farming and forestry will be take shape.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Urges Construction Industry to Go High-Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The wider application of
information technology (IT) would benefit local construction
industry and drive it forward, said Lee Shing-see, secretary for
works of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote speech at the Federation of Asian &AMP;
Pacific Electrical Contractors Association and International Forum
of Electrical Contractors 2000 Conference, Lee said the use of IT
in local construction industry was on the low side, as compared
with other local industries and with its overseas counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He said the wider use of IT would help the industry enhance
efficiency, promote cross-discipline integration, facilitate
construction work flow planning and forge a better match between
client requirements and the finished product.
</P>
<P>
"The government of the Hong Kong SAR promotes the wider use of
IT," the secretary noted, adding that the government also formed a
task force to formulate an e-tendering strategy for works
contracts in July last year.
</P>
<P>
He said there should be greater emphasis on the application of
IT in managing the project delivery process and turning round the
management's perception of how IT could be used to enhance
construction efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"We will embark on a consultancy study on these issues later
this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For the years to come, Hong Kong will maintain the momentum of
infrastructure developments. We have embarked upon a series of
projects including the West Rail, Science Park, and Disneyland
Theme Park," he said
</P>
<P>
He believed that all these projects would demand a pool of
electrical expertise.

<HEADLINE> Barak Seeks "Package Deal" to End Coalition Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- In a new bid to solve the running
coalition crisis, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is considering
transferring the control of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party's
education network from Education Ministry to another ministry so as
to wrest it from the hands of Education Minister Yossi Sarid.
</P>
<P>
Barak reportedly made the suggestion to Shas on Wednesday during
negotiations between the ruling One Israel party and Shas in an
effort to prevent the largest coalition partner with 17 seats in
the Knesset (Parliament) from quitting the coalition at next
Sunday's cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Shas' decision-making body, Council of Torah Sages, a day
earlier instructed the party's cabinet ministers to tender letters
of resignation on Sunday to protest against what they called the
ongoing "prosecution of Torah institutes."
</P>
<P>
The dragging dispute centers on Sarid's refusal to grant Deputy
Minister of Education Meshulam Nahari, from Shas, authority over
the religious party's extensive educational system. Shas also
claims that it is not getting the funds it was promised in the
coalition agreement and is not being permitted to take an active
part in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speculations here say that Barak may transfer the control over
the school system to the Culture Ministry, or to the Finance
Ministry or even to the Prime Minister's office.
</P>
<P>
Officials close to Barak confirmed the idea of transfer, which
was first reported by Israel's Army Radio. A subsequent statement
issued by Barak's office said the report was "not accurate,"
explaining that the proposal had not been made officially to Shas,
but instead had been raised as an idea during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Officials involved in the negotiations were quoted by the
Ha'aretz daily as saying that there was also another proposal,
under which a ministerial committee headed by Barak, would be
formed to decide on every issue of dispute concerning the education
network that might come up in the future between Sarid and Shas.
</P>
<P>
That idea has been rejected in the past by Sarid. Sarid said
Wednesday evening that he has been assured by those conducting the
negotiations for One Israel that "they do not know of such a
proposal."
</P>
<P>
He noted that if and when the proposal was put forward
officially, he would respond to it according to the decision to be
made by his left-wing Meretz party.
</P>
<P>
As part of the intense activities to keep Shas within the
coalition, Justice Minister Yossi Beilin of One Israel met
Wednesday with Health Minister Shlomo Benizri from Shas to discuss
the legal procedures involved in legitimizing Shas' private radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
The view in One Israel, says Ha'aretz, is that Barak wants to
work out a "package deal" with Shas to include the following
elements: a total and final solution of the problems of the
educational network, Knesset passage of a bill to legitimize the
private radio stations, Shas' commitment to vote against the bill
regarding the referendum on the Golan Height submitted by Likud
Knesset member Silvan Shalon and the addition of Shas leader Eli
Yishai to a small forum of ministers who will handle the diplomatic
process with Palestinians and perhaps later with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
With the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks entering a critical
stage, Barak is in dire need to a quick end to the coalition crisis
with Shas, whose support is of pivotal importance to any agreement
he may strike with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> No Evidence of Tamil Rebel Activity: Thai Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- There is no evidence to
substantiate suspicions that the Tamil Tigers, the separatist
rebels of Sri Lanka, use southern Thailand as a base to procure
provisions, arms and ammunition, the Thai government said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
And neither there is any proof that a half-built submersible
found at a shipyard on Phuket island, 862 kilometers south of
Bangkok, was meant for sabotage activities in Sri Lanka, according
to a report from the Thai government.
</P>
<P>
The shipyard is owned by a Sri Lanka-born Tamil with a
Norwegian passport, and he is now detained by local police for
illegally possessing radar and sonar equipment, it said.
</P>
<P>
Police of Phuket island will soon hand over their investigation
report about the case to the provincial prosecutor, for a decision
on further legal action, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Solomon Militants Agree to Hand Back Control of Honiara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Solomons Malaita Eagle Force
(MEF) signed Thursday an agreement allowing police to enforce law
and order on the streets of the capital city of Honiara.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press reported that they also agreed
to return commandeered police vehicles to the central police
station so that normal patrols could resume.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Solomons policemen are Malaitans and it was
reported that many of the officers returning to duty were
Malaitans who had joined the MEF's coup on June 5, while ethnic
Guadalcanal police were still absent.
</P>
<P>
The MEF refused to surrender arms seized in a raid on the
police armory until a new prime minister is elected to replace
Bartholomew Ulufa'alu. Meanwhile, it rejected Ulufa'alu's proposal
for the establishment of a committee of MPs to negotiate an arms
surrender and peace talks within 14 days.
</P>
<P>
The MEF launched a military coup last week, detained the Prime
Minister Ulufa'alu and took Honiara under its control.
</P>
<P>
Ulufa'alu resigned Tuesday to clear the way for a peaceful
resolution. He complained Australia and New Zealand rebuffed his
demand for military intervention.
</P>
<P>
Australia has offered the Navy's landing ship HMAS Manoora,
moored off Honiara, as a possible venue for peace talks and moved
it closer to shore Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic residents in Guadalcanal, the main island in the
Solomons archipelago, are angry at Malaitan settlers accusing them
of occupying land and top jobs. During the past 18 months, the
Guadalcanal militia Isatabu Freedom Movement drove out thousands
of Malaitans.
</P>
<P>
The MEF insists on financial compensation for their lost land
and property.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Finance Minister to Present New Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister Chris
Okemo will make its budget debut for the next financial year
starting from July 2000 to June 2001 in Parliament here Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The 2000/2001 budget will specifically address the immediate
and medium term projections of the Kenyan government aimed at
stemming poverty among the populace, the state-run Kenya Times
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The proposals by the Treasury are likely to be aimed primarily
at prodding the economy towards a recovery path after suffering a
battering over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Following the suspension of aid by the International Monetary
Fund in July 1997, Kenya's economy has dwindled gradually as
investors pulled out of the country. The economic growth rate for
1998 and 1999 was 1.8 percent and 1.4 percent respectively, as
against 2.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The budget will also be presented against a backdrop of severe
drought and the threat of food security. It is anticipated that
the budget will look into ways of ensuring food security and more
duty waivers could be expected on specific import goods to stem
the situation.
</P>
<P>
The budget will seek to deal with the power sector which is
currently under severe straining caused by the prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
Revenue collection will also be a priority in this year's
budget which covers other areas such as the privatization of
parastatals, infrastructure, development and rehabilitation of the
existing projects to be addressed.

<HEADLINE> Blind people to Increase in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Specialists said Tanzania is
expected to have 450,000 blind persons by the year 2025, rising
from the present 300,000, if necessary measures are not taken,
local newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Brian Savage, of the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center,
said on Tuesday at a week-long workshop on Community Eye Health
held in northern town of Moshi that half of the existing 300,000
blind Tanzanians were caused by cataract.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, organized by Kilimanjaro Christian Medical
College of Tumainin University in Collaboration with the National
Lotteries Charities Board and the London-based International
Center for Eye Health, discussed strategies for the prevention of
blindness.
</P>
<P>
On the magnitude of global blindness, Dr. Andrew Brown from
Leeds, United Kingdom, said there are an estimated 50 million
blind people out of the world's six billion population, while 150
million people are with visual impairment.
</P>
<P>
He said cataract is accounting for half of the total blindness
in the world, followed by glaucoma, reflective errors, trachoma,
diabetic retinopathy, age-related muscular degeneration (AMD),
onchocercosis and vitamin A deficiency.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said that although most of the causes of blindness are
preventable but there are not enough eye doctors, with one doctor
for every 1 million people in Africa, 10 in India and China, 40 in
Europe and 50 in America.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a senior official said that between 2,000 and 4,000
Tanzanians go blind every year because of iron deficiency
disorders mostly from leguminous plants.
</P>
<P>
The Minister for Agriculture and Cooperatives William Kusila
told another workshop in Dar Es Salaam that these blind people are
from over six million others who have Vitamin A deficiency.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 9 million other Tanzanians are at risk of
getting iron deficiency disorders with high rates of maternal and
child malnutrition, morbidity and mortality.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government is making special efforts to
curb the problem, urging international organizations and donors to
provide both technical and financial assistance.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Ends Second Visit to Burundi on Peace Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Burundi peace facilitator
Nelson Mandela Wednesday concluded his second visit to Bujumbura
in another bid to find a breakthrough in the long-running peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Burundi President Pierre Buyoya praised Mandela's visit as "a
very important step in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he was confident that CNDD-FDD and FNL, the
dissident Hutu rebel groups, would join the all-party talks,
which will be held in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha in July
for a possible peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
But he failed to make any progress on the issue of political
prisoners, stressing that discussions would continue.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya commented that it was very important that Mandela
personally came to visit the people of Burundi, to talk with them,
and to understand their fears, worries and emotions surrounding
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, chosen as mediator by leaders of the Great Lakes
region last December, has twice visited Burundi, the war-ravaged
tiny central African state.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, which began in Arusha in June 1998, are
currently dealing in four committees with the affairs of Burundi
conflict, democracy and good governance, peace and security,
economic reconstruction and return of refugees.

PYONGYANG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The June of this year at the
turn of the millennium will forever be remembered on the Korean
Peninsula, as the top leaders of the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) and Republic of Korea met here from Tuesday to
Thursday for the first inter-Korean summit after a 55-year
division of the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong Il, chairman of the DPRK National Defense Commission,
and Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People

exchanging views on issues of common concerns.
</P>
<P>
The landmark summit clearly reflected both the worldwide trend

</P>
<P>
It came as a pleasant surprise for Kim Dae-jung to see Kim Jong
Il greeting him at the airport and the warm welcome scenes
involving 600,000 citizens lining Pyongyang streets. The warm
welcome made a good start for the historic summit.
</P>
<P>
During their four-hour meeting on Wednesday, the two Kims
discussed such major issues as peace on the peninsula, national
reunification, easing of tension, and economic cooperation and
exchanges, culminating in the signing of the historic North-South
Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming the three principles for national reunification,
namely peace, independence and national unity, as set in the 1972
North-South Joint Communique, the two sides agreed in the joint
declaration to start exchange of visits by separated family
members, to promote balanced development of the national economy
through cooperation, to promote exchanges and cooperation in the
fields of society, culture, sports, public health and environment
and to establish a dialogue mechanism between the two governments
at an earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Kim Jong Il accepted Kim Dae-jung's invitation for a
visit to Seoul, promising a continuation of the top-level inter-
Korea dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders hailed the summit as of great significance for
strengthening mutual understanding, developing North-South
relations and realizing peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
The just-concluded summit is apparently a milestone in easing
the tension on the peninsula, as it outlined new scenarios for the
realization of reconciliation and unity of the Korean nation,
exchange and cooperation, and peace and reunification of the
Korean Peninsula, thereby making contributions to peace in Asia
and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
The 1972 North-South Joint Communique first indicated the
Korean people's desire for independent and peaceful national
reunification and was the first step toward the improvement of the
North-South relations. And now the Pyongyang summit opened a new
chapter in the history of the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
After all, one summit is far from being enough to remove the 55-
year-long distrust between the two sides, more so with differences
in social systems and ideologies taken into account.
</P>
<P>
Greater courage and resolution is needed to see the agreements
fully implemented and reach the ultimate goal of peaceful
reunification of the peninsula.

<HEADLINE> WWF Calls for Better Protection of European Wildlife Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Warning that almost a third of
Europe's important wildlife sites will not be protected under
proposals put forward by European governments, the Worldwide Fund
for Nature (WWF) has urged the European Commission to protect an
extra 2,326 sites in European Union (EU) countries.
</P>
<P>
In a press release received here Thursday, the conservation
organization said that the 15 EU member states are not nominating
enough sites to guarantee the survival of threatened species such
as the brown bear, lynx, wolf, otter, harbor porpoise and
loggerhead turtle.
</P>
<P>
"European governments should not be allowed to exclude almost
one in three of Europe's important wildlife sites from protection
under the Habitats Directive," said Sandra Jen, WWF's European
Biodiversity Policy Officer.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a tragedy if species like the brown bear, the
Iberian lynx and the harbor porpoise became extinct in Europe
because member states failed to protect enough sites when they had
the chance," said the officer.
</P>
<P>
The WWF is urging the European Commission and member states to
add the sites proposed by the WWF to the official list of sites to
be protected under the Habitats Directive, the EU nature
conservation law.
</P>
<P>
They include the proposed rowing and canoeing center for the
2004 Olympic Games in Schinias, Greece, the Kaiser Mountains in
Austria, the Pembrokeshire coast in Wales, the Corridor de Pagares
between Astrurias and Castilla Leon in Spain, and the Massif de
Sesques et de l'Ossau in the French Pyrenees, an important bear
habitat.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Deplores Youths' Role in Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
Thursday deplored what he called the "unprecedented" involvement
of youths in religious and ethnic unrest across the country, and
recommitted his government to providing jobs for them.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, speaking at the presidential villa in the West
African nation's capital Abuja while receiving a religious
delegation, regretted that youths have become tools in the hands
of unscrupulous people to satisfy their selfish interests.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is doing all it can to contain the
involvement of youths in militant organizations, through
productive programs like the Poverty Alleviation Program (PAP),
Universal Basic Education (UBE) and other sustainable socio-
economic programs.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the determination of his administration to strengthen
the moral fiber of the society, through good governance and
exemplary leadership, Obasanjo urged the youths to cooperate with
the government in its quest to achieve the goal of "making Nigeria
great again."
</P>
<P>
In riots over the implementation of the Islamic law Sharia
earlier this year, militant youths killed hundreds of people
throughout the country. In the just concluded nationwide strike
against gas price hike, police arrested hundreds of youths for
causing injury to innocent civilians and damage to property.

<HEADLINE> Visit to Pyongyang Very Successful, Kim Dae-jung Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
arrived at Seoul Airport Thursday afternoon from the three-day
Pyongyang inter-Korea summit which he called "successful" and "
fruitful."
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport, he said that both Kim Jong Il,
leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and he
had "tried really hard during the summit which was successful."
</P>
<P>
The significant summit has ended the 55 years of hostility on
the Korean Peninsula, he said, adding the Korean people can now
look forward to a bright future and that a new dawn of hope for
reconciliation, cooperation and unification is nearing.
</P>
<P>
When the South and North cooperate, "we will contribute to the
peace and stability of northeast Asia," he said, adding that
during the summit "we talked about nuclear weapons and missiles
and it was a very fruitful discussion."
</P>
<P>
"I am firmly convinced that the day of unification will come
without fail if the South and North dedicate their minds and
spirits," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the South Korean Red Cross will start working in
June with their counterpart in the North to arrangement reunion of
separated families.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders signed Wednesday night a historic South-North
Joint Declaration which focuses on issues of reconciliation and
unification of the Korean Peninsula, ways of easing tension and
establishing permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, and
reuniting separated families as well as mutual exchanges in the
economic, social and cultural arenas.
</P>
<P>
During the summit talks, Kim Jong Il accepted President Kim's
invitation to make a return visit to Seoul at an appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech at a farewell ceremony in Pyongyang,
President Kim said the joint declaration is the first step toward
a new age of reconciliation and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said during the summit, the two sides have confirmed that "
there was no big difference in our thinking or passion for the
future and unification of the nation."
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the South and North put a period to the age of
confrontation and faced a historic turning point from which we
will forge the fate of the Korean people together," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was seen off by DPRK leader Kim Jong Il at the airport. The
two hugged each other in the farewell ceremony, the first time
ever seen in the public.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Police at the Guangzhou Railway
Public Security Bureau in south China have uncovered 18 cases of
trafficking women and children over the past two weeks, saving 82
people and seizing 22 suspects.
</P>
<P>
On June 12, police apprehended a man named Hu Jinqing on a
train heading from the city of Chengdu in southwestern Sichuan
Province to Shenzhen in Guangdong. Hu is reported to have conned
four girls into believing he could find work for them in a beauty
salon, but he in fact intended to sell them to the shop.
</P>
<P>
Hu had gone to a labor market in the city of Leshan, Sichuan
Province, claiming that he could find jobs for people. The girls,
each aged 18, followed him.
</P>
<P>
In a separate case, police were called to a Guangzhou rail
station on June 11 where they stopped a man named Zeng Zhaosheng
with a weeping girl. After questioning Zeng, they learned that he
was involved in several rapes and the trafficking of young women.
</P>
<P>
Police at the Huaihua railway station in southern Hunan
Province uncovered two major cases of trafficking children, saving
31 youngsters from Guizhou Province in southern China and Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Guangzhou Railway Public Security Bureau
said that the crackdown on trafficking women and children will
continue.

<HEADLINE> West China Improves Legal System for Greater Development (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These are the practical measures taken by the local governments
as they attempt to improve the legal system in the west while
upgrading their infrastructure facilities, law expert Yin Wanbang
said.
</P>
<P>
The provinces, autonomous regions and municipality in western
China will also strengthen law making and law enforcement while
perfecting the legal system.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal People's Congress of Chongqing will work out a
series of rules and regulations on improving the investment
environment this year to ensure the interests of investors,
including an ordinance on encouraging foreign investment and
regulations on management of the Chongqing Economic and
Technological Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always encouraged the formation of a
sound legal system in the process of the country's economic and
social development.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign businesspeople also said that they are afraid of
doing business in the traditional Chinese style of depending on
high-powered connections, or "guanxi," because this will increase
their investment cost.
</P>
<P>
A good investment environment based on transparent rules and
regulations will be more favorable for fair competition, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, law experts said that the development of the west
should not mimic the old groping ways that took place in the east
during the early stage of the country's reform and opening up
drive.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated upsurge of the western area against the
backdrop of China's expected WTO entry and a maturing market
economy needs the guarantee of a legal system, experts said.
</P>
<P>
"The country's 22-year-old reform has basically established the
rules of the game for China's social and economic development,"
said Prof. Zhuo Zeyuan at the Southwest China University of
Political Science and Law.
</P>
<P>
The starting point for the development of the west should be
high, Zhuo added. The area's development scheme and implementation
measures must conform to those of the World Trade Organization and
should leave more room for further development.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the development of the west should be in step
with the construction of the legal system.
</P>
<P>
Chinese law experts are now researching a legal security system
and will offer suggestions for the strategic development of the
west.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Governments in west China
provinces, autonomous regions and municipality are working to
improve the legal system in the area, hoping to facilitate healthy
development there and encourage investment from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
A batch of existing rules and regulations that are out of sync
with development of the market economy have been annulled by the
governments in the west.
</P>
<P>
This is a joint move made by the governments of 10 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipality in western China, including
Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Guizhou,
Yunnan, Chongqing and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
At a recent national conference, Chinese law experts said that
only a sound legal environment can help establish a democratic and
scientific decision-making system, prevent construction of
redundant projects, and improve the ecological environment in
western areas.
</P>
<P>
Chinese law experts are now researching ways to ensure a legal
guarantee for the sustainable development strategy in west China,
whose area and population accounts for 57 percent and 23 percent
of the country's total respectively.
</P>
<P>
Professor Cheng Liaoyuan, a member of the research team, said
that the plan is to integrate the rule of law with sustainable
development and the strategy of developing west China.
</P>
<P>
The government of Chongqing Municipality announced the
annulment of over 200 local rules and regulations in early June.
The People's Congress of Chongqing Municipality is also reviewing
more than 100 rules and regulations formulated since 1997 when it
became a municipality enjoying provincial status in the country.
</P>
<P>
The outdated rules and regulations and those which do not tally
with the strategy of developing west China should be rescinded or
revised, an official from the Chongqing Municipal People's
Congress said.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, as well as Guiyang, the provincial
capital of Guizhou, and Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan,
have also abolished some regulations and rules or made revisions
of others.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires, which erupted
Tuesday, are still blazing in various areas of Cyprus, said the
police Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, the island has been ravaged by a total
of about 40 forest fires which broke out on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit area lies near Vavla and Layia, two villages in
the Larnaca district of the southern coast.
</P>
<P>
The fires, which were once thought to have been brought under
control, erupted again and later moved close to the two villages.
</P>
<P>
A fire brigade spokesman said that efforts Wednesday night to
put out the fires failed due to strong winds.
</P>
<P>
In the southwestern Limassol district, the blaze approached
holiday residences. Strong fire brigade, police, forestry
department, national guard and other units are in the area to
battle the blaze, helped by volunteers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Prominent MP May Become Jordan's Next Premier by Wang Bingfei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Ali Abul Ragheb, a prominent
parliamentarian and former minister, looks set to become the next
prime minister to succeed Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh, who is apparently
loosing a battle against the parliament over policy differences.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb, 54, has risen in the eyes of King Abdullah Bin Hussein
after drawing up a master plan to develop the southern harbor city
of Aqaba into the kingdom's largest special economic zone, informed
sources said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He worked out the comprehensive plan as head of a special task
force in six weeks with the help of international consultants,
leaving an impression of being swift and efficient, the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
It was widely anticipated that King Abdullah will appoint the U.
S.-educated architect, as prime minister in a royal decree next
week or as early as Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The monarch has the consitutional rights of appointing or
dismissing governments and dissolving parliament.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts believe that Ragheb, if appointed, would help
usher in a more harmonious era between the government and the
parliament, particularly with the 80-member house of deputies or
the lower house.
</P>
<P>
The Rawabdeh government, appointed by King Abdullah 15 months
ago, had been at odds with the house over political and economic
policies, including its crackdown on Muslim dissidents,
privatization of key but non-profitable state enterprises, and
introduction of a 10-percent sales tax which triggered a price hike
in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb, on the other hand, believed that parliamentarians should
be included in the government or cabinet, and he could summon a few
of his fellow house members into his cabinet if he becomes prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Barely two months ago, Ragheb led a group of parliamentarians
who prepared a petition to the king, attacking Rawabdeh for his
policies, but stopped short of asking for his resignation or
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
The petition was signed by a majority of the 80-member lower
house and highlighted a breach of relations between the legislature
and the government.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh has tided over several confidence crisis during his 15-
month service as prime minister, including a rumor that his son was
asking for hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in bribes from
potential foreign investors to help them win construction
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh managed to keep its job as the kingdom is emerging from
a decade-old economic recession since the 1990 Gulf Crisis,
achieved a rare 1.5 percent economic growth in 1999 and eying for a
3 percent growth in 2000.
</P>
<P>
But his inability to win support from the house is costing him
his job now, as the 38-year-old king expected harmony between the
legislature and government.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb, given his liberal economic background, is widely
expected to inherit the economic and reform policies of Rawabdeh,
which were also endorsed by the king.
</P>
<P>
On the regional level, Ragheb is said to be preoccupied with the
displeasure between Jordan and Iraq, which was caused mainly by low
trade volumes, and he is expected to take measures to improve ties
between the two countries if he comes to power.
</P>
<P>
He is considered to be "reserved" on dealing with the Jewish
state to the extent as enthusiastic as Rawabdeh.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody would blame a politician who is cold towards Israel,
when (the Jewish state) is not respecting our agreements on water
and trade," the semi-official Jordan Times said, quoting a source
close to Ragheb.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel and its Arab
neighbors since the kingdom signed a peace treaty with Israel in
1994. It was the second Arab country after Egypt to strike such a
peace deal with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
However, anti-Israel sentiment could be easily felt in the
Jordanian population, over 60 percent of whom are of Palestinian
origins.

<HEADLINE> Visit to Pyongyang Very Successful, Kim Dae-jung Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 15 (Xinhua) -- President Kim Dae-jung arrived at
Seoul Airport Thursday afternoon from the three-day Pyongyang
inter-Korea summit which he called "successful" and "fruitful."
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport, he said that both Kim Jong Il,
leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and he
had "tried really hard during the summit which was successful."
</P>
<P>
The significant summit has ended the 55 years of hostility on
the Korean Peninsula, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we failed, the disappointment of the world would be great
and if we succeed, the benefit expected would be enormous," he
said.
</P>
<P>
When the South and North cooperate, "we will contribute to the
peace and stability of northeast Asia," he said, adding that
during the summit "we talked about nuclear weapons and missiles
and it was a very fruitful discussion."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders signed Wednesday night a historic South-North
Joint Declaration which focuses on issues of reconciliation and
unification of the Korean Peninsula, ways of easing tension and
establishing permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, and
reuniting separated families as well as mutual exchanges in the
economic, social and cultural arenas.
</P>
<P>
During the summit talks, Kim Jong Il accepted President Kim's
invitation to make a return visit to Seoul at an appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech at a farewell ceremony in Pyongyang,
President Kim said the joint declaration is the first step toward
a new age of reconciliation and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said during the summit, the two sides have confirmed that "
there was no big difference in our thinking or passion for the
future and unification of the nation."
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the South and North put a period to the age of
confrontation and faced a historic turning point from which we
will forge the fate of the Korean people together," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was seen off by DPRK leader Jim Jong Il at the airport. The
two hugged each other in the farewell ceremony, the first time
ever seen in the public.

<HEADLINE> World's First 64-Bit Chinese Linux System Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Cosoft Alliance under China
High-Tech Development Program 863 and the Software Institute under
the China Academy of Sciences today launched the Chinese Penguin
64, the world's first 64-bit Chinese Linux operational system.
</P>
<P>
This is the first software product made by Cosoft Alliance,
founded in February of this year and consisting of 30 outstanding
universities, research bodies, enterprises and specialized media
companies.
</P>
<P>
Li Mingshu, deputy director of the Software Institute, said
that Penguin 64 was developed based on the 64-bit hardware
platform offered by Singapore Donovan Systems Corporation and
represents the latest development of Linux, an English operational
system famous for making its source code public.
</P>
<P>
Experts here noted that operational systems are monopolized by
some international software giants, a situation which has greatly
hindered the development of China's national software industry.
The birth of the Chinese Penguin 64 will help break the monopoly
and give a chance for China's software makers to show off their
talent, experts said.
</P>
<P>
"Penguin 64 is expected to become a new computing standard for
Chinese governments and enterprises, because its source code will
be publicized and clients can use it freely according to their own
needs," Li said.

Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Rifaat al-Assad, brother of late Syrian President Hafez al-
Assad, told reporters of the Hurriyet newspaper in his villa in
Marbella, Spain, that he and his family will return to Syria as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Rifaat could not pose a threat to the
power base of Bashar al-Assad, Assad's second son and heir
apparent, as he enjoys no support among the Syrian people.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak may transfer control of the
religious ultra-Orthodox Shas Party's school system to Finance or
Culture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Yossi Sarid, who has refused to meet Shas'
demands for school funding and control, said Wednesday that he has
been assured by those conducting negotiations for the ruling One
Israel party that "they do not know of such a proposal."
</P>
<P>
Anti-religious Shinui Party leader Yosef Lapid ridiculed such a
move and called the way Barak is running his affairs "a comedy."
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak wants U.S. President Bill
Clinton to put pressure on the Palestinian leadership to agree to a
postponement of the "third withdrawal" in the West Bank until after
a framework agreement for the final status arrangement is reached.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat is to meet
with Clinton on Thursday. Ahead of the meeting, Barak phoned
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Arafat's diplomatic patron, "and
stressed the importance of reaching a framework agreement and the
dangers of not making a real effort to reach such an agreement."
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the scheduled third withdrawal in the West Bank
is next Friday, June 23.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- As Israel's ultra-Orthodox Shas Party and Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's One Israel renewed talks on solving the coalition crisis,
the opposition Likud leader Ariel Sharon tired to lure Shas into
his own corner with a pledge to raise funds for the party's
education network.
</P>
<P>
However, Sharon's pledge drew fire from some Likud Knesset
(Parliament) members who blasted him for wanting to help a
different party, when the Likud's own financial status was "very
serious."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The death of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and the
ascension of power of his son Bashar bear "the potential for a
substantive change in the Middle East landscape," Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he noted, "Time will certainly be needed until
the new leadership in Damascus formulates its policy and is capable
of making political decisions."
</P>
<P>
While criticizing the late president's lack of "requisite degree
of flexibility, creativity and imagination to cross the
psychological barrier" and make peace, the prime minister pointed
out "there is no doubt that he (Assad) bequeathed to his son and to
Syria the very idea of the legitimacy of talking peace with Israel,
and that fact holds out hope for the future."

<HEADLINE> Manila Confident of Achieving Lasting Peace With MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- After agreeing with Catholic
bishops on the peace process in Mindanao, the Philippine
government is confident that lasting peace can be achieved with
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), a high-ranking official
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio speech that
President Joseph Estrada is hopeful the Catholic Bishops
Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) can do its part to achieve
the goal of lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
"The process as been set. The MILF must meet the three
conditions -- they are not for secession, they must stop the acts
of terrorism, and they will lay down their arms. We are hopeful
the CBCP can convince them to do these," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada set the three conditions for a ceasefire with the MILF
during a meeting with representatives of the CBCP in the
presidential palace Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada on Wednesday gave Catholic bishops in
Mindanao six months to convince the MILF rebels to lay down their
arms, in effect extending until December 14 a June 30 deadline for
negotiators to produce substantive results in ongoing peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"They (the bishops) agreed, and there was applause," he said,
adding that the fulfillment of the third condition is now in the
CBCP's hands.
</P>
<P>
But Zamora said this does not include the Abu Sayyaf extremist
group, which the government earlier had accused of having a
connection with the MILF.

<HEADLINE> Another Earthquake Shakes Bengkulu, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 4.85 on
the Richter Scale jolted Bengkulu province on Sumatra island,
Indonesia, on Wednesday at 10:30 p.m. local time (15:30 GMT), an
official said.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the quake is located at 5.51 South Latitude
and 11.05 East Longitude, 33 kilometers beneath the sea level and
some 232 kilometers southwest of Bengkulu, Antara news agency
Thursday quoted an officer at the local meteorological and
geophysics office as saying.
</P>
<P>
So far, no casualties or damages to buildings were reported due
to the aftershock, he said.
</P>
<P>
At least 1,827 aftershocks were recorded by the local
meteorological office after an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the
Richter Scale struck Bengkulu on June 4, killing at least 130
people and injuring more than one thousand of others.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is prone to earthquakes as it is situated at the
Pacific "Ring of Fire," a string of volcanoes and earthquake zones
that stretch from Mexico to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri has
arrived in Bengkulu on a two-day visit to quake victims.

<HEADLINE> Thai King Approves Cabinet Reshuffle List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- King Bhumibol Adulyadej of
Thailand Thursday approved the cabinet reshuffle list submitted by
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, according to latest television
reports.
</P>
<P>
Only two cabinet seats were changed during the minor government
reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Adisai Potharamic, deputy leader of the Chart Pattana Party,
was named as Prime Minister's Office Minister, replacing Praveena
Hongsakul, who resigned to run for Bangkok governor and triggered
the party's limited reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Pracha Promnok, who resigned as national police chief Monday,
replaced Wut Sokosol as labor minister.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Wut was unseated because he has had no
major accomplishments during his term.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth cabinet reshuffle of the six-party coalition
since it took power in late 1997. The coalition enjoys a
comfortable majority of 237 in the 385-member Lower House of
Parliament. But it must call a general election before November
this year when its term expires.

<HEADLINE> Reports on Transfer of Basilan Hostages to Sulu Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Regional police in the southern
Philippine province island of Basilan has denied reports that the
Basilan-based Abu Sayyaf group has moved the remaining eight
hostages to the neighboring island of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Police Regional Director Akmadul Pangambayan told local
reporters Thursday that the eight all-Filipino hostages are now
being kept somewhere in the hinterlands of Sumisip, Basilan.
</P>
<P>
Pangambayan was reacting to a local radio report quoting Abu
Sabbaya, Abu Sayyaf spokesperson, as saying that he and another
Abu Sayyaf leader together with the remaining hostages are now in
Sulu, where the 21 mostly foreign hostages abducted from Malaysia
in April are kept.
</P>
<P>
Pangambayan said the Basilan Crisis Committee has received no
such official report from the police and military intelligence
community.
</P>
<P>
Most Of the more than 50 hostages kept by the Abu Sayyaf since
March 20 were rescued and five were killed by the Abu Sayyaf
including a priest, while eight others remain captive.
</P>
<P>
Still in the hands of the Abu Sayyaf are two local teachers and
six school children, the police director added.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Consume 13,000 Acres In U.S. Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Additional crews and equipment
from neighboring states are expected soon to help battle two wind-
driven Colorado wildfires that have scorched more than 13,000
acres, local officials said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Crews from Oregon, California, Wyoming, South Dakota, Montana
and Utah are coming to the aid of weary Colorado firefighters, CNN
quoted local officials as saying, adding that some 1,100
firefighters were on the lines Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 450 personnel worked to contain the Bobcat fire, north of
Denver, and 13 more crews were ordered. The blaze was only about 5
percent contained by late Wednesday, and officials worried that
winds and low humidity would help spread the flames further.
</P>
<P>
The Bobcat fire has burned 6,640 acres and forced the
evacuation of residents in three small communities about 12 miles
west of Loveland, a city of 37,000 about 12 miles south of Fort
Collins.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Red Cross said about 200 people have
registered in three local shelters.
</P>
<P>
South of Denver, the High Meadow fire burned 6,640 acres and
forced 400 people in the small cities of Conifer, Pine and Buffalo
Creek to leave their homes, said Caitlin Marquez of the Fire
Information Office.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 personnel battled the fire by land and air, and 400
more people were ordered to work on the blaze, Marquez said.
</P>
<P>
At least 39 homes and two outbuildings were destroyed, and 150
more were threatened, according to the National Interagency Fire
Center Web site update.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the U.S. West, fires are also burning. In
California's Napa County, residents in vacation communities around
Lake Berryessa returned home Wednesday, a day after being
threatened by a wildfire that has burned 5,000 acres about 55
miles northeast of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 firefighters were in the field Wednesday battling
the 3,000 acre blaze, which authorities said was probably ignited
by sparks from a minor car accident on a local road.
</P>
<P>
The fire forced a 10-mile stretch of State Highway 128 to be
closed, said Nancy Carniglia, a fire information officer for the
California Department of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, erratic winds fanned the flames of two wildfires in
New Mexico, northeast of Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
A fire sparked by lightning near Questa grew to 1,000 acres in
size Tuesday in the Rio Grande Gorge, while a 300-acre fire near
Mora forced 33 families from their mobile homes, said fire
information officer Peter D'Aquanni.
</P>
<P>
The fire season is shaping up as the worst since 1996,
according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho. It
began more than a month ago with blazes engulfing areas of Florida
and the Southwest, most notably in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
About 44,300 fires covering more than 1.2 million acres have
been recorded nationwide so far, with drought getting worse in the
West.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the respondents
in Guangdong Province of a survey said adulterers should face
criminal charges, the All-China Women's Federation said here today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the women's federation for the
revision of China's Marriage Law, covered 10 provinces and
autonomous regions. But at present, only Guangdong Province in
South China has worked out survey results.
</P>
<P>
According to Guangdong's results, more than 30 percent of those
questioned said the new Marriage Law should forbid "keeping
concubines," and a quarter of those surveyed said that an addition
should be made to punish both the adulterer and the "third party"
involved in extramarital affairs.
</P>

Out of all people surveyed in the coastal province neighboring

for adulterers charged with extramarital affairs or keeping
concubines. And 50 percent said that adultery is a legitimate
reason for divorce.
</P>
<P>
Some 94.5 percent said a parent should has the right to visit

<HEADLINE> Barak, Clinton Discuss Israeli-Palestinian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and U.S. President Bill Clinton discussed Wednesday night ways for
pushing the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks forward, Israel
Radio reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Barak phoned Clinton and expressed his hope that Clinton would
put pressure on the Palestinian leadership to agree to a
postponement of the third troop redeployment in the West Bank until
after a framework agreement for the final-status arrangement is
reached, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
Barak called Clinton just ahead of his meeting Thursday in
Washington with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. But Barak's
office did not disclose more details about the telephone
conversation.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the third Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank is June 23. Israel has threatened that if the Palestinian
side rejects its demand for the postponement and insists on the
withdrawal being carried out on time, it will stick to a previous
government's decision that the third withdrawal will include only 1
percent of the West Bank territories.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords signed by the two sides in 1993, Israel
has to transfer all remaining West Bank territories to Palestinian
control during the third redeployment. Israel so far has handed
over about 40 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak also wishes Arafat to agree to a summit sponsored by
Clinton, in which the leaders can try and complete the framework
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians feel that the time is not yet ripe for the
summit, and Arafat told U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
last week that the third redeployment must be carried out on
schedule.
</P>
<P>
Barak also phoned Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Wednesday and
stressed the importance of reaching a framework agreement, Barak's
office said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian negotiating teams resumed their intensive
talks near Washington Tuesday and the talks have been divided into
two groups dealing with interim and final-status issues
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Washington said that the interim talks were broken
off on Wednesday as the Palestinian side was angered by the Israeli
positions on the third redeployment and prisoner release.
</P>
<P>
"We will not postpone this withdrawal," Palestinian chief
negotiator on interim issues Saeb Erekat said, adding that the
Palestinian side "will not agree to even a one-minute delay."

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Government Unveils Budget for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Finance Minister
Michael Cullen delivered the first budget of the new government
here Thursday, indicating the coalition government will play a
more "hands-on" role in the country's economic and social life.
</P>
<P>
"Budget 2000 does not try to do everything at once, but it does
mark out a new direction. It points the way to rebuilding a fair
and sustainable social and economic order," the minister said when
he was addressing the Parliament Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In his budget policy statement, Cullen said the New Zealand
government, formed last December by the Labor Party and the
Alliance, has the advantage of a strong economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
"Growth is forecast to average around 3 percent per annum over
the next three years on the back of a robust world economy and a
competitive exchange rate. Unemployment is expected to reduce to
just above 5 percent by March 2002."
</P>
<P>
He said the government is looking ahead to substantial and
rising surpluses with this year's surplus being 763 million NZ
dollars (359 million U.S. dollars) and the figure rising to 1.01
billion NZ dollars (475 million U.S. dollars), 2 billion NZ
dollars (940 million U.S.dollars), and 2.7 billion NZ dollars (1.
27 billion U.S. dollars) for the following three years,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Cullen said the government encourages the development of an
innovative economy and boosts small and medium-sized business.
</P>
<P>
"The government is committed to assisting the transformation of
the economy from its current ever-reliance on commodity production
to the knowledge intensive industries of the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government, Cullen said, plans to allocate more than 330
million NZ dollars (155.1 million U.S. dollars) for regional and
economic development over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
It will feed an extra 30 million NZ dollars (14.1 million U.S.
dollars) to encourage research and development of science and
technology, most of which will go to the private sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister told the parliament a key task the
government has set for itself is closing "gaps" between the
skilled and the unskilled, between employment-rich and employment-
poor communities, and between the cities and the provinces.
</P>
<P>
"But the most urgent and visible gaps exist between Maori and
Pacific communities and others," he said.
</P>
<P>
The budget dedicates 114 million NZ dollars (53.6 million U.S.
dollars) over the next four years to "build the capacity of Maori
and Pacific peoples to design and deliver their own initiatives,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the budget, the New Zealand government also plans to
invest more money in health, education, culture and the cause of
social benefit.
</P>
<P>
In his budget policy statement, Finance Minister Michael Cullen
also announced that the country will open an embassy in Brazil to
boost exporting to the world's ninth-largest economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is ready
to meet a reported threat of the National Democratic Front (NDF)
to conduct terrorist acts in the country, a senior official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview
that the government is aware of NDF chairman Luis Jalandoni's
instructions to that effect which, he said, had been published on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"But that is nothing new. We have known that for some time. We'
re taking steps to make sure it does not happen," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, Jalandoni had ordered the New People's
Army (NPA), the NDF's armed group, to conduct terrorist acts in
the Philippines, now that the military is facing challenges from
many fronts including the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and
the Abu Sayyaf group.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the government plans to present the Internet
document to the Dutch Embassy and seek Jalandoni's deportation
anew. Jalandoni is presently considered a Dutch citizen.
</P>
<P>
"We will bring it to the Dutch Embassy so they will see their
citizen is interfering in our affairs. It is like declaring war on
the Philippines," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese and Belgian
scientists have discovered some rare dinosaur fossils in the
western part of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region in north
China.
</P>
<P>
The fossils were from such dinosaurs as the protoceratops and
ankylosaurus, according to the scientists.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Belgian team also found skull fossils of dinosaurs in
the area, known for its prevalence of dinosaurs in history.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Belgian joint excavation started in 1995 and was
scheduled to be completed in 2002. Researchers hoped to obtain new
fossils of duck-billed dinosaurs so as to provide new data for
establishing a lineal tree of dinosaurs and to make a comparative
study of dinosaurs and mammals in the autonomous region and
Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Steel Price Hike Slowing Down in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- After a price hike starting in
April, costs for major steel products are returning to normal,
sources with the State Material Information Center said today.
</P>
<P>
Steel prices shot up in April this year, boosted by the price
rebound on the international steel market and the industry's
efforts to curb production. Of the 50 steel varieties being
monitored, prices of products for construction use continued to
rise at a double-digit rate in May, and prices for steel sheeting
and tubing climbed by an average 3 to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
These price hikes are the highest in years, experts noted.
</P>
<P>
Now, the rise in prices has slowed, with most of the steel
prices falling from their high level. Prices for wire and screw
thread steel, for example, dropped from 2,900-3,000 yuan per ton
to 2,600-2,700 per ton.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that prices for construction use-steel will
remain stable this month, but the costs for steel sheeting might
go up.

TOKYO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Japanese leaders Thursday praised
the joint declaration signed in Pyongyang Wednesday by Kim Jong Il,
leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
"It was a historic achievement on which our government and
people congratulate and welcome," Mori said in an election

</P>
<P>
Mori pledged to seek the Group of Eight (G-8) major nations'
support for Korean reunification when Japan hosts the group's July

</P>
<P>
"At the G-8 summit, we'd like to call for creating a framework
of full support for Korean reunification and the agreement by the
two leaders, and make it an important issue," Mori said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister expressed the hope that the
achievements of the first-ever inter-Korean summit would lead to
eased tension on the Korean Peninsula and give positive impetus to
stalled talks between Japan and the DPRK on establishing
diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, meanwhile, issued a
statement welcoming the inter-Korean summit declaration as being "
historic and epoch-making."

</P>
<P>
"We strongly hope the North-South dialogue will continue and
progress in easing tension on the Korean Peninsula on the basis of
this achievement; and we expect such moves will positively affect
normalization negotiations" between Japan and the DPRK, Kono added.
</P>
<P>
The accord, signed on the second day of Kim Dae-jung's three-

<HEADLINE> Superstar Bryant Rescues Lakers With Thrilling Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Lakers
Wednesday night overcame Glen Rice's hurt feelings, Kobe Bryant's
hurt ankle and Shaquille O'Neal's fouling out to defeat the
Indiana Pacers 120-118 in overtime for a 3-1 lead in the NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
Bryant became a true superstar Wednesday night. Coming to his
team's rescue after O'Neal fouled out in overtime, Bryant made
three of the most clutch shots of his young career to lead the
Lakers to a 120-118 victory over the Indiana Pacers and a 3-1 lead
in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
Superstars make great plays at big moments, and that's what
Bryant did three times in the extra session while showing an
uncanny calmness for a 21-year-old. Two of the shots were
straightaway jumpers to restore three-point leads; the last was a
reverse layup putback of a miss by Brian Shaw with 5.9 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
"I fouled out, Kobe took over," said O'Neal. "He's a fabulous
player, I'm glad he's back."
</P>
<P>
The Lakers went up 3-1 in the best-of-seven series. Game 5 is
scheduled Friday night, also in Indianapolis, with Games 6 and 7,
if needed, in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"When Shaq fouled out, my mindset was this game became a lot
more interesting," said the 21-year-old Bryant, who scored 28
points.
</P>
<P>
"In our mind this was the championship," said Bryant who
sprained his left ankle early in Game 2 and missed Game 3, the
Lakers' only loss.
</P>
<P>
"It's hurting right now," Bryant said after the game. "It's
real tight, real sore."
</P>
<P>
The Lakers forward Glen Rice, who criticized Lakers coach Phil
Jackson for his lack of playing time in the series, played a much
bigger role in Game 4, scoring 11 points.
</P>
<P>
"Their (the Pacers) back is now against the wall, officially,"
said the Lakers coach Jackson.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers had a chance to win it after that, but Reggie Miller
- after scoring 35 points - couldn't get an open 3-pointer to drop
from the right elbow of the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
Most experts and fans believe that Game 4 is the best of the
NBA finals so far, and also be one of the best in the NBA history.

<HEADLINE> Water Project to Benefit 24 Million More Rural Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China will launch a project to
help 24 million more rural residents have access to drinkable
water by 2003, according to the Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, a rural population of 240 million had difficulty
obtaining safe drinking water; however, by the end of 1999, 216
million or 90 percent of them had an adequate clean water supply,
and the problem had been solved for another 150 million living in
towns and counties, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has spent over 30 billion yuan since
1993 on construction of three million water supply projects with a
daily capacity of 20 million tons. These projects were included as
an important part of the national relief program in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In towns and counties, the central and local governments
invested 40 billion yuan to improve 150 million people's water
supply for daily use and production purposes.
</P>
<P>
However, some 240 million rural farmers in China's hinterland
still have great difficulty getting water, and the Ministry of
Water Resources said that it is working to help these people get
access to water within three years.

<P>
TOKYO, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan's leading newspapers published
editorials Thursday, welcoming the signing of a landmark accord by
leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and
South Korea in Pyongyang late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The accord, signed by DPRK leader Kim Jong Il and South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung, calls for reconciliation and envisages
eventual reunification of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
What is remarkable in the milestone accord is that the leaders
have confirmed that the two sides will go forward eyeing a
federation in terms of eventual reunification, the Asahi Shimbun
said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Cold War paradigm has remained on the Korean
Peninsula like a huge iceberg even though the Cold War has ended,
the paper said the iceberg has now begun to melt following the
historic inter-Korean summit.
</P>
<P>
The Yomiuri Shimbun, in its editorial, described the signing of
the accord as a significant step toward lasting peace on the
Korean Peninsula and called on the two sides to implement the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Expressing high appreciation of the achievement of the historic
inter-Korean summit, the Mainichi Shimbun said face-to-face
contact between the two leaders is the fundamental necessity for
ensuring long-lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The inter-Korean summit showed the leaders have the ability to
create such a peace, the daily said.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Beat Pacers in Game 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
INDIANAPOLIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- With Shaquille O'Neal ejected,
Kobe Bryant shook off his ankle injury and scored eight points in
overtime to help the Los Angeles Lakers to a 120-118 victory over
the Indiana Pacers that put them one win away from the NBA
championship on Wednesday .
</P>
<P>
"I fouled out, Kobe took over," said O'Neal. "He's a fabulous
player, I'm glad he's back."
</P>
<P>
The Lakers went up 3-1 in the best-of-seven series. Game 5 is
Friday night, also in Indianapolis, with Games 6 and 7, if needed,
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"When Shaq fouled out, my mindset was this game became a lot
more interesting," said the 21-year-old Bryant, who scored 28
points.
</P>
<P>
Bryant sprained his left ankle early in Game 2 and missed Game
3, the Lakers' only loss. "It's hurting right now," Bryant said
after the game. "It's real tight, real sore.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal had 36 points, 16 in the fourth quarter, before fouling
out. He also had 21 rebounds and improved his foul shooting,
making 10-for17.
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller, who had 35 points with 13 in the fourth quarter
and six in overtime, had one last shot and went for the win, not
the tie at the end of overtime, but just missed.
</P>
<P>
Bryant put back a Brian Shaw miss with 5.9 seconds left in
overtime to put the Lakers up 120-117. The Lakers' Rick Fox made
what looked like a bad mistake when he became entangled with Jalen
Rose before the ball was inbounded, giving the Pacers a free throw.
</P>
<P>
Miller made the free throw to cut the lead to 120-118. But then
on the inbound, Miller hoisted a 3-point attempt that looked
online but hit the front rim and bounded over the backboard as
time expired.

<HEADLINE> 25 Dams Built in Myanmar's Bago Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 25 dams and diversion
weirs have been built in Myanmar's central Bago division since
1988 to prevent floods and water shortages which usually occur in
the division's western part, official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the annual floods in rainy season which is due to
failure to systematically control the streams originating in the
Bago Yoma mountain range, the division faces water shortage in
summer, Lieutenant-General Tin Oo, second secretary of the Myanmar
State Peace and Development Council, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Seven more irrigation facilities are under construction in the
Bago division to help solve the problem, Tin Oo disclosed
Wednesday at the opening of the Thekaw Dam, which is the 25th one
built in the division.
</P>
<P>
Bago division, which is the main sugarcane growing region of
the country, should utilize more lands to plant beans, pulses and
edible crops, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of nine private companies are reclaiming
vacant and virgin lands in the western part of the Bago division.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, a total of 110 dams have been
built in the whole of Myanmar since 1988. They also include 18
dams in Magway and 28 dams in Mandalay divisions in central part
of the country.

<HEADLINE> DPRK, South Korean Leaders Highly Evaluate Summit EDS-rpts with correction in 1st para </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the North and the
South of the Korean Peninsula have hailed the inter-Korea summit
as helpful to the national reunification before President Kim Dae-
jung winds up his historic visit to Pyongyang Thursday.
</P>
<P>
 At a banquet hosted by Kim Dae-jung in Pyongyang Wednesday,
Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's
Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), said
the summit has "showed a good sign of national unity to the fellow
countrymen."
</P>
<P>
During the summit between DPRK leader Kim Jong Il and Kim Dae-
jung, which started Tuesday, the two sides discussed national
problems earnestly and came to understand each other, he noted,
adding the politicians of Korea can pool all their wisdom and
energies to make reunification a work to be undertaken right now.
</P>
<P>
Kim Yong Nam said he believes that the Pyongyang visit of Kim
Dae-jung will help achieve the country's reunification, the
cherished desire of the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
He said the two days of the summit were meaningful days during
which "years of too long separation seemed to be forgotten during
the too short meeting and talks because of compatriotic feelings."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Kim Dae-jung described the summit as "a great
auspicious event" to be rejoiced over by the whole Korean nation
and the first historic inspiring action in 55 years of division.
</P>
<P>
He said he fully agreed with the statement made by Kim Jong Il
during his recent Chinese visit that the issue of the Korean
Peninsula should be solved by the Korean people themselves. "I am
also sure that the destiny of our nation can be carved out by the
Korean nation itself," he added.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean president said he was confident that the
South-North summit talks were the starting-point for peace and
reunification, the cherished desire of the 70 million Koreans.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Kim Jong Il for the warm reception and hospitality
accorded to him.
</P>
<P>
The second day of the summit ended Wednesday with the signing
of a joint communique containing the historic agreement on the
issues of reconciliation and cooperation, easing of tension and
national unification, reunion of separated families and broad
exchanges in economic and social sectors.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong Il and Kim Dae-jung are expected to have lunch
together before the South Korean president leaves for home
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung is likely to fly home Thursday afternoon instead
of, as previously scheduled, returning by car through the tiny
truce village of Panmunjom, a symbol of the division of the Korean
Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Moves to Embrace Cyber Age Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MANILA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada signed into law Wednesday the Electronic Commerce Act of
2000, which is a major step to usher the Philippine economy into
the cyber age.
</P>
<P>
The law establishes legal and regulatory framework to
facilitate the conduct of e-business in the Philippines, including
penalties for hacking and other cyber crimes.
</P>
<P>
"We now leave the confines of the industrial age to embrace
the immense possibilities of an economy that is based not on land
or capital, which are the privileges of a few, but on talent,
ingenuity and skill, which are common to all," Estrada said in
signing ceremonies at the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
The legislation aims to facilitate both domestic and
international electronic transactions. It also requires the
government to ensure all agencies can accept electronic
transactions within two years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the law requires government to develop a labor
force skilled in information technology, make technology products
and services more affordable, as well as build a national
communications network to promote information technology in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, e-commerce can benefit Filipino
citizens and consumers in three aspects.
</P>
<P>
The first impact, he said, would reduce the economic distance
between producers and consumers, thereby greatly increasing the
trade of goods and services across frontiers.
</P>
<P>
A second impact would be the concrete manifestation of the
country's alliance with the rest of the global community in the
fight against cyber crimes.
</P>
<P>
This law provides that the computer hackers would be sentenced
a three-year imprisonment and a minimum fine of 100,000 pesos (2,
500 dollars), the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Legislators were spurred to pass the law after the "I Love You
" computer virus, which spread last month to millions of computer
systems worldwide, was believed to have originated in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Before the passage of the e-commerce measure, the Philippine
authorities had to scour the statute books for lack of an
appropriate law that would punish computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
A third impact is the improvement of civil services as the law
mandates the computerization of government offices involved in the
issuance of permits, licenses and other documents.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the global business-to-business e-commerce will
grow to about seven trillion U.S. dollars worldwide in the next
four years. The Asia-Pacific region is estimated to account for 14
percent of this market, which will grow at the rate of 150 percent
through 2004.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is the fourth country in Asia, next to
Malaysia, Singapore and Korea, to have an e-commerce law.
</P>
<P>
Estrada pointed out that the Philippines has an excellent
chance of capturing a major share of the emerging e-commerce
market because the country has "highly trained and trainable human
resources" and "a developing information infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
The president stressed the need for concerned organizations to
quickly establish the needed support structures for the developing
of e-commerce in the country.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, includes setting up the necessary physical
infrastructures and developing the needed personnel, and
reengineering the Filipino's mindset to prepare for the
intellectual and social effects of this new technology.
</P>
<P>
"We must remember that e-commerce will only thrive in those
countries which provide low-cost, high-quality telecommunications
and Internet services, a supportive legal and business community,
and a technically skilled workforce," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged entrepreneurs to step forward and create the

<P>
"We must bear in mind that the vitality of the digital economy
is anchored on the development of entrepreneurs who will create
the necessary business opportunities to further spur the growth of
e-commerce in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Senate President Franklin Drilon said the e-
commerce law marks the formal entry of the country into the global
Internet economy and paves the way for Filipino "entrepreneurs" to
partake of the multi-billion dollar opportunities in cyber space.
</P>
<P>
"The significance and long-term benefits of the E-commerce Act
cannot be overemphasized," Drilon said.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Floods caused by torrential
rains have killed 120 people in the southern Mexican state of
Oaxaca, local authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The death toll was taken from the Acatlan de Perez Figueroa
municipality, where several roads have been blocked by landslides,
according to State Civil Protection director Hector Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a landslide buried at least 10 houses without human
deaths in the Mixistlan de Reforma, said Gonzales in the city of
Oaxaca, which has the same name as the state, about 316 kilometers
southeast of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
The collapse was caused by the rains, which softened the
terrain. The appearance of fissures in some streets prompted the
authorities to evacuate some 30 families from their homes in the
same area.
</P>
<P>
Strong rains that are pelting the center and south of Mexico
have caused serious floods and damage.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities of Guerrero state, in the south of Mexico,
have called on people to take extra precautions against possible
floods from the intense rains.
</P>
<P>
Tourist places of Acapulco and Zihuatanejo, both on the Pacific
Ocean coast, are the worst hit areas.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Gold Smelter Reopens after Disastrous Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A gold smelter in Romania which
caused a disastrous cyanide spill in European rivers in January
has reopened with tighter safety measures, the Romanian News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Aurul gold smelter at Baia Mare in northwest Romania, which
is partly owned by an Australian firm, polluted the whole
environment on the Tisza and Danube rivers after ten thousands of
tons of cyanide-tainted water overflowed the tailings dam on
January 30.
</P>
<P>
The spill, causing great losses in Hungary, Yugoslavia, Ukraine,
Bulgaria and Romania itself, is said to be one of Europe's worst
river pollution accidents.
</P>
<P>
In order to get support from related government and
environmental authorities for reopening, the gold smelter had
changed to an open circuit system, which meant in an emergency the
waste water could be pumped back to the plant site or another
nearby pool at a rate of over 500 cubic meters per hour.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the company had consolidated dam walls and raised the
freeboard, the distance between the water level and the top of the
dam.

<HEADLINE> China Wishes Balkan Nations Harmonious Coexistence: Chinese Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LJUBLJANA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC)
Li Peng said Wednesday that China sincerely hopes the Balkan
countries can achieve peaceful coexistence and common development.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here from Yugoslavia on Tuesday afternoon for
an official goodwill visit to Slovenia, said this when meeting
with Slovenian President Milan Kucan.
</P>
<P>
He said that after drastic changes took place in Eastern Europe
at the beginning of this decade, China respected the Slovenian
people's political choice and established diplomatic relations
with the Republic of Slovenia in 1992, soon after its independence
from former Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
This embodied China's independent foreign policy of peace, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
China repeatedly affirms that it is willing to develop ties
with each former Yugoslav republic on the basis of five principles
of coexistence, Li noted, saying his country has never sought
selfish interests in its intercourse with these nations.
</P>
<P>
On regional conflicts, the Chinese leader said China has always
insisted that international or ethnical differences or disputes
should be solved through peaceful negotiations rather than the use
of force, and that internal problems of every country be settled
by their own people.
</P>
<P>
China has been strongly opposed to the logic of "human rights
above sovereignty", he said, noting that the recognition of this
logic, which provides excuses for foreign interference in the
internal affairs of other countries, is very harmful to the
healthy development of international relations.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic and trade ties, Li pointed out that the
prospect is promising, urging the business sector of both
countries to explore for cooperation potentials.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kucan described China as an important political
force on the international stage and a strategic partner of
Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed his country's one-China policy, saying Slovenia
does not establish any political ties with Taiwan except mutual
contacts in the business field.
</P>
<P>
Kucan expressed the belief that China is able to settle the
Taiwan issue by itself.
</P>
<P>
Li is on a six-nation tour, which has taken him to Yugoslavia
and will also carry him to Croatia, Slovakia, Azerbaijan and
Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Poland Imports Food to Stabilize Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Polish government has decided
to import 200,000 tons of food tariff free to level the domestic
food prices.
</P>
<P>
The imports, including 50,000 tons of wheat, would be put on
market next week. Experts say the country would have to import 5
million tons of food this year to meet its domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
Food prices are rocketing due to cold waves in early spring
followed by a massive drought in April and May.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of June, wheat flour prices jumped by 20 to 50
percent, and bread prices by 10 to 40 percent, according to media
reports.
</P>
<P>
The drought hit 3.3 million hectares of farmland, or 18 percent
of the country's total, affecting 230,000 rural households and
costing the country more than 350 million zlotys (about 83 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that this year's total harvest would be brought
down by 5 million tons, or 20 percent, compared to 25.8 million
tons last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia agreed to accept a
cease-fire plan proposed by the Organization for African Unity (
OAU) to end its war with Eritrea Wednesday after it recaptures
western Eritrean town of Tesseney.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the Ethiopian prime minister's office said that
the Council of Ministers has accepted the proposal and signed the
plan.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi had informed OAU leaders of the
Council of Ministers' Tuesday meeting on the acceptance of the
peace proposal, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU proposal calls for the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers
in a "security zone" inside Eritrea as well as for Ethiopia to
withdraw to positions it held before February 1999.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has said it would accept the OAU proposal, worked out
in Algiers during 12 days of indirect talks which started late
last month, and blamed Ethiopia for delaying its reply.
</P>
<P>
War between the two Horn of Africa countries broke out in May
1998, fighting for border territories left undefined by Italian
colonialists.

SEOUL, June 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
is likely to fly from Pyongyang to Seoul Thursday afternoon
instead of, as previously scheduled, returning home by car through
the tiny truce village of Panmunjom, a symbol of the division of
the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In confirming the change in the arrangement with Xinhua here
Thursday, Kim Jeong-on, who is in charged of Foreign Media
Division of the Information Agency, declined to specify the reason
of the change.
</P>
<P>
But there are speculations here among South Korean officials
and journalists that the several-hour drive from Pyongyang to
Seoul would be too tiresome for the 75-year president, while
others cited security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Photographers, who will cover President Kim's arrival, were
informed to take a shuttle bus to the airport.
</P>
<P>
Kim will be back to Seoul Thursday afternoon after reaching
landmark agreement on major issues including the national
reunification on the peninsula with Kim Jong Il, leader of the

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Sali Berisha, former Albanian
president and now leader of the Albanian Democratic Party (ADP),
was Wednesday denied entry into Yugoslavia's Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
Berisha, together with some other senior ADP officials, was
stopped at the Morina border point on his way to Pristina, capital
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Interim Executive Committee said the no-admittance
order is made for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Berisha had planned to hold talks with key ethnic Albanian
leaders in Pristina and attend a rally which had not been
authorized by U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The former Albanian president refused to cancel his plan on
Tuesday even after receiving a letter from the Kosovo Interim
Executive Committee, warning him to stay out of the region for
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
On contrary to Berisha's strong protest after his return to
Tirana, Albanian parliamentary leader Skender Gjinushi supported
the move of the Kosovo Interim Executive Committee, saying it did
the right thing.
</P>
<P>
Due to Berisha's pro-independence stance on the Kosovo issue,
there is fear that his visit would aggravate tension in the region.

<HEADLINE> DPRK, South Korean Leaders Highly Evaluate Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the North and the
South of the Korean Peninsula have hailed the inter-Korea summit
as helpful to the national reunification before President Kim Dae-
jung winds up his historic visit to Pyongyang Thursday.
</P>
<P>
 At a banquet hosted in honor of Kim Dae-jung in Pyongyang
Wednesday, Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme
People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (
DPRK), said the summit has "showed a good sign of national unity
to the fellow countrymen."
</P>
<P>
During the summit between DPRK leader Kim Jong Il and Kim Dae-
jung, which started Tuesday, the two sides discussed national
problems earnestly and came to understand each other, he noted,
adding the politicians of Korea can pool all their wisdom and
energies to make reunification a work to be undertaken right now.
</P>
<P>
Kim Yong Nam said he believes that the Pyongyang visit of Kim
Dae-jung will help achieve the country's reunification, the
cherished desire of the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
He said the two days of the summit were meaningful days during
which "years of too long separation seemed to be forgotten during
the too short meeting and talks because of compatriotic feelings."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Kim Dae-jung described the summit as "a great
auspicious event" to be rejoiced over by the whole Korean nation
and the first historic inspiring action in 55 years of division.
</P>
<P>
He said he fully agreed with the statement made by Kim Jong Il
during his recent Chinese visit that the issue of the Korean
Peninsula should be solved by the Korean people themselves. "I am
also sure that the destiny of our nation can be carved out by the
Korean nation itself," he added.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean president said he was confident that the
South-North summit talks were the starting-point for peace and
reunification, the cherished desire of the 70 million Koreans.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Kim Jong Il for the warm reception and hospitality
accorded to him.
</P>
<P>
The second day of the summit ended Wednesday with the signing
of a joint communique containing the historic agreement on the
issues of reconciliation and cooperation, easing of tension and
national unification, reunion of separated families and broad
exchanges in economic and social sectors.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong Il and Kim Dae-jung are expected to have lunch
together before the South Korean president leaves for home
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung is likely to fly home Thursday afternoon instead
of, as previously scheduled, returning by car through the tiny
truce village of Panmunjom, a symbol of the division of the Korean
Peninsula.

BUDAPEST, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Exchanges between the Hungarian
and Chinese governments and parliaments should be further expanded
to better understand each other, Vice Chairperson Katalin Szili of
the Hungarian National Assembly said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting a Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) delegation,
Szili said the visit of the delegation shows that China attaches
great importance to the development of the Hungarian-Chinese
relations.
</P>
<P>
"Fast development and drastic changes taking place in politics,
economics and culture in China in recent years and China's
increasing role in the world affairs have drawn great attention of
Hungary," Szili said. "We both should make more efforts to
cooperate with each other on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit."
</P>
<P>
She also gave her counterpart Buhe, vice chairman of the NPC
Standing Committee who led the delegation, a brief introduction to
the developments of politics and economics in Hungary in the last
few years and the functions of the National Assembly of Hungary.
</P>
<P>
After briefing the host on the role of the NPC, Buhe said the
relations between China and Hungary have been steadily
strengthened since they established diplomatic relations,
especially since the visits to each other countries by the heads
of state of the two countries in 1994 and 1995 respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Exchanges between the parliaments of our two countries will
give an impetus to deepen understanding, improve friendly
relations, increase consensus and cooperation between our two
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation started its five-day visit to Hungary
from June 13.

<TEXT>
<P>
LJUBLJANA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC),
held talks with his Slovenian counterpart Janez Bodobnik on
bilateral relations Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, which proceeded in a friendly atmosphere, the
two leaders also exchanged views on contacts between the two
parliaments and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Bodobnik, chairman of the Slovenian National Assembly, said
Slovenia attaches great importance to its relations with China and
that he hopes Li's visit will promote the relations and help
increase contacts between the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that his country supports the "One China"
policy held by the People's Republic of China and recognizes only
one China.
</P>
<P>
Li said he appreciates Slovenia's stand on China. The big
differences between China and Slovenia in terms of area,
population, history and culture, he said, will not affect
cooperation and exchanges between the two countries. China is
willing to establish ties with various parties in the Slovenian
parliament according to the principle of mutual respect and non-
interference in each other's internal affairs, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On ethnic affairs and human rights, the Chinese leader said it
is quite natural that they may have differences in the
understanding of human rights issues, since various countries have
different social systems, economic conditions, historical
backgrounds, culture, tradition and religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
Li said human rights should be an integrated concept, which
includes not only citizens' political rights, but also their
economic, social and cultural rights, especially their rights to
subsistence and development.
</P>
<P>
He said the conditions of China's current human rights are
better than those in any other periods of China's history.
</P>
<P>
Li also said Tibet has been an inalienable part of China's
territory since ancient times, and that no countries in the world
have deemed that Tibet is an independent country. He said he
welcomes Slovenian friends to visit Tibet to see what has happened
there with their own eyes.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia to Invest More in Bulgaria: Economic Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Slovak companies will invest more in
Bulgaria, visiting Slovak Economy Minister Lubomir Harach said
here Wednesday after meeting his Bulgarian counterpart Peter Jotev.
</P>
<P>
Harach and a large group of Slovak businessmen are accompanying
Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda during his two-day official visit
to Sofia, which started Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia will provide expertise to Bulgaria in bringing the
safety of its nuclear plant in line with international standards,
said Harach.
</P>
<P>
Slovak companies are also interested in the privatization of
the energy sector in Bulgaria and willing to invest in the
expansion of the natural gas distribution network here, Harach
said.
</P>
<P>
They can provide machines for the construction of roads and of
the second Danube bridge between Bulgaria and Romania, and they
can offer know-how for the clearing of the Danube waterway, the
Slovak minister added.
</P>
<P>
It would be of mutual benefit for Bulgarian and Slovak
companies to join their efforts and work as contractors under the
Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two ministers also mentioned the
defense industry, farming and tourism as areas with good prospects
for bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Bulgarian minister noticed that in 1999 the
trade volume between the two countries only totaled 38 million U.S.
dollars, which he said was unsatisfactory. In his view, Bulgaria
can export to Slovakia more food, including fresh fruits, canned
vegetables and canned meat.
</P>
<P>
He said that a meeting of the Bulgarian-Slovak Joint Committee
for Economic, Scientific and Technological Cooperation will be
organized at the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Jotev told a Bulgarian-Slovak business
forum that the agreement on mutual recognition of quality
certificates, which was signed in April, will add impetus to the
exchange of goods.
</P>
<P>
The forum was attended by executives of 35 Bulgarian firms and
25 Slovak companies operating in the fields of construction,
banking, the energy sector, and the chemical, food and glass
industry.

<HEADLINE> British Marines Set for Sierra Leone Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- British marines will leave Sierra
Leone Thursday after the tense situation in the west African
country seems to abate, reports from Freetown said.
</P>
<P>
While the marines are being withdrawn, Britain is leaving a
force of about 50 to train troops over the next six weeks. Another
150 troops will also have limited security duties there.
</P>
<P>
The latest crisis in Sierra Leone erupted when rebels of the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) took hostage hundreds of U.N.
peacekeepers and marched toward Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Many Sierra Leoneans concern that the withdrawal of the British
troops might lead to a collapse in security of the country, once
full responsibility for it is put into the hands of the U.N.
mission and the troops of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's followers.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of peacekeepers taken hostage last month were set free
after Liberian President Charles Taylor, who has close links with
the rebels, intervened.
</P>
<P>
But 21 more Indian peacekeeping soldiers were taken hostage 10
days ago in eastern Sierra Leone, while 235 other peacekeepers
have been surrounded in the town of Kailahun so that they are
unable to move since fighting flared up again in the country last
month.

URUMQI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Pan-Asia Railway Delegation
recently made an inspection tour of China's Alataw Pass, in
northwest China's Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the current tour is to study railway and highway
transport facilities and cargo transit at a section between Alataw
and Druzhba of Kazakhstan on the second Euro-Asia continental
bridge. Alataw Pass is China's second largest railway port.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, organized by Kazakhstan, was composed of 170
members from 25 countries including Russia, Germany, France,
Britain and Italy. This was the largest delegation ever to Alataw
Pass in the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
Alataw Pass, 90 kilometers long and 20 kilometers wide, is a
passage linking China with central and western Asia. As the only
railway and highway border transport center in China, Alataw
handled 3.68 million tons of cargo last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- France's Alstom has stepped up
efforts this year to promote long-term development in China.
</P>
<P>
In February the company signed an agreement with the Nanjing
Puzhen Rolling Stock Works in Nanjing, capital of east China's
Jiangsu Province, to jointly produce 28 trains comprising 168 cars
for a Shanghai light railway line.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month it held an exhibition of its metro train
systems here.
</P>
<P>
The company is also considering further contributing its
experience and expertise to the modernization of the urban
transport systems in more Chinese cities like Guangzhou and
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
An Alstom source said his company is keen on the prospects for
long-term development in China because this country boasts a huge
potential metro train market as it pushes forward with its
urbanization drive.
</P>
<P>
Alstom, with a presence in more than 60 countries, came to
China in the late 1970s and has since established six
representative offices and 11 joint ventures in the country.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Imperial Tombs Discovered in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A group of imperial tombs dating
back more than 700 years were recently discovered under a tea
plantation in the county of Shaoxing in east China's Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
These tombs belong to the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279),
which made Hangzhou, Zhejiang provincial capital, its capital.
</P>
<P>
Local archeologists believe six Southern Song emperors lie
buried in these tombs with their empresses and concubines.
</P>
<P>
Historical data say more than 100 imperial tombs were built in
Shaoxing by the Southern Song Dynasty. Yet their exact whereabouts
had remained unknown since nearly all their ground buildings and
other markers have been destroyed over the past centuries.
</P>
<P>
The tombs were discovered when tea growers were ploughing up
the plantation in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
The ploughing work was immediately stopped and further measures
are being taken to better protect the tombs.

<HEADLINE> Railway Passengers to Enjoy Shorter Train Travel to Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A renovation project is going on
smoothly on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang railway line to meet the
requirements of the Chinese Ministry of Railways which plans to
raise train speeds for a third time on October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The over 2,000-kilometer-long railway is a trunk railroad
linking the eastern and western parts of China, and the only rail
passage from northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to the
interior area of the country.
</P>
<P>
The railway was first completed in the early 1960s, when it
just ran from Lanzhou, capital of Gansu Province, to Urumqi,
capital of Xinjiang. The annual handling capacity of cargoes only
stood at 4 million tons then. Now the railway line has extended to
Alataw Pass in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of the renovation project, train ride from
Urumqi to Beijing will be shortened from the former 60 hours to
less than 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Trains with a speed of 140 kilometers per hour can run on the
renovated railway.
</P>
<P>
China began to raise train speeds on April 1, 1997.

<HEADLINE> China's Summer Grain Output to Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China's summer grain output is
expected to drop 10 percent from 1999 to stand at 105 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Ministry of Agriculture officials as
saying that the drop is attributed to a cut in crop acreage,
severe drought and falling prices.
</P>
<P>
The total area devoted to summer grain crops decreased to 29.3
million hectares this year, and the drought in north China and
along the Yellow and Huaihe rivers has hurt wheat growth since
March.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the drought will continue to wreak
havoc on China's agriculture production and may even spread to the
south.
</P>
<P>
Low rainfall had affected 12.4 million hectares of crops while
the high temperature had caused proliferation of plant diseases
and insects by the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
In addition to natural factors, the chronologically low market
prices for grain and farm produce has sabotaged the farmers'
incentive to farm.

All the hotline numbers end in 148, which sounds similar to the

<HEADLINE> Health Care Stressed in Western Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- As China develops its western
areas, the country should change its medical and health care
policies to better serve farmers, the majority of the population
in the west, said an article in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
More spending on western infrastructure has been advocated for
a long time, and it seems that only preferential policies for
business people will alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
However, "investment in human resources is equally important,"
argued the author Zhu Ling, a research fellow with the Economic
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The economic inferiority of the west not only stems from its
harsh natural conditions and poor infrastructure, but also from
the quality of human resources: namely, education and health lage
behind national averages.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that public health care has yet to receive its due
respect when the significance of education has been widely
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has pledged to guarantee all farmers'
basic medical care this year. To this end, the government should
improve its medical services.
</P>
<P>
It also must regulate the rural medical market, control surging
drug prices and reallocate income to ease poor people's health
care costs, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Government investment in public disease prevention has declined
since the early 1980s. With less government financing, many
western rural public health indices have not met State-prescribed
minimal standards.
</P>
<P>
Now that the market is playing a role in the medical industry,
the problem is no longer a lack of drugs or medical services as
before. So again, the government must change its health care
policies.
</P>
<P>
Countryside health care should receive priority attention, and
the focus of medical work should be disease prevention and cutting
costs, the article said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Writers and publishers of science
books and magazines for general audience are trying to prepare
their industry for China's entry into the World Trade Organization
(WTO), the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Due to lack of creativeness and vividness, China's science
publications usually attract few readers.
</P>
<P>
After China joins WTO, some protective policies enjoyed by
Chinese publishers, such as limits of market entry on foreign
publications and protective prices will no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
Domestic publishers, especially science book publishers, will
face much tougher competition, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In seeking a way out, Li Shi, editor-in-chief of the Popular
Science Publishing House, suggested the industry improve quality
and appeal of mass-market science books to attract domestic
readers and increase exports.
</P>
<P>
Currently, at least 7,000 mass-market science books and more
than 300 science magazines roll off the presses each year, three
times more than in the early 1980s.

<P>
BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature will pass
a package of laws and regulations in the coming years to protect
the environment while developing economy, the English-language
newspaper China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The seven draft laws and regulations cover the evaluations of
environmental influences, limiting sandstorms and desertification,
cleaner production processes, controlling pollutant discharges,
limiting pollution from automobiles and licensing the disposal of
hazardous wastes.
</P>
<P>
The new laws will supplement the nation's 19 environmental laws
and 123 administrative regulations on environmental and resources
protection formulated by the State Council, said Sun Youhai, an
official of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Despite the push for the new laws, Chris Van Lint, general
manager of the Regulatory Affairs Department of Bayer China Co.
Ltd. said that China's current environmental laws are of "world
standard."
</P>
<P>
The paper said that implementing environmental laws is a
central government priority. Thousands of small polluting
enterprises have been shut down in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Online Grocery Markets Still Kicking in North America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Two separate new studies have
found that the online purchases of food and groceries in both the
United States and Canada are in the early stages of development.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, a study by marketing information provider
NPD Group estimates that online grocery sales reached about 260
million U.S. dollars during the three months ending April this
year. Only 9 percent of all consumers who bought anything over the
Web bought groceries online during the period.
</P>
<P>
But online grocery purchasers also registered the highest
expected purchasing intention when compared to other categories.
Among American consumers who have made online grocery purchases in
the last three months, 40 percent bought only once, 40 percent
bought two to three times, and 20 percent four or more times.
</P>
<P>
NPD's study also found that American online grocery purchasers
are more likely to buy health and beauty aids, office supplies,
flowers, gifts and prescription medications online.
</P>
<P>
The "Canadian women online study" conducted by J.C. Williams
Group, a Canadian retail and marketing consulting firm, found that
only four percent of female Internet buyers have made a food or
grocery purchase online.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that 70 percent of female Canadian
Internet users use the Internet during the shopping process.

<HEADLINE> Italy Leads Group B after Beating Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Francesco Totti and Stefano
Fiore scored one each for Italy's second win at the European
Championship as the Italians beating co-host Beugium on Wednesday
to put the former world champion three points clear at the top of
Group B.
</P>
<P>
Totti headed after six minutes in to the match while Fiore hit
a 20-meter strike for the second after 66 minutes at the King
Bauduin stadium.
</P>
<P>
Italy, now six points from two matches, is virtually sure of a
place in the quarterfinal while Belgium, who won its opening match
2-1 over Sweden, will anxiously await the result of Thursday's
Sweden-Turkey game in Eindhoven, Netherlands, and then hope to
beat the Turks in Brussels on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Italians had started the evening by laying flowers at the
foot of the stand where 39 fans, 31 of them from Italy, were
killed in the Heysel disaster of 1985.
</P>
<P>
This was Italy's first match in the since-renovated and
renamed stadium.
</P>
<P>
Dino Zoff's side made an explosive start to the match. Paolo
Maldini and Inzaghi combined to force two reflex saves out of De
Wilde in the space of a few seconds before Totti put the Azzurri
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Demetri Albertini swung in a cross from the Italian right and
the AS Roma forward met it with a brave stooping header.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later the Belgiums came within inches of an
equaliser when Bart Goor fired in a rasping long range shot which
Toldo tipped on to his crossbar.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians, roared on by most of the 45,000-strong crowd,
dominated possession for much of the half but failed to create
clear goalscoring chances.
</P>
<P>
Marc Wilmots and Yves Vandehaeghe proved more than a match for
Albertini and Antonio Conte in the center of midfield and Gert
Verheyen found acres of space on the Belgian right.
</P>
<P>
But the Italians are past masters at defending a one-goal lead
and withstood the pressure.
</P>
<P>
They sat back at the start of the second half too before
stinging the Belgians with Fiore's brilliant second.
</P>
<P>
Second half substitute Marco Delvecchio had the ball in the
back of the net in the 79th minute but was judged to have pushed
his marker before he scored.
</P>
<P>
This was Italy's first victory over Belgium in 23 years and
their first in the European championship, either in the qualifiers
or finals.

Three minutes later the Belgiums came within inches of an
equaliser when Bart Goor fired in a rasping long range shot which
Toldo tipped on to his crossbar.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians, roared on by most of the 45,000-strong crowd,
dominated possession for much of the half but failed to create
clear goalscoring chances.
</P>
<P>
Marc Wilmots and Yves Vandehaeghe proved more than a match for
Albertini and Antonio Conte in the center of midfield and Gert
Verheyen found acres of space on the Belgian right.
</P>
<P>
But the Italians are past masters at defending a one-goal lead
and withstood the pressure.
</P>
<P>
They sat back at the start of the second half too before
stinging the Belgians with Fiore's brilliant second.
</P>
<P>
Second half substitute Marco Delvecchio had the ball in the
back of the net in the 79th minute but was judged to have pushed
his marker before he scored.
</P>
<P>
This was Italy's first victory over Belgium in 23 years and
their first in the European championship, either in the qualifiers
or finals.
</P>
<P>
Belgium coach Robert Waseige said Italy had deserved their
victory. "I don't mind losing to a team that was better than us. I
think the victory was deserved.
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult for us after they scored so quickly.
Players like Vanderhaeghe and Staelens never stopped running but
the Italians have something we don't - they are used to playing at
the highest level."

<HEADLINE> OECD Meeting in Italy Seeks Bottom Up Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 15 (Xinhua) -- An OECD ministerial meeting wound up
Thursday with approval of a charter, the Bologna Charter, that
seeks to temper free-market globalization with concern for man and
his environment and a bottom up approach to globalization to
replace the focus on the giant multinationals that has dominated
the globalization debate hitherto.
</P>
<P>
Organized in Italian central city of Bologna because northern
and central Italy are home to the many, highly dynamic smaller
companies that form the backbone of Italian economic growth, the
summit said modern, but also sustainable growth can be achieved by
thinking small, or at least in terms of smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
"I think Bologna was a step down the road from Seattle as
regards sustainable development, in economic, social,
environmental and human rights terms," said Italian Industry
Minister Enrico Letta at the closing press conference.
</P>
<P>
The idea of sustainable development is firmly stamped on the
charter's text, signed by fifty countries - not only the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) 29
economically advanced nations, but also some emerging ones.
</P>
<P>
The OECD's assistant Secretary-General, Herwig Schogl, who
joined Letta at the press conference, said that small and medium
enterprise, or the SMEs as the smaller companies are now known in
international jargon, in fact represents the key link in the
globalization debate.
</P>
<P>
Italian news agency Ansa reported that the United States and
Canada argued more vehemently for free markets during the meeting,
while the Europeans, including Britain, joined the emerging
nations in urging measures to curb the market's full violence.
</P>
<P>
But the summit had no powers to hand down orders. "It has no
decision-making powers and can only offer guidelines," said Letta,
while Schlogl admitted that any practical measures are now up to
the governments "on the basis of their national peculiarities".

<HEADLINE> E-signatures Bill Passed by U.S. Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Striking a deal or making a
contract online will soon be possible after U.S. Congress passed a
bill that gives electronic-signatures the same status as ink-and-
paper signatures.
</P>
<P>
The electronic-signature and record keeping bill, passed 426 to
4 by Congress on Wednesday, will make it easier for both companies
and consumers to do business online.
</P>
<P>
For instance, computer users would be able to take out
mortgages, buy insurance, even enter a binding contract with their
roofer without ever leaving their home, signing a piece of paper
or waiting for back-and-forth of mailed paperwork.
</P>
<P>
And business negotiating contracts with each other could enter
binding agreements without having to send paper documents
overnight.
</P>
<P>
"Approval of this legislation will ensure that American
businesses and consumers can take advantage of the digital
revolution," says Rick Lane, the U.S. The technology that allows
for secure e-signature and Internet technology. He calls the
measure "a historic step for e-commerce and the future of the
American economy."
</P>
<P>
The technology to allow for secure e-signatures is still being
developed, however. Among the approaches are encrypted numeric
coding devices and fingerprint or iris scans attached to computers
that verify a person's identity.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to pass the bill later this week.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers fired
five gunshot which suspended a U.N. team from verifying the
Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
 Four shots passed over the heads of the verification team and
one hit the ground in front of the deputy force commander of the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The shooting began after eight U.N. and four Lebanese officers
got out of U.N. marked vehicles and walked towards a barbed wire
fence, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries and the Israelis apologized to the
United Nations, saying it was a stupid mistake, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The verification would resume Friday, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
It is widely seen here that the shots were the reminder of the
difficulties that the United Nations is facing in verifying the
Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has hoped to finish the verification within
days of the abrupt Israeli pullout on May 24.

<HEADLINE> Italy to End Printing of Lira Notes This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The last lira bank-notes still being
printed -the 5,000 notes - will stop coming off the press at the
end of this month ahead of the introduction of the euro in 2002,
Bank of Italy Deputy Director-General Antonio Finocchiaro told a
conference on the changeover here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Cash 2000 conference, Finocchiaro said the
Italian central bank had already spent some 70-80 billion lire (
about 35 million to 40 million U.S. dollars) on buying new
machines and scrapping old ones.
</P>
<P>
Production of euro notes began in July last year, Finocchiaro
recalled. He said the whole series of new notes would be rolling
off the press by October.
</P>
<P>
The effort to keep up with the changeover schedule was putting
a heavy burden on the bank's printing staff, Finocchiaro said.
</P>
<P>
Finocchiaro said the changeover, despite requiring such a
massive effort, would be "an historic event".
</P>
<P>
He noted that 564 days are left to January 1, 2002, when the
euro comes into circulation, and 623 to the end of the period of
double circulation.

The controversy came up when American-Bolivian firm Ductec said
it would suspend on June 30 water supplies to Chilean firms
Antofagasta and Bolivian Railway and National Copper Corporation
if that consumed isn't paid.

Silala spring is found in Bolivia's Potosi department and its

Northern Chile receives about 18,000 cubic meters per day of

supply locomotives.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
Thursday named Commerce Secretary William Daley to take over his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
Delay will resign from the present office on July 15 to replace
Tony Coelho, the former California congressman who was hired by
Gore a year ago to lead the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Daley, 51, son of former Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and
brother of the city's current mayor, has extraordinary connections
in the Democratic Party, and is considered a political insider
with ties to both President Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
Daley, who chaired the 1996 Democratic convention in his native
city of Chicago, helped Clinton win the White House in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He recently led a successful campaign for the White House to
win passage of a legislation granting permanent normal trade
relations status to China by the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
A senior Gore official said Tony Coelho was leaving for health
reasons and on doctor's orders.
</P>
<P>
After suffering stomach pains for three weeks, Coelho checked
into hospital in Washington Monday night. He called Gore Wednesday
night with his resignation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russia Seeks Constructive Cooperation With New Syrian Leaders: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia desires to develop
constructive cooperation with new Syrian leadership in the sphere
of foreign policy, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Moscow hopes "the new Syrian administration will pursue the
policy of President Hafez al-Assad, who passed away last Saturday,
to strengthen multilateral Russian- Syrian cooperation," Ivanov
said in an interview with the Syrian information agency "Sana."
</P>
<P>
"The peace-making process in the Near East is now going through
an important stage," and Russia is in favor of "active joint
actions by the two co-sponsors of the peace process (Russia and
the U.S.) to ensure real progress in the settlement of the
situation in the Near East, its parallel progress in all spheres,"
Ivanov stressed.
</P>
<P>
He expressed conviction that there is a prospect for finding
mutually acceptable solutions to the Syrian-Israeli dispute,
assuring that Russia "will continue to do everything to promote
mutual understanding between Syria and Israel on the basis of the
Madrid formula of 'total peace for total withdrawal'."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said he supports "Syria's balanced position on the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from Southern Lebanon," adding that "
the situation, including the Lebanon situation, can be fully
normalized only by settling the situation in the Near East as a
whole."
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad died of a heart attack last
Saturday morning at the age of 70. His favorite son Bashar, 35, is
believed to become the new head of state of the Middle East
country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton,Arafat Discuss Ways to Break Mideast Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday discussed ways to
break the deadlock between Israel and the Palestinians that
threatens the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the three-hour talks at the White House, Arafat
said the discussions had been "very fruitful".
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader, who arrived here Wednesday evening,
accused Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak of lacking the will for
"a just and comprehensive settlement to achieve peace." He told
reporters that "We need the American role to assure the success of
the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who declared "I want to finish the job" before his
meeting with Arafat, said he would prefer to say as little as
possible about the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to make peace, we're going to have to deal with
the difficult issues, and the less we say now the better, I think,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the Israeli-Palestinian talks were in danger of
collapse, Clinton responded:"I think it's an important moment and
we have to keep working on it."
</P>
<P>
Ahead of his meeting with Arafat, Clinton reportedly held a
long telephone conversation Wednesday night with Barak on the
Israel-Palestinian talks in Washington. Details of the discussions
were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks, which resumed here Tuesday, have
reportedly hit an impasse because the two sides differed on the
release of Palestinian prisoners and an Israeli pullback from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The talks in theory are still aiming to pave the way for a
summit of Arafat, Barak and Clinton later this month to hammer out
a final peace pact between Israel and the Palestinians before the
September 13 deadline.

<HEADLINE> Elian's U.S. Relatives Appeal to Full Appeals Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez's U.S.
relatives appealed to the full 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Atlanta Thursday, calling for a reversal of a decision that
would allow the 6-year-old boy to return to Cuba with his father.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, a three-judge panel of the 12-member court ruled
in favor of Elian's father and denied a political asylum hearing
for Elian as requested by Elian's relatives.
</P>
<P>
Under the ruling, Elian must remain in the United States for 14
days to give his Miami relatives a chance to appeal.
</P>
<P>
The appeal filed Thursday says the panel's decision conflicts
with earlier rulings made by the Supreme Court regarding the power
of a government agency to interpret laws.
</P>
<P>
The appeal also claims the panel ignored the federal law that
it argues allows any alien, even a child acting against his
parents' wishes, to appeal for asylum.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the court's 12 judges would have to agree to hear the
case for it to come before the court. A court order requiring
Elian to stay in the United States could be extended if the court
decides to rehear the appeal.
</P>
<P>
Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez wants to take his son back
to Cuba, but his relatives have been trying to prevent Elian from
being sent back to Cuba with the help of many anti-Cuba people in
Miami, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who survived a migrant boat disaster last November in
which his mother and 10 others died, has been in the United States
after he was picked up by a fisherman off the coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
Elian's Miami relatives cared for him until he was seized from
his relatives' home on April 22 in a government raid and reunited
in Washington with his father.

<HEADLINE> Reno Calls for Better Lawyers, DNA Tests for Death Penalty Inmates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno Thursday called for better lawyers and access to genetic and
other scientific tests for death penalty defendants before they
are convicted.
</P>
<P>
"There are too many people in this country who do not have
competent counsel to represent them in capital cases," Reno said
at her weekly news conference.
</P>
<P>
"People should not be prosecuted for a capital crime until they
have a lawyer who can properly represent them and they have the
investigative and other resources necessary to properly
investigate the charges against them," she said.
</P>
<P>
Reno made the remarks as debate over the death penalty heats up
in the country.
</P>
<P>
A 10-year Columbia University study found recently that two-
thirds of death sentences nationally are overturned on appeal,
often because of an incompetent defense or an overreaching
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Two bills in Congress would provide genetic DNA testing for
inmates already on death row.

<HEADLINE> Putin Warns Europe against U.S. Missile Shield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
warned on Thursday in Berlin that Europe and the world would face
serious dangers if the United States began to develop the proposed
National Missile Defense system.
</P>
<P>
"This is a new spiral of armament and very, very dangerous,"
said Putin in a speech on the first day of his official visit to
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Putin pointed out if the U.S. began to put the proposed NMD
system into effect Europe could feel very "painful".
</P>
<P>
Putin warned that some elements of the limited U.S. system
would have to be stationed in Europe and that it could make Russia
to take countermeasures. But Putin did not say which measure would
be taken.
</P>
<P>
The United States will install radar sites and 100
interceptors which could shoot down the missiles fired at the U.S.
by so-called rogue states such as Iraq and Iran and so on. But
Russia and Germany both think that this would harm the 1972 Anti-
Ballistic Missile( ABM) Treaty which strictly limits such systems
and could set off a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
"If Russia felt itself threatened this would destabilize not
just Europe but the whole world," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
During the first day of his visit to Germany Putin had talks
with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. Two leaders all stressed
the importance of developing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Putin said : "Germany is the most important economic partner
for Russia in Europe." "I don't think overall German-Russian
relations have worsened."
</P>
<P>
Putin has met with German President Johannes Rau and the
former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday Putin will meet with the German business leaders and
lay a wreath at a memorial in Treptow, Berlin for the 600,000
Soviet soldiers who died during the World War II and were buried
in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Condemns New Maneuvers in Elian Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 15 (Xinhua)-- Cuba accused as new postponing
maneuver, the appeal presented Thursday by distant relatives of
boy Elian Gonzalez, obliging the young one and his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, to stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Aymee Hernandez said at the
weekly press conference that this appeal forms part of the
maneuvers his relatives have carried out for a long time for Elian
to lose his identity.
</P>
<P>
"Cuba will not renounce the boy's return to the island",
stressed the spokeswoman when commenting on the new resource
presented by Lazaro Gonzalez, great-uncle of the minor before
Atlanta Appeal Court.
</P>
<P>
Elian, six years-old, survived last November the shipwreck of
an illegal immigrant trafficking, in which his mother and step-
father died, and was delivered in American city of Miami to
distant relatives, who refused to give him back to his father.
</P>
<P>
On April 22, U.S. Federal Agents rescued the boy and took him
to Washington, where he was given to his father, who traveled from
Cuba to the United States to pick him up.
</P>
<P>
Currently, father and son await in America's capital a judicial
decision on his case, which was extended this Thursday for
indefinite time with the Miami relatives' appeal, who are trying
for political asylum to be granted the child.
