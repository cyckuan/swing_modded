<HEADLINE> S. Africa Sets up Elite Anti-Crime Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- An FBI-style special
investigative unit, dubbed the Scorpions, was officially launched
in South Africa Wednesday, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching, President Thabo Mbeki said the
200-strong unit had the ability to beat crime and the government
would be watching for results.
</P>
<P>
Super cop Frank Dutton will head the unit, whose official name
is the Directorate of Special Investigations.
</P>
<P>
Dutton said his brief was to produce a dedicated pool of
skilled professionals with the resources and capacity to
effectively combat organized and syndicate crime, serious economic
offenses, corruption in the criminal justice system and crimes
against the state.
</P>
<P>
"Although I am excited about the future of the Scorpions, I am
certainly under no illusion as to the enormity of the task we
face. I accept the position with some trepidation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that there were no quick fix solutions.
</P>
<P>
"What we aim to achieve will take some time to establish. We
want to develop a skilled and dedicated investigations capacity.
We intend to start out with an initial staff component of about
200 people, and hope to grow to a full complement of approximately
2,000 members over the next two years. "
</P>
<P>
Dutton emphasized that the Scorpions would not replace existing
law enforcement structures but would aim to complement and
reinforce existing efforts.
</P>
<P>
Dutton's new team will report directly to National Director of
Public Prosecutions Bulelani Ngcuka.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Relocate Major Settlements of Quake-hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said here Wednesday that the government has started to
consider relocating at least three major settlements battered by
the August 17 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Receiving Nasuh Mahruki, leader of Turkey's Search and Rescue
Society, Ecevit said geological conditions must be take into
account in planning new settlements, adding that settlements
established in natural disaster-prone areas should be relocated to
safer places.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that many of the settlements and industrial
establishments were built in high-risk quake or flood areas,
Ecevit said it was impossible to correct the situation overnight
but the country must act immediately to avoid future mishaps.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that at least three of the nine major settlements
battered by the killer quake, namely Adapazari, Golcuk and
Degirmender, will be reconstructed in safer locations.
</P>
<P>
On August 17, a 7.4-magnitude quake hit populous northwestern
Turkey, killing over 14,000 people, injuring 24,000 others and
leaving over 500,000 people homeless.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Predicts Half Mln AIDS-Related Deaths in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Projections showed that
the number of AIDS-related deaths in South Africa would increase
from 200,000 in the year 2000 to half-a-million in 2010, South
African Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question by a member of parliament from an
opposition party, she said the short and medium-term projections
were based on data from past and current trends in the HIV
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Longer projections were considered of little value due to the
complex and relatively unknown dynamics affecting the future
spread of HIV which causes AIDS, she said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Education Minister Kader Asmal
Wednesday released a policy document which bans discrimination
against pupils, students and teachers who disclose they are
HIV-positive or have AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The policy did not compel pupils, students and teachers with
HIV or AIDS to disclose this fact to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, any affected person would be free to disclose such
information voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, "appropriate measures" must be taken
where the affected person poses a health risk to others.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear what these measures are.
</P>
<P>
The policy also emphasizes life-skills training and stipulates
that pupils, students and teachers must receive education about
HIV and AIDS on an ongoing basis.

<HEADLINE> S. African Trade With Rest of Africa Booming: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's exports to
the rest of Africa now total some 20 billion rand (3.3 billion
U.S. dollars) a year, according to a report released Wednesday by
the United Nations news agency, IRIN, in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
This indicated an expansion of 335 percent since 1992 when
trade sanctions against South Africa were lifted.
</P>
<P>
The report, compiled by a research group for South Africa's
export promotion trade fair, Saitex, showed that most of South
Africa's export trade was in manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
The figures however excluded exports to South Africa's partners
in the Southern African Customs Union that comprise Botswana,
Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
It was not all good news. The figures also showed a sharp
slowdown in the growth of this trade in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the export trade had grown by 61 percent from 1992,
while in 1996 the figure stood at only a 27 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 export trade grew by only 11 percent and last year a
mere three percent growth was recorded.
</P>
<P>
This decline, according to the report, was partly because of
the worldwide recession and also because of the unresolved trade
dispute with South Africa's main neighboring market of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The trade dispute between the two countries, it said, revolved
around the trade deficit which favors South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe imports goods worth about 325 million dollars per
annum from South Africa, while South Africa imports from Zimbabwe
goods worth only about 75 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report said there was a fall last year of 15 percent in
South Africa' s imports from the rest of Africa, which was "bound
to create political tensions within the region".

However, according to reports reaching here from Togo's capital

Sankoh apparently quickened his homing pace against a

him to go back to help the slack disarming process in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the BBC before leaving Togo, Sankoh pledged that
his men would respect the agreement scrupulously, despite what he

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese civilians and
five members of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) were
killed Wednesday in clashes between Israeli troops and Lebanese
guerrillas, according to Lebanese security sources.
</P>
<P>
The five SLA militiamen were killed by a roadside bomb near
the Labbaya village in the western Bekka Valley which borders the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the explosion.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli artillery troops blasted the village,
killing two villagers identified as Hassan Akel, 22, and Fatmeh
Jabali, 25. Another five civilians were also wounded in the
shelling.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also raided several suspected Hezbollah
targets in the occupied zone which was set up in 1985 by Israel
to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
But there has been no immediate casualties reports from the
Israeli air raids.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hezbollah warned that if one more Lebanese civilian
was attacked by Israeli fire it would fire Katyusha rockets into
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I want to tell the (Israeli) settlers to be ready as of today
to go to bomb shelters any time a Lebanese civilian is
wounded," Hezbollah's second-in-command Naim Kassem said at a
funeral procession held in Beirut for a Hezbollah fighter.
</P>
<P>
He also said Hezbollah would not take the impending Middle East
tour by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright into
consideration when it picks the time and venue for launching
Katyusha missiles.

<P>
BAGHDAD, September 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes on
Wednesday bombed some civilian and service installations in
northern Iraq while a U.S. congressional delegation is in Iraq
for a visit, said an Iraqi military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 11:05 (0705 GMT) seven formations
of U.S. and British warplanes coming from a Turkish base violated
northern Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Erbil and Neineva provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy planes bombed some civilian facilities in Mosul,
the capital city of Neineva province, said the spokesman. He did
not mention whether casualties were caused or not.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired missiles at the
enemy planes and repulsed them to their base in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases
also violated southern Iraqi airspace in the day, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the U.S. congressional delegation,
which arrived here on Sunday to assess the humanitarian
consequences of nine years of U.N. sanctions, visited a children
hospital in southern Iraqi province of Misan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation was received on Tuesday by Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. One member of the delegation said they
had a "useful, interesting, productive and warm discussion" with
Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have been targetting Iraqi civilian and military
targets in the no-fly zones, causing severe civilian casualties
and property damage.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against attacks by Iraqi government troops.

ADDIS ABABA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- An aircraft, which was
shot down by Ethiopian anti-craft forces on August 29, has been
identified as a jet registered in the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to a government press release issued on Monday, the
U.S. registered plane was downed after it had entered a no-fly
zone while flying through Ethiopian air space near the northern
town of Adwa, about 40 kilometers of the Eritrean border.

All aircrafts that pass through Ethiopian air space should
follow the civil aviation route, the release said.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov: Russia Regards Abkhazia as Integral Part of Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
said here Wednesday that Russia regards Abkhazia as an integral
part of Georgia and that the results of a planned referendum in
the breakaway region will not alter Moscow's stance.
</P>
<P>
"Russia, just as the whole world community, does not recognize
Abkhazia's independence proclaimed in the constitution adopted (by
the separatists) in November 1994," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"A referendum, scheduled for October 3 this year, if it is
held, will not change our position," the Itar-Tass news agency
quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia is an autonomous region within Georgia. Ethnic
Abkhazis launched a bloody military campaign and, by late 1993,
had gained control of much of the region. A cease-fire providing
for Russian peacekeepers was signed in Moscow May 14, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Georgia has decided to prolong the Russian peacekeepers'
presence in the region, a decision Ivanov welcomed as
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
"For many years, Russian servicemen have been on a dangerous
peacekeeping mision in Abkhazia. Peace has been maintained in the
conflict zone, to a greater extent, thanks to their efforts," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The political status of Abkhazia must be determined on the
basis of agreements of the sides involved in the conflict, during
the talks, which are conducted with Russia's participation under
U.N. auspices," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"The decision of the Abkhazian authorities to hold a referendum
may have a negative effect on the process of the settlement of the
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing a U.N. Security Council resolution adopted July 30 this
year, Ivanov described a planned presidential election in Abkhazia
as "unacceptable and illegal."

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Minister in Prime
Minister's Office Haim Ramon said Wednesday he was optimistic that
Israel and the Palestinians could reach agreement on the
implementation of the Wye interim agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ramon made the statement after two hours of talks with senior
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat at a Jerusalem hotel.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held after the negotiations between Erekat and
his Israeli counterpart Gilad Sher broke down earlier Wednesday
over the release of Palestinian prisoners and a target date for
the conclusion of the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office issued a statement
after the breakdown, demanding the Palestinians to come up with a
satisfactory proposals before the start of a security meeting
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
After the gaps narrowed in rounds of talks, the Palestinians
demand that Israel release 400 political prisoners, those jailed
for anti-Israel activities, but Israel insists that it will
release only 350.
</P>
<P>
Israel has proposed that the two sides reach a framework on the
final-status talks, which deal with thorny issues like the

comprehensive agreement in December that year.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians want the final agreement to be reached in
April, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have hoped that Barak and Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat would be able to sign a
memorandum on the revised Wye agreement at a ceremony in Egypt
Thursday, in the presence of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who started a

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Hails Signing of Lusaka Cease-fire for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda Wednesday hailed the
signing of the Lusaka accord on Tuesday by founding members of the
main Congolese rebel movement, the Congolese Rally for Democracy
(RCD).
</P>
<P>
"This is a positive step toward ending the civil war in Congo,
which could pave the way to peace and stability in the region,"
the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) quoted government spokesman, Wilson
Rutayisire, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Rwanda which negotiated the accord, and
signed it, is fully committed to its implementation.
</P>
<P>
As for the military situation in the wake of the signing of the
Lusaka deal, Rutayisire said Rwandan troops are at a standstill,
and will remain in their positions until the U.N. peace-keeping
force is deployed.
</P>
<P>
On pulling out of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),
Rutayisire said, "those genocidal forces should be disarmed and
neutralized before any talk of pulling our troops out of Congo."
</P>
<P>
When the RCD launched the rebellion to remove Congolese
President Laurent Kabila from power on August 2 last year, Rwanda
committed troops to helping the rebels, with the aim of doing away
with the Hutu extremist forces which were using the Congolese
territory as a launching pad for their cross- border raids inside
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 10,000 "Interahamwe" militiamen were reportedly
airlifted from areas in the east of the Congo for training,
reorganization, in its southeastern Katanga province.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of this force constitutes the backbone of the support
to Kabila' s loyalist forces which are also strongly backed by
troops from Zimbabwe, Angola, and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the issue of Rwandan Hutu extremists in
the Congo, as well as other regional guerrilla forces operating on
the side of Kabila constitutes the hardest bit of the accord to
chew.
</P>
<P>
There have been allegations by RCD rebels that Kabila has
already started distributing the Congolese identity papers to the
militia which have been fighting for him, thus saving them from
any arrest, disarming, or handing over to Rwanda or to the
International Tribunal in Arusha, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
These allegations, however, have not been independently
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Another obstacle people have foreseen is the capacity of the
25,000 U.N. peace-keepers expected to be deployed to disarm the
"Interahamwe" scattered in the Congolese jungle forests for they
will not offer themselves gratuitously, even if they were
operating under Chapter VII.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of the Lusaka accord is one thing, but many
problems remain ahead to have it successfully implemented," one
political analyst, who spoke on anonymity condition, said.

<HEADLINE> Productive Offshore Oil Field Discovered in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Esso Exploration Angola Limited
(Esso) has announced an exciting discovery of productive oil
structure "Xilomba" in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Angola.
</P>
<P>
"Xilomba" is the sixth productive oil structure discovered in
the same block of sea called "Block 15" since 1998, by the Esso,
an affiliated company of the U.S. Exxon Corporation, mass media
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newly-sunken oil well, denominated as "Xilomba-1" by Esso
and Sonangol, Angola's largest and sole petroleum company, is
situated in "Block 15", about 400 kilometers northwest to Luanda,
capital of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The "Xilomba-1" oil well, with a total depth of 2,876 meters,
passes 1, 335 meters through water before reaching the surface of
the earth crust.
</P>
<P>
According to Sonangol, which monopolizes the country's oil
industry, Xilomba-1 is "good for petroliferous reserve", with a
1,435-barrel-per-day volume of flow in a test of production.
</P>
<P>
Complete and exact evaluation of the productive capacity of the
oil field needs more biological studies, said the press.
</P>
<P>
In the same block of sea, five productive oil wells have been
announced since 1998, including wells named as Hungo, Kissanje,
Marimba, Dikanza and Chocalho.
</P>
<P>
Contractors of the Block 15 include Esso (having 40 percent of
the investment in the block), BP Exploration Angola Limited (26.67
percent), the Agip Angola Limited (20 percent) and the Den Norske
Stats Oljeselskap (13.33 percent), with Esso as the operator.
</P>
<P>
Angola, the second largest oil producing country in sub-Saharan
Africa, only after Nigeria, divided its seas, abundant of oil,
into blocks.
</P>
<P>
International companies have to compete with each other for the
 authorization of exploration by the government.
</P>
<P>
Sonangol, as the representative of the Angolan government in
the field, enjoys a share in the oil production.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Stresses Role of Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said Wednesday that the government recognizes the
indispensable role the private sector is capable of playing in the
provision of quality infrastructure in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said this when commissioning the Bulawayo-Beitbridge
railway line at Umzingwane Bridge of west Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The railway line which started working three months ago had led
to the reduction in rail distance between Beitbridge and Bulawayo,
the second largest city of the country, by more than 200
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The railway line set aside 15 percent share holding for the
National Railways of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said there were many opportunities for the private
sector to enter into joint ventures or partnerships with the
government to improve the country's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The president said through its new economic policy, Zimbabwe
made an undertaking to involve more private sector participants in
key sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said in line with economic reforms that were taking place in
the rail, road, power and civil aviation transport sub-sectors,
the government had decided to reorient itself in order to
concentrate more on regulating them.
</P>
<P>
The president said the reorientation would result in
facilitating investment, ensuring fair competition and provision
of quality services.
</P>
<P>
"The railway line will not only enhance national economic
growth, but it will also help to foster regional economic growth
and trade, particularly with South Africa," Mugabe added.

<TEXT>

LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) - Fitch IBCA, the international
rating agency assigned Wednesday Short-and Long-term ratings to
Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) of 'F2' and 'BBB' respectively.
</P>
<P>
It assigned the same Long-and Short-term ratings to IBK as to
the Republic of Korea. The bank is 98 percent government-owned and
operates under a special law, the Industrial Bank of Korea Act.
</P>
<P>
In the same way as for the Korea Development Bank, there is a
provision in this law, which requires the government to make good
any losses incurred by the bank and not covered by its own
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Although this does not amount to an explicit guarantee of
specific liabilities of the bank, it means that the government is
legally obliged to maintain the bank's solvency.
</P>
<P>
In Fitch IBCA's opinion this means that in practice the
government will ensure that the bank is able to meet its
obligations in a timely manner.

<HEADLINE> NATO Replaces Its Troops in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) Wednesday held a hand-over ceremony at the
Rinas Airport for its forces in Albania, at which new NATO forces
called "Communication Zone West (COMMZW)" replaced its old troops
on "humanitarian" missions in Albania called "AFOR".
</P>
<P>
AFOR and the Albanian government had faced tremendous
challenges of Kosovo refugees during the Kosovo crisis and AFOR
extended significant assistance to the Albanian government and the
Albanian people, said Admiral James Ellis, commander of NATO's
Allied Forces for South Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of AFOR's "humanitarian" role, AFOR also
contributed a great deal to the ending of the Kosovo crisis, said
Ellis who arrived here specially for attending the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the ceremony, Albanian Defense Minister
Juan Hajdaraga said that AFOR has successfully completed its
"humanitarian" missions in Albania and he expressed thanks for
AFOR's assistance to Albania.
</P>
<P>
Stressing Albania would not forget the assistance that AFOR
extended to Albania during the past more than four months,
Hajdaraga said that the Albania government will give support to
COMMZW'S operations in Albania.
</P>
<P>
AFOR Commander Gen. John Reith said that 25 countries
participating in AFOR missions made enormous contribution in
helping the Albanian government to copy with the refugee crisis
and helping ending the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that the deployment of COMMZW shows that NATO will
continue its presence in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The new COMMZW Commander Gen. Pietro Frisone pledged that he
would do his best to lead his forces to carry out well the
missions of COMMZW in Albania.
</P>
<P>
According to AFOR press officers, the main task of COMMZW,
which means NATO's communication zone west of Kosovo, is to
provide logistic support to NATO peacekeeping forces in Kosovo,
including ensuring the roads leading to Kosovo, while it will help
rehabilitate infrastructure in Albania.
</P>
<P>
AFOR Commander Reith early this week said that Albania has very
various suitable zones for shooting grounds and military
exercises, his remarks implied that COMMZW might have a mission
for conducting training exercises in Albania in the future.
</P>
<P>
AFOR came into Albania in mid-April during the Kosovo crisis.
Its first contingent of some 270 French soldiers arrived on April
12 and its main body moved into the country On April 20.
</P>
<P>
COMMZW will be under the command of Gen. Mickael Jackson,
commander of NATO's forces in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Russia Criticizes Summers' Remarks on IMF Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian official said
Wednesday that he is bewildered by U.S. Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers' statement that Washington will not support the
extension of new IMF credits to Russia until a report on the use
of earlier loans is forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
"I am not sure at the moment what Summers wants to check," the
Interfax news agency quoted Alexander Livshits, the Russian
president's special envoy in international financial institutions,
as saying at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The use of earlier IMF funds has been reviewed and the findings
of the review made public, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the IMF team now in Moscow is supportive of the
Russian Cabinet's monetary and economic policy, Livshits said.
</P>
<P>
The PriceWaterhouseCoopers auditing company has already
published its findings on the activities of the Bank of Russia, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I would love to know what more the U.S. treasury secretary
wants to check," Livshits said.
</P>
<P>
Summers' statement came amid Western media reports on alleged
money laundering by Russian mobsters through several U.S. bank
accounts. Some newspapers said IMF loans could be involved.
</P>
<P>
Livshits said that he does not understand the "game" or why or
by whom it was started. He said he was surprised to see his name
mentioned in a number of articles.
</P>
<P>
"Every country faces problems, but nobody should be allowed to
humiliate Russia. This scandal will not be easy to forget," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Russia
would not tolerate Western attempts to slander the country.
</P>
<P>
Moscow will not accept the "use of unverified facts to cast a
shadow on our country," Ivanov told students at the Moscow Foreign
Relations Institute.
</P>
<P>
Corruption does exist and is a problem, he said, but this
manner of discussing it in "some Western mass media is not
fighting corruption but targeted politics," he said.
</P>
<P>
The scandal surrounding "Russian money laundering" is in effect
the policy "of certain circles, which do not want Russia to
reclaim its role as a great power in the international arena," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the scandal might be linked "to the election
campaigns underway in Russia and the United States."

<HEADLINE> New WTO Chief Pledges to Help Least Developed Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The new director-general of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) Mike Moore pledged to help the
poorest countries when he officially took office here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The very poor, the (48) least-developed countries, still don't
get the access they need for their products and the technical
assistance to fully engage, so that they can sit at the table of
our global family and share equally and fully," the former New
Zealand prime minister said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The new WTO chief called on the richer countries to play their
part by opening their own markets to goods from poorer regions,
saying "it would not cost rich nations much to wipe away barriers
for the poorest countries."
</P>
<P>
Moore said that addressing the plight of the poorest members
had to be a key element of the agenda for the WTO's third
Ministerial Conference in the U.S. west coast city of Seattle
scheduled for November 30 to December 3.
</P>
<P>
Moore and Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand were chosen as the
WTO's next two consecutive leaders by the ruling General Council
on July 22.
</P>
<P>
Moore will head the WTO until August 31, 2002 when he will be
replaced by Supachai who will also serve a three-year term until
August 31, 2005.
</P>
<P>
At the decision-making meeting on July 22, WTO members agreed
that neither should be eligible for re-appointment as WTO chief,
nor should the period of office be extended.
</P>
<P>
Normally, the term of office of the WTO chief is four years as
former WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero had served.
</P>
<P>
The decision was a compromise based on proposals by Bangladesh
and Australia after a year-long dispute among WTO members on who
would succeed Ruggiero. Ruggiero left office as scheduled on April
30, 1999.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Drops in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department
reported Wednesday that U.S. construction spending declined 0.5
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 695.7 billion
dollars in July.
</P>
<P>
Construction spending in June also fell slightly instead of
previously estimated 0.5 percent gain, according to the revised
government figures.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said July's spending decrease was unexpected and
signaled one of the economy's strongest sectors is beginning to
slow.
</P>
<P>
Home building and other construction activity were a key
contributing factor to the strong economic growth in the early
part of the year.
</P>
<P>
In order to slow down the economy and prevent inflation, the
Federal Reserve last week bumped up interest rates by a quarter of
a point, making borrowing more expensive.
</P>
<P>
Rising mortgage rates took a bite out of the housing market in
July. Existing-home sales dropped 3.9 percent, while sales of new
homes increased a slight 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Today's report showed that spending on all private construction
projects fell 0.7 percent in July, following a tiny increase in
June. Private construction totaled 545 billion dollars, on a
seasonally adjusted annual basis. However, spending on hotels and
motels, and office buildings showing increases.
</P>
<P>
Spending on government projects rose 0.3 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 150.7 billion dollars, after
falling slightly in June. Government spending on schools and other
educational facilities, conservation and development systems and
water supply plants all showed decreases.
</P>
<P>
The report said spending on all residential projects fell 0.8
percent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 319
billion dollars with spending on single-family homes down while
spending on apartments was up.

<HEADLINE> IFC Finances Development of Oilfields in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) has signed an agreement to invest 55 million
U.S. dollars in Harken de Colombia Ltd., a subsidiary of the
U.S.-based Harken Energy Corporation, to develop four oilfields in
Colombia, the IFC announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
IFC's investment will finance the first stage of development of
the Bolivar Block in Colombia's Middle Magdalena Valley. This
phase will include drilling nine wells and constructing facilities
and transmission pipelines to produce up to 30,000 barrels of oil
per day which will be exported via Covenas on the country's
Caribbean coast.
</P>
<P>
The project will have a positive economic impact on the
community by employing local labor and contractors and upgrading
education, transport, and health facilities in the area, said IFC,
a member of the World Bank Group.
</P>
<P>
The total costs of the project are 158 million dollars. IFC's
financing consists of loans totaling 30 million dollars for its
own account and a syndicated loan of 25 million dollars for the
account of participants. The syndicated loan has been jointly
arranged by Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, the investment banking
arm of Dresdner Bank AG, and is fully underwritten by Dresdner
Bank Lateinamerika AG.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Seek Pause in Aid to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States will seek
a pause in the aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to
Russia until there is an adequate safeguards for the money, U.S.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said.
</P>
<P>
Summers, who took over as treasury secretary last month, made
the remarks in an exclusive interview with the USA Today on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. will not support disbursement of the next tranche
without adequate safeguards to assure that any funds disbursed are
used properly (and) without adequate accounting," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 182-member IMF is scheduled to release another 640 million
U.S. dollars of a 4.5 billion U.S. dollars loan package to Russia.
USA Today said the IMF has lent Russia 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that some of the 10 billion U.S. dollars allegedly
funneled through the Bank of New York by Russian gangsters in a
money-laundering scheme may have involved IMF loans to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The British Pricewaterhouse auditing firm has been conducting a
study on the IMF loans. The U.S. administration is also
investigating the allegations. But an IMF official said on Monday
that there was no evidence that the IMF loans were misused.
</P>
<P>
"As these investigations continue and as these revelations come
to light, we'll have to make judgements about what constitutes a
satisfactory accounting," Summers said.

ANKARA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Minister of Public
Works and Housing Koray Aydin said here on Wednesday that Turkey
would spend about 200 million U.S. dollars to set up prefabricated
buildings for the earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
Aydin told reporters that Provincial Bank General Directorate

apartments before they move to their permanent residences, said
the minister, adding that his ministry had started looking for
fields to erect prefabricated buildings near cities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Open Draw Wide Open As Sampras, Rafter Withdraw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- In a span of 13 hours, the
men's draw of the U.S. Open was torn wide open when it lost top
seed Pete Sampras of the United States and two-time defending
champion Patrick Rafter of Australian due to injuries.
</P>
<P>
Play had hardly begun at 11 a.m. today when the shocking news
came that Sampras, who was seeking his record 13th Grand Slam
title and fifth U.S. Open championship, had withdrawn with a
strain in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
Rafter brought an abrupt and painfully early end to his hopes
for a third straight title when he retired in the fifth set of his
featured night match against Cedric Pioline of France with an
aching right shoulder that has bothered him all summer.
</P>
<P>
Although second-seeded Andre Agassi now must be considered the
favorite, the top half of the 128-player men's draw is wide open
and devoid of superstars.
</P>
<P>
"It's tough for the tournament," Rafter said, "especially with
Peter playing such great tennis and my form was pretty good as
well coming into here. I was feeling pretty confident about having
some good wins here."
</P>
<P>
Sampras suffered the injury Sunday during a practice session
with Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil. He had been the hottest player on
the men's tour, winning Wimbledon for the sixth time and taking 24
consecutive matches and four titles before withdrawing with a hip
injury during a match against fellow American Vincent Spadea two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-seeded Rafter won the first two sets against
Pioline,topping out his serve at 117 miles per hour -- which may
have taken its toll. He received treatment on several occasions
for his ailing shoulder, which had sidelined him since his
withdrawal in Indianapolis less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"It is a sharp pain," admitted Rafter, who became the first
defending men's singles champion in the 119-year history of the
tournament to retire in a first-round match. "I felt it mostly on
my serve, and occasionally when returning his serve on my backhand.
"
</P>
<P>
Tim Henman of Britain became the first casualty among the top
men. The sixth seed was ousted 7-6 (7-1), 6-4, 6-3 by Guillermo
Canas of Argentina. Canas, who is ranked 68th in the world, was 0-
5 on hard courts this year before the upset.
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport opened defense of her title by
eliminating doubles partner and fellow Amercian Corina Morariu 6-0,
6-3 in a day match.
</P>
<P>
Five other seeded men's players were in action Tuesday and
13th seed Alex Corretja of Spain is headed home after being beaten
by Wayne Arthurs of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the fifth-seeded Kuerten beat Bohdan Ulihrach of
the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-4, 6-3; No. 7 Todd Martin of the United
States avoided a five-set meltdown and held off Stephane Huet of
France 6-4, 6-7 (2-7), 6-7 (5-7).7-6 (7-3) in a four-hour match.
No. 16 Nicolas Kiefer of Germany fought off Jason Stoltenberg of
Australia 6-4, 6-3, 1-6, 4-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, two-time champion and fourth seed Monica
Seles of the United States routed Germany's Barbara Rittner 6-1,6-
1. Fifth seed Mary Pierce of France ousted Yugoslavia's Sandra
Nacuk 6-3, 7-5; No. 9 Julie Halard-Decugis of France beat Cara
Black of Zimbabwe 6-3, 5-7, 6-3; No. 14 Sandrine Testud of France
and No.16 Conchita Martinez of Spain also beat their rivals
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Serena Williams of the United States needed only 49 minutes to
beat countrywoman Kimberly Po 6-1, 6-0.

<HEADLINE> Police Break Up Anti-Nuclear Blockade in Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Swiss police Wednesday broke up
a two-day protest by Greenpeace activists outside the Gosgen
nuclear power plant, according to the Berne-based European Nuclear
Society.
</P>
<P>
The protesters began the blockade on Tuesday in an attempt to
prevent a train carrying 12 spent fuel elements from leaving the
plant site.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the European Nuclear Society said that
demonstrators chained themselves to a heavy iron box on a stretch
of railway track, in a bid to stop the transport operation getting
underway today as planned.
</P>
<P>
About 16 members of the local cantonal police force were at the
scene in the early hours of this morning, and six protesters were
arrested and taken away for questioning. The four people in
chains, three men and a woman, remained at the scene overnight,
with police attempting to negotiate a peaceful and voluntary end
to the protest.
</P>
<P>
Police officers cleared the area shortly before noon, and the
train left the site about two hours later as scheduled. The spent
fuel involved is part of a total consignment of 48 elements being
sent to Cogema's reprocessing plant at La Hague in northern
France.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, France and Germany imposed a ban on such transport
operations in May last year, after contamination on spent fuel
containers became a public issue.
</P>
<P>
France resumed spent fuel transports last year after more
stringent cleaning and monitoring methods were introduced, and the
Swiss authorities recently lifted their ban.
</P>
<P>
The German authorities have not yet given the go-ahead for a
resumption, although preparations for a restart have already been
made by the UK reprocessing firm BNFL.

<HEADLINE> Fate of Missing S. African Plane Still Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- By Wednesday afternoon
there was still no word on the fate of two pilots who disappeared
over Ethiopia Sunday in a Johannesburg-bound flight, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Linden Birns, spokesman for aviation group ExecuJet, was quoted
as saying that the pilots, one a South African-based British
national and the other a Swedish citizen, had been equipped with
satellite telephones.
</P>
<P>
"If they had needed to make an unscheduled landing, they would
have contacted us," he said. "We haven't heard a word."
</P>
<P>
Birns said the company was still trying to persuade the
Ethiopian and Eritrean governments to launch a search and rescue
mission for the missing Learjet.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to get them to provide information as to what
may have become of the aircraft," the spokesman said. "We are at
a loss to explain what might have happened."
</P>
<P>
The Learjet 35A, registered in the United States as N350JF, was
piloted by South African-based Alan Lewis, 47, and Swede Anders
Rors, 48.
</P>
<P>
The two freelance pilots were hired to fly the aircraft to
ExecuJet at Lanseria Airport near Johannesburg for refurbishment.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft took off from Luxor in Egypt at 11:25 GMT Sunday
on the second leg of its flight. Eritrean authorities confirmed
that the aircraft entered its airspace at 12:54 GMT.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean air traffic controllers reported losing radio contact
with the plane as it passed about 100 nautical miles southeast of
Eritrean capital Asmara near the Ethiopia-Eritrea border.
</P>
<P>
It was reported on Tuesday that the Ethiopian defense ministry
claimed to have shot down an Eritrean aircraft near Adwa, a north
Ethiopian town not far from Asmara, Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean authorities subsequently denied that any of its
aircraft had crossed into Ethiopian airspace on that day.
</P>
<P>
Birns said the pilots had submitted flight plans and obtained
the necessary clearance from all the countries whose airspace the
Learjet would cross on its flight to Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been at war since May 1998 over the
control of some disputed border areas.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Offers Relief Aid to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Wednesday
announced its donation of 10 million U.S. dollars in urgent oil
assistance to Turkey, which suffered devastation damage and loss
of human lives caused by earthquake in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
A news release from the Iraqi Mission to the United Nations
said, "The Iraqi Government donated for relief a quantity of Crude
Oil equivalent in value to an amount of 10 million U.S. dollars,
to be distributed by the Turkish Red Crescent Society to the
Turkish families victims of the earthquake in Turkey."
</P>
<P>
"Iraq have started from August 29 to pump through the
Iraqi-Turkish pipeline a quantity of 100,000 barrels of oil a day
for a period of 5 days for a total of about 500,000 barrels," the
news release said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced the donation despite the hardship caused by the
continuous of what Baghdad called "the unjust comprehensive
sanctions imposed by the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"On the last day, Iraq shall pump an additional quantity to
make up of any shortage to reach an equivalent amount of 10
million U.S. dollars," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is worth noting that Iraq has ranked first in providing
humanitarian emergency assistance to Turkey," the news release
said. "The second rank is left to the U.S."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council's sanction committee approved unofficially
Tuesday on Iraq's proposed donation in oil to Turkey's earthquake
victims, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is expected to sell the oil and donate the revenues to
the Turkish Red Crescent to aid those made homeless in the
devastating August 17 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The crude oil to be donated to Turkey will flow though the same
pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan that carries about 45
percent of the oil sold the U.N. "oil-for-food program."
</P>
<P>
The plan, an exception to the sanctions, allows Iraq to sell
5.26 billion U.S. dollars in oil every six months to buy needed
humanitarian supplies for its people.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Exchange Alliance Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) - Plans to link stock exchanges
across Europe are falling behind schedule, according to British
media reports Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Eight European stock exchanges - led by the London and
Frankfurt stock markets - are in talks to build a single
electronic trading platform for Europe's top stocks, with common
rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The London Stock Exchange insists on CrestCo, the UK system,
while Frankfurt wants Deutsche Borse Clearing, its in-house
settlement system, which is merging with Cedel, the pan-European
commercial clearing house.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said that the issue is far more serious than
outsiders realize. One source close to the talks said: "Clearing
is the key. Anyone can cobble together a deal on the front end.
But if you can have joint settlement and clearing, that is where
the big savings are."
</P>
<P>
"The trouble is both London and Frankfurt have invested a huge
amount of money in their respective systems," the source added.
</P>
<P>
The strains between London and Frankfurt come at a sensitive
time, when the two are set to harmonise their trading hours from
20 september, while others are set to follow.

<HEADLINE> Cost of Health Care Expected to Rise in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The increase in crime and
violence, new diseases and drugs will rocket the cost of health
care and medical aid in the next few years in South Africa,
according to a 1999 health care survey released in Johannesburg
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Health care costs were rising above salary inflation and
medical costs would become more expensive, Old Mutual Health care
managing director Riaan Jordaan said at a media briefing at the
Pharmaceutical Society of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
New diagnostic treatments and the increase in life expectancy
of the ageing population will also contribute to the expected hike
in medical costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
The survey identified cost control and HIV/AIDS as the key
challenges facing the health care system in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Adrian Baskir of Old Mutual health care said HIV/AIDS-related
medical aid benefits accounted for between six and 10 percent
(more than 250 million U.S. dollars) of the total 800 million
dollars spent in the industry on health care costs for 1998.
</P>
<P>
With HIV/AIDS figures soaring, the survey predicted a financial
disaster as the disease would "reduce medical aid scheme reserves
and make health care for all more unaffordable".
</P>
<P>
Jordaan said medical aid fraud was a major problem contributing
to the increase in costs.
</P>
<P>
"If doctors keep seeing family members not subscribed to the
schemes, other members will suffer increases to premiums."
</P>
<P>
Jordaan said managed health care based on the United States
model, which should have provided lower income South Africans with
private health care, proved unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
He said the survey highlighted that managed health care was not
 affordable for low income workers, resulting in accumulated
losses close to 166 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that most medical aid schemes implemented
control over hospital and chronic medicine costs, as well as
forming self-funding benefit plans. However, costs continued to
soar.
</P>
<P>
"Although the initial impact of this was to reduce cost
escalation, health care costs are now starting to outstrip
inflation," Jordaan said.
</P>
<P>
He said this was expected to grow by 40 percent within the next
10 years, costing the country 3.9 billion dollars under managed
care.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that most medical schemes had implemented
major managed care programs to control hospital and chronic
medicine costs.

<HEADLINE> UK's Conservative Leader Attacks Blair on N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain's main opposition
leader William Hague accused Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Wednesday of betraying the people of Northern Ireland by ruling
that the IRA (Irish Republican Army) ceasefire was still intact.
</P>
<P>
Hague, the Conservative leader, called in an article in the
Daily Telegraph newspaper for an immediate halt to the early
release of guerrilla prisoners under the terms of last year's Good
Friday peace agreement for the British province.
</P>
<P>
He said his Conservative Party wanted to see the Northern
Ireland peace process succeed but all violence had to end.
</P>
<P>
"The Conservative Party is clear about what must now happen.
Paramilitary violence, on both sides, has to end and
decommissioning of illegally held weapons begin," Hague said.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, the early release of terrorist prisoners must
immediately be suspended. On any view, it must be unacceptable
that, at a time when IRA terrorism of the most brutal kind
continues, terrorists are being given early release back into
their communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hague said Blair's failure on this issue challenged the
sincerity of his pledges and promises to the people of Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"It is an outrage and a betrayal of the trust of the people of
Northern Ireland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair has backed his Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, who
last week decided that a ceasefire by the Irish Republic Army
(IRA) was still intact despite alleged links to a murder and a
gun-smuggling plot.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Sector Expands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) - The UK manufacturing sector grew
in August for the third month in a row but began to show tentative
signs of inflation, the Purchasing Managers Index found.
</P>
<P>
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said the index
dipped to 52.9 in August from 53.1 in July, signallying expansion
but a slightly slower pace.
</P>
<P>
That growth could fuel fears - fed by Tuesday's reports of
rising house prices - that the UK is returning to boom conditions.
</P>
<P>
The report said the expansion of demand for house and goods led
to an increase in demand for inputs in August, the prices of which
rose for the first time since September 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Input price inflation was further stimulated by the increase in
import prices resulting from the modest depreciation of sterling,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that it could also heighten
expectations that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee
will move to increase interest rates.
</P>
<P>
An expert at the City said that the index is not in itself
enough to trigger a Bank of England rate hike, but, coming on top
of the nationwide house price index, the Bank will be getting
increasingly twitchy.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Prices Rise in Mocambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government
Wednesday announced increases in prices for all liquid fuels
except diesel, taking effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
Kerosene rises in price by 10.8 percent, from 2,120 to 2,350
meticais a liter (currently one U.S. dollar equals to 12,800
meticais), according to a press release issued here by the
Ministry of Mineral Reassures and Energy.
</P>
<P>
The price for jet fuel increases by nine percent from 2,555.87
meticais a liter to 2,784.92 meticais.
</P>
<P>
However, Motorists will have to pay only an extra 1.9 percent
for their petrol. A liter of petrol goes up from 6,190 to 6,310
meticais.
</P>
<P>
The price of diesel remains at 4,340 meticais a liter.
</P>
<P>
The largest increase is for cooking gas, which rises by 24.2
percent from 5,651.81 meticais to 7,017.91 meticais per kilo.
</P>
<P>
Since the last alteration in fuel prices on June 1, there had
been a general price increase for petroleum products in the world
market, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Mozambican currency meticai had devalued by
1.1 per cent, it added.
</P>
<P>
This triggered the price changes, which occur whenever the
weighted average price of imported fuels, expressed in meticais,
alters by more than three percent in either direction.
</P>
<P>
The prices indicated for the government are for the main ports
of Maputo, Matola, Beira and Nacala. Fuel distributors elsewhere
are allowed to increase the price to cover their transport costs.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Budget Deficit to Fall By Half: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's budget
deficit for 1999, which was officially projected at 44 billion
Saudi riyals (11.7 billion U.S. dollars), is likely to fall by
half due to the prospect of growth in state revenues, a Saudi bank
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The total expenditure in the present financial year starting
January 1 is expected at 180 billion riyals (48 billion dollars),
the Saudi-British Bank said in a report, quoted by the Kuwait News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
However, the deficit in the budget is expected to drop to 20
billion riyals (5.3 billion dollars), as the state income is
likely to reach 160 billion riyals (42.66 billion dollars) by
year-end, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The fresh forecast put the oil revenues at 110 billion riyals
(29.33 billion dollars) and non-oil income at 50 billion riyals
(13.33 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The kingdom's 1999 budget, which was unveiled last December,
projected the expenditure at 165 billion riyals (44 billion
dollars) and total revenues at 121 billion riyals (32.3 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's dominant oil power, has been running
high budget deficits in the past two years as the country was hit
hard by the sagging oil prices in global oil markets.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 budget carried a deficit of 17 billion riyals (4.5
billion dollars) while the budget deficit for the 1998 financial
year was 18 billion riyals (4.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Oil prices, however, rebounded dramatically since April 1,
when member states of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers began to cut their output.
</P>
<P>
World benchmark Brent crude futures for October delivery on
Tuesday hit a 22-month high of 21.3 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, world leading oil producers, including Saudi Arabia,
have urged OPEC and non-OPEC nations to keep in place their
current production cuts.

<HEADLINE> Founders of Congolese Rebel Group Satisfied with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The majority founders of the
Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) have expressed satisfaction
that Congo will now be reconstructed according to the will of the
Congolese after the peace accord was signed Tuesday in Lusaka by
46 founder members of the major rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Chief of rural development department based in Goma in eastern
part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Getrude
Kitembo, said here Wednesday that the first thing was to have
democratic elections where leaders would be elected.
</P>
<P>
Kitembo said the regime of President Laurent Kabila was imposed
on the people, but with the spirit shown at the signing of the
cease-fire pact, there would be leadership elected by the people.
</P>
<P>
She said voting was a sign of democratization and not something
imposed by others but people should choose what they want.
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes according to plan, we should have a new
leadership in the DRC in two months time," she said.
</P>
<P>
And permanent secretary of founders Mamba college of the RCD,
Nkolo Balamage said that the signing of the cease-fire pact would
have a positive bearing to opposition parties that were operating
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Balamage said the RCD had been talking to Etiene Tsisekedi, who
had a large following in the country on what role he could play in
the new government.
</P>
<P>
He said that everybody in the Congo was looking not only for
peace but democracy to prevail in the country after years of
chaos.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his party was compelled to use force because
Kabila did not want to change and this was the same view shared by
Tsisekedi.
</P>
<P>
"Tsisekedi has a role to play in the new government. .We want a
national government in which all forces of the Congo are found,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He further emphasized that in future there is need for Great
Lakes regions to offer protection to each other for the sake of
security in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of a grant
of 898,950 U.S. dollars to support a Brazilian program that
promotes decentralized energy services based on renewable sources
in isolated communities.
</P>
<P>
The resources from the Japan Special Fund, which is
administered by the Washington-based IDB, will help the Brazilian
government improve the management and the effectiveness of its
program, known as PRODEEM, for developing renewable energy
services in rural municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The project will create a framework designed to attract
investment to renewable energy systems and renewable energy-based
services that can improve the quality of life and raise
productivity in isolated populations that lack access to modern
and clean sources of energy.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, PRODEEM would step up the transfer of
project execution to decentralized market agents and the private
sector. It would also provide training to the agents and assist
small and medium size enterprises in using renewable energy to
boost their productive capacity.
</P>
<P>
The project also seeks to reduce deforestation due to the use
of wood and charcoal as energy sources as well as to decrease
missions from poorly maintained diesel generators.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Seeking Delay in IMF Loan to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
denied that it seeks a halt in the loan from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to Russia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the U.S. newspaper USA Today published
Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the United
States will seek a pause in the aid from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to Russia until there is an adequate
safeguards for the money.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. will not support disbursement of the next tranche
without adequate safeguards to assure that any funds disbursed are
used properly (and) without adequate accounting," Summers told the
newspaper Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department said what
Summers said did not mean that the U.S. seeks a delay to
disbursements from the IMF's latest lending program to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"As it normally does, the IMF is doing its review with respect
to the second tranche and it would be premature to make any
judgement as to whether Russia will meet the conditions for that
disbursement," the spokeswoman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has insisted that there be adequate
safeguards in place with respect to the current program and that
there be an adequate accounting for the use of past funds," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The 182-member IMF is scheduled to release another 640 million
U.S. dollars of a 4.5 billion U.S. dollars loan package to Russia.
USA Today said the IMF has lent Russia 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that some of the 10 billion U.S. dollars allegedly
funneled through the Bank of New York by Russian gangsters in a
money-laundering scheme may have involved IMF loans to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The British Pricewaterhouse auditing firm has been conducting a
study on the IMF loans. The U.S. government is also investigating
the allegations. But an IMF official said Monday that there was no
evidence that the IMF loans were misused.
</P>
<P>
"As these investigations continue and as these revelations come
to light, we'll have to make judgements about what constitutes a
satisfactory accounting," Summers was quoted by USA Today as
saying.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Deplores Attacks on Civilians in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) deplored Saturday's "brutal raids in
Burundi" which resulted in the death of dozens of people,
including children, the U.N. agency said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The raid follows months of similar violence in which the
victims have included innocent children," a UNICEF statement said.
"It is intolerable that children be the victims of senseless and
wanton bloodshed by any side in the conflict."
</P>
<P>
"Saturday's raid occurred four days after the United Nations
Security Council adopted a resolution on children in armed
conflict which condemned the targeting of children, including
killing, maiming, sexual violence and recruitment of young people
as soldiers," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The tragedy in Burundi is a clear call to the international
community that it must now act forcefully to protect the rights of
children, not only in Burundi but in all other theaters of armed
conflict," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations aimed at ending the nearly six-year-old impasse
in Burundi were scheduled to resume in Dar Es Salaam, capital of
Tanzania, in early September.
</P>
<P>
"With further violence threatened, UNICEF urges all parties
to come to the negotiating table and to give special attention
to the protection of children in such conflicts," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Hutu rebels attacked the capital in brutal overnight
raids, murdering 38 civilians and taking on the army in fierce
fighting that killed another 20 people, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Burundi has been locked in a series of ethnic conflicts between
the Hutu majority and Tutsi minority over the past three decades.
About 150,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed
since civil war again erupted in 1993.

UNITED NATIONS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will
send a three-person team out Thursday from the U.N. Headquarters
in New York to Congo (K) to pave the way for the deployment of the
first phase of U.N. military personnel to Congo (K) and other
concerned countries in the region, a U.N. spokesman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The team, composed of staff of the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations, is leaving Thursday evening, Fred Eckhard, the U.N.
spokesman, said, adding that it will travel to Nairobi, where it
is expected to assemble within a week the initial group of United
Nations military liaison officers.
</P>
<P>
Four members of the team will support the Joint Military
Committee to be established in Lusaka, Zambia, while six members
will set up an advance United Nations headquarters in Kinshasa,
Congo (K), he said.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 16 members will be dispatched to regional
capitals of the signatories of the ceasefire accord, initially
Bunumbura, Kigali, Kinshasa, Kampala, Windhock and Harare.
</P>
<P>
The dispatch was made in the wake of the rebels signing of the
Lusaka ceasefire accord for Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The dispatch of these officers is the first phase of a
three-stage plan outlined by the secretary-general in his July 15
report to the Security Council on the Democratic Republic of

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Economic Indicators Rise In July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Composite Index of
Leading Economic Indicators in the United States rose 0.3
percent in July, the same pace as in the prior two months, the
Conference Board, the U.S. prominent research group, said in a
report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With the increase of 0.3 percent in July, the leading
index stands at 108.0, the report said. This Index has
registered increases in nine of the last ten months.
</P>
<P>
"Seven of the 10 leading indicators posted increases,
underscoring the continuing strength of the current economic
expansion," said ken Goldstein, Conference Board Economist. "The
two key drivers of this latest increase were manufacturing and
the labor market."
</P>
<P>
Goldstein said "There are concerns that the two interest-rate
hikes this Summer could slow growth later this year. Indeed, the
financial indicators were the weakest component of the index."
</P>
<P>
"But overall, strength in manufacturing conditions and a
robust labor market more than offset the negative contribution
of higher interest rates," he said.
</P>
<P>
The leading indicators are calculated from a base of 100,
set in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Community Criticized on African Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa said Wednesday that the international community is
not paying sufficient attention to the problem of refugees in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said it is hard to understand why a refugee in Europe,
like those from Kosovo, is getting assistance that is almost 10
times what a refugee in Africa is gaining.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian President made the remarks in Sweden while
delivering a speech at a lecture on "Peace-Making and Conflicts
Resolution in Africa" at the Aula Magna University of Uppsala,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
With such little support, he said, Africa feels difficult to
solve the problem that is not only a product of conflicts but also
one of the factors causing a vicious cycle of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that no continent like Africa is currently
embroiled in so many armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Africa is hosting 7.1 million or 34 percent of 21.1 million
refugees in the world and that Tanzania alone is currently hosting
at least 890,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
"This is an enormous burden on a poor country like Tanzania in
economic, social, political and environmental terms," he said,
adding that his country has never refused the entry of any
refugee.
</P>
<P>
"We take them in a humanitarian gesture and as an international
 obligation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The former colonial powers and those who turned Africa into
the battlefield of east and west during the Cold War, must be held
responsible for a number of African conflicts and should
contribute actively to finding a solution to the conflicts, Mkapa
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said colonialism and the Cold War turned upside down the
Africans' way of life that had an in-built mechanism for
preventing and resolving conflicts and building social cohesion
within participatory democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Until this day Africa is yet to recapture its pre-colonial
traditions and ways of life," he said, adding that state
repression, a colonial legacy, and politics of exclusion and
bigotry continue to trigger armed insurgencies.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned other contributing factors to the African
conflicts as poverty and under development.
</P>
<P>
"Unquestionably the solution to African conflicts is also the
responsibility of the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mkapa said regional economic integration as a good way
of reducing potential or risk of conflicts and expansionism.
</P>
<P>
The president said there is also a growing consensus that
African countries should concentrate on preventing conflicts,
something that could be achieved through several ways including
giving more attention to nation building and civic education to
inculcate the sense of nationhood.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- European main stock markets
ended in black as a rebound by U.S. shares and a stronger euro
tempered anxiety about rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 finished 29.8 points or 0.48 percent higher
at 6,276.2, partially recovering from a 2 percent sell-off in the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
Oil producer BP Amoco advanced 1.65 percent to 1,166 pence,
while rival Shell Transport added 2.17 percent to 506 pence,
supported by a recent rise in crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
British Aerospace rose 2.15 percent after applying for an 800
million U.S. dollars loan to support its share of the development
cost of Airbus Industrie's Planned 600 seat super jumbo aircraft.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said the market's nerves remained shaky and
the FTSE was likely to drift ahead of key U.S. labor data Friday
as worries over the outlook for U.S. interest rates continued to
haunt investors.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the electronic Xetra Dax closed up 0.88 percent,
or 46.35 points, at 5,317.12, boosted by a confident start on Wall

The spotlight was centered on the utility and financial
sectors. Viag soared 7.96 percent after it was confirmed Tuesday
that the group was in merger talks with rival Veba, which climbed
4.2 percent.

<P>
Paris' CAC 40 closed up 0.96 percent at 4,633.38, near its

</P>
<P>
In front of around 25,000 viewers in the National Stadium,

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges Peace in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Wednesday condemned the violence in East Timor after a
ballot on its future on Monday, while holding Indonesia
responsible for the peace and security during vote-counting.
</P>
<P>
It underlined the need for non-violence in the post-ballot
period and demanded the arrest of rioters and immediate steps by
Indonesia to prevent new incidents from occurring.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by September council president, the
Netherlands' Arnold Peter van Walsum following a closed-door
council meeting.
</P>
<P>
A similar statement was made by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
At least two people were reportedly killed in Dili, capital of
East Timor on Wednesday, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place nearby the compound of the United
Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) with local militia members
involved.
</P>
<P>
However, vote-counting continued undisturbed during the
incident, said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures show that 98.6 percent of some 450,000
eligible voters cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
All boxes arrived in Dili on Tuesday and the process of
so-called ballot reconciliation began Wednesday morning, Eckhard
said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day reconciliation would see if the number of ballots
cast is matched with the number of people who voted.
</P>
<P>
On Friday and Saturday actual counting of ballots will be done,
Eckhard added.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question on the possibility of establishing a
peacekeeping force for East Timor, the spokesman ruled out such an
arrangement, saying that Indonesia is fully responsible for the
security in the territory according to the May 5 agreement.
</P>
<P>
The accord signed by Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and
Portugal and the U.N. Secretary-General paved the way for the
ballot to determine the status of East Timor -- part of Indonesia
with special autonomy or independence.
</P>
<P>
In the past 23 years, clashes between pro and anti-independence
parties have featured the political scene in East Timor, a
Portuguese colony until 1975 when Indonesia occupied it.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Seeking Delay in IMF Loan to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday denied that it seeks a halt in the loan from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to Russia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the U.S. newspaper USA today published
Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the United
States will seek a pause in the aid from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to Russia until there is an adequate
safeguards for the money.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. will not support disbursement of the next tranche
without adequate safeguards to assure that any funds disbursed are
used properly (and) without adequate accounting," Summers told the
newspaper on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department said what
Summers said did not mean that the U.S. seeks a delay to
disbursements from the IMF's latest lending program to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"As it normally does, the IMF is doing its review with respect
to the second tranche and it would be premature to make any
judgement as to whether Russia will meet the conditions for that
disbursement," the spokeswoman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has insisted that there be adequate
safeguards in place with respect to the current program and that
there be an adequate accounting for the use of past funds," she
said.
</P>
<P>
In an telephone interview with Xinhua, a Treasury spokesman
said everything Summers said had been correctly quoted in USA
Today except the title of the story -- "U.S. Seeks Pause in
Russian Loans."
</P>
<P>
The 182-member IMF is scheduled to release another 640 million
U.S. dollars of a 4.5 billion U.S. dollars loan package to Russia.
USA Today said the IMF has lent Russia 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that some of the 10 billion U.S. dollars allegedly
funneled through the Bank of New York by Russian gangsters in a
money-laundering scheme may have involved IMF loans to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The money laundering and corruption charges are "serious," said
State Department spokesman Phil Reeker at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The investigation is ongoing, and facts in that case are still
being established," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we will not provide assistance to Russia unless we
can be sure it will support market and other reforms in that
country and will not be misused or diverted. The IMF, the World
Bank and other international financial institutions take a similar
approach," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Reeker noted that many reports in the U.S. media are just
speculation, which are "outdated or perhaps factually incorrect."
</P>
<P>
The British Pricewaterhouse auditing firm has been conducting a
study on the IMF loans. The U.S. administration is also
investigating the allegations. But an IMF official said on Monday
that there was no evidence that the IMF loans were misused.
</P>
<P>
"As these investigations continue and as these revelations come
to light, we'll have to make judgements about what constitutes a
satisfactory accounting," Summers was quoted by USA today as
saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 4,000 people are
suffering from a meningitis epidemic that broke out in early June
in the northeastern county of Iasi, Romania.
</P>
<P>
4,127 people, most under the age of 19, were reported to be
infected, according to a Health Ministry warning reported on local
media Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Most infections of the acute meningitis, which have been
clinically confirmed, have been found to be situated in the
northern and northeastern part of the country, such as Iasi, Neamt,
Botosani, Suceava and Bacau. No meningitis linked deaths have yet
been reported.
</P>
<P>
A similar epidemic in 1973 was contained only after a large
part of the population received immunization, said local
epidemiologists. They also said that epidemics similar to the one
occurring in Romania now were, in the past nine years, reported in
South Korea, Canada, Switzerland, Cuba, Poland, Spain, Australia,
Norway and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry warned that measures to prevent the
epidemic from spreading were still in force and recommended that
people wash fruit and vegetables thoroughly, wash their hands
before eating, and avoid contact with flies and mosquitoes.

East Timor since the ballot," said Foreign Secretary Robin Cook in
a statement issued by the foreign office.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no possible excuse, and no purpose, to the random
violence that we have seen in the last few days. It must stop," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Violence has spread in East Timor this week after people in
that former Portuguese colony voted in a United Nation's-run
ballot. The ballot is expected to show huge support for
independence from Indonesia's 23-year-long rule.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to the result of that ballot when it is
announced," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, pro-Jakarta militia went on the rampage near the
United Nations headquarters in Dili, the capital city of East
Timor, killing at least five people, one of them hacked to death
with machetes in front of television cameras.
</P>
<P>
"The prime responsibility for halting that violence rests with
the government of Indonesia. It is very important that their
security forces should now bring order to the streets of East
Timor and halt those who are carrying out the intimidation," Cook
said.
</P>
<P>
"I will be communicating to my colleague, the foreign minister
of Indonesia, our concern at the reports of that violence and of
the intimidation of the people of East Timor," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> China's First Debt-to-Equity Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Cinda Assets Management Corp.
signed an agreement with the Beijing Building Materials Group
today on the debt-to-equity transfer of the Beijing Cement Plant,
the first deal of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Cement Plant, a subsidiary of Beijing Building
Materials Group, will reduce its asset liability ratio from 80.1
percent to 32.4 percent after the deal, which is hoped to bring an
annual profit of more than 20 million yuan (2.4 million U.S.
dollars) beginning in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The plant will also be transformed into a limited liability
company with both Cinder and the Beijing Building Materials Group
as its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
With a daily output of 2,000 tons of cement, the Beijing Cement
Plant is one of the major state-owned enterprises in China. By the
end of 1998, the plant's total debt had amounted to 968 million
yuan, which plunged it into chaos.
</P>
<P>
China has resorted to debt-to-equity conversions in tackling
floundering large and medium-sized state enterprises in a move to
pull them out of difficulty in three years.
</P>
<P>
The Cinda Assets Management Corp., established in March, mainly
focuses on writing off bad loans from commercial banks to push
forward the reform of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China is setting up a number of asset-management companies to
take over the non-performing loans of its commercial banks.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Flight Ban Has Negative Impacts on Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The decision on banning all
flights to and from Somalia by the Kenyan government has already
shown its impacts in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Nine local airlines offices were closed Thursday, of which
three had been taking passengers to and from Kenya while six
others had been working on the khat business.
</P>
<P>
The agencies in charge of the passenger planes are the first to
close down their business, while those of the khat are still
struggling to survive.
</P>
<P>
The passengers planning to leave for Kenya have been
disappointed, but some of them have already resorted to using the
route via terra to Nairobi sneaking through the already closed
borderlines between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The ban will also bring bankruptcy to the local travel agencies
open in almost all of the main towns in Somalia including Kismayu,
Mogadishu, Beletuein, Galkaio, Bossaso and others.
</P>
<P>
However, the main khat business dealers said they are not
getting stuck by the Kenyan ban, but will simply turn to Ethiopia
for importing the widely chewed narcotic leaves of khat.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan khat is known as Mirow, while the stuff from
Ethiopia is called Hareri. The Hareri is consumed in northern
Somalia while the Mirow is used in the south.
</P>
<P>
On the positive side of the flight ban, the absence of the khat
from Mogadishu's markets has also affected the souring rate
between the Somali shilling and the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Somali shilling has dramatically been devaluating ever
since the illegal huge consignments of the Somali bank notes were
imported by the local businessmen earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The dollar lost its value considerably Thursday with one dollar
 equalling only 9,900 shillings. Before the ban, only a week ago,
one dollar was equal to 10,150 shillings.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen in the main business center of Bakara market
attributed the sharp fall of the dollar value to its shrinking
demands in the exchange wards of the market following the ban
imposed on all flights to and from Somalia by Kenyan President
Daniel Arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
The khat dealers are believed to have been using more than
300,000 dollars everyday for the importation of the khat from
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Some of the businessmen also said the recent United Nations
report on Somalia and its proposed meeting on Somalia by the U.N.
Security Council has lowered the value of the dollar.

JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Only one South African
will be among the first group of U.N. military liaison officers to
be deployed in the Congo to supervise the implementation of the
cease-fire accord, Defense Minister Patrick Lekota said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had said it was prepared to contribute eight
officers to the 30-member group, but the U.N. had asked for only
one, South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Lekota as
saying in Cape Town.

<P>
The year-long fighting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
was officially over when all founding members of the major rebel

agreement in Lusaka on Tuesday, which had been signed in July by
six countries involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. group would probably assemble in Kenya for
pre-deployment training before going to the Congo, but the date of
their deployment was not yet known, according to SAPA.

South Africa is willing to comply with any U.N. requests for
assistance in the Congo mission, and further training of personnel

<HEADLINE> New WTO Chief Outlines Priorities for Third Ministerial Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The New Director-General of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) Mike Moore has underscored his
priorities for the upcoming ministerial conference in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
During his first press conference since assuming his post on
September 1, Moore, the first non-European to head the WTO,
stressed the importance of achieving a balanced outcome in the
Seattle conference which will address the needs of all WTO members.
</P>
<P>
"Seattle is the priority, but the Seattle Ministerial will only
be judged a success if there is a balanced outcome," Moore said on
Thursday. "We need to assist all member governments to engage in
the process. Thus we need to increase the levels and focus of
technical assistance from the WTO and other sources to make this
happen."
</P>
<P>
The priorities spelled out by the WTO's new chief include:
facilitating and assisting countries to achieve a balanced outcome
from the negotiations, which will benefit the more vulnerable
economies; advocating the advantages -- for the great nations and
the more modest nations -- of a more open trading system and how
that can increase living standards and build a more prosperous,
safer world; strengthening the WTO and its system and rules, to
build on and maintain its reputation for integrity and fairness,
and to re-shape the organization to reflect the new reality of its
membership and their needs.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said the
number of new claims for unemployment benefits edged up last week.
</P>
<P>
There were 289,000 people who filed new claims for jobless
benefits for the week ending August 28, up by 4,000 from the
previous week, the Department reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The four-week average for claims was up to 286,500 last week.
It was the highest level since Aug. 7, when claims were at 288,250.
</P>
<P>
Last week's rise in new claims was in line with many economists
' expectations. Economists consider jobless claims levels below
300,000 an indication of an extremely tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that for the week ending August 21, 14
states and territories reported increases in new jobless claims
while 39 reported decreases. The state data lags a week behind the
national figures.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the state with the biggest increase in
applications for jobless benefits was Georgia, up 1,538, while the
state with the biggest decrease in jobless benefits claims was
Michigan, down 1,642.

FUKUOKA, Japan, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Taipei
upset host Japan 77-68 by a 1-2 punch of Lo Shin-liang and Cheng
Chih-lung in the final minute of a quarterfinal round match at the
Asian Men's Basketball Championship here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Guard Lo scored a team-high 25 points and Cheng added 24 to
storm Chinese Taipei, who lost to Japan twice in the past two
versions of the Asian championship, into the semi-final against
tournament favorite China, who trounced Lebanon 107-67 earlier
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Reigning champions South Korea wrapped up their quarter-finals
with the third win after defeating Syria 70-62, setting up a meet
with Saudi Arabia, who ousted Kuwait 93-80 in a physical match.
</P>
<P>
The semi-finalists will take one day off the schedule with
teams in the classification playoffs competing for placing from
the 5th to the 12th on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Even the 2.06-meter Weiss Dan tried to threw 3-pointers when
Chinese Taipei, who lost to South Korea on Monday and finished
second in group F after the win, led by as much as seven points
from a 9-0 run with 1:18 to go on the clock.
</P>
<P>
Japan's top scorer Orimo Takehiko, who scored 16 points, had
two 3-pointers down the stretch to close the game, but his
outrange efforts were cut off by deadly foul free-throws of the
Chinese Taipei, which was 15-27 on the line.
</P>
<P>
"We made mistakes down the stretch, and we paid the price,"
said Dan, who made 3-pointers attempts when his teammates could
not get into the solid defense of the Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Lo made a game-winning three-pointer to extend Chinese Taipei's
lead to 69-62 from Chou Chun-San's assist with 2:14 left remaining.
</P>
<P>
"I had nothing in my mind but to make the basket at that time,
" Lo talked about his best shot of the game.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese had more pressure than us to make into the semi
because they are the hosts," said Chen, who was ABC Most All-Round
Player in Asia last year.
</P>
<P>
China won its fifth-consecutive game in the tournament, which
started on August 28, with no player was given more than 20
minutes on the court by head coach Jiang Xingquan.
</P>
<P>
"I want to have more players ready for the semi-final and final
game," Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champion Zhan Xugang Sets New World Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN,CHINA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Spurred on by the strong
rival from Iran while cheered on by the enthusiastic local fans,
Atlanta Olympic champion Zhan Xugang from China broke the clean
and jerk world record in the men's 77kg category at the Asian
Weightlifting Championships here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Zhan jerked 206.0 kilograms at his third
attempt,surpassing the previous mark 205.5kg set by Aranda
Idalberto of Cuba at the Pan America Games in Winnipeg, Canada on
August 5.
</P>
<P>
"I had never expect to break the world record at this
championships. I am very blessed," said Zhan, who swept three
world records for the total champion in the 70kg division at the
Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Hosscin from Iran changed the weight twice for his
final attempt before he failed to jerk 202.5kg which spurred
emulative Zhan to challenge the world record.
</P>
<P>
Zhan won the total champion for 365.0kg while his compatriot Li
Hongli claimed the victory in the snatch with 160.0kg, edging Zhan
to the second place on the same bar for his lighter body weight.
</P>
<P>
Li won the silver medal for a total of 350.0kg and Hosscin took
the bronze medals in the snatch and total with 155.0 and 345.0kg,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"We were 60 percent certain that Zhan would break the jerk
world record before tonight's competition, and he did it," said
the excited national head coach Yang Hanxiong.
</P>
<P>
Chinese strongwoman Xu Xuefen swept three gold medals in the
women's 63kg class for a winning total 215kg, followed by Yoon I-
Sook of South Korea 202.5kg and Nansita Devi of India 185.0kg.

<HEADLINE> Senior Israeli Sources Say Pact to be Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat
will apparently sign a revised Wye agreement in Alexandria, Egypt
on Friday morning, senior Israeli sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources were quoted by Israel Radio as saying that
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's King Abdullah and
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will take part
in the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The positive comments came after the talks between Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators hit a snag as both sides refused to
compromise on the prisoner issue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As part of a revised Wye accord, Israel offered to release 356
Palestinians held for anti-Israeli activities, while the
Palestinians sought the release of 400.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said principles were at stake and that it would not
release Palestinians who killed Israelis.
</P>
<P>
But senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat accused Israel
of "escalating the situation at the final moment for no reason."
</P>
<P>
"We reject this way of dealing with us," Erekat added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have intensified efforts in
the last few days to bridge their gaps over the implementation of
the Wye accord, signed and then frozen by Barak's hard-line
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu late last year.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have virtually been on the verge of an
agreement. In the previous talks, they have made significant
progress on most issues concerning the implementation of the Wye
accord, including a timetable of further Israeli troop withdrawals
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Wye agreement calls on Israel to hand over 13 percent of
the West Bank to the Palestinians in three stages over a period of
12 weeks and release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Netanyahu
froze the deal after carrying out its first stage.
</P>
<P>
Ousting Netanyahu in the national elections three months ago
on a platform to revive the Middle East peace process on all
tracks, Barak has promised to carry out the Wye agreement but
proposed some changes in its implementation.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted his proposal to divide the two
remaining phases of Israeli troop withdrawals into three stages
and put off the final stage until early next year to avoid
potential confrontation between Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
They have also agreed upon several sideline issues such as the
construction of a seaport in Gaza and the opening of safe passages
between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said that if the two sides could not agree on all
issues, it would carry out the Wye agreement as written, meaning
all understandings recently reached including those on the
seaport and safe passages would not be implemented.

<HEADLINE> Roman Catholic Priest Killed in Eastern India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- In yet another attack on
Christian missionary, a Roman Catholic priest was killed and
another injured by unknown assailants early Thursday in eastern
Indian, reports reaching here said,
</P>
<P>
The priest, Aruldoss, was attacked by a gang armed with bows
and arrows in the early morning hours in a village named Jamabani
belonging to Mayurbhanj district of Orissa, according to the Press
Trust of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
Neither the identity of the attackers nor the motive behind the
killing was immediately known.
</P>
<P>
This is the second such attack on missionaries after the
gruesome murder of Graham Staines and his two sons from Australia
on January 22 this year in the same district of the state.
</P>
<P>
Indian caretaker Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee Thursday
strongly condemned the killing of Aruldoss and asked the state
government to "show its efficiency" by arresting the culprits.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly condemn the dastardly killing of the Christian
priest and especially urge the government of Orissa to show its
efficiency and capability in quickly arresting the culprits in
this and previous such crimes," Vajpayee said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
While expressing condolences to the family of the deceased,
Vajpayee said, "It is extremely distressing that such murderous
attacks on representatives of a minority community should be
taking place unchecked and with alarming regularity in Orissa."
</P>
<P>
The incident came close on the heels of the killing of a Muslim
trader Sheikh Rehman in the area on August 26.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the incident occurred barely a few hours after the
ruling Congress and several other political parties of the state
held a state-wide rally to protest against the continuing attacks
on the minorities.
</P>
<P>
Like the previous incidents, the latest killing occurred on the
day of a Hindu festival, Janmasthami. The Australian missionary
was killed on the day of Saraswati Puja while Rehman was hacked to
death on Raksha Bandhan.
</P>
<P>
No arrest had been made so far in connection with the
incidents.

<HEADLINE> Russia Pledges Partnership With Moldova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin said
Thursday that Russia will continue to maintain a friendship and
strategic partnership with Moldova.
</P>
<P>
"We want to live in peace, friendship, and develop a more
strategic partnership with a united Moldova," Yeltsin told
visiting Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin praised the productive and constructive
atmosphere of the talks. "For those issues that have accumulated
between us, not a single one remains unresolved or unsatisfied,"
the Interfax news agency quoted Yeltsin as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents signed a treaty encouraging economic
cooperation through 2008.
</P>
<P>
According to Yeltsin's Deputy Chief of Staff Sergei Prikhodko,
the two leaders addressed bilateral issues and the Transdnestr
settlement.
</P>
<P>
"These talks demonstrate that both Moscow and Chisinau
appreciate the trend toward stabilization in Transdnestr. There is
no more bloodshed in that region and negotiations have been
directed to the appropriate political channels. The prospects for
a Transdnestr settlement are encouraging," Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting erupted in March 1992 in the Transdnestr region
between Moldovan security forces and Slavic separatists who feared
Moldova would merge with neighboring Romania.
</P>
<P>
In a plebiscite on March 6, 1994, voters in Moldova supported
independence, rather than unification with Romania. Defying the
Moldovan government, voters in the breakaway Dnestr region held
legislative elections and approved a separatist constitution on
December 24, 1995.

MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The population of Russia
decreased by 0.28 percent, or 406,200 persons in the first half of

From January to June in 1998, the population of Russia

reported.
</P>
<P>
The declining population was attributed to a rising death rate
as well as a decrease in migration from outside Russia.

<HEADLINE> Teen-Ager Adimts to Killing Acquaintance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- As part of a plea bargain, a
teen-ager pleaded guilty in Tel Aviv District Court on Thursday to
the 1997 murder of an acquaintance in the United States.
</P>
<P>
In return, Samuel Sheinbein, 19, would be sentenced to 24 years
in an Israeli prison.
</P>
<P>
The judge convicted Sheinbein, from Maryland, the U.S., of
premeditated murder minutes after he admitted to the murder. But
the judge did not rule immediately whether he would approve the
bargain deal.
</P>
<P>
Sheinbein fled to Israel shortly after his acquaintance Alfred
Tello's body was found burned and dismembered in an garage near
his home in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Althogh Sheinbein grew up in the U.S., he claimed Israeli
citizenship because his father was born here in 1944, and said he
could not be extradited under an Israeli law prohibiting
extradition of Israeli citizens to face trial abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Supreme Court has uphold Sheinbein's claim.
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli law, which is more lenient than that of the
U.S., Sheinbein could be paroled after 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors from Maryland said the penalty was too much light.
</P>
<P>
But Israel's attorney general, who had worked out the plea
bargain, defended it on grounds that a 24-year sentence is the
heaviest which can be imposed in Israel on a minor. At the time
of murder, Sheinbein was 17 years old.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Sign Agriculture Protocol With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government's
food security program will shift to high gear with the signing
later this month of a protocol with China to strengthen
cooperation between the two countries in agriculture and
fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Edgardo Angara of the Department of Agriculture is
set to leave for China to officially sign the document aimed at
strengthening agricultural productivity while improving the
standards of living of people in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Angara said Thursday that his scheduled visit to China next
week highlights the importance of agriculture in the national
development of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on agricultural cooperation was first reached
during Chinese Agriculture Minister Chen Yaobang's visit to
Manila in July when the two countries signed a declaration of
intent to enter into a protocol on cooperation in agriculture and
fisheries.
</P>
<P>
During Chen's Manila visit, he and Angara conducted extensive
and in-depth discussions on agricultural issues, especially
technological assistance to be provided by China in forms of farm
machinery and the use of high-yielding rice seeds.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines will learn so much from China, which has
succeeded in providing sufficient food for its 1.2 billion people
despite the constraints that it has to contend with," Angara said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he is also proposing a joint venture with China
on the development of lower-cost high-yielding seeds, which China
has successfully developed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Philippine President Joseph Estrada has sent a
government team to China to study agricultural technology and
explore ways to improve the country's agriculture sector.

<HEADLINE> Moore Supports China's Bid to Enter WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China, as an economic power, is
entitled to membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), said
the organization's new chief here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody, every member in the WTO, wants China to sit at the
table (at the third ministerial conference in Seattle later this
year) as it should," Director-General Mike Moore told Xinhua at
his first press conference after taking office at the Geneva-based
WTO.
</P>
<P>
"China ought to be a member of the WTO," said the former New
Zealand prime minister. "And it will be a splendid thing when that
's achieved."
</P>
<P>
"It is a very good thing that presidents of China and the
United States will be meeting in Auckland," he added. He believes
the meeting will promote negotiations on China's entry into the
world trade body.
</P>
<P>
On China's accession to the WTO, Moore said, "from my point of
view, I think it would be a great thing and a splendid thing that
would make all of us proud."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he noted, the WTO is managed by its members,
and it is the members who decide on the acceptance of new members.
</P>
<P>
But Moore pledged that he and his organization would do
everything possible to help create conditions for China's early
entry into the WTO; he encouraged WTO members to make new efforts
toward that end.

<P>
LUSAKA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has rejected a U.N.
proposal to host the 1994 Rwanda genocide convicts, Times of
Zambia reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa as
confirming in parliament Wednesday that "after weighing all pros
and cons, Zambia has decided that it will not host Rwandan
genocide prisoners and having made that decision we have already
informed the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in
Arusha about the move."
</P>
<P>
He did not disclose the reason for the refusal.
</P>
<P>
Last month the ICTR offered financial assistance to Zambia to
rehabilitate some prisons it had inspected to keep the convicts.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR earlier in the year requested the Zambian government
to host the 1994 genocide suspects after convictions.
</P>
<P>
The release of the funds was subject to the government's
willingness to host the convicts.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR was set up by the U.N. to try those implicated in the
1994 genocide in which Hutu extremists killed over 500,000 Tutsis
and moderate Hutus.

expect foreign investments in Tunisia this year to exceed a record
high of 600 million dinars (550 million dollars), surpassing
Tunisia's budget estimates.

Syria and European states.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Mohamed Al Amadi
Wednesday inaugurated the meeting organized by the Syrian-EU
business center and the EU Commission envoy.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported Thursday that 35 foreign companies,
including those from European states, and 135 local firms are
participating in the meetings which will take place in Damascus,
Aleppo and Homs.
</P>
<P>
Textile is one of Syria's strategic industries and the second
largest source of revenues after petroleum. Weaving and textile
and ready-to-wear clothes industries take in 30 percent of the
total investments, bringing in some 53.9 billion liras (1.1
billion U.S. dollars). The textile industry also provides jobs for
36 percent of the industrial labor force.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Governor of Alexandria General Abdul Salam Mahgoub has
said that investments in petroleum projects now underway in
Alexandria have reached 20 billion pounds (about 5.8 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition, the governor said investments in industrial and
free zones in Alexandria amounted to about 4 billion pounds (1.15
billion dollars), some 40 percent of overall industrial
investments, the Arabic daily Alam Al Yom reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili
has said that Egypt's non-petroleum imports reached 130.3 million
pounds (37.8 million dollars) in the first six months of this
year, an increase of 6 percent over the corresponding period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Total imports, including petroleum products, amounted to 1.1
billion pounds (318 million dollars), an increase of 4.6 percent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Alam Al Yom reported Thursday that non-petroleum exports
during the first six months of this year has increased by about
356.9 million pounds (103.4 million dollars), a rise of 12.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports of petroleum and petroleum by-products have
declined by some 39.3 million pounds (11.4 million dollars), a
drop of 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the total exports have increased by about 403.6 million
pounds (116.9 million dollars), or 9.3 percent.

consider next year the rescheduling of 280 million dollars,
another 240 million dollars in 2001 and further 270 million
dollars in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The source pointed out that rescheduling Jordan's debts would
help lower the debts in the coming three years, alleviating the
burdens on State Budget and maintaining the country's reserves of
hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Jordan's overall external debts amount to
7 billion dollars, of which 4 billion are owed to the big seven
industrial countries, 3 billion to international finance
establishments and Arab funds. Japan is its biggest creditor.
</P>
<P>
KHARTOUM -- The Sudanese Council of Ministers has approved an

<HEADLINE> U.N. Probe Team Begins Work in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) - A United Nations team led by
former Swedish Premier Ingvar Carlson has arrived in Rwanda to
investigate the actions taken by the U.N. before and after the
1994 genocide, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Inquiry commission was set up in May of this
year by the U.N. Security Council, on proposition by the Secretary
General Kofi Annan, and was given about six months to present its
report.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Carlson, the team is also comprised of former South
Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-Joo, and Lieutenant General Rufus
M Kupolati from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Carlson said the Inquiry commission aims "to give all the facts
we can on how this terrible genocide happened, how the
international community could let it happen and did not react
stronger and more rapidly'', and
</P>
<P>
"To draw conclusions for the future so hopefully never anything
like that could happen again."
</P>
<P>
Carlson told this to reporters upon arrival at Kanombe airport
of Rwanda's capital Kigali Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Carlson said that it was not within the mandate of the
team to propose sanctions against individuals or member states who
would be found guilty.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Team started with looking into all materials available
on genocide, and very recently, it held a two-day seminar in
Geneva with international experts.
</P>
<P>
In the third and last phase, it will be visiting Rwanda,
Tanzania, Uganda, Washington, New York, Paris, Brussels, and other
places to meet people who can ''tell their own stories.''
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations, especially its current Secretary General
Kofi Annan, who at the time of genocide was U.N. Under-Secretary
General in charge of peace-keeping operations, has been seriously
criticized by Rwanda for its failure to intervene and stop the
genocide from April to July 1994.
</P>
<P>
While Hutu militia extremists were butchering people, the U.N.
decided to scale down its presence in Rwanda to around 200
soldiers, and withdrew the bulk of its force.
</P>
<P>
For its current stay in Rwanda, the U.N. Inquiry commission
will meet government officials, non-governmental organizations,
genocide survivors, and visit genocide sites.
</P>
<P>
The final report of the commission is expected to be presented
to the U.N. Secretary General before the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> S. African Reserves Grow in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The gross gold and
foreign exchange reserves of the South African Reserve Bank grew
by almost 4.5 percent in August to 37.3 billion rand (6.1 billion
U.S. dollars), compared to 35.7 billion (5.85 billion dollars) in
the previous month.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in gross reserves was however not the result of
normal inflows but rather an increase in the use of foreign credit
lines," said Henry Flint, economist at Standard Bank Investment
Corporation. "The better than expected reserve figures compliment
the other (economic) data we have seen so far this week."
</P>
<P>
"Our positive trade performance and the growing foreign
interest in South African investments, especially equities, should
continue to support reserves," South African Press Association
Thursday quoted Flint as saying.
</P>
<P>
With most important data releases published for a while and a
stronger rand, the South African central bank may soon signal a
more rapid decline in the repo rate which will eventually filter
through to lower rates across the board, said the economist.
</P>
<P>
At the end of August, the use of foreign credit lines stood at
16.9 billion dollars compared to 15.2 billion dollars in July.
Net reserves remained virtually unchanged at 3.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Flint said the reserves could now almost cover three months of
imports, which is the internationally accepted norm.

Thursday quoted an army officer as saying.

<P>
Director of Army Public Relations, Colonel Felix Chukwuma, said
that " despite the fact that the Commander-in-Chief has the

and make input".

<HEADLINE> 2,000-Year Old Noble's Tombs Found in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
found two noble's tombs, dating back to the Western Han Dynasty (
206 BC-24 AD) in Yuanling City in the western part of Hunan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists, who are carrying out protective excavation
on the bigger tomb, said it had not been robbed before being
discovered in a construction area of the city.
</P>
<P>
The 15.3 by 12 meter tomb, located eight meters underground, is
at the same level as the famous Western Han tombs unearthed at
Mawangdui in Changsha, capital of Hunan.
</P>
<P>
The Mawangdui tombs were excavated in 1972. Objects unearthed
from the tombs include an intact woman's corpse, a jade suit
stitched with gold thread, exquisite lacquer, silk books, silk
paintings and bamboo slips with inscriptions on them.
</P>
<P>
The tomb is in three parts: a pit, chamber and entrance pathway,
and there are steps cut into the pit walls for access , according
to He Jiejun, head of the local archaeological research institute.
</P>
<P>
A large number of charcoal pieces, used as moisture proof
material, can be seen at the bottom of the pit, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
"There are three cypress boards covering the outer coffin," he
said. "On the two sides of the coffin, there are two wooden boxes
for containing objects buried with the dead," he went on, adding
that there is also a double door carved with characters indicating
North and South between the outer and inner coffin chamber.
</P>
<P>
The occupant of the tomb was probably a member of a large noble
family living in the region for three generations during the time
of the dynasty. "This will be confirmed after further excavation."
</P>
<P>
"The tombs will provide valuable clues for the study on funeral
systems and tomb construction in the early Han Dynasty," the
expert added.

<HEADLINE> Last 80 Nigerian Soldiers in Liberia to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to withdraw its last
batch of peace-keeping soldiers from Liberia in late September,
Nigerian Foreign Minister Sule Lamido said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 Nigerian soldiers are still in Liberia as part of the
west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG charged with overseeing
the destruction of weapons remaining from the country's seven-year
civil war, the Post Express newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawing of the soldiers, demanded by Nigerian President
Olusegun Obasanjo, will bring an end to the country's nine-year
intervention in Liberia, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
In August 1990, then President Ibrahim Babangida sent thousands
of troops to Liberia to support embattled President Samuel Doe
against rebels led by Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Doe was later killed and in 1997 Taylor was elected Liberian
President in a U.N. monitored election.
</P>
<P>
Before being elected to the presidency, Obasanjo had promised
to return home the last Nigerian troops from Liberia and Sierra
Leone, and to focus its government's energy on domestic economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 Nigerian peace-keeping troops in Sierra Leone were
Tuesday flown home following the signing of a peace agreement in
July, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More troops are expected to be flown out of Sierra Leone in a
phased withdrawal expected to take around six months, reducing the
Nigerian contingent from around 10,000 to 1,000 men.
</P>
<P>
The last troops will be charged with overseeing the disarmament
agreed in the July peace accord in Lome, Togo.

<HEADLINE> Pak Will Take into Account New Situation Before Making Decision on CTBT Issue: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday said it
will take into account the "new situation" in the face of India's
recent nuclear doctrine before making any decision on the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) issue.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan cannot remain unmindful to this situation (after
India's announcement of nuclear program) and we have to take into
account all these factors before a final decision (on CTBT),"
Foreign Office Spokesman Tariq Altaf told foreign media here.
</P>
<P>
Last year both Pakistan and India agreed to sign the CTBT by
September 1999, but earlier this year India said it will not do so
before the completion of the general election which will be held
from September 5 to October 3.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, India launched earlier this month a "nuclear
doctrine" which targets the deployment and operationalization of
nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
Altaf expressed Pakistan's concern over India's militarization
program.
</P>
<P>
"Recent developments have created a lot of complications and
the new situation, arising from India's militarization program,
has de-stabilized peace and security in the region," he said.

the MagicM7 against Sallen from Uppsala in his first game on
October 26.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to visiting Sweden and playing with my team,not
just one or two games," Johnson told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
"To play several games with my team is part of a process to
educate the players. They are learning during practice but for me
to show what I mean, we really have to play together."
</P>
<P>
MagicM7 changed its name from M7Boras after they made the
agreement with Johnson. Last year M7Boras finished fifth in the
Swedish league and missed the play-off.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 40, said he picked the Swedish league because he was
impressed by the interest in basketball when he was here for an
exhibition team event in 1996.
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, Johnson has turned his hand to
business, with his company, Magic Johnson Enterprise, branching
into cinemas, a record company and a basketball camp.
</P>
<P>
Johnson tested HIV-positive in 1991. He retired at the start of
the 1991-92 season but made a brief comeback, playing for the
United States "Dream Team" who won gold at the 1992 Barcelona
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Johnson returned to the game again in January 1996 and played
half of the season but when the Lakers were eliminated from the
playoffs, Johnson retired for good from the NBA.

<HEADLINE> Jet Downed over Ethiopia May Have Veered Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A Johannesburg-bound jet
shot down over Ethiopia Sunday appeared to have veered off course
and strayed into a war zone, the South African embassy in Addis
Ababa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Although we know how the plane was brought down, we can't say
how it ended up in a war zone or why it strayed off course," South
African Press Association quoted political counsellor Ajay Bramdeo
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries (Ethiopia and Eritrea) have been at war for
16 months. There is no way that either country would have granted
direct access to any plane from the territory of the other," the
counsellor said.
</P>
<P>
The flight plan of the Learjet 35A was from Luxor in Egypt to
Eritrean capital Asmara, to Perim in Djibouti, overhead Addis
Ababa to Nairobi where it was scheduled to land, according to
Linden Birns, a spokesman for aviation company ExecuJet.
</P>
<P>
However, the plane was shot down near the northern Ethiopian
town of Adwa, about 400 kilometers from Djibouti, Bramdeo said.
</P>
<P>
Birns said the aircraft had confirmed to Eritrean air traffic
controllers that it was en route to Djibouti shortly before
authorities lost radio contact with the jet.
</P>
<P>
"We can vouch that unless instructed to do otherwise, such
professional pilots would not have made the error to stray off
course over a war zone," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And even if they had, air traffic controllers would have
warned them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Birns said Ethiopian authorities would have to provide proof
that the aircraft had indeed crossed the war zone. "It is a handy
excuse at the moment."
</P>
<P>
The Learjet, which was registered in the United States, was on
its way to Johannesburg for refurbishment by ExecuJet. It was
being flown by South African-based British national Alan Lewis,
47, and Swede Anders Rors, 48.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia Wednesday accepted responsibility for shooting down
the plane.

MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A private plane with two people
aboard crashed in the seawaters of Siraway, Zamboanga Del Norte
province in the southern Philippines Thursday morning, a sketchy

A report of the Philippine Air Force (PAF) said the

Two MG-520 helicopters flew over Siraway but were forced to fly

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud Thursday left here for Canada to attend a summit of
Francophone countries.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the presidential palace said that Lahoud will
address the 8th summit of Francophone countries to reiterate
Lebanon's commitment to achieving a fair, comprehensive peace in
the Middle East and maintianing unity between Syria and Lebanon in
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The president will also seize the occasion to stress his
country's outright rejection of the resettlement of thousands of
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, 360,000 Palestinians are living in 12 key refugee
camps scattered across the country.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's recent remarks made in the
U.S. on refusal of return of Palestinians sparked Lebanon's deep
concern.
</P>
<P>
The government fear that the resettlement of Palestinians,
mostly Muslims, in Lebanon, will tip the country's delicate
religious balance against the favor of Christians in the
post-civil war era.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day conference, attended by 50 Frenchphone
countries, Lahoud will hold talks with French President Jacques
Chirac on the peace process and bilateral ties, the sources
added.

<HEADLINE> Dream of Doing Business at Home to Come True in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kongers' dream of doing
business elsewhere around the world at their homes will soon
become a reality, as an e-gateway project is expected to be
completed by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Over the last three years, TNT has 'web enabled' most of its
major internal applications, and has laid the foundations for a
global e-commerce infrastructure," said Noud Leussink, a regional
manager of TNT's Customer Interface Technology (CIT) for Asia.
</P>
<P>
Leussink was speaking at a media workshop in Hong Kong Thursday,
unveiling TNT's latest and complete range of Internet services,
designed to reshape the marketplace for express distribution
services and secure TNT's leadership in Internet-based service
delivery.
</P>
<P>
TNT, one of the world's leading companies in global express
distribution, logistics and mail, has introduced e-gateway through
the CIT, offering online integration to complete the Internet
logistics system.
</P>
<P>
People are already able to do local e-commerce through the
Internet, but with the establishment of e-gateway supported by TNT,
they will have access to fast, efficient services worldwide,
explained Bryan Chan, general manager of the TNT Express Worldwide
(Hong Kong) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely encouraging," Chan said. TNT' technology is
designed to be integrated directly into the customer's supply
chain, streamlining operations for organization and allowing an
unprecedented control over the shipping and supply process, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has made
efforts to promote the development of information technology and
the Internet and this has greatly helped the realization of e-
gateway, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lau Kam-hung, director of the Hong Kong government
's Information Technology Services, who spoke at an e-business
symposium in Melbourne Thursday, establishing an open and common
interface, as well as a public key infrastructure to enable
individuals, businesses and the government to interact through
digital networks easily and securely is one of the initiatives in
a move to put Hong Kong at the threshold to tomorrow's digital
world.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet has completely changed people's way of life since
its founding 30 years ago," Raymond To, senior account executive
of the API Prism Ltd., told the workshop.
</P>
<P>
To stressed that TNT's increasing focus on Internet commerce
and application is a direct reflection of their view on the
potential of the Asia-Pacific market, since Internet penetration
in Asia is being driven by businesses while in the United States
it was driven by individuals.
</P>
<P>
There will be a dramatic increase in the use of online business
in Asia in the next three years and by 2002, 70 percent of all
consignments in Asia will be handled electronically, To predicted.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition to Establish Cabinet, Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan opposition United
Front has decided to revive a 10-member cabinet and set up a
central Afghan bank, an opposition spokesman said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
General Hussain Anwari said in an e-mail message from the
Panjsher valley that prominent members of the opposition met
recently in the valley to discuss issues pertaining to foreign and
domestic policies, the composition of a new cabinet and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
Details of the cabinet ministers will be made public in due
course, said Anwari.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan opposition decision came at a time when the United
Nations is set to make a decision about the Afghan turmoil later
this month. The ruling Taliban, who control nearly 90 percent of
the country's territory including the capital Kabul, have been
demanding international recognition since they overran Kabul three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations still recognizes the deposed President
Burhanuddin Rabbani as the legitimate Afghan ruler. Pakistan,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the only three
states which recognize the Taliban government.
</P>
<P>
Anwari said the meeting, chaired by Commander Ahmad Shah
Masood, also reviewed military matters and decided to open new
fronts against the Taliban.

<HEADLINE> Team Starts Searching for Remains of W.W.II Bomber in SW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- An American search team has
arrived at a mountain in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region to look for the remains of the crew members
aboard a lost American bomber from the World War II.
</P>
<P>
On August 31, 1944, a B-24 bomber of the "Flying Tigers"
squadron crashed after bombing Japanese warships, killing all ten
crew members.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, local villagers found debris from the aircraft and the
remains of eight of the missing American airmen have subsequently
been recovered.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth team that has been sent to the area for the
purpose, an official from the regional foreign affairs office told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The team is composed of 12 servicemen, anthropologists and
linguists, while the local government has also sent 10 porters and
two doctors to travel with the American experts to the Mao'er
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
The search is scheduled to last three to five weeks and the
experts hope they could at least find something related to the
final two crew members.
</P>
<P>
Led by U.S. Gen. Claire Lee Chennault, the "Flying Tigers"
squadron was a voluntary American airlift operation which helped
the Chinese in their struggle against the Japanese aggression.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese-Egyptian Ties Improving, Sudanese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Osman Ismail has admitted that his country's ties with
Egypt have not returned to normal, but he stressed they are in a
better shape.
</P>
<P>
He added that Egypt has come to realize the U.S. attempt to
divide and destabilize Sudan, the Sudanese official daily Al Anbaa
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said that his government accepts the Egyptian-Libyan
initiative to hold a national dialog aimed at achieving a national
reconciliation and agrees to attend a discussion of a preparatory
committee at any time and anywhere.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Khartoum has no objection to dealing with
any topics, adding that realization of national reconciliation
will expand the government's achievements.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old civil war between Sudanese government and the
southern rebels, and the ensuing famine have claimed over 1.5
million lives in the poor African country.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Sudan and Egypt plummeted in 1995 after an
unsuccessful attack on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
Ethiopia. Egypt accused Sudan of harboring the attackers, an
accusation denied by Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
The two countries began to improve relations since last
year. As a goodwill overture, Sudan returned part of the Egyptian
property it seized over chilling relations after an
Islamist-backed government assumed power in 1989.

<HEADLINE> 10 U.S.Tourists Found Dead in Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- All 12 people boarding a
plane that crashed in north Tanzania's Arusha Region, including 10
U.S. tourists, have been found dead, the Regional Commissioner,
Daniel Njoolay, told Xinhua Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"They are dead. The bodies are in pieces," Njoolay said over
telephone from Arusha.
</P>
<P>
He said that the tragedy was reported by policemen who have
arrived in the scene, which lies in a forest on the slope of a
hill.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian policemen and U.S. rescuers are still at the scene
investigating the incident, he said.
</P>
<P>
The small charter plane, which crashed Wednesday morning, was
carrying six male and female U.S. tourists from the world-famous
Serengeti National Park to the Kilimanjaro Airport in northern
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
On board the Cessna 404 aircraft, which went down some 12 miles
away from the 14,979-foot Mount Meru, the fifth highest in Africa,
also included a Tanzanian tour guide and a pilot.
</P>
<P>
Mount Meru, often surrounded by cloud, is a part of the Arusha

the region.
</P>
<P>
The Acting Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Natural
Resources and Tourism, R.P. Kabende, left here Thursday morning

<HEADLINE> Blair Hits Back on Northern Ireland Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Thursday angrily dismissed criticism from opposition
Conservatives as well as the Protestant and Roman Catholic leaders
of his approach to the Northern Ireland Issue which he said
remained his priority.
</P>
<P>
Blair, apparently annoyed by Conservative leader William Hague'
s comments that he had betrayed the people of Northern Ireland, in
return, accused Hague and others of undermining the already
troubled peace process in the province.
</P>
<P>
"Before people say 'let's pull the whole process to bits',
which is effectively what the Conservatives are saying, they
should really think about the future of Northern Ireland, the
children of Northern Ireland and whether it is really a
responsible thing to do," Blair told the Times in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives and politicians from Northern Ireland's
Protestant majority have attacked Northern Ireland Secretary Mo
Mowlam for ruling that the IRA's two-year-old ceasefire was still
intact despite reports the guerrilla group was linked to a Belfast
murder and a U.S. gun-running plot.
</P>
<P>
Blair accused Hague of breaking a long-standing bipartisan
policy on Northern Ireland between Britain's main parties.
</P>
<P>
He urged politicians from across the sectarian divide in
Northern Ireland to set aside bitter recriminations and join a new
peace push next week.
</P>
<P>
"The idea nothing has been gained through the peace process is
absurd," he said. "Parts of the media and parts of the
Conservative Party did not want the Good Friday agreement to
succeed and did not believe in it."
</P>
<P>
Last year's Good Friday peace agreement has run into trouble
because of a deadlock over guerrilla disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Blair said finding a way forward was his most urgent priority.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sends Police Companies to East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Two companies of policemen
from Jakarta arrived in Dili, capital of East Timor, on Thursday
to help secure the territory following the direct ballot on August
30.
</P>
<P>
The 200 policemen arrived in Dili aboard two Hercules transport
planes of the Indonesian Air Force at noon, according to the
Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The police have two main tasks following the popular
consultation -- to help create a conducive situation and to
safeguard the process and result of vote count of the ballot,"
East Timor Police Chief Col. Timbul Silaen said in a written
address to the police companies.
</P>
<P>
There have been plans to send five police companies to East
Timor after the ballot, Antara said, adding that it is not known
when the other three companies will arrive.
</P>
<P>
There are 28 police companies under the command of the East
Timor Police.
</P>
<P>
A spate of violence took place in East Timor as the United
Nations began counting the votes from Monday's ballot on the
future of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
At least two persons were killed and three others injured in
the latest violence targeted at the U.N. Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Togar Sianipar said here
Wednesday that in anticipation of post-ballot violence, a Mobile
Brigade unit was deployed from Kupang to Atambua, bordering East
Timor and East Nusa Tenggara. If necessary, five units will be
sent to East Timor, he added.
</P>
<P>
Defying fears of massive violence, 98.6 percent of the about
450,000 registered voters showed up for the ballot.
</P>
<P>
The direct ballot will determine whether East Timor, a former
Portuguese colony, will enjoy wide-ranging autonomy within
Indonesia or get independence. East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move was never recognized by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Vote results are expected to come out on September 7.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
found more than 3,000 pieces of pottery, jade and bronze articles,
dating back to the Spring and Autumn Period (770 B.C.-476 B.C.),
in Houma City in Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The articles were unearthed from 950 tombs and 900 pits used in
ancient ceremonies in a 500,000-sq-m ruins, which were discovered
at a construction site of the city early last year.
</P>
<P>
Among the relics, the most rare is a pressurized bronze cooking
vessel that even contains the remains of food from ancient time.
</P>
<P>
The well-preserved tombs and objects inside will provide
valuable clues for archaeological research into the Jin State, an
ancient kingdom of the Spring and Autumn Period with Houma as its
capital.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Bid Farewell to Hunger (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to official data, spending on food by agricultural
workers accounted for 69 percent of their income in the early
1950s, but had dropped to 53 percent by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, their spending on education, recreation and services
grew to 10 percent, with the livable housing space rising to 23.7
square meters per household.
</P>
<P>
Bian Cuihua, a baby-sitter in Beijing from rural areas in
neighboring Hebei Province, said, "I have enough to eat and wear
at home. I came to Beijing mainly to broaden my view."
</P>
<P>
In the southeastern coastal areas, which took the lead in
developing rural businesses in China, city dwellers saw with envy
the building of elegantly designed houses by farmers, their sedan
cars and fashionable clothes. And it is now hard to tell a farmer
from a urban resident.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, the net income of farmers nationwide
has grown by 10 percent on average, but the growth rate has varied
in different regions due to unbalanced economic development.
</P>
<P>
In eastern China, farmers' income has jumped 19.5 fold, while
the figure is 14.6 fold and 11.7 fold, respectively, in central
and western regions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has intensified its efforts to develop
the vast western region, especially western mountainous areas
which are now home to most of the remaining impoverished people.
</P>
<P>
This year, the central government will spend a record 28.4
billion yuan in poverty relief, hoping to reach its goal of
banishing poverty for farmers by the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> Suicide Bombing Kills Tamil Politician in N.Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A suicide bombing on Thursday
noon killed at least two people in northern Sri Lanka, including a
senior Tamil politician, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
Manikkadasam, vice president of the People's Liberation
Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) was blown up by a woman
suicide bomber in the party's office in Vavuniya, some 250
kilometers north of Colombo, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Manikkadasam, also the party's military wing
leader, was killed during a meeting in his office.
</P>
<P>
A PLOTE's district military leader was also killed in the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
Nobody has yet claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing.
But police believed that it was an operation of separatist
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
PLOTE has been helping the government in its 16-year old fight
against the LTTE rebels who demand a separate Tamil homeland in
the north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
LTTE rebels, notorious for launching suicide bombing, have also
been blamed for the killing of Neelan Thiruchelvam, a leading
Tamil lawmaker and vice president of the Tamil United Liberation
Front (TULF) in late July.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Slams Banks Over Minimum Balance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has criticized major banking institutions for locking out
small depositors with the imposition of high minimum balances.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Thursday quoted Moi as saying that
the practice had forced people especially those in the rural
areas to close their accounts due to the inability to meet the
high balances.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, most people in the rural areas do not have
adequate banking facilities," Moi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Major banks in Kenya introduced high minimum balances for
current and savings account holders recently. The Kenyan
government holds less than 50 percent of shares in a few banks.
</P>
<P>
Over 40 percent of Kenyans live under poverty line, according
to official statistics.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh MP Urges Asia to Secure Destiny of Mankind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Bangladeshi
Parliament said here Thursday that with nearly two-thirds of
humanity on its soil, Asia has an abiding, natural and moral
responsibility to secure the destiny of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Ali Ashraf made this statement in his keynote paper presented
at the Asian Parliamentarians' Conference for Peace and
Cooperation, which started here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The 20th century has been a violent and painful one -- more so
in Asia. Since World War II, Asia has witnessed more full-blown
wars than all the other continents put together," noted Ashraf,
who is also chairman of Bangladesh's Parliamentary Standing
Committee on the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
"We, the parliamentarians as people's representatives can save
our states and our people from the meaningless pursuit of
belligerence," he told the conference.
</P>
<P>
On the role of parliamentarians in maintaining human security,
Ashraf said, "We must act together to bridge the gaps between
dissenting and discontent minds, diffuse tension, discourage
militarism, avert conflict and so on."
</P>
<P>
All the people of the world want peace and security, he said,
pointing out, "To ensure security most of the developed countries
are making nuclear weapons spending a great amount of their
wealth, but they are very much ignorant about the fact that arms
can never bring peace or security."
</P>
<P>
"Only the removal of arms or disarmament can make the world
safe, secure and peaceful," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Some 105 members of parliament from 33 Asian countries and 38
members of civil societies of these countries are attending the
four-day conference, which was initiated by Bangladesh and is
funded by the Bangladeshi government and the U.N. Development
Program.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese MPs to Visit Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Two members of the Sudanese
Parliament are scheduled to arrive in Uganda Thursday for a visit
connected with the longstanding problem of abduction of children
by rebels in the northern part of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Kagole Kivumbi, spokesman to the Ugandan Parliament, told
Xinhua in a telephone interview Thursday morning that the Sudanese
MPs were coming for the visit, but they were not invited by the
Ugandan legislature.
</P>
<P>
"I am not aware that they are invited by the Parliament. They
can be invited by some individual MPs here," he said.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper report Thursday said that the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) is coordinating the visit.
</P>
<P>
Absolom Ongom, chairperson of the Acholi Parliamentary Group,
was quoted as saying that the Acholi MPs would meet the Sudanese
in the UNICEF office here later in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese legislators would visit Kitgum and Gulu, two
northern districts subject to frequent attacks by the rebels of
the Lord Resistance Army (LRA) since 1986.
</P>
<P>
The LRA rebels, spearheaded by Joseph Kony and allegedly based
in southern Sudan, have made abductions and killings in northern
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Sudan have accused each other of backing their rebel
groups in their respective countries. The two neighbors severed
their relations in
April 1995.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Seek Better Ecology along China's Longest Inland River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese scientists have
called for the improvement of the ecological environment along the
Tarim River, China's longest inland river in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to a consultation report released by the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS), China's leading science institute, the
deteriorating ecological environment along the Tarim River affects
the whole region of Xinjiang, and as a result sand storms will
spread to northwest and north China and farther areas outside the
country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,321 kilometers long, the Tarim River flows through
Xinjiang, and is regarded by the local people as the region's "
mother river". Many historic sites including the ancient kingdom
of Loulan are dotted along the river.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xinshi, an academician of the CAS, said that because of
improper water utilization, 320 kilometers of the river have dried
up, and the underground water in the lower reaches of the river
has dropped 18 meters since the 1950's.
</P>
<P>
The forest area of a poplar species growing in the desert
decreased by 47,000 hectares from 1958 to 1995, and a large area
of farmland was turned into desert.
</P>
<P>
Observation data from the meteorological department show that
the precipitation amount in the valley of the river has remained
the same over the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
Scientists attribute the reason for the drying up of the river
to large scale reclamation of wasteland, improper use of water in
the upper reaches, inefficient irrigation, and lack of water
facilities.
</P>
<P>
In the consultation report, scientists have suggested
harnessing the middle reaches of the river, and building dykes and
canals. The run-off of the river is expected to increase by more
than two billion cubic meters as a result.
</P>
<P>
The construction of water projects along the Tarim River will
also benefit the local economy in the northwestern region of China
and help narrow the gap between the region and the developed
coastal areas, said the report.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Irreplaceable Role for Conference on Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Disarmament (
CD), as a multilateral disarmament negotiating body, is
irreplaceable in terms of its status and role, the Chinese
ambassador for disarmament affairs, Li Changhe, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Even though it has not been able to get down to treaty
negotiations for the time being, the conference can still function
as an important forum where dialogue can be conducted on major
issues of international peace and security, and on some specific
disarmament items," Li said at a CD plenary.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CD could help enhance mutual understandings
and explore possibilities for negotiations on certain issues.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the international situation could improve
and delegations accommodate each other's concerns in a practical
and flexible manner in order to reach an early agreement on a
comprehensive and balanced program of work next year," Li told the
plenary as the CD's 1999 session was about to be concluded.
</P>
<P>
The admission of five new members on August 5 was the major
progress of the 1999 session, Li said. The new members are Ecuador,
Ireland, Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Li said that a series of developments this year in
international peace and security have exerted profound negative
impact on international relations, the confidence and security
perceptions of states, which in turn inevitably affected the
international disarmament process.
</P>
<P>
The divergence among member states on the CD's program of work
should not be seen as procedural in nature, but rather a
reflection of differences over the priorities for disarmament
agenda, he said.
</P>
<P>
In formulating its program of work, the CD should take this
fact into consideration and accommodate the concerns of all member
states to the largest extent possible in a comprehensive and
balanced manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Necessary political will and flexibility is required from all
sides," Li said. "The current stalemate manifests the necessity
for further efforts in this regard."

NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Commercial Bank is
hoping to find a foreign strategic partner by the end of this year
to reverse the bank's recent misfortunes.
</P>
<P>
The bank's general manager Ernest Saina said Wednesday that the
search for a foreign bank to invest in his bank was a top
priority, adding "we have already sent feelers to potential
banks."
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Thursday quoted the general manager
as saying a strategic partner would bring in global benefits,
access to technology, funds and management.
</P>
<P>
The commercial bank, one of the five largest banks in Kenya,
has been hurt by bad and doubtful debts, and its pre-tax profits
slumped to 1.4 billion shillings (around 20 million U.S. dollars)
in 1998 from 4.1 billion shillings in 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the first half of this year, the bank only posted a pre-tax
profit of 393 million shillings (some 5.6 million dollars)
compared with 1.6 billion shillings in the 1998 same period.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A new park opened in Beijing
today to commemorate the 22nd Universal Postal Congress (UPC)
which is being held in China for the first time.
</P>
<P>
International delegates to the congress attended the opening
ceremony of the park located beside the site of an ancient post
office in a northern suburb of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Liu Liqing, postmaster general of China's State Post Bureau (
SPB) said that the particular location of the park is meaningful.
He said that postal services have made great contributions to the
progress of civilization in the past and will further promote
social progress under the joint efforts of the members of the
Universal Postal Union (UPU).
</P>
<P>
Thomas Leavey, director general of the International Bureau of
the UPU, said that environmental protection has received great
attention at the congress.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the postal sector handles a very large portion of
the earth's paper and uses hundreds of thousands of motor vehicles
for collecting and delivering mail, he said that postal services
worldwide have a heavy ecological and economic responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"I am proud to say that in recent years, postal services have
come to realize the effect of their business on the environment
and the need to act in a responsible way," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the opening of the tree packed park is a very good
example of such efforts.
</P>
<P>
Liu and Leavey unveiled a monument in the park engraved with
the name of the 189 member countries of the UPU.
</P>
<P>
The international delegates planted a tree on behalf of each of
their countries.
</P>
<P>
A delegate from Cote Divoire in Africa said that each tree
planted in the park represents the goodwill of the people from a
member of the UPU.
</P>
<P>
"As we are applying to be host of the next UPC, our country is
thinking of holding similar activities to this," he said.

BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has extended a warm written welcome to delegates planning to
attend the forthcoming 4th annual conference and general assembly
of the International Association of Prosecutors, Xinhua learned
today.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China
and myself, I extend a warm welcome" to prosecutors from all over
the world, Jiang wrote.
</P>
<P>
"We are about to bid farewell to the 20th century and brace
ourselves for a new millennium. At the same time, with both
opportunities and challenges co-existing, every nation in the
world attaches great importance to economic development, social
stability and the improvement of living standards for its citizens,
" Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Guaranteeing the healthy development of national economies and
society at large by legal means has become a common task for all,
and it is of great significance for the International Association

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen members of the Nigerian
House of Representatives are now being investigated by the Ethics
and Privileges Committee of the house, following petitions
against them by members of the public.
</P>
<P>
According to a local newspaper report, at least seven of them
are being investigated over drug related allegations, six are
being investigated over certificate qualification deficiency while
the rest are being investigated over allegations of being
ex-convicts.
</P>
<P>
The Vanguard newspaper Thursday quoted a source close to the
committee by saying that "during the course of our
investigations, we had evidence that some members were involved
in drug peddling. But the fact that they were never convicted
makes it difficult for us to recommend any type of punitive
measure against them".

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has captured two
Indian soldiers during the latest fighting between the two
countries in the disputed area of Kashmir earlier this week, a
military spokesman said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier Rashid Qureshi, director general of Inter-Services
Public Relations of Pakistan, said in a briefing to reporters here
that the captured soldiers belonged to the Ninth Brigade of the
Indian Army.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the two Indian prisoners were safe and sound
in Pakistan's custody.
</P>
<P>
He said the capturing of Indian soldiers belied the allegation
of an Indian Army spokesman that New Delhi had not launched any
attack against Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan claimed that on early Monday its troops foiled an
attempt by Indian troops to capture a Pakistani post in the
Shyok-Turtok sector of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Qureshi said heavy losses had been inflicted on the Indian side
and many dead bodies were left behind when they were forced to
retreat.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Say Bodies Found at Plane Crash Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for U.S.
embassy in Dar es Salaam said Thursday that Tanzanian villagers
had found bodies at the scene where a small plane carrying 10 U.S.
tourists crashed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. rescuers have not reached the crash scene yet because
it lies in a hilly, steep area, so the fate of the tourists have
yet to be established, Dudley Sims, Director of United States
Information Service in Dar es Salaam, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Arusha Regional Commissioner, Daniel ole Njoolay, will take a
helicopter with policemen and doctors later Thursday to inspect
the scene, a local government official told Xinhua over telephone.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult for a car to reach the scene because the plane
crashed in a steep mountain," said the official who declined to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which crashed Wednesday morning, was carrying six
male and four female U.S. tourists from the world-famous Serengeti
National Park to the Kilimanjaro Airport in northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
On board the aircraft, which went down some 12 miles away from
the 14, 979-foot Mount Meru, the fifth highest in Africa, were
also a Tanzanian tour guide and a pilot.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian and
Indonesian military forces will build a joint border post at
Timbang Mangaris, Sabah, East Malaysia, to enhance security along
their common border in Borneo.
</P>
<P>
The border post would be ready by August next year, Commander
of the First Malaysian Infantry Division Major-General Pahlawan
Mohamed Azumi Mohamad said Thursday at a news conference in
Kuching, Sarawak, East Malaysia, after holding talks with
Major-General Zainuri Hashim, the military area commander for
Kalimantan, Indonesia, who is on a visit to Sarawak.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from ensuring security, the post will also strengthen
friendship between the two military forces," Bernama news agency
quoted Mohamed Azumi said.
</P>
<P>
The joint border post will be the third along the
Malaysian-Indonesian border. At present, there are two such common
border posts in Sarawak.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Indonesian commander said at the joint press
conference that the Indonesian and Malaysian Armed Forces have
excellent relations and many border problems have been amicably
resolved between them.
</P>
<P>
This relationship would be maintained through more exchanges of
information and joint exercises, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Post Prospers After Return to Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong postal services have
enjoyed greater influence in the postal world since Hong Kong
returned to the motherland in 1997, according to a senior postal
official in the special administrative region.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Xinhua, Allan Chiang, deputy
postmaster general of Hong Kong Post, said that since 1997 Hong
Kong has had much more opportunities to participate in
international postal meetings than ever before under the "one
country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
He is one of the ten representatives from the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) attending the ongoing 22nd Universal
Postal Congress (UPC) in Beijing as members of the Chinese
delegation.
</P>
<P>
He describes the cooperative relations between Hong Kong Post
and postal services on the mainland of China as "brotherly" which
began long before the 1997 handover.
</P>
<P>
Express Mail Services (EMS) is the number one postal exchange
between Hong Kong and the mainland in terms of volume, followed by
ordinary mail. Pointing out that mainland customs have greatly
supported and assisted the relay of mail to and from Hong Kong, he
said that the volume of EMS between the two places increased by 15
percent after 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Delivery time of EMS has also been cut to two days, which is
an unprecedented speed," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the philately service is also an important area of
cooperation between Hong Kong and the inland, with a two-way trade
volume of 46 million Hong Kong dollars every year.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong people are buying one million Hong Kong dollars
worth of stamps from the mainland every year. Taking into
consideration the population of Hong Kong, it is quite a
significant figure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though Hong Kong Post still remains as a government institution,
the postal service on China's mainland has become a corporation
that has a certain independence from the postal administration.
</P>
<P>
"It is much more flexible in offering services than in Hong
Kong," Chiang said. "And its operations are highly commercialized,
which is very good," he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the postal services, both in Hong
Kong and on the mainland, have a bright future.

<HEADLINE> China Encouraging Use of Water-Saving Irrigation Methods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China has begun changing from
its old way of flooding fields to a new water-saving irrigation
system, which was being used on about 15.3 million hectares of
land at the end of 1998, according to the Water Resources Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is placing great importance on this and
other methods and is encouraging farmers to use them, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
In a recent visit to areas along the Yellow River, President
Jiang Zemin said that saving water and changing from flooding
fields to more intensive cultivation is a priority item. To this
end, China has earmarked more than 25 billion yuan for encouraging
the use of the new method since 1996.
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, 15 billion cubic meters of water have
been saved annually because of this project, which is equal to
building 150 large reservoirs that would cost billions of yuan.
China's total grain output at the same time went from 466.5
billion kilograms to 490 billion.
</P>
<P>
Water shortages are still a major hindrance to national
economic development and social advancement, so China will
continue to improve irrigation methods. By 2010, water-saving
irrigation will be used on 34 million hectares, according to Zhang
Chunyuan, vice-minister of water resources.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Bid Farewell to Hunger (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great changes have taken place in China's rural areas over the
past 50 years, especially since 1978 when the household contract
responsibility system was implemented and farmers were allowed to
farm their own land.
</P>
<P>
With good consecutive grain harvests and the mushrooming of
rural businesses, Chinese farmers no longer have to worry about
starvation and care only about how much more money they can earn.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Ke, an official of Lingbi's Weiji Town, where Zhang lives,
said that it used to be the poorest region in the county, with
annual per capita income less than 100 yuan 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The figure has risen to 1,750 yuan and more than 90 percent of
households have bought farm vehicles and almost every family has a
TV set," he said.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Statistics indicates that the average
net income of farmers nationwide has soared to 2,162 yuan in 1998
from 44 yuan in 1949, when the People's Republic of China was
founded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of impoverished people dropped to 42
million last year from 250 million in 1978, accompanied by a
remarkable improvement in the quality of life and the living
environment of farmers.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, over 95 percent of villages across the country had
access to highways, some 70 percent to telephone services, and
more than 95 percent to electricity.

BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year marks
the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China. Over the past five decades, China's achievements in all
economic sectors have attracted worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency is to release about 20 stories about the
nation's economy. The first of the series was released on August
17. This is the thirteenth.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five year old farmer Zhang Desheng never imagined when he
was a youngster that he would be eating meat or wheat-flour bread
every day but these have become common foods for his family now.
</P>
<P>
Zhang lives in Lingbi County, in the north of east China's
Anhui Province, a place which used to be hit alternatively by
droughts and floods; and a place where farmers made a meager
living by growing sweet potatoes.
</P>
<P>
"Sweet potato and sweet potato, no one can survive without
sweet potato", is an old proverb that best depicted the life of
local agricultural workers in the past. They had almost nothing to
eat except sweet potato and meat was a rare delicacy.
</P>
<P>
Now, Zhang lives with his youngest son, who works in a village
fodder plant, and helps his daughter-in-law to grow wheat, cotton
and vegetables, while raising four pigs and dozens of hens.
</P>
<P>
"We have several dishes for each meal and sweet potatoes have
become fodder," Zhang said, grinning, "I can even enjoy my
favorite Sizhou opera from TV every night."

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Several hundred anti-independence militiamen launched a
bloody chase against the pro-independent militants in the
Indonesian province of East Timor Wednesday afternoon around the
headquarters of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET)
in Dili. At least two persons were killed -- one was shot, the
other killed with axe -- and several houses burnt in the area
surrounding the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
-- In Sweden, about 63,000 people were sterilized between 1935
and 1975 as the Swedish authorities were trying to eliminate what
they considered to be "dregs" in order not to block the collective
development of the country. Some of the victims are now asking for
compensations from the government.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- For Russians, the custom of placing its money in security in
the West is not new. While the latest affair of International
Monetary Fund (IMF) is making a scandal, in which from 4.2 to 15
billion U.S. dollars of IMF aid was hijacked, it is estimated that
the money which escaped Russia in the past five years amounted to
138 billion U.S. dollars, most of them through operations of
imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
-- India will hold on Sunday its third legislative elections in
three years. The ruling BJP is expected to beat the Congress Party
of Sonia Gandhi. The war against Pakistan in Kashmir has lifted
the image of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, the key figure
of BJP who has made India enter the club of nuclear arms.

de Miranda, would lead a delegation to Zambia before a reciprocal
visit to Luanda was undertaken.

Angola has been alleging that it had credible information
confirming substantial involvement of the Zambian authorities in
the logistical and military support to the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to enable the rebel movement
perpetuate the war in that country. But Zambia denied the
allegation.

<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan publishers are losing
more than 300 million shillings (about 4 million U.S. dollars)
annually due to book piracy, Kenya Publishers Association has
said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Thursday quoted David Muita,
chairman of the association, as warning that Kenya's publishing
industry would face a collapse if the menace was not curbed.
</P>
<P>
Muita said that the industry had a yearly turnover of two
billion shillings (27 million dollars) and served a source of
livelihood for more than 3,000 families.
</P>
<P>
He urged publishers to inform the association about cases of
piracy to facilitate the crackdown against the culprits.
</P>
<P>
"We will in future blacklist all booksellers involved in piracy
 activities to ensure they get no orders from us, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Muita revealed that the association would press for tougher
laws relating to the Copyrights Act, saying that the
200,000-shilling (2,700 dollars) fine or the five-year jail term
was too lenient for "a criminal making millions of shillings
illegally".

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Present Political Package Before Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
keen to present before parliament a political package aiming to
resolve the long drawn-out ethnic war, said Minister of Media
Mangala Samaraweera Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Samaraweera, who is also Cabinet spokesman, told a news
conference that President Chandrika Kumaratunga will present the
package "as soon as possible" if some minor differences of
electoral reforms are ironed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Kumaratunga had instructed Justice
Minister G.L. Peiris to make legislative preparations for the
political package.
</P>
<P>
The ruling People's Alliance (PA) government and the main
opposition United National Party (UNP) on Wednesday started a new
round of bipartisan talks to work towards a mutually acceptable
peace proposal.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year old civil war fought
between the government and the Tamil rebels who demand a separate
homeland in the north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga unveiled a power-sharing political
package four years ago to resolve the conflict through non-violent
means but it has been shelved due to the lack of bipartisan
consensus.
</P>
<P>
The government had hoped to present the package before
parliament last month but was delayed again for fears that it
would not receive a mandatory two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
Samaraweera said that most of the UNP lawmakers would support
the government's political package once it is tabled before
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Achieves 93 Percent Literacy Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has made progress in its
campaign to eliminate illiteracy since the country declared
independence on September 2, 1945.
</P>
<P>
Now as many as 93 percent of Vietnam's 76.3 million people are
literate, compared with only 10 percent in 1945, the Vietnam News
Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
By June 1999, 52 of the country's 61 provinces and cities had
met the national standard in illiteracy elimination. This means
that 538 of 597 districts and 9,611 of 10,299 wards and communes
have met the national standards.
</P>
<P>
According to the standards in illiteracy elimination set by the
Ministry of Education and Training in 1995, an individual is
literate if he or she finishes the third grade of the five-grade
primary education; a commune will be recognized as meeting the
national standard if 90 percent of its 15-35 year olds (15-25 year
olds for mountainous areas) are literate; and a city or province
will meet the national standard if 90 percent of its districts and
communes meet the standard for them.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Vietnamese government is still making efforts to
eliminate illiteracy in the remaining nine mountainous and remote
provinces. Illiterate people in the nine provinces number 181,700.
</P>
<P>
The nine provinces have received almost half of the 40 billion
Vietnamese dong (about 2.86 million U.S. dollars) from the
national budget for this year's illiteracy elimination and primary
education program.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has approved additional fundings of
7.5 billion Vietnamese dong (about 536,000 dollars) to help the
poorer five provinces of Lai Chau, Ha Giang, Lao Cai, Kon Tum and
Soc Trang to carry out the task.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and visiting South Korean Prime Minister Kim Jong Pil
agreed Thursday to further strengthen bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after their talks, Obuchi
said he reconfirmed with Kim "the importance of building up future-
oriented relations" between Japan and South Korea by steadily
implementing the action plan the two countries adopted during a
state visit to Japan by South Korean President Kim Dae Jung last
October.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Obuchi said he and Kim agreed to begin full-
fledged negotiations later this month toward concluding a
bilateral investment treaty, and to start consultations between
aviation authorities toward improving transportation when the two
countries co-host the 2002 World Cup soccer finals.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also agreed to boost various exchange
programs between the two countries in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who arrived here Wednesday for a five-day official visit,
renewed Seoul's invitation to Japanese Emperor Akihito to visit
South Korea for the first time before the 2002 World Cup. Obuchi
replied that Japan intends to work on improving the environment
toward realizing the visit.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi conveyed his intention to attend the second round of
bilateral consultations involving a full range of cabinet
ministers to be hosted by South Korea on October 23-24 on Cheju
Island.
</P>
<P>
The first round of bilateral consultation, hosted by Tokyo last
November in Kagoshima, southwestern Japan, was attended by 11
cabinet ministers, including Kim and Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed to beef up cooperation in such
multilateral bodies as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
and the World Trade Organization, and to continue working together
on global issues including the reduction of greenhouse gases,
Obuchi said.

LOS ANGELES, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Men and women in the
United States approach the Internet with a different mind-set,
according to an on-line survey released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Most women tend to check e-mail and gather information about a
topic of interest on the Web more often than men, while men are
twice as likely to go to the Web to transfer or download files
than women, said the survey report from PC Data, a leading
Internet research firm specializing in Web audience measurement.
</P>
<P>
The firm had reportedly surveyed more than 2,800 Internet users
in early August.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of women are more likely to surf the Web with a
specific task or objective in mind than men, and are more likely
to use page links as both a navigation method and a source for
site information. Men are more likely to use search engines for
navigation and site information.
</P>
<P>
In addition, men and women shop for different items on the Web.
Men are more likely to purchase computer software and hardware.
Women are more likely to use the Internet to shop for greeting
cards and music. Both men and women are equally interested in
shopping for books on-line.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Maids to Destroy Families in UAE: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The large number of foreign
maids in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a "time-bomb" to
destroy the base of traditional families and hurt the future
generation, a senior police official has warned.
</P>
<P>
The fact that many women in UAE have given up their household
responsibilities and housemaids are bringing up children has
resulted in break-up of many families, said Lieutenant Ibrahim
Abdulla Al Hosani of the Abu Dhabi Police Criminal Evidence
Department.
</P>
<P>
In a report published recently by the Interior Ministry's Al
Shurta (Police) magazine, Hosani said undue employment of maids
and nannies is increasingly weakening the strong bond between
the mother and child especially.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is getting worse as the number of housemaids
and nannies from different beliefs and cultures is continuing to
grow," Hosani said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that unmarried housemaids account for 57
percent and the rest are minors. Many maids allegedly had
unlawful relationships with their employers which resulted in
break-up of the family.
</P>
<P>
"In this light of these facts and statistics, I believe
we are facing a serious problem which needs radical steps for
a solution," Hosani cautioned.
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, it is a gloomy future for the younger
generation which has grown up away from their parents' care
and affection. In fact, the maids' religion, language and
culture have such a strong influence on them that many of
them cannot speak Arabic," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called upon parents not to ignore their responsibility
of bringing up their children and urged everyone to work
toward protecting the young generation from the danger it faces
- the danger posed by housemaids.
</P>
<P>
"We should all wake up before it is too late," Hosani added.

the scene, a local government official told Xinhua over telephone.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult for a car to reach the scene because the plane
crashed in a steep mountain," said the official who declined to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
The small plane, which crashed Wednesday morning, was carrying
six male and four female U.S. tourists from the world-famous
Serengeti National Park to the Kilimanjaro Airport in northern
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
On board the Cessna aircraft, which went down some 12 miles
away from the 14,979-foot Mount Meru, the fifth highest in Africa,
also included a Tanzanian tour guide and a pilot.
</P>
<P>
Mount Meru, often surrounded by cloud, is a part of the Arusha
National Park located some 45 kilometers from the Arusha town in
the Arusha Region.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassy staffs in Tanzanian and Kenya are also heading
toward the scene, Director of the United States Information
Service in Tanzania, Dudley Sims, told Xinhua on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The acting permanent secretary in the Ministry of Natural
Resources and Tourism, R.P. Kabende, left here Thursday morning
for Arusha to handle issues related to the incident.
</P>
<P>
Rescue efforts using helicopters have started since Wednesday
after the plane crashed but were hampered by foggy weather.
</P>
<P>
The Serengeti park draws tens of thousands of tourists every
year who came to see its wide range of big game animals and the
annual migration of millions of gnus.

Mombasa is not only a gateway to Kenya, but also to East and
Central Africa, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Development Inalienable Human Right: Bangladeshi Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Development is an inalienable
human right, Bangladeshi Minister for Law, Justice and
Parliamentary Affairs Abdul Matin Khasru said in his keynote paper
to the Asian Parliamentarians' Conference for Peace and
Cooperation here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the rights proclaimed in the United Nations
Declaration on the Right to Development are meaningless for those
whose basic needs -- food, clothing, shelter, health care and
education are not fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge before us has been to extend the noble ideals of
human rights relevant to those whose life is a constant desperate
struggle for survival at a sub-human level," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister called for appropriate economic measures and
mechanism for getting appropriate economic resources from
developed partners for the development of developing countries so
that the rights, particularly the economic, social and cultural
rights, guaranteed in the International Bill of Human Rights
become meaningful to the people in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Khasru stressed that Asia has different history, cultural and
social moorings, but at the same time Asia is connected and linked
by its strong belief in human dignity, respect for each other's
culture and religion. Asian civilization is based on the belief in
its roots and respect for its social values, struggle and
sacrifice of its ancestors for sustaining each of its
civilizations, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We, therefore, realize more than any other people and nation
as to how important it is to protect our freedom and sovereignty
to work for peace to ensure the sustainable development in our
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khasru noted that he will put forward to the conference, which
opened Wednesday, a proposal for setting in motion the process for
formulation and subsequent adoption of an "Asian Charter of Human
Rights."
</P>
<P>
Asia is the only major continent, which is yet to formulate its
own human rights instrument, he said, adding that the Asian
Parliamentarians' Conference For Peace and Cooperation may resolve
to become the appropriate forum for initiating the process for
formulation and adoption of the Asian Charter of Human Rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister John Moore
traveled to Darwin Thursday to review the plans for the evacuation
of Australians from East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister was quoted by AAP as saying that he had
always expected the period following the ballot to be more
dangerous than the vote itself, and Australian troops would remain
on standby in case the violence got out of hand and an evacuation
was needed.
</P>
<P>
"We are maintaining our preparedness in the Northern
Territory," he said, adding that "As a consequence of that I will
be traveling there on Thursday night to see first hand the
preparations we have made and to speak to the people involved."
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that Australia had built up a task
force in its Northern Territory and about half of its army's
Blackhawks helicopters massed there.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Australian prime minister John Howard phoned to
Indonesian president Habibie, warning that the Australian armed
forces had been on full alert for an evacuation of Australians
from East Timor in case the situation there got worse.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebel Leader Optimistic of Lasting Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) said Wednesday
in Zimbabwean capital that he was optimistic lasting peace would
be achieved in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Africa has enough experienced leaders interested in
making this continent peaceful in the likes of Julius Nyerere,
Robert Mugabe, Nelson Mandela and many others," a Zimbabwean
newspaper Thursday quoted him as saying at a public forum
organized by the Association of African Political Scientists.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that we all, including those that we fought
against, come together and give peace a chance. This is a time for
us to interact, exchange views and ways of ensuring that the
democratization of the Congo takes place for the good of the whole
continent. It is in this spirit of regional cooperation that we
find ourselves here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wamba dia Wamba said that Africa has an obligation to make sure
that the Democratic Republic of the Congo achieves lasting
political stability on which regional peace would hinge.
</P>
<P>
"War has certain ways of educating us all. The moral of this
war in the DRC is that the needs, expectations and aspirations of
the majority have to be articulated through a national
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
He argued that unless African countries realized that it was
fundamental to have a majority and democratically elected
government which protected the interests of the minority,
stability would remain a dream, because it was this problem that
led to genocides.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Chief Denies Allowing Violence in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Forces
(TNI) Chief Gen. Wiranto Thursday said TNI and Indonesian Police
(Polri) had never let any kind of violence take place in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
"TNI and Polri have never let it happen. We have missions to
prevent and neutralize any kind of violence," Wiranto told
reporters here before attending a meeting with the House of
Representatives' Commission I.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who is also minister of defense and security, said
security matter in East Timor was the responsibility of TNI and
Polri.
</P>
<P>
"(Foreign Minister Ali) Alatas has reiterated that Indonesia is
responsible for East Timor's security affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to demands to have the presence of U.N. peacekeeping
force in East Timor, Wiranto said it was not easy to do that.
</P>
<P>
"There should be special reasons to bring up U.N. peacekeeping
force," he said, adding that the Indonesian government and its
security officers had had anticipation plans to face the worst
possible happening when the U.N.-sponsored direct ballot result is
announced.
</P>
<P>
He said news reports on the shooting incident at the U.N.
Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) Wednesday were exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
At least two people were reportedly killed in the latest
violence targeting at the UNAMET in Dili, capital of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"I had been informed by UNAMET Chairman and U.N. Special Envoy
for East Timor Jamsheed Marker about the incident," he said,
noting that the press needs to clarify the reports.
</P>
<P>
He, however, acknowledged that there was small-scale clash
between pro-autonomy and pro-independence supporters in the
region.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 98.6 percent of some 450,000 eligible
voters in East Timor cast their ballots on August 30.
</P>
<P>
The direct ballot will determine whether East Timor, a former
Portuguese colony, will enjoy wide-ranging autonomy within
Indonesia or get independence. East Timor integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move was never recognized by the United
Nations.

<HEADLINE> China's Unicom Stopping Joint Ventures Through Fair Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China United
Telecommunications Corporation (China Unicom) will terminate its '
China-China-foreign' ventures through fair negotiations based on
state laws and regulations, according to Yang Xianzu, China Unicom
's chairman, today.
</P>
<P>
This does not mean terminating cooperation with foreign
partners, he said, but is meant to help create conditions for new
cooperation that comply with government regulations and to avoid
losses caused by delays.
</P>
<P>
Unicom is China's second largest telecoms operator and began
using the CCF method to finance projects by getting a Chinese
company to set up a joint venture with a foreign company. The
joint venture would then enter into a cooperation contract with
China Unicom and back the construction of telecoms infrastructure,
primarily GSM networks. After the completion of the project, the
parties involved would share the profits from the project in
agreed upon amounts.
</P>
<P>
Unicom has signed 46 such cooperative contracts with foreign
ventures, 43 of them for GSM and fixed line projects, involving
about a billion U.S. dollars worth of capital.
</P>
<P>
Yang says that because of CCF irregularities and the fact that
it does not comply with the relevant government policies and
regulations, the ventures have had numerous problems, and China
Unicom and many of its CCF partners have agreed that this is not
an ideal way to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China Unicom began negotiating with foreign parties
for possibly terminating CCF ventures and reached an agreement
with some of them. On August 30 of this year, the Ministry of
Information Industries issued a statement saying that China Unicom
's CCF contracts with foreign businesses violated the current
government policies and regulations and needed to be corrected. It
asked China Unicom to study all the CCF ventures on a case-by-case
basis and to straighten them out by the end of September.

<HEADLINE> China's Students Need More Physical Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey by the China
Children's Research Center, Beijing Normal University, and Beijing
Publishing House found that over 70 percent of China's primary and
secondary school students get less than 3 hours of exercise per
week, or less than half an hour each day.
</P>
<P>
The survey started last October among primary and secondary
school students aged 10 to 18 in 10 provinces and municipalities.
It found that as the years go by students have less time for
physical exercise and some secondary school students do almost
none.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 percent of the primary school students said that they
have no time for exercise outside of P.E. classes and nearly 34
percent of the junior high and 42 percent of the senior high
students said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the survey reveals two problems: students
think that they have no need for physical exercise and the
pressure from studies causes them to give up exercise, and they
warn that these students need more exercise and a healthier
lifestyle.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Economist for Int'l Currency Trading Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- There should be
international regulations for currency trading, a Japanese
economist said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There should be some infrastructure surrounding currency
trading. There should be proper international regulations and a
more orderly state for currency trading," Eisuke Sakakibara,
special adviser to the minister of finance of Japan, said here at
the international symposium on currency controls and Asian
monetary cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, he regretted that there does not seem to be any desire
to bring about transformation in the global financial
architecture.
</P>
<P>
Currency trading is zero sum game, Sakakibara, who is known as
"Mr. Yen", said, adding currency trading is very volatile but the
trading could not be prohibited in the new emerging
cyber-capitalistic system.
</P>
<P>
"We have overcome the immediate crisis but the root cause of
the problem is still with us, that is, the inherent instability of
cyber-capitalism and serious convulsions associated with the
transition," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was very important for all to recognize that the
world is passing through a period of great transformation and in
order to adapt to this great transformation, a shift in paradigm
is clearly necessary.
</P>
<P>
The shift in paradigm from market fundamentalism or the
perception that government and market are substitutes to a regime
where national governments and regional and international
organizations complement and interact with the market seems in
order, he said.

<HEADLINE> Rare Coin Brings 4 million Dollars at Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The famous Childs specimen
of the 1804 Silver Dollar has been sold for a world record 4.14
million U.S. dollars at a New York auction, a collectibles grading
company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Collector Universe, the U.S. largest provider of
collectibles grading and authentication services, the previous
rare coin world record was held by the Eliasberg specimen of the
1804 Silver Dollar that sold for 1.8 million dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Childs and Eliasberg specimens of the 1804 dollar are among
eight so-called "original" pieces believed to have been struck in
the mid-1930s for inclusion in presentation sets prepared as gifts
from the U.S. seventh president Andrew Jackson to rulers in the
Far Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Collector Universe said that the Childs specimen had not
appeared on the market for more than half a century. It last came
up for sale in 1945 when it was purchased for 5,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In purchasing the coin in 1945, businessman Charles Childs was
expanding a collection beginning in 1870 by his grandfather,
Walter Childs. For a period of several decades in the 1800s and
early 1900s, Walter Childs bought proof coins each year from the
Philadelphia Mint. All of these coins remained in the family
collection through succeeding generations before being consigned
to the New York auction Monday.
</P>
<P>
In all the Childs sales included 803 lots and realized a total
of more than nine million dollars, according to Collector Universe.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Fires Rockets into Northern Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's leading anti-Israeli
group Hezbollah Wednesday night fired Katyusha rockets into
northern Israel to avenge the killing of two Lebanese civilians by
Israeli shelling.
</P>
<P>
About 25 rockets were fired into Kiryat Shemona in northern
Israel. There has been no reports about the casualties.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah's attack came after two Lebanese civilians were
killed in the Israeli shelling on the Labbaya village in the
country's western Bekka Valley on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Another five villagers were wounded in the bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Israel's offensive was triggered by a roadside bomb detonated
by Hezbollah near the village which killed at least five members
of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been
spearheading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli troops and their
allied SLA out of the country.
</P>
<P>
In June, Israeli warplanes heavily bombed Lebanon's
infrastructure and killed nine people after Hezbollah launched
Katyusha rockets into its north.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's two power plants and three key coastal bridges that
were destroyed in the June attack are still under repair and
residents in the capital and its environs have been suffering from
lack of electricity supply.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Teams Rushing to Plane Crash Scene in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. embassy staff and
Tanzanian officials are heading toward the scene where a plane
carrying ten U.S. tourists crashed, but reports about casualties
of the incident are not available at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Director of the United States Information Service in Tanzania,
Dudley Sims, told Xinhua Thursday morning that two persons from
the embassy have almost reached the scene, and will keep informing
progress of the rescue job hour in hour.
</P>
<P>
"They telephoned us at six this morning, saying that they are
half an hour (drive) from the scene. By now, they haven't ringed
us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another rescue group sent by U.S. embassy in Nairobi, Kenya,
is also rushing to the scene, Sims said.
</P>
<P>
The small charter plane was carrying the tourists from the
world-famous Serengeti National Park to the Kilimanjaro Airport in
northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
On board the Cessna aircraft, which went down some 12 miles
away from the 14,979-foot Mount Meru, the fifth highest in Africa,
also included a Tanzanian tour guide and a pilot.
</P>
<P>
Mount Meru, often surrounded by cloud, is a part of the Arusha
National Park located some 45 kilometers from the Arusha town in
the Arusha Region.
</P>
<P>
The Arusha Regional Commissioner, Daniel ole Njoolay, told
Xinhua that so far he has scanty information about the incident
but will keep following it.
</P>
<P>
The tourists included three couples and a group of four that
came from Florida, Massachusetts, Connecticut, California and New
Jersey, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Rescue efforts involving helicopters have started since
Wednesday after the plane crashed at around 10:20 a.m. local time
(0720GMT) but were hampered by foggy weather.
</P>
<P>
The Serengeti park draws tens of thousands of tourists every
year for its wide range of big game animals and the annual
migration of millions of wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Acting permanent secretary in the Ministry of Natural Resources
and Tourism R. P. Kabende left Tanzanian capital Thursday morning
for Arusha to handle issues related to the incident, said an
official with the ministry.

<HEADLINE> IT Firms in Malaysia Urged to Form Strategic Alliances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Thursday urged Malaysian and
foreign-owned information technology (IT) companies to form
strategic alliances and joint ventures for mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
"Sharing does not diminish competitiveness. In fact, it brings
together resources, which combined, can effectively progress and
prosper for mutual benefit," Abdullah said when launching WebHost
Asia at Cyberjaya near here.
</P>
<P>
He said his government has given its full support for the
development and growth of the IT industry in Malaysia by investing
in technology and infrastructure, and hoped that IT entrepreneurs
would focus on developing the industry from the ground-up by
taking advantage of the infrastructure provided.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see more local IT companies embarking on such
bold and innovative ventures and, at the same time, sharing their
technology with both local and foreign firms to enhance Malaysia's
role in the global digital revolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), a
50-kilometer by 15-kilometer zone stretching southwards from here
designated as a hub for the development of multimedia products and
services, offered unlimited opportunities for those willing to
work hard and use the opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He said the positive 4.1 percent growth of gross domestic
product (GDP) for the second quarter signaled that the worst was
over for Malaysia. "It also signifies that with renewed growth,
there will be more opportunities especially in the fast-growing
and ever-changing industry like IT in areas like e-commerce," he
said.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 1 (Xinhua) -- California exports to Asia
in the second quarter showed the first clear signs of a broad
recovery, reflecting Asia's astonishing comeback.
</P>
<P>
South Korea was the first major export country to bounce back,
and California shipments there rose by 37 percent in the second
quarter, according to data released Tuesday by the Massachusetts
Institute for Social and Economic Research.
</P>
<P>
However, the one lingering weakness in Asia is Japan. Shipments
there fell by 12 percent in the second quarter after a decline of
10 percent in the first quarter and a drop of 16 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
In all, California exports totaled 25.4 billion U.S. dollars in
the second quarter. California is the nation's leading exporter,
and merchandise shipments account for more than 10 percent of the
state's economic growth.

<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya may lose about 13,000
lives through road accidents by the end of this year, Health
Minister Jackson Kalweo has said.
</P>
<P>
It will be the highest death toll recorded in a single year
and will surpass the average annual rate of 2,000 deaths
registered since the late 1980s, the East African Standard

</P>
<P>
Addressing a nine-day course on " Spot Advanced Life Support"
held recently in the country's capital Nairobi, Kalweo disclosed
that 6,000 Kenyans had died from road accidents in the first seven
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The minister observed that 35 percent of those killed on road
were people aged between 15 and 45.
</P>
<P>
To counter the threat posed by various disasters, Kalweo said,
his ministry had placed various strategic interventions in the
National Health Sector Strategic Plan, covering the 1999-2004
period.

<HEADLINE> Inaugural Meeting to Launch EALAF Opens in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 officials from
27 East Asian and Latin American countries including China began
their two-day discussions Thursday to lay groundwork for the East
Asia-Latin America Forum (EALAF) mooted by Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Singapore Minister for
Foreign Affairs and Law S. Jayakkumar said the forum is not "a
talk shop" and asked participants to share some of the broad
ideas that lie behind the thinking of this new forum.
</P>
<P>
Listing the linkages built between different regions in the
world, such as Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the deep
trans-Atlantic links between Europe and North America, the
Organization of American States (OAS) and the Free Trade Area of
the Americas (FTAA) and the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) as well as
historical and other links between Europe and Latin America,
Jayakumar said the missing link is between East Asia and Latin
America and the gap prevents both regions from mutually exploiting
their enormous economic potential.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the forum is neither just about geography and
nor only about trade and economic, Jayakumar said "the lack of
understanding about regions that are, in reality, no longer far
flung created a latent instability in the international system."
</P>
<P>
"The lack of systematic historical contacts does give a certain
intrinsic value to dialogue to build greater common
understanding," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the post Cold War world has seen two
contradictory trends, adding that "the ever closer integration of
the global economy has not created greater international
cohesion."
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, globalisation has meant an ever greater
disconnect between economic geography, political geography,
financial geography and social and cultural geography," he added.
</P>
<P>
He made clear the project will be making progress step by step
and next year will see the convening of a meeting of foreign
ministers of the forum.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony on behalf of Latin America countries,
Ambassador Cristial Barros, head of the Chile delegation, said
Latin America expects to foster closer links with East Asia
countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his wish that "the forum will operates with full
independence from other existing intraregional or inter-regional
organization" and build a forum "whose nature is unique, where the
countries participate independently and not under the scheme of
regional blocs."
</P>
<P>
The project of the forum was first proposed by Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong during his visit to Chile in October 1998
and he conceived the forum as a multi-dimensional dialogue to help
break down barriers and encourage the evolution of more concrete
links between East Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister had said the potential of linking
the two regions is likely to take 10 years or more due to the lack
of historic contact, awareness and understanding between both
regions and the launch of the forum will thus be the start of a
long-term process to bring that synergy to fruition.

<P>
KATHMANDU, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Nepal is going to join hands
with Singapore on human resource development for service industry,
The Kathmandu Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The post quoted Narendra Bajracharya, first vice president of
Hotel Association Nepal (HAN) as saying that Singapore Hotel
Association is going to support a one-year diploma program in
hotel management in Nepal, which is to begin from the third week
of September.
</P>
<P>
Bajracharya, who returned home from a 15-day seminar on Hotel
and Catering Management held in Nadi, Fiji, said that due to lack
of well-trained staff, particularly in the hotel industry, quality
of service is deteriorating in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, in a changed globalized context, emerging tourism
industry is seeking efficient personnel along with new
technologies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bajracharya presented a working paper in the seminar. The paper
contained various issues on tourism industry, including service
quality improvement, human resource development, quality check
ups, upgrading existing facility, prevention of anti-social
activities, environment protection, ecology, licensing, consumer
protection act and so on.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Favors Proposed Asian Regional Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand Thursday
responded favorably to Japan's proposal to set up an Asian
Regional Fund.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi Thursday
described it as a working mechanism that can be acceptable to all
as well as functional in the context of the prevailing financial
market.
</P>
<P>
Although the proposal was shot down by the United States,
certain Asian countries seemed to be showing some favorable
response towards it, he said at the international symposium on
currency controls and Asian monetary cooperation here. His speech
was delivered by Sura Sanittanont, special advisor to the minister
of commerce of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"Sentiment towards such supplementary and complementary
arrangements have since become more accommodating," he said,
adding "this is evident by the fact that the Miyazawa fund of 30
billion U.S. dollars to assist affected countries was acceptable
to the United States, the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank."
</P>
<P>
Suggesting a case be made for the creation of a financial
safety net for the weaker and open economies in the Asia Pacific
region, Supachai said this would help these economies cope with
possible future financial crisis even when the United States is
unsure that IMF resources will be sufficient to deal with another
crisis of a similar magnitude.
</P>
<P>
He said the still unrecovered economies in Asia are not
equipped to deal with the volatility, uncertainty and disruptions
in the world financial market, and all these could cause another
financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Macao Airport Handles Record Number of Passengers in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Macao International Airport
handled a record number of passengers in August this year,
according to latest figures released by the airport authorities.
</P>
<P>
More than 257,600 passengers used the airport last month, the
biggest monthly figure since the airport went into operation four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
From January to August, the airport handled more than 1.75
million passengers, an increase of 21 percent over the same period
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The increase is believed to be partly the result of more
personnel exchanges between Macao and the mainland areas of China
as Macao is returning to the motherland at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, cargo transportation at the airport in August
plummeted by 34 percent from the same month of last year. The
airport witnessed booming cargo business in the summer of 1998 as
something was wrong with the new airport in neighboring Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Set Up Kosovo Relief Aid Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is considering
setting up a center to coordinate medical relief aid and missions
to help Kosovo war victims.
</P>
<P>
The proposed center would, among other things, coordinate
deployment of medical volunteers to help Kosovo recover from
prolonged ethnic conflicts, Bernama news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government is taking the initiative following feedback from
Malaysian medical teams whose Kosovo relief efforts were arranged
by a United States-based volunteer organization, Foreign Minister
Syed Hamid Albar said in the northern state of Kedah Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
"From the feedback we reckon that Kosovo is in dire need of
medical aid and the government, on its part, feels that it needs
to coordinate these voluntary medical missions," Syed Hamid was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry was studying the financial and other
implications of setting up such a center before making a
commitment.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, several other countries already have
such coordination centers run by non-government organizations and
governments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said that donations for the Kosovo
Action Fund by Malaysians and the government now totaling 4
million ringgit (over 1 million U.S. dollars) would be handed
over to Kosovo leaders soon for rebuilding and repairing damaged
schools and mosques.

<P>
WARSAW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Polish Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek Wednesday night announced that Janusz Tomaszewski was
removed from his posts as deputy Prime Minister and the Minister
of Internal Affairs and Administration.
</P>
<P>
Buzek did not appoint a successor, nor gave reasons for the
dismissal. Tomaszewski was the second minister removed from his
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
According to Polish Press Agency reports, Buzek called in
Tomaszewski in the evening to tell him that he was no longer
trusted and his assistance no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
Some people believed Tomaszewski was fired for his improper
reaction to whether he should receive a court investigation or not.
</P>
<P>
Tomaszewski, a former automobile mechanic and the vice-chairman
of the Solidarity Trade Union, took his office on October 31, 1996
when Buzek set up his cabinet. Since then, he had provoked much
criticism over his leadership, which some people said had led to "
chaos" in his ministry and a "terrible state of public security."
</P>
<P>
The polish political circle gave mixed reactions to his
dismissal. Some considered the move as "another government crisis",
while others proposed an institutional reform to divide the
current Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration into two
parts.

BELGRADE, September 1 (Xinhua)-- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic promised on Wednesday to free two Australians who were
arrested for espionage during the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Tanjug News Agency, Milosevic made
this promise at a meeting with a delegation of Serbian Australian
emigrants. The president said that in return for the great support
from 300,000 Serbian emigrants during NATO airstrikes, Yugoslavia
decided to accept the request by the delegation to release the two
Australians -- Prat and Valas.
</P>
<P>
The security organ of Yugoslavia destroyed the spy network
under the leadership of Prat this April. Yugoslavia accused them
of spying under the name of humanitarianism organization "Care
International".
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia arrested them on charges of collecting information
about the movement of Yugoslav police and troops and about the
bombing effects before and during the attacks. Australia has
demanded several times the release of Prat and Valas, but all
requests have been rejected by Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> India's Imports Rise Slightly in April-July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- India's imports were
estimated at 14.07 billion U.S. dollars in April-July, up by only
1.01 percent from the level of 13.93 billion U.S. dollars recorded
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the commerce ministry, oil imports during the
period stood at 2754.53 million U.S. dollars, 51.05 percent higher
than last year's 1923.58 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, non-oil imports stood at 11.31 billion U.S.
dollars, 6.53 percent lower than last year's 12.10 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the oil import zoom during the period was due
to the rise of oil prices in the global market.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Roman Catholic Church in Asia Discovered Near Silk Road (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first synod was held in Abinsm during the Yuan Dynasty (
1271-1368), and was attended by proximately 3,000 believers,
according to the Japanese archeologist.
</P>
<P>
An international team headed by the Chinese archeologist Huang
Wenbi discovered Abinsm over 70 years ago and identified it as the
residence of the chieftains of the Wanggu Tribe, a Turkic people
who helped Genghis Khan (1162-1227) unify the Mongolian tribes.
Abinsm was the tribe's capital and was known as the "Town of
Prince Zhao". Chieftains of eight generations of the Wanggu were
made prince of Zhao by Yuan emperors, the first of whom was Kublai
Khan (1215-1294), the grandson of Genghis Khan.
</P>
<P>
Abinsm was an important town on route to the Silk Road at that
time, but later declined in importance because of wars.
Archaeologists say that the rear of the church was a library,
beneath which they believe there could be many relics.

BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A recent poll shows that most
Chinese citizens think teachers are very important, though only
half of those surveyed said they would like their own children to
choose a teaching career.
</P>
<P>
The survey covered 4,575 residents in 11 cities including
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wuhan, and has just been released
at the beginning of the new semester.

to the survey, primary and secondary schools teaching is seen to
have extraordinary social significance, requiring devotion to duty.
</P>
<P>
More than 68 percent of those asked said "hard work" best
described a teacher's occupation, while 50.4 percent used the word
"important" when referring to the job.
</P>
<P>
Respondents also considered teachers "trustworthy," "kind," and
"serious".
</P>
<P>
The polling company divided 18 professions into four categories
depending on responses, and the teaching profession was ranked in
the third category - "moderately authoritative."

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Uzbek President Islam Karimov
said Wednesday that Russia and the Central Asian countries will
coordinate in fighting against terrorism, according to the reports
reaching here from Uzbek capital of Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
Karimov made the remarks while meeting Russian Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev who arrived in Tashkent Wednesday for talks on the
current crisis in southern Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Karimov also urged Russia to actively
participate in settling the crisis, saying the armed conflicts
there are not merely terrorist activities but a result of the long-
term complicated situation in the central Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev replied that Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan,
Tajikstan and Russia must joint efforts in solving the problem and
coordinate in fighting against extremism and terrorism, according
to the reports.
</P>
<P>
"There exists a mechanism among the Central Asian countries for
mutual assistance -- the collective security agreement of the
Commonwealth of Independent States," said Sergeyev, hinting that
the crisis could be solved under this agreement.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev announced that Russia and the four Central Asian
countries have established an action group to plan on the anti-
terrorist fight.
</P>
<P>
In the past month, a great number of armed terrorists
infiltrated into southern Kyrgyzstan from Tajikstan, and also
attempted to further infiltrate into Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
They have held one senior Kyrgyz military officer and four
Japanese hostage.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Sports Council to Propose Review of Sports in State Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) plans to recommend the House of Representatives to
review their vision for national sports development in the next
state guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Enny Hardjanto, KONI's official in charge of media and
promotion,said the council would ask House members to prioritize
athlete achievement instead of targeting to become overall
champions.
</P>
<P>
"The policy should be changed. We should focus on grooming the
athletes to be recordbreakers rather than overall champions," she
said on the sidelines of a meeting here on Wednesday to evaluate
Indonesia's show at the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei
Darussalam last August.
</P>
<P>
Enny said that the government should show more political will
to support national sports development, particularly in funding
training.
</P>
<P>
"The governments from other Southeast Asian countries like
Thailand and Malaysia give their full support for athlete
development. Both countries have substantial training programs.
Here, we do not have a program or the government's commitment,"
she was quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia bowed out to archrival Thailand and overall runner-up
Malaysia in the SEA Games, taking home 44 golds, 43 silvers and 58
bronzes, which was less than its estimated 70 golds.
</P>
<P>
KONI officials earlier blamed the athletes' performance at the
Games on the short-term training period and shortage of funds
which had prevented athletes from going overseas for training.
</P>
<P>
Enny said that KONI would put certain sports on top of the list
for training for the 2001 SEA Games and the 2002 Asian Games in
Pusan, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"In the near future, we will determine which athletes should be
sent to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney and what their medal targets
are. After that, we will arrange a strategy to prepare our
athletes for the 2001 SEA Games and 2002 Asian Games," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also said that KONI would pursue a bid to host the 2006
Asian Games despite public criticism for its failure to prioritize
the money for athlete development instead.
</P>
<P>
"Sports is a long-term effort. If we don't host the Asiad, we
will not have a second chance because other Asian countries have
better athletes. Besides, being a host will also improve our
economy," she said.

HELSINKI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi on Wednesday expressed hope for further
development in his country's relations with the European Union (EU)
.
</P>
<P>
Iran would like to hold another round of talks with the EU
within the current Finnish term of the rotating EU presidency in
order to improve bilateral ties, Kharrazi told a press conference
after meeting with his Finnish counterpart Tarja Halonen.
</P>
<P>
"We have made progress in talks with the European Union. Our
two sides set up working panels discussing issues include energy,
environment, drugs, industry and investment. We just hope all
these will lead up to the signing of agreements eventually," said
the Iranian foreign minister, who arrived here Wednesday for a two-
day visit.
</P>
<P>
Halonen said that she is satisfied with the improvement
achieved in cooperation between Iran and the EU.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the two ministers focused on issues
including the Middle East peace process, arms control, human
rights and the EU dialogue with the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-EU ties bottomed with the EU members withdrawing
their ambassadors in 1997 summer when Tehran protested over a
German court verdict linking Iranian top leaders with a terrorist
bombing in a Berlin restaurant several years ago.
</P>

The Iranian foreign minister is scheduled to meet with Finnish
President Martti Ahtisaari, parliament speaker Riita Uosukainen

PYONGYANG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The General Staff
Headquarters of the Korean People's Army (KPA) declared its
maritime military control zone off western Korea on Thursday, one
day after Pyongyang and Washington failed to agree on demarcating
a maritime boundary, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The KPA at the same time declared as invalid the "plunderous"
Northern Limit Line, which was unilaterally drawn by the United
States at the end of the Korean War in 1953 and which was never
recognized by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the DPRK would exercise its self-defense right
over the military boundary on the sea "by various means and
methods."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, DPRK and U.S. negotiators failed to reach any
agreement in the sixth round of general-level talks since the
naval forces from the Republic of Korea (ROK) and DPRK exchanged
gun fire off the Korean Peninsula's west coast on June 15.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK government ruled out further general-level talks with
the United States on the maritime boundary issue, condemning the U.
S. for lacking the necessary sincerity in solving the boundary
dispute between the north and south.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Favors Free Market Without Currency Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday Malaysia is not disloyal to free
market if currency trading is disallowed.
</P>
<P>
The free market can still function without currency trading and
without adverse effects on real trade and foreign investments
flowing into productive sectors, he said at a symposium here on
the first anniversary of the capital controls imposed by Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is being attended by some 500 participants
including Eisuke Sakakibara, special adviser to the finance
minister of Japan, Amar Bhattacharya, senior adviser to the World
Bank and Heiner Flassbeck, former vice-finance minister of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that for a long time, there was no currency
trading while world trade grew economically and fixed exchange
rates enabled values to be attached to goods and services.
</P>
<P>
"We in Malaysia feel that we are not disloyal to the free
market if we disallow currency trading. Our real trade should not
be affected nor should foreign investment in productive capacities
suffer," Mahathir said in his keynote address focusing on why
Malaysia's selective currency controls are necessary and why they
have worked.
</P>
<P>
He said selective capital controls were successful because they
were a soft system, as Managing Director of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus had said.
</P>
<P>
Another reason why Malaysia was very successful was because of
its export drive whereby foreign exchange came in by the buckets,
Mahathir said. "There was no shortage of foreign exchange and
there was no liquidity problem."
</P>
<P>
A third reason for the success is the fact that Malaysia is
very sincerely trying to guarantee the stability of the Malaysian
ringgit, not its value, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted a fixed rate, not a high rate for the ringgit. For
Malaysia, it succeeded because it sought to stabilize the ringgit
at a reasonable level, not at an overvalued level for technical
stabilization reasons and because Malaysia always had its exports
and national competitiveness at the forefront," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia pegged the ringgit to the U.S. dollar at a rate of
3.80 in early September last year among the selective capital
controls.
</P>
<P>
"Another reason was that "with this single bold step,
confidence in the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), the ringgit
and in the real economy was quickly restored," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Without this rapid, almost overnight restoration of
confidence, we could not have succeeded," he added.
</P>
<P>
To be sure, some external factors helped a great deal, Mahathir
said, adding that the currency stabilization in East Asia and the
economic recovery in East Asian economies have been a great help.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that Malaysia has been able to achieve what
others have achieved without having to go into massive debts,
without saddling future generations with massive debt servicing
burdens, without having to sell family silver and precious
heirlooms, without having to auction off precious corporations to
foreigners with fire-sale prices, without having to bend and bow
to anyone and without having to kiss anyone's feet.

<P>
He said that the economies of East Asia are all different, so
comparisons are often difficult and unfair.
</P>
<P>
"But most surely, each country has the right to decide on its
priorities and to choose its own path to recovery. And most
obviously, the unorthodox, bold and strong measures which we took
366 days ago have borne fruit," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is well on the road to recovery as the economy
recorded a 4.1-percent gross domestic product growth in the
second quarter this year after a contraction of five consecutive
quarters.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian economy, hit by the Asian financial crisis since
July 1997, had a negative growth of 6.7 percent in 1998.

<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Total merchandise export of the

percent higher than last year's 2.501 billion dollars, a report of
the National Statistics Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, total export receipts for the period

dollars from 16.406 billion dollars recorded during the same
period last year.

<P>
For July alone, electronics and components, accounting for 53.4
percent of the aggregate receipts, valued at 1.522 billion
dollars, 27.5 percent higher than the 1.194 billion dollars of
July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Input/output peripheral units emerged as the country's second
biggest earner for the month with sales amounting to 236.87
million dollars, an increase of 32.3 percent over 1998's 178.99
million dollars, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured goods netted 2.603 billion dollars in July, up
from 2.193 billion dollars a year earlier, posting an 18.7-percent
upswing in receipts and accounting for 91.3 percent of the
aggregate earning.
</P>
<P>
Agro-based products ranked second among the country's major
export groups and accounted for 4.2 percent of the total
dollar-inflow for the month even as sales fell by 32.1 percent to
119.45 million dollars from 175.81 million dollars the same month
last year.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that exports to the United States grew by 6.6
percent to 992.74 million dollars from 931.57 million dollars a
year earlier and accounted for 34.8 percent of the total receipts.
</P>
<P>
Japan remained at the second spot with a 13.7-percent share.
Sales to Japan rose by 9.0 percent to 391.55 million dollars from

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Young Shuttlers Advised to Overcome Mental Obstacles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) training director Christian Hadinata said
Indonesian players must overcome psychological barriers during a
certain period in their careers.
</P>
<P>
Christian was commenting on the poor performances of two
Indonesian shuttlers in Sanyo Indonesia Open, currently held in
Denpasar, capital of Bali province.
</P>
<P>
The two athletes, Yudi Suprayogi and Jeffer Rosobin, both made
first-round exits from the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"Jeffer began to play well several years ago. We thought he
could eventually take over for the veteran players. Apparently he
was unable to break through that psychological barrier of becoming
a top player, and he wasn't really sure about which way he wanted
to go -- to success or failure," he was quoted by The Jakarta Post
Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jeffer lost to Malaysia's Yap Yong Jyen 15-12, 14-17, 11-15 for
the second time in as many meetings. The pair first met in the
Malaysia Open. Yudi also bowed out to Malaysian shuttler Jason
Wong, 11-15, 3-15.
</P>
<P>
"Jeffer should have been able to take control during the
critical points due to his experience. Unfortunately, he wasted
his chances, particularly in the second set when he was really
close to victory, leading 14-13 and holding serve," Christian said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about Yudi, Christian blamed the young player's lack
of experience as the main factor in his loss to the Malaysian.
</P>
<P>
Yudi lost 11-15, 3-15 to Jason Wong from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"Yudi must change his monotonous play by better covering the
court and improving the accuracy of his shots," he said.
</P>
<P>
Christian said Taufik Hidayat, the All England runner-up,
Singapore Open
finalist and Southeast Asian Games gold medalist, was someone who
could deal with the pressure of being a top player.
</P>
<P>
He said Taufik's teammates Ronny Agustinus and Johan Hadi
Kusuma were nearing this same level of maturity.
</P>
<P>
"Ronny and Johan are only one step away from being prepared to
become top players. Some players were stuck in the same
circumstance for some time, but
finally managed to break the barrier, including Joko Supriyanto,
Hendrawan and Budi Santoso," he said.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, when they broke the barrier, they were too old
for long-term glory, he added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Strong Yen, Good or Bad for Asia? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese yen has been
climbing to new highs against the U.S. dollar during recent
trading sessions, but the potential effects of a strong yen on
Asian economies are yet to be felt.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Japanese yen maintained its 109 level against
the greenback in trading, still the highest in seven months.
</P>
<P>
But the continuous rise of the yen in the past week has failed
to lift Asian currencies much, as the regional markets were
dragged down by the U.S. Federal Reserve System's move to raise
U.S. interest rates on August 24.
</P>
<P>
As Japan is other Asian nations' major trade partner, the yen's
rebound is crucial to the region's economic comeback. A year ago,
when the Japanese yen started to surge again after falling beyond
140 to the dollar, its rally supported Asian currencies and
allowed the crisis-stricken nations to cut interest rates.
</P>
<P>
But now, Asia's economic recovery is already on track and the
yen's appreciation does not have the same effect on Asian
currencies as it did a year ago. To maintain their export
competitiveness, Asian countries would rather keep their
currencies relatively weak.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the peso declined to 39.87 to the dollar
last week, a 10-month low, after the central bank cut its key
policy rates 20 times earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Central Bank of the Philippines did not
intervene. Instead, Central Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura said
that his bank would be comfortable with an exchange rate between
38.50 and 38.90 pesos against the dollar this year.
</P>
<P>
Just like the Philippines, other Asian countries do want to
take advantage of relatively weak currencies to stimulate export
growth.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, the authorities are expected to prevent any
significant appreciation of the won, which was trading around
1,180 to the dollar recently.
</P>
<P>
"For South Korea, which is coming out of a very very deep
recession, maintaining a stable inflation, interest rate and
exchange rate environment is clearly conducive to producing a
sustainable economic recovery," said Duncan Woolridge, senior
economist at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
For such purposes, Asian countries would like to see a strong
yen, because the yen's up trend will give them a competitive edge
over Japan in the global export market, and increase Japan's
demand for export products from other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"The yen's strength is clearly positive for Asian exports. You
are starting to see the effects coming through now. Asian exports
to Japan are picking up strongly," said Rob Subbaraman, an
economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, economists said, a strong yen would benefit
Asia with more Japanese investments in the region, where countries
are badly in need of more foreign investments to speed up the
recovery process.
</P>
<P>
But in the long run, the strong yen, which would cause a
slowdown in the Japanese recovery, will hurt Asian economies. The
steady surge in the yen has already started eating into profits of
Japan's biggest companies and threatens to hold back the chances
of a swift economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that if the yen averages at 113 to the dollar or
higher in the fiscal year ending next march then there will be no
growth in corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
When the Japanese economy begins to slow down because of the
strong yen, it will affect Japan's domestic demand for Asian
products, and Asian economies will then be hurt, they said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the strong yen is good for Asia only in the short
term, but bad for the region in the longer term.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Roman Catholic Church in Asia Discovered Near Silk Road (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A 700-year-old church site
discovered on a route to the old Silk Road is believed to be the
site of the earliest Roman Catholic church in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The church was located in a town known as Abinsm, meaning "a
place with many temples" in Mongol, about 190 kilometers north of
the city of Baotou in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The
remaining walls are about five meters high. There was believed to
be a 100-square-meter main hall with two rostrums four to five
meters high at one end.
</P>
<P>
Shattered around are quite a lot of white glazed tiles and
other tiles with decorations that were popular in Ancient Rome.
Chinese archeologists had been hesitant to reach a conclusion
about the church's origins until recently when they found a white
stone lion under the ruins. The 16-centimeter lion does not
resemble traditional Chinese stone lions and is more like those in
front of Catholic churches in Italy.
</P>
<P>
This is enough to show that this church's origins are similar
to those of Catholic churches in the West, according to
archeologist Gai Shanlin in Inner Mongolia.

<HEADLINE> Nokia, Reuters Team up to Develop News Services on Mobile Phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Nokia and Reuters have signed
a global cooperation agreement to develop and deliver financial,
sports and general news services based on the Wireless Application
Protocol (WAP).
</P>
<P>
The news services are optimized for Nokia 7110, the world's
first mobile phone for Internet access launched early this year.
</P>
<P>
The services have been developed to work with the Nokia
Messaging Platform and are currently available to operators
participating in Nokia WAP pilots.
</P>
<P>
With the WAP system making bitmap imaging possible, the Reuters
logo, featured as a wireless bitmap, will appear on the phone
display when it enters the service.
</P>
<P>
"The delivery of Reuters news and information services via WAP-
based phones is a strategic objective of ours," said Jonathan
Bailem, managing director of Reuters Wireless Services.
</P>
<P>
"Combined with Reuters' position as a global source of content
delivery, Nokia enables the mobile information society, bringing
news to everyone's pocket," said Pekka Salonoja, vice President of
Nokia Wireless Data Server Systems.
</P>
<P>
"Nokia now has over 20 WAP pilots worldwide with innovative
operators. Reuters news services are an important addition to the
services currently offered," he added.
</P>
<P>
The WAP standard includes a wide range of value-added services
for mobile phones, such as Internet access and data and images
transmitting.

<HEADLINE> New WTO Chief Pledges to Facilitate China's Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The new director-general of the
World Trade Organization (WTO), Mike Moore, pledged here Wednesday
to do what he can to help China join the world trading bloc as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
China, as a world power, has to sit at the table one day, Moore
told reporters, adding,"I'll do anything I can to facilitate China
's membership."
</P>
<P>
China has negotiated for 13 years with WTO members on
conditions for its accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Moore also promised to help the poorest countries when he
officially took office earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
"The very poor, the (48) least-developed countries, still don't
get the access they need for their products and the technical
assistance to fully engage, so that they can sit at the table of
our global family and share equally and fully," the former New
Zealand prime minister said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The new WTO chief called on the richer countries to play their
part by opening their own markets to goods from poorer regions,
saying "it would not cost rich nations much to wipe away barriers
for the poorest countries."
</P>
<P>
Moore said that addressing the plight of the poorest members
had to be a key element of the agenda for the WTO's third
Ministerial Conference in the U.S. west coast city of Seattle
scheduled for November 30 to December 3.
</P>
<P>
Moore and Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand were chosen as the
WTO's next two consecutive leaders by the ruling General Council
on July 22.
</P>
<P>
Moore will head the WTO until August 31, 2002 when he will be
replaced by Supachai who will also serve a three-year term until
August 31, 2005.
</P>
<P>
At the decision-making meeting on July 22, WTO members agreed
that neither should be eligible for re-appointment as WTO chief,
nor should the period of office be extended.
</P>
<P>
Normally, the term of office of the WTO chief is four years as
former WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero had served.
</P>
<P>
The decision was a compromise based on proposals by Bangladesh
and Australia after a year-long dispute among WTO members on who
would succeed Ruggiero. Ruggiero left office as scheduled on April
30, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Host Int'l Construction Fair, Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to host South
Asia's first international exhibition and conference on the
construction industry in November, organizers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The event "Build Int Asia'99" between November 9 and 12 will
provide a unique opportunity for potential investors in
construction and real estate as well as buyers and sellers in
these sectors, said a spokesman for the organizers.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition and conference are supported by the government
and promoted by JPR International (Pvt.) Ltd., a recently
incorporated professional exhibition and convention organizer.
</P>
<P>
The events are expected to bring more than 250 local and
foreign exhibitors and over 40,000 visitors, the spokesman said,
adding that they have sought the assistance of 42 Sri Lankan
missions overseas to help create awareness about the event and
promote participation.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the exhibition and conference is "Homes for the
People and Land for Urban Development."
</P>
<P>
As the Sri Lankan government plans to build 10,000 flats for
slum and shanty dwellers, a huge market for suppliers is expected
to open up and large areas of urban land will be released for
development.
</P>
<P>
The visitors expected to the event include construction sector
professionals such as civil engineers, interior designers,
contractors, builders and architects and students and the general
public.
</P>
<P>
The conference, scheduled for November 10, will be attended by
international and local speakers who will review, assess and
promote future policies and strategies in urban development,
housing and construction.

YINCHUAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China's reform and opening up
policies which were introduced at the end of 1978 provided
opportunities for the country's Moslem Hui ethnic people, well-
known for being smart business people and brought their talents
into full play.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xuegui, a Hui farmer in Laoheqiao Village of Lingwu City in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, sells over 1,000
kg of mutton and beef wholesale to Tianjin and Beijing every day.
</P>
<P>
Ma currently earns 50,000 yuan (about 6,024 U.S. dollars) a
year and has just built a new two-story house to replace his
former mud and brick hut. His five-member family now has all the
popular modern household appliances and a car.
</P>
<P>
"It's the policy of the market economy that has made me
affluent," Ma said with emotion. Before he started as a
businessman in the late 1980s, the annual income of Ma's family
was about 1,000 yuan (about 120 U.S. dollars ) a year from a small
plot of land.
</P>
<P>
The Laoheqiao market, which was formed on the basis of the
village 14 years ago, is now China's largest mutton and beef
wholesale market for Moslems.
</P>
<P>
Every year, about 35,000 sheep, 30,000 cows and nearly 400
camels are slaughtered in the market, and nearly 300 Huis are
engaged in this work.
</P>
<P>
The Huis are descendants of Arabs and Persians who came to
China to trade after the seventh century. There are now some 9
million in China, and nearly 2 million live in Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
The Huis are well-known for being good at business. However,
business was usually looked down upon in ancient times. Before the
founding of new China in 1949, the Huis were not even recognized
by the rulers as an ethnic group.

<P>
SANTIAGO September 1 (Xinhua) -- Chile's copper production has
reached 2.156 million tons this year, a 20.2 percent increase over
the same period of last year, Chile's Copper Commission said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The copper production of Chile, the world's first copper
producer and exporter, in 1998 stood at 3.689 million tons, and
the copper giant is expected to produce over 4 million tons by the
end of 1999.

<P>
China's reform and opening up policies encouraged many Huis to
engage in business to secure a better living.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays in Tongxin County, the most populous county in Ningxia,
one-third of the Hui people are engaged in various kinds of
businesses. In Xihaigu Prefecture, the poorest area of the region,
even women of the Hui nationality, who are used to being confined
to their homes, are now actively engaged in business, and half of
the prefecture's 200,000 Hui ethnic business women have become
affluent.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Ningxia has set up over 300 commodity markets and
over 1,000 various kinds of specialized markets and trading
agencies, with business turnover exceeding over 4 billion yuan (
about 480 million U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The number of the region's individual and privately owned
enterprises now has reached nearly 100,000, employing over 170,000
people.
</P>
<P>
Jingyuan County at the foot of Liupan Mountain, where Hui
ethnic people make up for 96 percent of the local population, has
been built into one of the country's key cow-breeding bases.
</P>
<P>
A meat processing plant has been built which slaughters 15,000
cows and process 1,800 tons of beef and related products a year.
At present, the output of animal husbandry accounts for one-third
of Ningxia's agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
After years of development, many Hui entrepreneurs have emerged,
and the region's first listed company, the Ningxia Minzu
Petrochemical Group, is now the largest dicyandiamide production
base in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia also has become one of the world's three major tantalum
production bases. Four of every ten mobile phones in the world are
manufactured with products produced by the Ningxia Nonferrous
Metal Smeltery.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia now also has established trade and economic cooperation
ties with more than 60 countries and regions.

JINAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province in east China
is planning an economic and trade fair from October 9 to 12 in the
city of Liaocheng to help the western part of the province to
attract more domestic and overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The largest project available reportedly will need one billion
yuan (about 120 million U.S. dollars) worth of investment.
</P>
<P>
There will be a symposium on agricultural development,
scientific and technological cooperation, urban construction, as
part of the fair.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Hails China As Model Developing Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China has been a successful
model of development with its economic reforms over the past two
decades, Rubens Ricupero, Secretary-General of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), said in a recent
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said China's economic achievements since the founding of the
republic 50 years ago and particularly since its implementation of
the opening-up policy some 20 years ago have enhanced the
confidence of other developing countries in seeking their own
social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
With an annual economic increase of 9.8 percent in the past 20
years, China is one of the few dynamic economies in the world with
both rapid and sustained growth, Ricupero said.
</P>
<P>
In foreign trade, China's annual exports have shot up to 184
billion U.S. dollars from only 1 billion dollars in 1979.
According to the 1998 ranking list by the World Trade Organization
(WTO), China was the world's fifth largest exporter and sixth
largest importer.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero said that he was deeply impressed with the speed of
the foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into China. Some 20
years ago, he recalled, the FDI to China was nearly zero. But the
latest UNCTAD report showed that China has been the top FDI
recipient among developing countries since 1992. By June 1999,
China has received a total of 286 billion dollars worth of the FDI.
</P>
<P>
"Facts and figures speak louder than words," said Ricupero. "It
's almost unnecessary to make further comments."
</P>
<P>
As the only permanent member from the developing world in the
UN Security Council, Ricupero said that China is the most reliable
supporter for any UN policy about the promotion of the development
of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the step-by-step way in which China has been
carrying out its economic reforms in accordance with its own
circumstances has not only set a good example for other developing
countries but also contributed to the whole international
community.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero said that he is pleased with his organization's close
and cooperative relationship with China. As the UNCTAD chief, he
paid several visits to China and witnessed China's amazing changes
brought by the reforms.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident in China's economic prospects," he said, noting
that it would still be deemed a great success if China could keep
its growth rate at 6-7 percent following a continuous annual
growth of about 10 percent during the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero said that the next century is a knowledge-based
century and that he hopes China would make further efforts to
strengthen education and improve the quality of its massive labor
force to create more favorable conditions to compete in the 21st
century.

BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
"People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- President Jiang Zemin told Chinese police force yesterday
that "maintaining stability is the overwhelming priority."
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission,
praised the police force for their proven reliability in the
ongoing struggle of maintaining social security. And he encouraged
them to make continued efforts to create favorable conditions for
reform and development.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a ceremony to highlight police work,
where he met model police officers and relatives of those who have
sacrificed their lives in the course of their duties.
</P>
<P>
-- Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
said yesterday that educating party officials in line with the
requirements of the "three stresses" must be carried out to the
letter.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks while attending the opening ceremony of a
new semester of the Party School of the CPC Central Committee, of
which he is also president.
</P>
<P>
The "three stresses" involves underlining and strengthening
theoretical study, political awareness, and good conduct.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

newly-appointed ambassadors to China at the Great Hall of the
People yesterday.

Joseph Mokotj of Lesotho.
</P>

session of the Kuomintang's 15th Congress" passed the resolution
to "set the tone" of the cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
His move of including the "two states" remarks into party
resolution exposed his political malice and naivety as well as his
intention to split Chinese territorial integrity and sovereignty
and an attempt to separate Taiwan from China, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
"China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Chinese President

relations.

passed an amendment to the law on Monday. The amendment is
expected to reduce the incentive to save and lessen the banks'
burden of having to pay out large sums of accumulated interest,
according to lawmakers.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Trade Deficit Increases Year After Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's trade deficit has
been increasing year after year since 1997, according to the
latest Economic Indicators issued by the Central Statistical
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar imported 762 million U.S. dollars' worth of commodities
 in the first four months of this year, while exporting 399
million dollars' worth of goods, producing a trade deficit of 363
million dollars in the period.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, there was a trade deficit of 1.686 billion dollars as
the import amounted to 2.824 billion dollars while the export went
to 1.137 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the trade deficit amounted to 1.22 billion dollars as
the import stood 2.122 billion dollars while the export
represented 902 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's year-by-year increase of trade deficit is due mainly
to being unitary of its export items which are restricted to
cover only agricultural and marine products, timber and primary
products.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem arising from the trade deficit in the
past years, Myanmar, on the one hand, encourages entrepreneurs to
produce import-substitute goods, while, on the other hand, making
efforts to expand the range of export goods, add non-traditional
commodities such as natural gas in export items and increase the
export quota of processed and manufactured goods to enable its
export goods value-added.

ULAN BATOR, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's new government
was formed Wednesday after the powerful one-chamber legislature,
State Great Hural, decided to retain almost all the former cabinet
ministers led by Janlaviin Narantsatsralt.

However, the law-making body did not retain the judiciary
minister, only keeping Logiin Tsog in an acting capacity.
</P>
<P>
State Great Hural voted to dismiss former prime minister
Narantsatsralt and his eight-month-old government on July 22 and
later elected Rinchinnyamiin Amarjargal as his successor on July
30.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Woman Dedicated to Weather Forecasting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: This year marks the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Xinhua News
Agency is releasing a series of stories about 50 Chinese men and
women, young and old, who will describe their own experiences and
how they fit into the changes that have taken place in the past
five decades in China. This is the 12th story.
</P>
<P>
LHASA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Travelers who fly to Tibet must
have noticed that all the landings and take-offs at Lhasa airport,
the capital of the autonomous region, are carried out in the early
hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
This is because of the turbulent and changing climate on this
mountainous plateau which has an average altitude of more than 4,
000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasting, therefore, is seen as one of the most
difficult and challenging jobs in Tibet. That's why Pubu Zhuoma, a
47-year old ethnic Tibetan woman, has become such a celebrity
figure for the local people.
</P>
<P>
Zhuoma is one of the first Tibetan women working in this field
and moreover, she is the first Tibetan weather forecaster who has
gained national recognition thanks to her own efforts.
</P>
<P>
In 1969, Zhuoma first had a taste of fame for being good at
studying the works of the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong. One year
later, she left the countryside, where she labored as a "re-
educated youth", like many of her contemporaries, and was assigned
to work in the regional meteorological bureau as a telegraphist.
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterwards, she began to learn the skill of weather
forecasting from experts and even local herders who have an innate
understanding of climatic changes. And the girl was so involved in
this meteorological work that she had turned down several
invitations to study other subjects in university.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Zhuoma's dream came true when she was admitted to
Yunnan University to study her beloved subject. Three years later,
she returned to the regional meteorological bureau to work as a

<HEADLINE> Hingis Breezes into Third Round at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- One day after the men's side
of the U.S. Open was rocked by the exit of Pete Sampras and
Patrick Rafter, top seed Martina Hingis of Switzerland left little
room for drama on the women's end.
</P>
<P>
Hingis breezed into the third round with a 6-1, 6-1 win over
Sarah Pitkowski of France today at the $14.5 million grand slam
event here.
</P>
<P>
World No. 1 Sampras and two-time defending champion Rafter were
forced to withdraw rom the tournament Tuesday with injuries,
leaving the top half of the men's draw wide open. Meanwhile, the
women's draw has been more true to form with 15 of the 16 seeded
players still alive.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Hingis needed just 46 minutes to dismiss
Pitkowski, and was grateful to have such an easy second-round
match.
</P>
<P>
"I prefer it once in a while. It's nice," Hingis said. "Because
the other tournaments are tough. All the best players are there,
you have to take every single round seriously. But here at a Grand
Slam, till you get in the better rounds, it's nice to have a match
like that."
</P>
<P>
Third-seed Venus Williams of the United States attempts to stay
on course for a possible semifinal meeting with Hingis when she
faces Anne-Galle Sidot of France tonight.
</P>
<P>
Williams, regarded as one of the favorites to win her first
Grand Slam singles title, crushed Belarussian qualifier Tatiana
Poutchek 6-1, 6-2 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Also advancing today were 10th seed and 1994 champion Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario of Spain, who easily defeated Nicole Pratt of
Australia 6-2, 6-2; 12th seed Barbara Schett of Austria, who
downed Sweden's Asa Carlsson 6-4, 6-2; No. 13 Dominique Van Roost
of Belgium beat Italy's Rita Grande 6-3, 6-3; and 15th seed Amelie
Mauresmo of France downed South African Mariaan De Swardt 4-6, 6-1,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
In the other second-round match involving seeded women, No. 8
Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic connected on just 39 percent of
her first serves but still was able to dispose of Slovenia's Tina
Krizian 6-0, 6-3 in one hour.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Houston Comets and New
York Liberty renew acquaintances Thursday night when they battle
in Game One of the best-of-three WNBA Finals at Madison Square
Garden here.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time in three years these teams are meeting
for the title. Houston gained the first of its two straight
championships with a victory over New York in a one-game series 65-
51 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
These clubs split two games this season with the home team
winning each time. Houston leads the all-time series 6-4 and holds
a 4-1 mark home-court record. New York's only triumph came in its
first visit on June 26. 1997.
</P>
<P>
Houston is paced by two-time regular season and playoff MVP
Cynthia Cooper. She scored 23 points and dished out a postseason
record 12 assists in the clinching game over the Los Angeles
Sparks for the Western Conference title. Sheryl Swoopes also added
23 points.
</P>
<P>
New York got here on the strength of its Eastern Conference
finals win over the Charlotte Sting in three games. Teresa
Weatherspoon personally carried the club to victory.
</P>
<P>
She averaged 12.5 points during the two victories in New York
and made sure the raucous home crowd stayed that way throughout
the series.
</P>
<P>
The home team is 4-0 all-time in the finals and the last three
best-of-three series have seen the home club win each time. The
next two contests are in Houston. Game Two is Saturday and Game
Three, if necessary, is Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Museum of Overpasses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has been turned into a
virtual museum of overpasses, with some 200 now in the metropolis
following the completion of several modern ones in advance of the
country's National Day which falls on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's flyovers are plentiful, large, of high quality, and
come in a variety of shapes, some cloverleafs, some round, and
others of a rhombus design.
</P>
<P>
The new flyovers newly built or reconstructed this year include
the four-layer "Sihui Bridge" with an area of 110,000 square
meters in east Beijing, and the rainbow-like Dabeiyao junction
leading to the embassy compound.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's first three overpasses, the Baifu, the Balizhuang,
and the Chedaogou, were completed in 1966. And the cloverleaf at
Fuxingmen junction, the first one in Beijing, was open to traffic
in 1974, while the three-layer Jianguomen overpass, the first with
separate lanes for bikes and autos, was completed in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the rapid growth of
overpasses, when the 33-km-long Second Ring Road and the 48-km-
long Third Ring Road were built to ease traffic congestion in
downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Overpasses have helped form a traffic system combining public
and cargo vehicles and railways, " said Zhang Ren, deputy chief
engineer with the Beijing Municipal Design and Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the number of automobiles has climbed to
more than 1.3 million now, compared with 400,000 a decade ago.

<HEADLINE> British Soldiers on Drunken Rampage in Italy's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of Sorrento, the famous
resort on Italy's south coast, has ordered a two-day ban on
alcohol sales after 400 drunken British soldiers caused havoc in
the town Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Two of the soldiers, on leave after a six-month stint in
Kosovo, stole a car and hurtled around Sorrento's quaint streets,
injuring two residents before they were caught and arrested by
police.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 British soldiers aboard four ships came to port in
Naples recently and Tuesday night chose Sorrento, a short ride
down the coast, to release their pent-up tensions.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 were reported to have gone on a pub crawl around
Sorrento's several English-style pubs and to have become deeply
drunk, causing confusion and some trepidation throughout the
night.
</P>
<P>
The two soldiers who went on a joy ride went to court Wednesday
and were given suspended eight-month jail sentences and fines of
one million lire (about 550 dollars).

<HEADLINE> S. African Athletic Group to Draw up Plan After Dismal World Champs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua)-- Athletics South Africa
ASA) is to formulate a plan to prevent a repeat of the dismal
performance by its World Championship team which returned to
Johannesburg on Wednesday with only one medal.
</P>
<P>
"We're going back to the drawing board," ASA CEO Banele Sindani
said. "We have to take stock of what happened and what did not
happen," he added, saying ASA would get more involved in athletes'
preparations ahead of major events.
</P>
<P>
"More involvement from ASA is needed. We are going to take an
active participation in an athlete's preparation... the full
content,"said Sindani, quoted by South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Sindani said the plan would be drawn up after talks with
coaches and athletes and would be unveiled by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
Team captain and South African 400m record-holder Arnaud
Malherbe said his problem had been over-racing -- a common
complaint by many of his team.
</P>
<P>
Although he had competed in both the local and European seasons
this year as he had in 1998 when he went on to perform well at the
Commonwealth Games, he had raced twice as often in Europe this
year.
</P>
<P>
"The financial incentives in Europe are big. I want to race the
Golden League next year. I need to cut my race numbers and it's
probably going to be in the South African season."
</P>
<P>
Malherbe said the maximum number of races in a year should be
20."I haven't counted yet (how many I have done), but it's over 30.
It's just too much."
</P>
<P>
Malherbe, however, was part of the 4x400m relay team which
broke the South African record and finished fourth. The men's
4x100m side also cracked a national mark.
</P>
<P>
But apart from those, all 44 athletes in the team failed to
achieve personal bests -- while many other competitors managed to
peak for the competition.
</P>
<P>
The ASA qualifying standards stipulated that athletes had to
compete at the national championships in Durban in March as well
as beat stipulated times and distances at that and other events.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Hezekiel Sepeng boycotted nationals and was handed
a hefty fine for doing so.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Olympic silver medalist who had said the World
Championships were not part of his preparations, was edged into
second place by Kenyan-born Wilson Kipketer for SA's sole medal.
</P>
<P>
At the previous World Championships in Athens in 1997, Marius
Corbett won javelin gold and Llewellyn Herbert silver in the 400m
hurdles.
</P>
<P>
But Herbert, the favorite to win this time around, pulled out
because of injury while an off-form Corbett fell way short of his
winning distance two years ago.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the lack of silverware, Malherbe was confident of a
much-improved showing at the All-Africa Games which start in
Johannesburg next week.
</P>
<P>
"Physically the team is very fit. Mentally we've learned a lot..
. I think we're going to have a good All-Africa Games."

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- South African Sports
Minister Ngconde Balfour Wednesday officially opened the All
Africa Games Village in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The village, comprising 1,700 houses, a primary school and a
shopping center, will house athletes for the All Africa Games due
to start next week.
</P>
<P>
Balfour appealed to the residents of Alexandra to help host a
peaceful and crime-free event.
</P>
<P>
"I believe you will live up to our reputation of hospitality",
he told residents attending the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Balfour said he believed the All Africa Games would prove to
the international community that South Africa could successfully
host such an event.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is bidding to host the 2006 soccer world cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
The black township of Alexandra is one of the three most
dangerous areas in Johannesburg, the world's "capital of crimes".
</P>
<P>
After the games, the athletes' village will be transferred to
the local community as a means of poverty alleviation.

<HEADLINE> Seaman Injury Blow for England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- England's chances of reaching
the European Championship finals have suffered a major setback,
after first choice goalkeeper David Seaman followed Sol Campbell
out of the squad.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal star Seaman is still struggling with a calf injury and
will miss the clashes with Luxembourg on Saturday and Poland next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But there was better news for manager Kevin Keegan when star
striker Michael Owen announced he would be able to last 90 minutes
in both England's vital qualifying matches.
</P>
<P>
Seaman, who picked up the injury in a pre-season game with St
Etienne, is the fourth player to pull out, after Campbell, Darren
Anderton and Rio Ferdinand.
</P>
<P>
Nigel Martyn of Leeds looks likely to replace him between the
posts in both matches - but Keegan may be tempted to call up
further goalkeeping cover.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tottenham manager George Graham finally had his wish
granted with the withdrawal of central defender Campbell from
Keegan's squad.
</P>
<P>
According to local press, Graham was involved in a public
disagreement with Keegan over Campbell being made to link up with
the England squad when he felt there was no chance of his being
fit to play.
</P>
<P>
The Spurs boss had insisted all along that Campbell was unfit -
but Keegan wanted the England medical staff to assess the player
in case there was a chance of him recovering in time to face
Poland a week today.
</P>
<P>
That slim hope disappeared with Campbell, who has played just
25 minutes this season, being sent back to White Hart Lane.
</P>
<P>
Campbell has joined Tottenham team-mate Darren Anderton and
West Ham defender Rio Ferdinand in withdrawing from the two games
England must win to reach the Euro play-offs.

<HEADLINE> Juninho on Way Back to Middlesbrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Middlesbrough have signed their
former midfielder Juninho on loan until the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC report on Wednesday, the deal was
announced after manager Bryan Robson flew to Spain to seal the
transfer with the Brazilian's club, Atletico Madrid.
</P>
<P>
On a busy day in the transfer market at the Riverside, Boro
also signed 26-year-old Senegal midfielder Ibrahim Ba on a
contract until the end of the season from AC Milan.
</P>
<P>
A club spokesman said: "A deal has been agreed with Atletico
Madrid which will see Juninho join Middlesbrough on a short-term
contract until June 2000 with a view to the player being offered
an extended contract after that time.
</P>
<P>
"The deal is subject to Juninho being granted a work permit and
the club has already made an application to the Department for
Education and Employment.
</P>
<P>
"Juninho will not come to Teesside until the result of the
application is known."
</P>
<P>
Juninho fell out of favor with Atletico Madrid, the club he
joined two years ago in a 12 million pound deal from Middlesbrough.
</P>
<P>
A broken leg dashed his hopes of playing for Brazil in the 1998
World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
He returned to the Atletico side last season but has not been
in favor with the Spanish club's new coach, Claudio Ranieri.
</P>
<P>
"Bringing Juninho back to Middlesbrough is great news for
Teesside and I am sure our fans will be delighted," said chief
executive Keith Lamb.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Prospect for Immediate Israeli, Palestinian Deal Slim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- In what would be a major setback
in the peace process, Israel and the Palestinians failed to reach a
deal on implementing a U.S.-brokered peace accord Thursday, hours
before a tentatively planned signing ceremony in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
A lengthy meeting of Israel's inner cabinet ended early Thursday
morning without making a decision on the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations over the implementation of the Wye accord. A new round
of talks planned to resume after the cabinet meeting was canceled.
</P>
<P>
The two sides might not be able to sign a memorandum on the
implementation of the Wye agreement in Alexandria, Egypt, Thursday
afternoon as widely expected, local media quoted sources close to
Prime Minister Ehud Barak as saying.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who started a four-day
visit to the region in Morocco Wednesday, had expected to attend the
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
There would be a major frustration not only for both Israel and the
Palestinians, but for Albright, who might have to be involved in
mediating the disputes between the two sides, something Washington has
been trying to avoid since Barak took office in early July.
</P>
<P>
Washington has said that Albright's visit, which will also bring her to
Egypt, Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Syria and Jordan, aims
to push forward the Israeli, Palestinian negotiations on the permanent
status and to resume the frozen Israeli-Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have intensified efforts in the
last few days to bridge their gaps over the implementation of the Wye
accord, signed and then frozen by Barak's hard-line predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu last year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday afternoon, the negotiations broke off without
reaching agreement on two remaining issues: the release of Palestinian
prisoners and a target date for a final status agreement.
</P>
<P>
After the gaps narrowed in rounds of talks lasting for over one
month, the Palestinians now demand that Israel release 400 political
prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israel activities. But Israel insists
that it will release only 350.
</P>
<P>
Israel proposed that the two sides reach a final status agreement
in December 2000, but the Palestinian wants the agreement to be
reached in April.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office issued a statement after the talks, declaring the
negotiations were over and threatening to carry out the original Wye
deal "to the letter," or according to Israeli interpretation, unless
the Palestinians came up with new proposals before the security
cabinet meeting starting at 7 p.m. (1600GMT).
</P>
<P>
For his part, senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat urged the
Israelis to continue talks and refrain from "any insinuation of an
ultimatum or threat, " saying he had sent new proposals to the Israeli
side on the issues where disputes exist.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli ultimatum, the second in the last few days, turned out
to be an attempt to make last-minute gains before the two sides
reached an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Barak set the deadline, Haim Ramon, minister in the
Prime Minister's Office, held two hours of surprise talks with Erekat
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Both sides emerged from the meeting in upbeat moods. Ramon said
every remaining problem would be resolved and Erekat said gaps had
been further narrowed by proposals Ramon brought to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was at this meeting that the two sides decided to resume the
negotiations as soon as the cabinet meeting concluded.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Barak had apologized to Arafat for the statement
insinuating an ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
Arafat cut short a visit to the Netherlands after a telephone
conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton over the deadlock.
The Palestinian leader said earlier in The Hagues that he expected
a deal would be struck "in a few hours" although the talks hit a
snag.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the two sides have already been on the verge of an
agreement. In the previous talks, they have made significant progress
on most issues concerning the implementation of the Wye accord,
including a timeline of further Israeli troop withdrawals from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Wye agreement calls on Israel to hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians in three stages over a period of 12
weeks and release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Netanyahu froze
the deal after carrying out its first stage.
</P>
<P>
Ousting Netanyahu in the national elections three months ago on a
platform to revive the Middle East peace process on all its tracks,
Barak has promised to carry out the Wye agreement but proposed some
changes in its implementation.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted his proposal to divide the two
remaining phases of Israeli troop withdrawals into three stages and
put off the final stage until early next year to avoid potential
confrontation between Palestinians and Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
About 15 Jewish settlements will be isolated, partially or fully,
after the final stage of troop withdrawals is carried out. Israel
wants to combine this stage into the final status talks, which aims at
a permanent peace between the two sides, in order to reduce the risk.
</P>
<P>
They have also agreed upon several sideline issues such as the
construction of a seaport in Gaza and the opening of safe passages
between Gaza and the West Bank. Israel has said that if the two sides
could not agree on all issues, it would carry out the Wye agreement as
written, meaning all understandings recently reached including those
on the seaport and safe passages would not be implemented.

<HEADLINE> Banks: England's World Cup Bid not Affected by Hooligans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Former British Sports Minister
Tony Banks has scotched suggestions that hooligans will undermine
England's chances to host the World Cup in 2006.
</P>
<P>
The England's 2006 World Cup ambassador believes English clubs
have an impeccable record.
</P>
<P>
"There is only a problem in England if we close our eyes to
other parts of the world," Banks said at the launch of new soccer
finance book 'A Game of Two Halves'.
</P>
<P>
"The number of incidents here is nothing like in other
countries,it's just amplified under the magnifying glass of
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
"There is no trouble worth mentioning inside our grounds and
that counts heavily with those who assess the bids."
</P>
<P>
There have been some incidents of late which raised a few
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
West Ham supporters clashed with Metz fans in France during
their Intertoto final, and a fan did run onto the pitch at Chester
this week and tackle the referee.
</P>
<P>
And there is concern that Swedish hard men from AIK Solna,
drawn in Arsenal's Champions League group, will make life hard for
the English bid team, but Banks stands defiant.
</P>
<P>
He has every faith in FIFA's sense of fairness over the issue,
but is wary of other factors which could unsettle FIFA chiefs'
views as to the best bid.
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately FIFA have a wide overview of world football far
greater than that at home. They're more open minded about the
situation here," Banks said.

<HEADLINE> Monarchs Forward Griffith Wins WNBA MVP Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The season may have ended on
a bitter note for Sacramento Monarchs forward-center Yolanda
Griffith,but she has the WNBA Most Valuable Player award to lift
her spirits.
</P>
<P>
Griffith, who won the Newcomer and Defensive Player of the Year
awards last Thursday, officially added the marquee MVP award to
the collection, ending the two-year reign of Houston Comets guard
Cynthia Cooper.
</P>
<P>
Griffith received 397 points and 23 first-place votes from a
panel of sportswriters and broadcasters. Forward Sheryl Swoopes of
the Comets finished second with 364 points and 15 first-place
votes,followed by Cooper, who had 324 points and 13 first-place
votes.
</P>
<P>
Griffith led the league in rebounding (11.8), steals (2.52) and
double-doubles (17), ranked second in scoring (18.8) and field
goal percentage (.541)and was third in blocked shots (1.86).
</P>
<P>
The awards brighten an otherwise upsetting end to the season
for Griffith, who missed the last four games with a torn medial
meniscus in her right knee. The Monarchs dropped all four of those
contests, including a 71-58 loss to Los Angeles last week in a one-
game playoff.
</P>
<P>
Once the American Basketball Leauge went defunct, Griffith
entered the WNBA draft and was selected by Sacramento second
overall after the Washington Mystics took Chamique Holdsclaw.
</P>
<P>
Griffith was recently named to the 1999-2000 Women's National
Team by USA Basketball, joining teammate Ruthie Bolton-Holifield.

<HEADLINE> Italian Foreign Ministry Sets Up Reform's Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Providing an adequate response to
the growing demand for foreign policy as a service and support for
Italy as a "country-system" on the world stage is the main goals
in the Italian foreign ministry reform to go into effect next
year, the ministry's secretary-general Umberto Vattani said
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, at the opening day of
the 2-day Italian ambassadors conference, Vattani said that the
growing need for Italian foreign policy derives from three
factors: crises laden with risk for Italy; Europe's growth and its
increasing role in the daily life of Italians; and
internationalization to a series of economic and social sectors
whence a pressing demand for the related services.
</P>
<P>
Vattani said the response must be a "global diplomacy" equipped
with the most modern tools, in which the foreign ministry is at
the cutting edge in the public administration, and above all a
rational and effective organization of the ministry's work.
</P>
<P>
Novelties to come on stream on January 1 include the Council
for International Affairs, chaired by the foreign minister and his
deputies with the aim of structuring and making systematic work at
the ministry's summit on elaborating and conducting foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
Another novelty is the ministry's organization by geographical
area, although issues of European integration will be handled by a
single division.
</P>
<P>
There will also be a new analysis and planning unit which will
extend the time horizon of Italian diplomacy so that its diplomats
"propose and act" rather than simply reacting to the development
of events.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Leaves Hague For Peace Deal </HEADLINE>

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat left The Hague of the Netherlands Wednesday for Alexandria
of Egypt for a peace deal signing ceremony with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader earlier told reporters in The Hague that
he hoped an eight-month deadlock with Israel over the Wye River
land-for-security agreement could be broken as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
At a doorstep interview with journalists in The Hague this
afternoon, Arafat made the statement after meeting with Dutch
Prime Minister Wim Kok and Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen,
but he declined to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
A Dutch foreign ministry spokesman said Arafat left because he
wants to get involved in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed their talks late at
night in Jerusalem in a race to finalize revisions to the Wye
River deal, frozen since December.
</P>
<P>
They were said to try to overcome differences in time for a
Thursday afternoon signing in Alexandria in the presence of U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
