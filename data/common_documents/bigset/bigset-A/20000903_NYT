(Correcting date in graf beginning `Cerda said': 1996 sted 1966 
LOS ANGELES: fix the leak. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even when the basement was fully ventilated, however, the
hydrogen sulfide was measured at 1 part per million.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said he got a quote from a geologist of $15,000 to study
the oil well, and $45,000 to properly cap it. With minimum-wage
jobs, the Floreses have no money for the repairs, having already
taken out a second mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, Cerda has waged her own unsuccessful battle
with two owners and numerous regulators. Retired, she says she
can't duplicate the rent elsewhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas investigators who first came to the property in 1993
told Cerda to be careful and get professional advice on mitigating
the oil well.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, the state official, said portions of the building would
have to be torn down enough to expose the leak before the state
could assist in repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Phil McAlmond, president of McAlmond Oil Co. Inc. that operates
10 oil wells near the Floreses and owns the mineral rights under
the apartment, said the well is typical of those closed up years
ago without proper sealant. He said gas seepage is a well-known
problem, which the school district should have known about when it
purchased the Belmont property.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 1,250 oil wells in this field in the early 1900s,''
McAlmond said. ``To pretend there was no gas seepage when there's
gas seepage all over was to ignore reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerda said she finally went to the Los Angeles County Department
of Health Services in 1996 and got inspectors to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out and scared the heck out of me,'' she said.
``They said, `Don't close the windows.' But then after a while,
they finally said there was nothing wrong. I asked them for a
letter saying it was safe. I never got a letter. When I asked, they
said they couldn't send such a letter.''
</P>
<P>
   County records show investigators visited the triplex April 2,
1996, and traced the smell of ``rotten eggs'' to the basement but
their equipment was inadequate to get a reliable measure.
</P>
<P>
   The county file shows Cerda was told to contact a certified
geologist, and in the meantime to install an exhaust fan in the
basement to force the contaminated air outside.
</P>
<P>
   The fan never was installed, but at some point a pipe was shoved
from the basement through an outside wall. Inspectors said the vent
does not appear to meet city codes.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Banuelos, the neighbor closest to the pipe, says he has
to keep all his windows closed to keep the smell of hydrogen
sulfide out of his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reported it 15 to 20 years ago to the Fire Department, and
they put in a pipe, but it doesn't help,'' said Banuelos, a retiree
who suffers from prostate cancer. ``Every place around here is a
problem. You can smell the contamination.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mario Flores, a former Mexico City street singer who has
struggled to make a better life in Los Angeles, the crack in the
regulatory system offers no way out of his dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my American dream. We worked so hard to get it,'' he
said. ``I'm at the point where I'm afraid I'll just have to live
with the situation _ or die with it.''

AUDIS BEAT HEAT, SWEEP GRAND PRIX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ All conquering all weekend, the Audi R8s
driven by Frank Biela and Rinaldo Capello completed a one-two
Prototype sweep for the German carmaker in the inaugural Grand Prix
of Texas at Texas Motor Speedway last night.
</P>
<P>
   But it could have been the other way around in Round 7 of the
American Le Mans Series. Running second to Capello with 42 minutes
left in the 2 hour, 45-minute event, Biela pitted for fuel in the
No. 78 car during the race's second full-course caution. Race
leader Capello also was supposed to pit during the yellow, but a
faulty radio prevented the Italian from getting the call from his
crew.
</P>
<P>
   Capello kept the lead for 31 more minutes, when he was forced to
pit because of a deflating tire and for fuel. That allowed Biela,
who shared the No. 78 Audi with Italian Emanuele Pirro, to inherit
a lead he would carry to the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was perfect until the end, but the main job was done
by the pit crew,'' Biela, of Germany, said during a somewhat muted
postrace celebration. ``I came in on the full-course yellow, and
that's where I gained the gap we lost in the first two stints.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning silver car led only the final 11 minutes (or nine
laps) around the 2.324-mile, eight-turn combined oval/infield road
course. That period proved particularly agonizing for Capello and
pole sitter Allan McNish of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just bad luck,'' Capello said. ``I had the radio
\Rworking\S not five minutes before the yellow flag. After
Nurburgring \Ran accident and 30th-place finish July 9\R, I said
all of our bad luck was over. This year Allan and I have rewritten
the book on bad luck. This was the only track where we don't have a
pit board.''
</P>
<P>
   That would have told Capello to bring it on in. As it was, he
continued to drive into the night ... and into the clutches of his
Joest Racing teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they had to stop because they hadn't pitted during the
yellow flag,'' Pirro said. ``Frank was trying to keep the gap big
enough to make sure we could keep the lead. Frank had the lead with
a lot of pressure, and made it.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the fourth for the Audi factory this season and
second for the No. 78 car in the ALMS. That does not include the
victory by Biela and Pirro in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ron Fellows and Andy Pilgrim scored the first Grand
Touring Sport victory for the Chevrolet Corvette C5-R, a resounding
three-lap decision over the No. 91 Dodge Viper GTS-R driven by
Olivier Beretta and Karl Wendlinger. The 'Vette's victory marked
the first time since the Team Oreca Vipers joined the series in
June 1999 that they failed to finish first, a streak covering 12
consecutive races.
</P>
<P>
   In the Grand Touring class, the No. 23 Alex Job Racing Porsche
911 GT3 R co-driven by Randy Pobst and Bruno Lambert scored its
second consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   Fellows, a two-time winner of the Grand Prix of Dallas Trans-Am
race, drove the opening and closing stints in the closed-cockpit
No. 3 GM Goodwrench Chevrolet. Ambient temperatures again were over
100 degrees when the race started at 7:17 p.m., and up to 160
degrees in the closed-cockpit Corvette. Fellows was drained when he
turned the car over to Pilgrim during a pit stop approximately 45
minutes into the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the infield portion of the course, I had to hold my breath
because the hot air was so powerful,'' said Fellows, a native of
Canada. ``When I came in I had about a dozen ice-down towels
\Rwrapped around him\S.'' Fellows said he also was escorted back to
his garage, where he received what he called an outdoor shower.
Fellows sat in a lawn chair while a crewman sprayed water on him
from a garden hose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt fine after about 30 minutes,'' said Fellows, the lead
development driver for the factory Corvette program.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway officials estimated all-day attendance at the track at
24,500, with approximately 9,000 on the grounds for the ALMS
feature.
</P>
<P>
   With the Audis of McNish and Pirro dominating the field, only
six of 26 cars remained on the lead-lap 38 minutes into the race.
At the one-hour mark, only the two Audis, the Panoz LMP-1 Roadster
driven by David Brabham and the BMW V12 LMR started by J.J. Lehto
had completed 48 laps. Prototypes occupied the top seven positions,
with the Corvette C5-R atop the GTS standings with Fellows at the
wheel. He was being chased by the Vipers driven by Wendlinger and
David Donohue in ninth and 10th, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Pole sitter Dirk Muller had his Porsche 911 GT3 R in the GT
class lead, 11th overall.
</P>
<P>
   McNish ended his double stint and surrendered his seat, but not
the lead, when he pitted at 8:51 p.m. during a full-course caution
brought out when Randy Wars' GT Porsche 911 developed a small fire
in the rear. Pirro also brought the No. 78 Audi R8 in for tires,
fuel and a switch to his teammate, Biela.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car's good to drive. It's comfortable,'' said McNish, who
after helping Capello get settled into the cockpit hopped over the
pit wall for another hot interview. nn

SMU OPENS STADIUM IN RED-HOT STYLE BY BEATING KANSAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TRACEY MYERS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ SMU football coach Mike Cavan was at peace Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He would be the first to admit the calm demeanor on game day was
typical. But there was something different this time, something
about this 2000 team that felt right.
</P>
<P>
   His positive attitude was reinforced later that evening.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Josh McCown threw for 164 yards and two touchdowns and
ran for another, as the Mustangs scored 24 points in the first
quarter on the way to a 31-17 victory against Kansas in the season
opener at the new Gerald J. Ford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs (1-0) triumphed in a season opener for the first
time since 1996, when they defeated Tulsa, 17-10. The game was also
the hottest in SMU history, as the game-time temperature reached
107 degrees. But the anticipation and desire for a victory in the
new stadium might have been more intense than any Texas sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not calling this the greatest win, but it's probably the
most important win that's been here, just because of everything
that's gone on,'' Cavan said. ``For us to come out here tonight and
play like we did, it was really good. It was a big-time win for our
program.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown, who completed 14 of 25 passes, was fully aware of the
Mustangs' recent past. Losing skids had become regular, and
breaking in the 2000 season with a victory was a weight off the
team's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go 0-4, 0-5 the past two seasons, going 1-0 makes all
the difference in the world,'' McCown said. ``It was a great lift
for the crowd to be behind us, and the start we had gave us great
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore wide receiver Chris Cunningham, who caught five passes
for 58 yards, also felt the energy of the 32,267 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came out of the tunnel and to see the crowd going
crazy,'' Cunningham said, ``well, that is what I imagined when I
decided to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   They also felt the impact of a new offense. The new one-back
setup installed by offensive coordinator Larry Kueck, who also had
the same job with the Mustangs in 1990, was evident immediately.
Set up to feature the passing game, the scheme allowed McCown to
pick and choose his receiving targets. Billy Ford and John Hampton,
a Burleson High School graduate, each had a touchdown reception.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Kansas free safety Carl Nesmith also might have
helped. Nesmith, a preseason All-America selection who had three
interceptions last season, didn't play because of a violation of
the team's code of conduct. But the Jayhawks were stymied more by
their own mistakes than by their missing teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Several wide receivers dropped quarterback Dylen Smith's passes,
including a possible touchdown to David Hurst in the second
quarter. A bad snap on a punt gave the Mustangs the ball on the
Jayhawks' 1-yard line, setting up an easy score. Kevin Aldridge
partially blocked another punt for the Mustangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't move the ball on offense in the first quarter,''
Kansas coach Terry Allen said. ``Our demise was the mistakes we
made on our punt team, but that was a result of us not moving the
football. We can't punt the ball four times in the first quarter
and win ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith left in the third quarter with cramps but returned in the
fourth after receiving fluids. He completed 15 of 37 passes for 207
yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   SMU scored on its first drive, after dropped passes by Hurst and
Termaine Fulton doomed the Jayhawks. McCown completed all four of
his pass attempts, including an 11-yard strike to Ford for a
touchdown, and the Mustangs scored on their next three possessions.
</P>
<P>
   The victory has helped Cavan breathe a little easier, for now.
But with a Western Athletic Conference matchup against UT-El Paso
approaching Saturday, the opener will be put aside quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of things to correct, we've got a long way to
go to be a real good football team,'' Cavan said. ``But I think
these guys understand it. No matter what this win is, it's bigger
next week.'' \Nsubheds:Briefly SMU tight end Steve O'Neill suffered
a sprained left ankle late in the game but walked off on his own
power.
</P>
<P>
   Two Mustangs, defensive end Kevin Aldridge and linebacker Vic
Viloria suffered dehydration.

DODGERS WIN IT IN 10TH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Even in this pinball era when 25 homers and 100
RBI are more staples of good seasons rather than benchmarks,
pitchers prove they still own the game.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies lefty Bruce Chen and Dodgers right-hander Kevin Brown
had one of those time-warp nights in which pitching dominated with
no solution.
</P>
<P>
   Neither starter budged. The Los Angeles Dodgers finally got to
Philadelphia's bullpen in the 10th inning and won 1-0 Saturday in
front of 37,244 at Dodger Stadium. Jeff Branson doubled to right
off reliever Vicente Padilla and Branson eventually scored on Tom
Goodwin's two-out single to center as the Dodgers won for the 10th
time in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had few chances against Chen - acquired in the Andy
Ashby deal with Atlanta in July - but it didn't start out that way.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, they were poised to do something, but
Goodwin's misread on Mark Grudzielanek's pop-up to right field cost
them. Goodwin led off with a single, but he wasn't sure if Phillies
second baseman Marlon Anderson would catch Grudzielanek's bloop.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson got a glove on it, and Goodwin turned to return to
first. Anderson dropped it, but center fielder Doug Glanville
quickly picked it up and threw to second to force Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Scott Rolen booted Gary Sheffield's grounder to
put runners on first and second, but Eric Karros flew out to right
and Shawn Green popped out to second.
</P>
<P>
   The only other runner the Dodgers got off Chen in the next six
innings was Grudzielanek's two-out single to right in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley broke Chen's string of retiring 13 straight with a
leadoff single to right in the eighth, but failure to execute hurt
the Dodgers. Branson, starting at shortstop in the place of the ill
Alex Cora, popped out on his bunt attempt. Jim Leyritz popped out
in front of home plate for the second out. Goodwin singled to right
to push Paul LoDuca, running for Hundley, to third, but
Grudzielanek grounded into a fielder's choice to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chen tied a career-high with eight strikeouts in 8 innings. He
walked one and allowed four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Brown held the Phillies scoreless through his seven innings,
yielding four hits and striking out nine. But it was a battle most
of the time. In the first six innings, the Phillies had a base
runner in all innings but the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Mike Lieberthal, a Westlake High product, led off the
second with a double and went to third on Travis Lee's grounder to
first. Needing a fly ball to score a run, Rob Ducey instead struck
out. It was the first of seven consecutive strikeouts recorded by
Brown. He got out of the inning by whiffing Marlon Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies had another threat in the fourth when Rolen led off
with a single and Lieberthal was hit with a pitch. However, Lee and
Ducey struck out and Anderson tapped harmlessly back to the mound
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Such a pitching performance is nothing new for Brown, or
actually any of the Dodgers' big three. Brown, Chan Ho Park and
Darren Dreifort haven't been the problems, but the end of the
rotation has been inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brown did go through a three-start stretch in which he
wasn't the dominating, overpowering intimidator he usually is. In
fact, included in that span was a messy, 1-inning, nine-run outing
against the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   But in his last three starts, Brown's been pitching the way he's
pitched since joining the Dodgers after the 1998 season. He took a
perfect game into the seventh inning in an Aug. 23 start against
Montreal and wound up yielding one run in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Though Brown allowed three runs in seven innings in his last
start at Milwaukee, he was pitching just two days after being
confined to his hotel room with flu-like symptoms. And he was
staked to a 5-0 lead in the first inning and didn't mind trading a
hit here and there in exchange for outs.

UCLA STUNS NO. 3 ALABAMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Four plays into the new season and it looked
like the same old train wreck of 1999 for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Four plays and the Bruins were already down a quarterback - Cory
Paus, who left with a separated shoulder. Four plays and they were
down on the scoreboard - Alabama's Freddie Milons returned a punt
71 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   All this and the UCLA defense hadn't even taken the field.
</P>
<P>
   While the 76,640 fans at the Rose Bowl might have been wondering
if UCLA would play a repeat of the 1999 disappointment, the Bruins,
behind tailback DeShaun Foster, began to establish a dominance the
same fans will only hope can be maintained.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins, who had lost nine of their previous 13 games, had
a host of questions when they walked onto the field, there was only
one to ask after they left it with a resounding 35-24 victory over
No. 3 Alabama:
</P>
<P>
   Where have these guys been?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we're back, but I'm very excited for our
football team,'' said coach Bob Toledo, who added he considered the
victory the second-greatest since his arrival at UCLA in 1996, the
year of its greatest - when the Bruins beat USC in double overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing about this team is they worked extremely hard
and they believed and you've got to believe you can beat
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had few reasons, if any, to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did they lose Paus, who is expected to be out two to
four weeks, but they lost receiver Brian Poli-Dixon early in the
second half with a pulled hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Things worsened in the third quarter, when UCLA was unable to
take advantage of strong field position while clinging to a 21-17
lead. Backup quarterback Ryan McCann was intercepted by Alabama
free safety Reggie Myles, who raced 91 yards untouched to put the
Crimson Tide ahead 24-21 with 8:26 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came off the field I told him we needed him,'' Toledo
said of McCann. ``I didn't lose confidence in him. I just told him
that we needed him to go back out there and make a big play.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCann, who was 2 for 9 with the interception and was sacked
twice since late in the second quarter, responded. With a first
down at Alabama's 46, cornerback Hirchel Bolden bit on McCann's
pump fake, allowing Freddie Mitchell to streak by. Mitchell hauled
in McCann's throw for a touchdown and a 28-24 lead with 7:05 left
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the defense, Foster and the offensive line took care
of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, who had never carried the ball more than 24 times in his
two previous seasons, was handed the ball a school-record tying 42
times and carried it for three touchdowns and a career-high 187
yards. He also caught three passes for 29 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a high school game for a minute,'' Foster
said of his workload.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line, which suffered through inexperience and
injury last season, returned all five starters and gained an
average of 12 pounds per player. And they pounded on Alabama early,
putting together 19- and 13-play scoring drives in the first half.
By the fourth quarter the speedy Crimson Tide defense, with eight
returning starters from last year's ninth-ranked unit in the
nation, was worn out.
</P>
<P>
   On the 19-play drive the Bruins converted three fourth downs,
all Foster runs, including a 1-yard scoring dive that answered
Milons' punt return.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago we put too much on the quarterback because we
couldn't run the ball,'' said offensive coordinator Al Borges,
whose team enjoyed a nearly 15-minute advantage in time of
possession. ``We knew we had to get physical this season. The
quarterback's best friend is the running game. If you make (the
linemen and linebackers) play in the box, they're not able to
indiscriminately run up the field. The whole thing starts with the
aggressiveness of the offensive line and the running game.''
</P>
<P>
   If the offensive line was remarkably different than last season,
then what of the defense?
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were ranked 99th and 107th in the nation in total
defense the past two seasons, but they led the country in being the
butt of handicapped jokes - in light of the scandal in which
players used handicapped parking placards on campus. It was their
turn to laugh Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They held Alabama, which returned nine starters on offense, to
265 yards in total offense. The UCLA defense also recovered three
fumbles, intercepted a pass and allowed only 10 points - the
Crimson Tide got their others on Myles' interception return and
Milons' punt return.
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Marques Anderson, a former cornerback, looked like
a natural at his new position, hitting hard, tackling soundly and
blanketing Milons when the alignment called for it. Jason Bell,
who, like Anderson didn't play last season, smothered receivers all
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   And the front seven - which got only a token appearance from
tackle Ken Kocher (ankle sprain) - never allowed Alabama to
establish a running game or throw deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing they got on us was trick plays,'' said
linebacker Ryan Nece, referring to a 56-yard reverse by Jason
McAddley and a throw- back screen to tight end Terry Jones for 27
yards, Alabama's only two plays longer than 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot to prove not only to ourselves, but the nation.
When you're doubted as much as we've been, you use it as
motivation.''

   McAddley appeared destined for the end zone on the reverse,
which would have pulled Alabama out from beneath a 14-point deficit
to tie the score just before halftime. But Manning made a diving
shoestring tackle of McAddley at the 15. Tide quarterback Andrew
Zow was sacked twice - by linebacker Tony White and Anderson - in
the next two plays, forcing Alabama to settle for a field goal and
a 21-17 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes up for everything,'' said Bell, who sat out last
season with a heel injury. ``I'm back, I'm healthy and I'm ready to
go. And we're back, we're healthy and we're ready to go.''

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia claims he doesn't
watch the scoreboard. Not all of his players, however, follow his
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been scoreboard watching since two weeks ago, since the
All-Star break, really,'' first baseman Mo Vaughn said. ``I always
look at that thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said it shouldn't be a distraction to look at the
scoreboard to see what other playoff contenders are doing. It
should motivate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time when every single at-bat, every single pitch,
every single play is crucial,'' Vaughn said. ``Every situation is
very important. We only have (27) games left. We have to capitalize
on every situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's meet: The Angels held a players-only team meeting before
Saturday's game for the first time this season. Scioscia wasn't
invited but he got word of what went on in the meeting, which
lasted about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gist of the meeting was, 'We've come this far playing
hard, let's stay on the path we're on, come out with the same
intensity and desire we've had,' '' Scioscia said. ``At the same
time, you don't want to create a sense of urgency that makes people
tighten up. But I don't sense that at all with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said he has no problem with players calling meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good,'' he said. ``Interaction of players is very
important. Whether it's a formal meeting or informal, with guys
talking to each other in the outfield during batting practice,
communication is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Garret Anderson had three RBI in Saturday's game
to improve his season total to 94, a career high. ... Bryan Ward,
acquired from the Phillies on Aug. 16, made his Angels debut
Saturday, giving up three runs and three hits in one inning. ...
Darin Erstad's 26 stolen bases this season are the most by an Angel
since Chad Curtis had 48 in 1993. ... Tim Salmon is hitless in his
past 14 at-bats.

SHEFFIELD WANTS DAY WITH SELIG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A viral infection, which knocked 11 pounds off Los
Angeles Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield, hastened his decision
to serve a five-game suspension he had twice appealed. But the
matter is far from over as far as the six-time All-Star is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield still wants his day with commissioner Bud Selig so he
can clear his name. Even if he chose to serve the suspension
because it was the best thing for the team - which was winning
without him anyway - at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield said he'll wait until after the season so it's not a
distraction, but during the offseason he hopes to discuss his role
- or lack thereof - in the May 16 fight at Wrigley Field that led
to his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for Sheffield to take this course of action
is to have the suspension, in theory, removed from his record.
Thus, his reputation - which he's worked hard to build as a
positive influence - would not be tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield said he took offense to attorney Greg Adamski, who
represents defendant Ronald Camacho in the criminal misdemeanor
case stemming from the brawl. Adamski called Sheffield a ``thug,''
although Sheffield has made it clear he was nothing more than a
peacemaker in the altercation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no thug,'' Sheffield said. ``That's my problem (with the
ruling standing). I'm going to be behind my teammates 100 percent,
but no matter where I've been, I'm always the one to get singled
out, even if I'm the peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to me. I'm going to address it during the
offseason. I want to know what (Selig) would have done, just for my
own curiosity. Just to know if he really listened to my case, which
the rest of them didn't do. It was like they were listening to the
case, but when it came down to the verdict, everything remained the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   The original suspension was handed down by Frank Robinson, vice
president of on-field operations for baseball. An appeal to Paul
Beeston, the COO of the office of the commissioner, was heard in
June. The suspensions of 11 players were overturned, but Beeston
upheld those of four players, including Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield appealed again to Selig, and a hearing was scheduled
for last Monday. However, Sheffield chose to serve the suspension
when he was bedridden with a viral infection. He wound up missing
11 games before returning to the lineup Friday. He said the
incident is behind him - for now.
</P>
<P>
   As a marquee player and an MVP candidate until the viral
infection knocked 11 games off his season, Major League Baseball
asks much of Sheffield. He has hosted This Week In Baseball and has
been asked numerous times to serve as an ambassador of the game. In
return, Sheffield just wants a chance to appeal to Selig,
baseball's highest authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you didn't do anything and you get falsely accused of
something and you don't even know why, that's something I'm always
wondering about,'' Sheffield said. ``That's going to be a problem
the rest of my career. There's things I have to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   Cora's, Hansen's turn: Jeff Branson started at shortstop while
Alex Cora continued to battle flu-like symptoms that forced him out
of Friday's game in the sixth inning. Cora improved in the
afternoon and is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   The virus has also made its way to pinch-hitter Dave Hansen, who
also was feeling weak. Hansen was available to pinch hit, but he
was experiencing similar symptoms to Cora. The two are the latest
players to be hit with the virus that's been plaguing the Dodgers
since early July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it ravage a club (like this),'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Right-hander Mike Fetters is listed as day-to-day
after experiencing a shooting pain while fielding a bunt Friday. He
threw pain-free on the side Saturday, but said it tightened up
afterward. ... Johnson said center fielder Devon White (strained
left quadriceps) remains a few days away from being able to play in
the field.

ALABAMA'S MILONS CAUSES SPECIAL PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The most dangerous man on the field Saturday
was Alabama's 5-foot-7, all-purpose threat Freddie Milons.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA figured it couldn't do much to prevent him from getting the
ball on offense, since Alabama uses so many formations and methods
to get him the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The kicking game, however, was an area they wanted to control.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it mission failed.
</P>
<P>
   Punter Nate Fikse's first punt went right to Milons, who juked
his way down the field for a 71-yard touchdown. He also returned
another 18 yards that he almost broke for much more. Finally,
Fikse, who averaged 45 yards on his five kicks, got the idea in the
second half and kicked the ball short and let it roll once and
putting another out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to kick it to (Milons) and Nate didn't want to
kick it to him,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``But sometimes it's
like my wedge shot, he slices it.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing 'em proud: The UCLA offensive line, which battled
inexperience, injury and lack of muscle last season, turned in the
type of dominating performance it regularly did in 1997 and 1998,
when the Bruins won 20 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Duly impressed were two members of that line, center Shawn
Stuart and guard Andy Meyers, who were on the UCLA sideline
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where they came from last year, I'm very proud of those
guys,'' Stuart said. ``They're much more athletic than we were and
tougher than we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon hurt: Brian Poli-Dixon, whose only catch was a
31-yard touchdown pass from flanker Freddie Mitchell, strained a
hamstring on UCLA's first possession of the second half and didn't
return. However, the injury isn't serious and Poli-Dixon could have
returned if needed, trainer Geoff Schaadt said.
</P>
<P>
   Flingin' Freddie: Mitchell's touchdown pass was the third of his
career - every one coming in a big game. The other two came in the
1998 season opener against Texas and in the 1999 Rose Bowl against
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The play began with Ryan McCann pitching the ball to DeShaun
Foster, who swept left and tossed the ball back to Mitchell, who
threw a perfect ball that Poli-Dixon caught just inside the back
line of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   In his career, Mitchell is 4 of 5 for 126 yards, three
touchdowns and no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddie Mitchell might be our best quarterback,'' Toledo
joked.
</P>
<P>
   What have you done lately?: UCLA defensive coordinator Bob Field
was thrilled with the way his defense played, particularly in light
of last year's struggles, when the Bruins allowed 444.6 yards per
game, 107th in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't getting carried away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling,'' Field said, ``but if we don't play
well next week, you'll get your pens fired up and write something
bad, and justifiably so.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA plays Fresno State next week.
</P>
<P>
   Orange eyes upon them: Corey Johnson, a former Long Beach State
athletic director, was at the game as a representative of the
Orange Bowl, which plays host to the national championship game
this season. He was not, however, seen in the UCLA locker room
after the game. !arrow!Add injuries:!off! Starting defensive tackle
Ken Kocher, who suffered a high ankle sprain nearly two weeks ago,
was on the field for several plays but did not have a tackle.

CLUBHOUSE MEETING DOESN'T HELP ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Anaheim Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn called a
players-only meeting before Saturday's game against the Chicago
White Sox to emphasize the positive and reinforce the team's focus.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hours later, they were down, 10-0, on their way to a
13-6 loss before 29,785 at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have lost three in a row and four of five, their
record falling to 68-67, only one game over .500 for the first time
since June 20. They are five games behind Seattle in the American
League West, and although they are still only 4 games behind
Cleveland, they fell into the sixth spot in the wild-card race as
Detroit passed them.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Kent Mercker left after two innings with a
strained left rotator cuff. His spot in the rotation most likely
will be taken by Tim Belcher, who would start next Thursday in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, as all but a few players were left in the
clubhouse, Vaughn told reporters what he tried to convey to his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, what we've accomplished as a team cannot
be forgotten under any circumstances,'' he said. ``I don't want
anybody getting caught up in whatever situation we're in. You have
to give a lot of credit to this organization, to this club. A lot
of guys are setting records, breaking records. I don't want our
guys to forget that as we get down to the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels typically play in the spotlight like they're under a
heat lamp, wilting instead of thriving. They've had only one
winning September since 1991, and that came last year after the
season had long been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing greater than to be playing for the playoffs in
September,'' Vaughn said. ``It's the same game playing in April,
May and June. But focus is the main thing, especially when it comes
down to the last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few pennants are won in April and May. Pennants are won
in September.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. The Angels are 0-2 in September. Saturday's game was over
shortly after it began. Mercker gave up four runs in the second
inning and was done for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson had the big hit of the inning with a three-run
double. He added an RBI single and a three-run homer later in the
game for a career-high seven RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox went to work against the Angels bullpen for one
run in the fourth and five in the fifth for a 10-0 lead. But the
Angels responded in the sixth with five runs, three coming in on
Garret Anderson's 32nd home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't give ourselves a real chance,'' Angels manager Mike
Scioscia said. ``We had guys on base but we only had five hits.
Getting down, 4-0, we were confident, but down 10-0 ... we battled
as hard as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have battled all season but have struggled to
overcome an inconsistent and injury-plagued starting rotation. The
bullpen has been tested all season because of it and is showing
signs of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petkovsek is the perfect example. Saturday, he faced 11
batters, allowed five hits and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need these guys (starters) to get deeper into games,'' said
Scioscia, who added he isn't worried about his team's state of
mind. ``These guys have a passion for the game. They come out every
day and want to get after it. We didn't win today, but we'll be
ready to go tomorrow, and the next day.''

DODGERS BEAT PHILLIES IN 10TH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even in this pinball era when 25 homers and 100
RBI are more staples of good seasons rather than benchmarks,
pitchers prove they still own the game.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia lefty Bruce Chen and Los Angeles Dodgers
right-hander Kevin Brown had one of those time-warp nights in which
pitching dominated. Brown didn't budge for seven innings, Chen for
8 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after more than three hours, the Dodgers broke through
to Philadelphia's bullpen on Tom Goodwin's two-out, run-scoring
single in the 10th inning as the Dodgers beat the Phillies 1-0
Saturday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (72-64) have won 10 of their past 13 games,
including a season-high five straight at home, and can climb a
season-best nine games above .500 with a win today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chen was awesome, Brownie was awesome, and this is two big
(wins) in a row,'' said Dodgers reliever Matt Herges, who pitched a
perfect 10th to record the win and improve to 9-3. ``Wins like
this, these types of games with extra innings or whatever, that's
incredible for morale. They feel better when you win that way. It's
definitely something to take into this last month, momentum-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Branson, starting at shortstop for the ill-feeling Alex
Cora, started the winning rally with a one-out double to right off
reliever Vicente Padilla. Branson moved to third on Dave Hansen's
groundout and scored when Goodwin stroked the first pitch he saw
from Padilla (3-4) into center field.
</P>
<P>
   It gave the Dodgers their second straight one-run win and marked
their first 1-0 shutout win nearly two years. Just how long was it
since the Dodgers had one of these? Well, Carlos Perez did it,
beating San Francisco on Sept. 28, 1998, in a complete-game effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm worried about is getting the win, it doesn't matter
who comes through,'' Goodwin said. ``We have to win just about
every game and put the pressure on the guys up top. It doesn't
matter who comes through. You don't play the game to be in a
situation like that. You play the game to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Branson was happy with the double and scoring the
game- winning run, but he was also disappointed by his failure to
execute in the eighth inning. Todd Hundley led of with a single,
but Branson popped out trying to bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Paul LoDuca, pinch-running for Hundley, eventually moved to
third on Goodwin's single but was stranded there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ballgame could have been over early if I get the bunt
down,'' Branson said. ``They have confidence to put you in there,
and I didn't come through. You're in that situation, and I didn't
do my job. It's great you score the winning run and hit the double,
but the game could have been over with. I'm still ticked off I
didn't get the bunt down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers outlasted a brilliant effort by Chen - he tied a
career-high with eight strikeouts and allowed four hits - mostly
because staff ace Kevin Brown was equally overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Brown pitched seven shutout innings, yielding four hits and
striking out nine. But he did battle through some trouble. The
Phillies had baserunners in five of the first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Mike Lieberthal, a Westlake High product, led off the
second with a double and went to third on Travis Lee's groundout to
first. Needing a fly ball to score a run, Rob Ducey instead struck
out. It was the first of seven consecutive strikeouts recorded by
Brown. He got out of the inning by whiffing Marlon Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies had another threat in the fourth when Rolen led off
with a single and Lieberthal was hit with a pitch. However, Lee and
Ducey struck out and Anderson tapped harmlessly back to the mound
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Chen) threw a lot of strikes, and he threw a lot of offspeed
stuff,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``He had a really good
change-up. He got a lot of easy outs with his change-up. He's a
promising young pitcher.''

 &HT;    City slow to learn value of a good tree
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a 90-degree day in a downtown parking lot last
week, the surface temperature of a parked automobile measured 150
degrees. On hot summer days, parked cars emit hydrocarbons that add
to ozone pollution, just like cars stuck in traffic jams do.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Bansley, executive director of TreesAtlanta, used a heat
gun _ an infrared thermometer that measures surface temperatures _
to make her point: Enforcing Atlanta's parking lot tree ordinance,
which requires one canopy tree (a minimum of 10 feet high with a
40-foot growth potential) for every eight parking spaces, is about
more than aesthetics. It's about curbing air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   As Bansley measured the surfaces in an unshaded lot next to a
downtown restaurant, she recorded pavement temperatures ranging
from 131 to 145 degrees in the sun. But under the one nearby shade
tree, the paving's temperature was 94 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Bansley was the first person I called when I heard the good news
that the city is starting to enforce the parking lot provision of
the tree ordinance after eight years of dormancy. Enacted in 1992,
it was challenged in court by parking lot owners for three years
before being upheld by the state Supreme Court in 1995. But with
one lone city arborist devoid of staff and no attention from the
mayor's office (except briefly before the Olympics), city parking
lots simply added to what NASA scientists describe as metro
Atlanta's ``17-square-mile and growing urban heat island.''
</P>
<P>
   In a display of how effective grass-roots efforts can be, droves
of Atlantans packed recent city budget hearings demanding funding
for the arborist's office so the city tree ordinance could be
enforced. As a result, the city hired four new arborists. Arborist
Frank Mobley has committed to enforcing the parking lot tree
requirements, although it's not clear whether they will apply only
to new lots and those being expanded or to all of them. (The
ordinance states that it applies to ``existing'' lots.)
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's ordinance, and others like it in the suburbs, ought to
be amended to require the planting of trees inside lots, too. It's
good to reduce parking lot temperatures with perimeter trees, but
if a car is parked under a tree, the heat reduction is doubled
because the fuel tank is protected from direct sunlight and fuel
doesn't vaporize as readily, said Greg McPherson, an urban forest
researcher with the U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   Trees play such an important role in fighting air and water
pollution that many urban planners say trees should be considered
``infrastructure'' just like roads and bridges _ and be funded
accordingly. They would pay for themselves in storm water
prevention savings alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although Atlanta claims trees as its signature asset, the metro
area has taken only baby steps toward valuing them, Bansley said.
Neither the governor's regional transportation agency nor business
leaders' Clean Water Initiative has considered trees as part of
their clean air and clean water strategies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still don't get it,'' said Bansley, who nonetheless
commends the governor for setting aside $30 million for metro area
green space.
</P>
<P>
   Besides fighting pollution, trees add value to businesses. In a
recent study by the University of Washington's Urban Institute,
consumers rated the quality of products in different shopping
districts. Products tested in shopping areas with large numbers of
shade trees were rated 30 percent higher than identical products
rated in shopping areas that were barren of trees.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, trees are like good teachers: undervalued for
their lasting contributions.

 &HT;    Trailing a toxic plume
 &HT;    By John Young

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEXAS CITY, Texas _ It seems crystal clear from here. But Max
Shauck's machines are having a fit.
</P>
<P>
   We are looking down at the face of oil refining on Texas' coast.
Aside bulbous, pale storage tanks, heater and boiler stacks reach
to the sky. From here they are like many whiskers on many moles.
</P>
<P>
   Shauck's DeHavilland Twin Otter is making loops at up to 5,000
feet over Galveston Bay and the Houston Ship Channel, sampling air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   We are in what Shauck calls a ``witch's brew'' of nitrogen
oxide, sulfur dioxide and hydrocarbons, the latter being the raw
vapors from petroleum and its byproducts.
</P>
<P>
   The nitrogen oxide _ NOx _ is invisible at its source. But
shortly the sun will cook it into a layer of haze _ ozone _
otherwise known as smog.
</P>
<P>
   Shauck, who heads the Baylor University Aviation Sciences
Department, has been trolling for smog for many years. Over recent
months the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission enlisted
him to draw a portrait of what's blowing where.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Shauck's plane has joined a veritable squadron out
of Houston's Ellington Field, carrying participants in the Texas
2000 air quality study. Scientists from the Environmental
Protection Agency, NASA, U.S. Department of Energy, National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the University of Texas and
Rice University are making Texas' most intensive air pollution
study ever.
</P>
<P>
   Shauck has flown all over Texas showing how pollution from one
region ends up elsewhere. He's shown, for instance, how emissions
from TXU Electric's Big Brown lignite-fueled plant near Fairfield
contaminates Dallas and Fort Worth, which need no such assist.
</P>
<P>
   He's shown how Gulf Coast pollution has managed to spike up
ozone levels in Crockett, some 140 miles away as the oxide flies.
</P>
<P>
   These are hardly revelations. Back in 1978 scientists enunciated
the air-flow concept of extreme long-range transport, such as East
Coast pollution recirculating all the way to the Florida Sun Coast.
Now scientists are confident that U.S.-made ozone migrates across
the Atlantic to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   DOWNWIND, UPWIND
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows where this came from?''
</P>
<P>
   The way Sergio Alvarez talks about what we're flying through, it
has the air of something the dog dragged home.
</P>
<P>
   He knows it well. His laptop computer is hooked to a row of
instruments in Shauck's plane. They breathe for science.
</P>
<P>
   They show how sun and wind affect the mix. Ozone levels rise at
midday when the NOx gets sun-scorched. At night the layer of ozone
gets compressed and moved out _ maybe from Houston to the Louisiana
coast, or north to the Piney Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone is the principal concern of the TNRCC, which is under
pressure by the EPA to curb smog in Houston, Dallas and El Paso.
Ozone-producing emissions may be stealthy in their short-term
invisibility, but they don't sneak past Shauck's plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're upwind,'' Alvarez says, as the ozone graph on his laptop
hugs the bottom during our first loop. As we put some wind between
us and the refineries of Texas City, the graph shoots skyward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that,'' exclaims Alvarez, who should be matter-of-fact
about such things.
</P>
<P>
   The graph shows ozone at over 150 parts per billion. The
acceptable EPA standard for a single hour is 120. The graph
moderates for a short while as we head toward and over Houston's
skyline. Now it is spiking up again. The contributors are not
refineries and chemical plants but cars along I-10, with emissions
that include such poisons as carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly Alvarez's laptop shows four abrupt spikes of sulfur
dioxide. They come from four stacks of a power plant under our
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Among the chemicals gauged are sulfate aerosols _ nasty,
enduring and precursing such secondary pollutants as sulfuric acid.
Sulfates stay in the air hundreds of miles.
</P>
<P>
   Shauck 's plane has gauged the air all over Texas. The Mexican
government has refused to allow monitoring flights over the border.
Such flights would not prove flattering. Mexico is a major
contributor to Texas' air pollution problems, particularly those of
Big Bend and El Paso. By the same token, pollution from Dallas-Fort
Worth has invaded Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   One objective of the Houston airborne study is to ``fingerprint
the power plant plumes,'' said Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   The route Shauck's plane has flown many times from Waco to
Dallas not only reflects pollutants from I-35's intense traffic but
also from the Big Brown plant and others. Alvarez recalled an ozone
reading over Waco one day pushing 100 parts per billion, not enough
for the EPA to swoop, but a sign of things coming.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, not a pleasant sight, even as blue sky abounds and the
view below is surprisingly clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a toxic cesspool,'' said Shauck of the air over the
coast.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not Houston's or the ship channel's problem alone.
Someone is demanding all that fuel and power, and paying
insufficient attention to cumulative results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-range transport of pollution is a serious problem,
and it's a global problem,'' said Shauck.
</P>
<P>
   Global meaning that Texas City is all of us.

 &HT;    A free spirit in this season of decision
 &HT;    By Brad Buchholz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We're on the cusp of autumn, the season of
decision. And so it is that 33-year-old Wanda Hall has spent some
time considering the essential question: What sort of choice does a
conscientious American make in this era of national prosperity and
comfort? Democrat? Republican? Nader? Buchanan?
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Hall has made her call. She's packing her bags _ and
moving to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Hall leaves today, in fact, for Arusha, Tanzania _ where she
intends to devote the next three years of her life to promoting
peace in the war-torn Great Lakes region of East Central Africa,
specifically Rwanda. She'll be working for Internews, an
international nonprofit organization that supports independent
media in emerging democracies.
</P>
<P>
   In Arusha, Hall will manage the Internews office at the site of
the International War Crimes Tribunal. Yet she expects to spend
half of her time in nearby Rwanda, a nation still reeling from the
deaths of 800,000 people during the genocide of 1994. Embracing the
motto of ``Peace and justice through media,'' Hall will travel
throughout the country with an African film crew _ showing
villagers a documentary about the tribunal and its aims, and then
recording responses from Hutus and Tutsis who watch the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be showing a film about the genocide _ but what the
tribunal is doing in the aftermath of genocide,'' says Hall,
sitting in the spare living room of the house she shares with her
mother in North Central Austin. ``We'll be traveling with mediators
and facilitators _ so there will be question-and-answers and an
open discussion about what they've seen. The idea is to encourage
dialogue, so that people can start voicing concerns and getting
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job will be to go out with a camera, at the end, and
interview people _ to get their personal testimonies and ask them
what they feel the tribunal can do for them. Then we'll edit the
responses onto the end of the documentary and show them to people
at future stops. I think, in the end, this is a project that will
help people begin to rebuild their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   A noble gesture, to be sure. But why Rwanda? Why gamble with
goodness in such a dangerous and volatile place? Certainly, there
is plenty to be done in the United States. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Hall contends, quite simply, that it's easier for an individual
to make an impact overseas _ particularly in a culture looking for
new truths after its old governmental and social codes have broken
down. ``I truly believe in peace and global stability,'' she says,
in a tone that rings more of pragmatism than pie-in-the-sky
idealism. ``And I've learned that you can create little bitty
miracles in an environment of chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   CHILD OF THE '60S
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Hall was destined, by birth, to take this journey. She was
born in Berkeley, Calif., in the summer of 1967, at the height of
the American peace and civil rights movements. Her parents were
activists. Mom worked for the underground newspaper; Dad shot
photos of National Guard troops firing tear gas at student
protesters at the University of California. Their house was a site
of Black Panthers fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a little girl, my mother would sing to me `You
Can't Always Get What You Want' by the Rolling Stones,'' recalls
Hall. ``Or: (From the Youngbloods), `Come on, people now/smile on
your brother/everybody get together/try to love one another right
now.' These were my `goodnight, baby' songs, my `it's time to take
a nap' songs.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of divorce in 1968, it was decided that young
Wanda would be raised by her mother, Carol _ who promptly sold the
family possessions to buy a new home, a red VW microbus with a
black butterfly painted on the front. ``My mother was a hippie,''
she says, ``and we lived a hippie life.'' Together, mother and baby
cruised the California coast, camping along the way, selling crafts
at flea markets, baking bread in a makeshift oven they'd place over
their campfire.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the hippies moved to Maui, Hawaii, and lived on the
beach. ``I have memories of getting food stamps and getting this
little thing of Dannon yogurt,'' says Hall. ``We'd set it in the
sand, put a candle on each side of it and share it under the stars.
She taught me about the constellations. We bathed in the ocean. I
learned what it was to be an Anglo minority in the Asian and Samoan
culture that was Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   It was fate _ and empty pockets _ that brought Hall and her
mother to Austin in 1975. They were traveling across the country in
a camper and had run out of money in the Texas town of
Stephenville. ``Look,'' people tried to tell them. ``There's only
one place in the state where you can live as you do, and that's
Austin.'' And so it was that the hippies finally settled in the
Texas capital, where, years later, Hall became a high school honor
student at McCallum.
</P>
<P>
   Hall received her undergraduate degree in International
Relations, with a minor in French, from Simmons College in Boston.
She earned a master's degree in International Policy Studies from
the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California.
Ultimately, however, the experiences of her youth _ a
hippie-child's faith in human nature and a real-life understanding
of food-stamp poverty _ prepared her just as well for the peace
missions that were soon to come.
</P>
<P>
   CHAOS AND MIRACLES Wanda Hall's first international job was in
Moscow, two years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in the
summer of 1993. She worked for an organization called Search for
Common Ground, and her mission was to try to help Russians resolve
social and ethnic conflicts within a culture where all the old
ground rules had been shattered.
</P>
<P>
   Some of her projects flopped _ such as an ambitious effort to
end ethnic discrimination against Georgians and Armenians within
the Russian military. But there were successes in the areas of
health and labor and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a (television) series on conflict management: ethnic
conflict and labor conflict management in Russia. There were six
30-minute programs, with the AIDS awareness message at the end _
and the whole thing cost $50,000,'' says Hall. Her voice rises, for
the passion of the past is still in her. ``I was 26 years old at
the time. And it was like, `Man. Things can get done!'''
</P>
<P>
   Hall lived in the heart of Moscow, sharing a two-bedroom flat
with a 70-year-old woman. Their diet was mainly potatoes and
carrots. Like the rest of Russia, she waited in line, in the cold,
for bread and milk. Once, they found a lemon _ rather, they paid a
small fortune for a lemon. ``We put it on the table and talked with
each other, for two days, about what we'd do with it,'' says Hall.
``Would we use it for tea? Would we use it in a torte?
</P>
<P>
   ``In this context, I sometimes got so frustrated with Americans
who patted themselves on the back after the fall of Soviet Union,
saying, `We were right. We win. You were wrong. You lose.' And now
we'll introduce the free market. Well, I saw what the free market
did there. And yes: A lot of people got rich very quickly in
Russia. But what about the person who'd been living on a pension _
and now it's all dried up _ and now he can't buy food because
prices are skyrocketing? So many people lost all of their
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, Hall moved to Russia's neighbor to the south,
Kazakhstan, and went to work for the Soros Foundation _ a non
profit organization devoted to building free and open societies,
particularly where cultures are in crisis. And there was crisis in
Kazakhstan. Children were fainting of hunger in the middle of a
school day. The nation's libraries had shut down _ and the
out-of-work librarians were selling the books on the streets to
raise money for food. There was virtually no central heat in the
city buildings, prompting residents to gather en masse on a single
floor to generate enough body heat. The general culture was one of
nepotism and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a diabetic in Kazakhstan, you were dead by the
time you were 15 _ because no one knew what to do to take care of
themselves,'' says Hall. But in time, she helped Kazaks establish a
nonprofit agency run by the parents of diabetic children to educate
the public about the disease and its treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Working miracles through media: This was Hall's mantra. Once,
she secured a grant to put portable video cameras in the hands of
30 Kazak citizens _ children, grandmothers, parents _ who hit the
streets to record their stories of the ``new'' Kazakhstan to be
broadcast on Kazak television. One 7-year-old shot video of orphans
living on the street, sleeping under cars. In the midst of
financial crisis, the orphanages had been closed down, the children
left to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could tell you the orphanage reopened. It didn't,''
says Hall, her voice strong and sure. ``But the project gave a
voice to people who'd never had a voice before. And the 7-year-old
girl who held that camera learned at a very early age that she had
a voice, a power inside of her. And when she's 27, she's going to
expect more justice than exists in that population today.''
</P>
<P>
   THE CALL TO AFRICA
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Hall left Kazakhstan in late 1996, having completed her
contract with the Soros Foundation and feeling the need to
re-energize. Hall had been shaken, too, by the killing of an
American compatriot she'd known there. So she spent the next 15
months in school in London, then returned home to Austin. She
reunited with her mother, took a part-time job and returned,
briefly, to an American life. Still, Hall pined for a new challenge
_ and this time, the voice within was calling her to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Why Rwanda? Because it was a culture in chaos, in need of small
miracles, and she'd been touched by the horror of the genocide. A
colleague had told her about his experience as a broadcaster in
neighboring Burundi _ producing little radio plays, written by
Africans, that dealt with themes of ethnic reconciliation. Again,
the use of media to achieve justice enthralled her.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many negative socialization forces have gotten power
through mass media,'' she says. ``It only makes sense to me that
positive ones could do so also.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, Hall learned that the best way to get a job in Rwanda _
since she had no experience anywhere in Africa _ was to fly there,
at her own expense, and get firsthand knowledge of the social
landscape in the Great Lakes region. So she spent more than a month
in the Rwandan capital of Kigali, knocking on doors, making
connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you notice about Rwanda is that it's a
tropical paradise _ and yet you know the people there have
witnessed a hell that I could barely imagine,'' she says now,
sitting in her mother's house, where there's a simple Rwandan rug
on the tile floor. ``If you drive downtown, though, you see all
these one-legged men hopping up and down the hills of Kigali with
the aid of a stick. I mean, the hills of Kigali are steep, and I
would not have thought such a thing was humanly possible. . . . But
the tenacity the people have for life there is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, on the eve of her departure, Hall's friends ask her,
gently: Why incur such an expense? Why subject yourself to personal
risk and discomfort? Why not stay in Austin _ and get a job at
Dell?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could have thought of anything else I could do with my
life, I would have pursued it,'' she says with a chuckle. ``But
when I closed my eyes and thought, `What do I want to do with my
life?' That's what I want to do, to explore a different culture
that fascinates me and accomplish something worthy _ something I
know I can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea how alive you feel, how human you feel, when
you share a meal with someone that lives across the globe from you,
and speaks a different language from you, and wears different
clothes than you. And you're laughing together, sharing each
other's humanness.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that Wanda Hall will never see Austin again. Her
mother has talked about selling their house, moving to cooler
climates in the north, and it figures to be a long time before her
daughter returns to America for a holiday visit. How much of it is
destiny? How much of it is choice? And what will she be thinking,
far from home, on Election Day, that day of American choice?
</P>
<P>
   ``As an American, I'm thankful for the opportunity to exercise
this kind of a choice _ a creative and optimistic choice _ that I
probably wouldn't be able to make had I grown up in another
country,'' says Hall, who intends to cast her presidential vote at
the U.S. embassy in Tanzania. ``When Americans cast their votes
this year, instead of thinking about how happy they are to live in
the richest country in the world, they might be thinking about how
they have the freedom to do something that is not the norm. To be
true to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Hall carries that thought with her to the skies, on the
way to a broken land, comfortable that she's cast the vote that
counts the most in the season of decision.

 &HT;    Easy living for former Dolphins coach, Jimmy Johnson
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMORADA, Fla. _ He wasn't bluffing. Jimmy Johnson pledged to
disappear. He held a news conference that was carried live on ESPN
and began by telling the sports world that he was done coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' he said, ``it's final and forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, he waved goodbye, hopped in his black
Corvette and came here, a town in the Keys that says goodbye to
visitors with a sign that says, ``Catch you later!''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but eight months later, he hasn't let anybody catch him.
At least not anybody outside his close circle of friends and
family.
</P>
<P>
   He used to live between goal lines. Now, at age 57, he lives
between mile markers. MM 85 and MM 90, to be exact. This is his end
zone. Other than to head off into the ocean, he has left this
little stretch of land only five times since January. To help the
Dolphins with the NFL Draft. To meet with ABC. To pick up his
father at Miami International Airport. To attend the wedding of
Stuart Weinstein, the team's security investigator. To be on hand
for a party for Nick Christin, his agent.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour into Christin's party, he plopped into a chair,
explaining that his feet hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had shoes on in a month,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He could be coaching the Dolphins. He could be in the Monday
Night Football booth or in the CBS studio. Instead, he is doing
exactly what he said he would _ fishing, snorkeling, checking his
investments on the Internet and, most of all, spending time with
the loved ones that, by his own admission, he often forgot about
while he was coaching football.
</P>
<P>
   He has turned down dozens of interview requests, including one
for this story. ``He hasn't talked to anybody,'' Christin said.
``And I don't think that's going to change in the foreseeable
future.''
</P>
<P>
   He also hasn't made public appearances, unless you count the
footage of him shown at Pro Player Stadium during Dan Marino's
farewell tribute.
</P>
<P>
   His face was only there for a split second, just long enough to
show him tossing a game ball across the locker room to Marino. Yet,
that was all it took.
</P>
<P>
   The 52,000 fans filled the place with the kind of boos normally
reserved for the Jets or Bills. And even when the video moved on to
something else and the boos faded, some fans began a chant.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.J. sucks! J.J. sucks!''
</P>
<P>
   THE BUY WHO COULD MAKE IT HAPPEN
</P>
<P>
   Giddy. That was the word people used to describe the feeling on
Jan. 11, 1996, the day that Johnson took the Dolphins job.
</P>
<P>
   Every time an NFL team hires a new coach there is optimism. But
this was different. The headlines trumpeted, ``J.J.'s back.'' No
full name necessary. He had led the University of Miami to a
national title. He had worked miracles in Dallas. He would do the
same with the Dolphins. Nobody seemed to doubt this, least of all
the coach himself.
</P>
<P>
   The fans were giddy. The players were giddy. Even the owner was
giddy. Wayne Huizenga held up a doctored photo that had Johnson's
famous hair replaced with a shiny bald crown, just like his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the guy,'' Huizenga had said, ``who's going to make it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson made a lot happen, all right. He made South Florida
buzz. He created seemingly a controversy-a-week. He put the
Dolphins back in the playoffs. Three times in four years. But, in
the end, he didn't make IT happen. He didn't take the Dolphins to
the Super Bowl as promised. They lost in the second round each of
his last two years _ by 35 points at Denver and 55 at Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there was saga of Jimmy and Danny, South
Florida's favorite soap opera until Elian Gonzalez came ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together _ the breathless expectations, the somber
finishes and the friction with Marino _ and you have a massive
backlash. Bring up Johnson's name on talk radio and listen to the
venom. Put his face on a big screen and hear the boos. Mention his
initials to a couple eyeing the menu at Jimmy Johnson's Bar &AMP; Grill
in Miami Beach and they go into a Dennis Miller rant. And not
because J.J.'s Classic Margarita goes for $8.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he's off in the Keys, doing whatever he's doing,''
said Lisa Mason, 32. ``He should've gone there sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say it's hard to find Johnson supporters north of
Key Largo. Just stop by his former place of employment and ask what
people there think of the boos. Watch Dave Wannstedt's face tighten
with anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a joke,'' said Wannstedt, Johnson's successor and
longtime friend. ``That's ridiculous. . . . For people to react
that way, it makes no sense. It's almost so ridiculous that it's
not worth commenting on. That's how I feel. Anybody who has any
intelligence about this sport and understands how tough it is to
win, would understand my sentiments.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones, Dolphins president, borrows the words Marino used
when the fans booed Huizenga: ``That's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Trace Armstrong, the defensive end who as union leader
occasionally clashed with Johnson, is quick to defend his former
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of silly,'' he said. ``A lot of times, he
can be an easy target because he does go out on a limb.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as Armstrong points out, there aren't very many storybook
finishes in the NFL. John Elway, he says, spoiled it for everyone
else. Made everyone dream about going out on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL isn't about Cinderella stories,'' Armstrong said.
``There aren't too many happy endings.''
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL HERO
</P>
<P>
   It's shortly after noon on Tuesday, five days before the first
NFL games of the season, at a bar that claims to have the oldest
liquor license in the Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie White, a bartender at Harrah and Dunn's Oceanview Inn and
Sports Pub, is testing out a new contest that will make its debut
Sunday. She is holding up a toilet seat in front of the big-screen
TV. The handful of locals who are sitting at the bar are taking
turns trying to throw a Nerf football through the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to call it Dan's Can,'' she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   She points at the insignia on her shirt _ New England Patriots _
and insists that she has nothing against Marino. Still, if you're
looking for a place where they still love J.J., where it still
feels a little like the summer of '96, then this is it. The Keys.
The land of many marinas but no Marinos.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the Oceanview. It used to be a biker bar, a place
notorious for bloody fights. For the last five years, though, it
has been owned by a couple of former University of Miami players
and roommates.
</P>
<P>
   The bar menu includes ``Jimmy Johnson's Famous Fish Sandwich.''
And in one corner of the room, right below Dennis Harrah's Rams
jersey and a picture of Gary Dunn and the '79 Steelers, there is a
photo of Three Rings, the boat that, to South Florida's dismay,
never required a name change.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen people are on board. Right in the middle sits Johnson,
wearing a floral shirt, holding his dog Buttercup on his lap and
grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy isn't in the Oceanview on this day. But he and his wife,
Rhonda, have stopped in. They came in a couple days after the
retirement announcement. Played some games. Had a couple of beers.
Everybody pretty much left them alone. But as Johnson got ready to
leave, the guy everyone calls Kooc couldn't resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't you . . . ,'' he said, as if trying to place the face,
`` . . . Dan Marino.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson smiled and said, ``No, he's taller.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kooc is seated at a corner of the bar, sipping a draft
beer. He explains that his real name is Richard Hoffert. ``I'm the
cook,'' he says. ``So they call me Kooc _ like cook backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   He gives Johnson the ultimate compliment. Calls him a local, a
Conch. A rich Conch, but a Conch nonetheless. The man seated next
to Kooc _ he will only say everyone calls him ``Buck'' _ chimes in
with his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan should've retired earlier,'' he says. ``I thought Jimmy
did a good job. They give Dan that thing at the stadium and they
boo Jimmy? Down here, everyone treats him like a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's home is located within walking distance of everything
Buttercup could ever need _ Pet Stuff, Pet Groomer and the Upper
Keys Animal Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Johnson is a homebody. He occasionally is
seen at Woody's, the Old Tavernier Restaurant or Whale Harbor. And
he stops by Smuggler's Cove Marina about once a week. That's where
he fills up his boat's gas tank and gets a bite to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he'll buy everyone a drink,'' Buck says. ``Well, the
locals at least.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, he doesn't like to call attention to
himself. He likes to blend in, which can be tough considering some
of the people he has taken out on his boat in the last nine months
_ Wannstedt, Redskins coach Norv Turner and, surprise, former rival
Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The locals rarely talk football with him. Usually the
conversation sticks to safe topics. Like how the fish are biting.
But every so often, someone will toss out the bait _ a question
about Marino _ and wait for Johnson to lunge at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never does,'' said one Smuggler's Cove employee. ``He only
has nice things to say about Dan. And he really likes Huizenga. . .
. He seems to want to enjoy his life now. He seems very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what everyone who has seen him in in the last nine months
says. From afar, this might not look like a happy ending. Up close,
they insist, Johnson is happier than ever. No matter what people up
in Miami are doing when they see his face on a giant screen.

 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic and Republican strategists concur that
in the not-so-distant future presidential debates will be staged on
the World Wide Web, perhaps with online voters posing questions to
the White House contestants.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 2000 race, Al Gore and George Bush have yet to agree
on ground rules for the traditional televised debates, let alone
deal with the uncharted risks of political combat in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the vice president and the Texas governor have
fully integrated the Internet into their campaigns. Each side has
thoroughly revamped its Web site for the general election contest,
with results that are far removed from the novelty items of the
not-so-distant past.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Internet assumes a dynamic role in their quest for
the presidency, their divergent Internet strategies have sparked a
lively debate on which of them makes the best use of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're struck by the way the two redesigns reflect what each of
the campaigns chooses to emphasize,'' Tucker Eskew, senior
communications adviser for the Bush campaign, said in a telephone
interview from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our site,'' he added, ``allows for much more intense
personalization, while the Gore site emphasizes the ability to
create (linked) interest group Web sites. Philosophically, Bush
focuses on the individual while the vice president's approach is
mired more in an interest-group style.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using our Internet site to rally our supporters and get
our message out aggressively. They don't do that,'' countered Ben
Green, a veteran political webmaster who has served as Gore's
director of Internet operations since last February.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Nashville, where he sometimes
appears on an always-on office webcam, Green asserted that ``one of
the clearest differences between our site and their site is that on
ours ... you can see the campaign actually as it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web address for Gore is: www.algore.com. The Web address for
Bush is: www.georgewbush.com
</P>
<P>
   Each side claims credit for having scored some notable firsts in
their online duel. Still, visitors to the Gore and Bush sites are
more likely to be struck by how similar they are in their basic
purpose, if not in their individual personality.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns make extensive use of powerful search engines
that are able to find archived issues papers, campaign speeches and
press releases on virtually every topic that has been in the news _
and quite a few that have not.
</P>
<P>
   They also let users customize the Web sites to reflect their
home state, their choice of English or Spanish, and a long laundry
list of specific interests. Both sites adhere to a rigorous privacy
code. Gore and Bush send a ``personalized'' electronic thank you
note to anyone who signs up.
</P>
<P>
   Each site also pushes the digital envelope into the broadband
future by offering extensive audio and video materials. Bush posts
all his campaign ads, including a 30-second spot a supposed
``first'' devoted exclusively to plugging his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   One Bush response to the unique Gore webcam is a ``daily trivia
contest.'' If they answer correctly, visitors can win a Bush coffee
mug.
</P>
<P>
   One difference: The Bush campaign shuns online donations while
the Gore site actively solicits contributions for a ``General
Election Legal &AMP; Accounting Compliance Fund.'' That reflects a
legal loophole in the campaign laws. Otherwise, the campaigns are
now limited to spending $68 million apiece in taxpayer subsidies
which must also cover the cost of their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have so far posted only one of their campaign ads.
But they seem to be ahead in the video streaming race by featuring
frequent ``live'' appearances of Gore and his running mate, Sen.
Joe Lieberman, on the campaign trail. The Bush site counters with a
link to CNN.com, where viewers can watch ``live'' Bush coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps license vendors to sell campaign-related materials
online, beyond the usual buttons and balloons. Goregear.com, for
example, offers $55 rolls of ``Gay &AMP; Lesbian Outreach Lapel
Stickers,'' an item not to be found at georgewbushstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP outlet advertises, at $32.40 a case, 16-ounce plastic
bottles of ``George W. Bush Drinking Water,'' which is said to
``come naturally from underground springs in the heart of
Kentucky's famous Blue Grass region.''
</P>
<P>
   According to PC Data Online, a leading Web site traffic tracking
service, for the week that ended Aug. 19, the official Bush site
attracted 193,000 unique visitors while Gore's attracted 175,000.
Each campaign also currently sends targeted e-mail updates to more
than 200,000 people who have signed up for them.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns continue to devise more strategies to lure even
more ``eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Eskew and Green envision the day when the Internet will
assume a leading role in interactive presidential debates. One
possibility: Users could review an extensive list of issues and
rank those that concern them the most. The candidates would then be
obliged to respond according to these ``votes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Story can end here. Optional add follows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Green, Gore's cyberspace guru, noted that ``when Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman are on the campaign trail, the Web site address is on the
podium. So it gets into the local news shots ... and on the
politics page of the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush staffers accuse the Gore camp of copying its new supersite,
which went up first. Said Eskew: ``They followed our lead. We can
cite many examples of Gore following Bush's lead with pale
imitations, such as Social Security reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush site is still in seeming need of some tweaks. A
recent ``personalized'' request on ``MyGeorgeW'' for Bush's views
turned up an apologetic ``sorry, we found nothing'' on Bush's own
list of topics for such subjects as antitrust, biotechnology,
defense modernization, uninsured health care, e-commerce, Medicare,
prescription drugs, the Vietnam war and the Balkans. On the other
hand, ``your interest in Social Security'' yielded links to 98 Bush
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor clearly has extensive views on all those
(unreferenced) matters,'' Eskew said. ``We're going to have to fix
that.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic and Republican strategists concur that
in the not-so-distant future presidential debates will be staged on
the World Wide Web, perhaps with online voters posing questions to
the White House contestants.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 2000 race, Al Gore and George Bush have yet to agree
on ground rules for the traditional televised debates, let alone
deal with the uncharted risks of political combat in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the vice president and the Texas governor have
fully integrated the Internet into their campaigns. Each side has
thoroughly revamped its Web site for the general election contest,
with results that are far removed from the novelty items of the
not-so-distant past.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Internet assumes a dynamic role in their quest for
the presidency, their divergent Internet strategies have sparked a
lively debate on which of them makes the best use of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're struck by the way the two redesigns reflect what each of
the campaigns chooses to emphasize,'' Tucker Eskew, senior
communications adviser for the Bush campaign, said in a telephone
interview from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our site,'' he added, ``allows for much more intense
personalization, while the Gore site emphasizes the ability to
create (linked) interest group Web sites. Philosophically, Bush
focuses on the individual while the vice president's approach is
mired more in an interest-group style.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using our Internet site to rally our supporters and get
our message out aggressively. They don't do that,'' countered Ben
Green, a veteran political webmaster who has served as Gore's
director of Internet operations since last February.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Nashville, where he sometimes
appears on an always-on office webcam, Green asserted that ``one of
the clearest differences between our site and their site is that on
ours ... you can see the campaign actually as it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web address for Gore is: www.algore.com. The Web address for
Bush is: www.georgewbush.com
</P>
<P>
   Each side claims credit for having scored some notable firsts in
their online duel. Still, visitors to the Gore and Bush sites are
more likely to be struck by how similar they are in their basic
purpose, if not in their individual personality.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns make extensive use of powerful search engines
that are able to find archived issues papers, campaign speeches and
press releases on virtually every topic that has been in the news _
and quite a few that have not.
</P>
<P>
   They also let users customize the Web sites to reflect their
home state, their choice of English or Spanish, and a long laundry
list of specific interests. Both sites adhere to a rigorous privacy
code. Gore and Bush send a ``personalized'' electronic thank you
note to anyone who signs up.
</P>
<P>
   Each site also pushes the digital envelope into the broadband
future by offering extensive audio and video materials. Bush posts
all his campaign ads, including a 30-second spot a supposed
``first'' devoted exclusively to plugging his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   One Bush response to the unique Gore webcam is a ``daily trivia
contest.'' If they answer correctly, visitors can win a Bush coffee
mug.
</P>
<P>
   One difference: The Bush campaign shuns online donations while
the Gore site actively solicits contributions for a ``General
Election Legal &AMP; Accounting Compliance Fund.'' That reflects a
legal loophole in the campaign laws. Otherwise, the campaigns are
now limited to spending $68 million apiece in taxpayer subsidies
which must also cover the cost of their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have so far posted only one of their campaign ads.
But they seem to be ahead in the video streaming race by featuring
frequent ``live'' appearances of Gore and his running mate, Sen.
Joe Lieberman, on the campaign trail. The Bush site counters with a
link to CNN.com, where viewers can watch ``live'' Bush coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps license vendors to sell campaign-related materials
online, beyond the usual buttons and balloons. Goregear.com, for
example, offers $55 rolls of ``Gay &AMP; Lesbian Outreach Lapel
Stickers,'' an item not to be found at georgewbushstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP outlet advertises, at $32.40 a case, 16-ounce plastic
bottles of ``George W. Bush Drinking Water,'' which is said to
``come naturally from underground springs in the heart of
Kentucky's famous Blue Grass region.''
</P>
<P>
   According to PC Data Online, a leading Web site traffic tracking
service, for the week that ended Aug. 19, the official Bush site
attracted 193,000 unique visitors while Gore's attracted 175,000.
Each campaign also currently sends targeted e-mail updates to more
than 200,000 people who have signed up for them.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns continue to devise more strategies to lure even
more ``eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Eskew and Green envision the day when the Internet will
assume a leading role in interactive presidential debates. One
possibility: Users could review an extensive list of issues and
rank those that concern them the most. The candidates would then be
obliged to respond according to these ``votes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Story can end here. Optional add follows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Green, Gore's cyberspace guru, noted that ``when Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman are on the campaign trail, the Web site address is on the
podium. So it gets into the local news shots ... and on the
politics page of the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush staffers accuse the Gore camp of copying its new supersite,
which went up first. Said Eskew: ``They followed our lead. We can
cite many examples of Gore following Bush's lead with pale
imitations, such as Social Security reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush site is still in seeming need of some tweaks. A
recent ``personalized'' request on ``MyGeorgeW'' for Bush's views
turned up an apologetic ``sorry, we found nothing'' on Bush's own
list of topics for such subjects as antitrust, biotechnology,
defense modernization, uninsured health care, e-commerce, Medicare,
prescription drugs, the Vietnam war and the Balkans. On the other
hand, ``your interest in Social Security'' yielded links to 98 Bush
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor clearly has extensive views on all those
(unreferenced) matters,'' Eskew said. ``We're going to have to fix
that.''

 &HT;    POPE JOHN PAUL BEATIFIES FATHER CHAMINADE
 &HT;    For release Monday, Sept. 4
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY _ After a century of prayers by his followers
around the world, Father William
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Chaminade was beatified Sunday by Pope John Paul during a
four-hour ceremony in the stifling
</P>
<P>
   heat at St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 pilgrims crowded into the vast square to
witness five beatifications _ including the
</P>
<P>
   much loved Pope John XXIII and the decidedly controversial Pope
Pius IX, who is accused by his
</P>
<P>
   detractors of being anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   After the 80-year-old pontiff proclaimed the beatifications _
the penultimate step toward sainthood _
</P>
<P>
   huge portraits of the newly blessed were unfurled in the square
to cheers and applause. As many as 7,000
</P>
<P>
   Marianists _ the order founded by Chaminade, a 19th Century
French priest _ were mingled in the massive
</P>
<P>
   crowd.
</P>
<P>
   For Brother John Lucier of Dayton, Ohio, the elevation of
Chaminade was the answer to more six decades of prayer. Even though
the searing heat in the square was taking its toll on Lucier, 83,
he considered it
</P>
<P>
   inconceivable to miss a minute of Sunday's ceremony. ``I would
have been there on my knees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've prayed for this every day for 63 years,'' said Lucier, a
retired chemistry professor at the
</P>
<P>
   University of Dayton, which was founded by Marianists. ``It's
the capstone of a lifetime. I didn't think
</P>
<P>
   I would live to see it. Someday he'll be declared a saint, but I
don't know if I'll be around for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the approximately 125 pilgrims from Dayton said after
the ceremony that they were elated
</P>
<P>
   and exhausted from standing _ or for the lucky, sitting _ for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Wagner, the university's director of Marianist activity, an
official at the university,
</P>
<P>
   was moved by the mass humanity gathered in the square. ``There
was this press of the crowd with everybody
</P>
<P>
   wanting their own place in the midst of this very holy
celebration,'' she said. ``I feel a bit overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, to realize that we are part of something so much bigger _
I don't think that I could put words to the experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who appeared before the adoring crowd in kelly green
robes, read the beatification
</P>
<P>
   proclamations from under a large tent. His image was displayed
on huge TV screens in the square. He
</P>
<P>
   appeared tired and frail.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff recalled the story of Chaminade, who was persecuted
during the French Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Chaminade, founded the Marianists, a religious order credited
with reviving Christianity in post-
</P>
<P>
   revolutionary France. The Society of Mary was established in the
United States in 1849 in Dayton and
</P>
<P>
   Marianists have a strong presence in the city, most notably at
the university.
</P>
<P>
   Marianists work in 34 countries with ministries in secondary and
primary schools, universities and
</P>
<P>
   technical schools, parishes, renewal centers, missions and
social justice enterprises. The gathering in Rome
</P>
<P>
   this weekend was the largest in the order's history.
</P>
<P>
   Also beatified were Italian bishop Tommaso Reggio (1818-1901)
and Irish abbot Columba
</P>
<P>
   Marmion.
</P>
<P>
   In his homily, the Pope addressed the controversy over Pius IX,
saying that holiness was not
</P>
<P>
   immune to historical influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctity lives in history, and every saint is not removed from
the limitations and personal conditioning of our human nature,'' he
said. ``By beatifying one of its sons, the Church does not
celebrate particular historical choices he made but rather points
him out for imitation and veneration for his virtues.''
</P>
<P>
   Pius was pope from 1846 to 1878, the longest reign in church
history. This period coincided with the
</P>
<P>
   loss of the papacy's temporal power and vast land holdings when
Italy was unified.
</P>
<P>
   Pius, who adamantly opposed religious tolerance and defined the
doctrine of infallibility, once referred to
</P>
<P>
   Jews as ``dogs.'' Jews and progressive Catholics opposed his
beatification.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the crowd roared in approval when he spoke of Pope
John XXIII, known as ``The Good
</P>
<P>
   Pope.''
</P>
<P>
   For 22-year-old Adam Molina, a University of Dayton senior from
Cincinnati, the weekend brought the grand scale of his church into
focus. ``It's affected me profoundly,'' Molina said later during a
tour of the Roman Forum
</P>
<P>
   with friends. ``Things make more sense to me. Words I've used
all my life _ all these other people use
</P>
<P>
   them too _ now make sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Molina said the experiences of the weekend would linger with him
for the rest of his life. ``You can
</P>
<P>
   only get a true sense of our Catholic faith by taking a journey
like this,'' he said.

FOOLED BY FAKE NEWS RELEASE, BLOOMBERG TAKES STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Noon, Wednesday, Aug. 30. The ``page one'' meeting
for Bloomberg News is in full swing at a conference room in
Bloomberg's midtown Manhattan headquarters. Linked by Webcams and
videoscreens, editors in Europe and the United States chew over the
day's hot news, discussing what stories belong on Bloomberg's main
screen.
</P>
<P>
   And like any good editor in chief, Matthew Winkler, a former
Wall Street Journal reporter who has led Bloomberg News since it
was founded a decade ago, is not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``This needs to be overhauled,'' Winkler said as he looked at a
story about Royal Philips Electronics, the Dutch conglomerate, with
a confusing lead sentence. On another story, he explained, ``I'm
not a big fan of this word `robust,' because it means whatever you
want it to mean. Do we mean growing demand, increasing demand? Then
why don't we say that?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the meeting was solidly in the tradition of the daily
conferences that newspapers use to discuss what stories to run.
There was just one difference. Every story that Winkler critiqued
was already out on Bloomberg's 144,000 workstations, a staple of
trading floors around the world. These first-version wire stories
needed work to meet Winkler's standards of clarity and style, but
they were accurate and on hot topics. So they were posted, whatever
their imperfections, awaiting further updates and more editing.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of financial news services, the most hotly
competitive place in journalism today. With 950 reporters and 79
bureaus, Bloomberg competes to break news with Dow Jones, Reuters
and Bridge News, along with newspaper Web sites, dozens of smaller
Internet sites and even gossipy chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The race never ends, moving with the sun from Asia to Europe to
the United States, and at any moment fortunes in trading profits
are staked on the speed and accuracy of the news that Bloomberg and
its competitors provide.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fast-growing, lucrative business, but the intense
pressure to be first is not without cost. Ten days ago, Bloomberg
committed a spectacular blunder, falling for a fake press release
and publishing a story that caused shares in Emulex, a California
communications equipment company, to plunge 55 points in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The release, which came over Internet Wire, a service that
distributes company news, claimed in suspiciously vague terms that
Emulex's chief executive had resigned and the company would restate
its earnings. Bloomberg reported the release as fact, even though
it was unable to confirm with Emulex that the news was real.
</P>
<P>
   The hoax was quickly discovered, and Emulex stock regained its
value within hours. On Thursday, federal prosecutors charged Mark
S. Jakob, a 23-year-old California man, with securities fraud for
the hoax. But Emulex investors who panicked and sold their shares
as the stock plunged are unlikely to recover their losses. One
angry investor has now sued Bloomberg and Internet Wire, claiming
he lost $15,000 as a result of their recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bloomberg will continue to use information from PR
Newswire and Business Wire, the leading press release wires, as
well as Internet Wire, without verifying its authenticity in most
cases, Winkler said. Financial news services and other media
organizations get press releases 15 minutes before they are
distributed to the general public, fueling a furious competition
among the news services to rewrite them for their subscribers
during their window of exclusivity.
</P>
<P>
   Given the sheer crush of news releases, wire services do not
generally verify their authenticity, a task impossible under
current competitive pressures. Traders watch for news intently and
react almost instantaneously to news, creating intense pressure on
the financial wires to be first with headlines and stories. To keep
up, Bloomberg has a team of seven people at its Princeton, N.J.,
bureau who monitor press release wires full-time.
</P>
<P>
   The job has grown harder, said Brian Rooney, a Bloomberg editor
at large. The number of releases has soared over the last two
years, largely due to the growing number of public companies and
startups looking for publicity, Rooney said. ``You end up with just
a lot more releases to sort through than you ever had before,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler said the hoax had caused Bloomberg to toughen its
standards on using information from press releases, even those from
PR Newswire and Business Wire. If the releases have unusual
information, Bloomberg reporters will now be required to confirm
that they are real before using them. For example, if a company
reported earnings of 60 cents per share and analysts expected
earnings of 58 cents, that would not be unusual. But if the release
reported earnings of 20 cents, a reporter would confirm the
accuracy of the release with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything on those releases is remotely a surprise, yes,
we're calling them,'' Winkler said. ``It doesn't matter who's
saying it's kosher. We're still going to ask the rabbi to bless
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Winkler also insisted the new policy would not slow
Bloomberg. ``We don't intend to sacrifice speed in any way,'' he
said. Reporters would have to be better prepared to reach company
public relations officers immediately.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some public relations firms say they want the press
release wires to institute uniform security standards to lessen the
risk of another hoax. The news wires should be careful in dealing
with press release wires that do not have strict security, said Tim
Johnson, managing director of the San Francisco office of
Golin/Harris International, a public relations agency that
represents about 450 clients worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are careful with every release,'' said David Armon, senior
vice president of PR Newswire. His company conducts a credit check
and calls back companies to verify that they are represented by the
public relations firm that claims to represent them, he said.
Still, PR Newswire cannot vouch for the factual accuracy of its
releases, he said. ``As long as the attribution checks out, the
clients are allowed to say pretty much what they want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet Wire says it has tightened its security policies since
the hoax.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the hoax is unlikely to hurt Bloomberg's long-term
growth. Thanks to the explosion in financial markets, Bloomberg has
17 times as many subscribers as it did a decade ago. The company,
which charges more than $15,000 annually for a subscription to its
workstations, will have revenue of more than $2 billion this year,
and Bloomberg's journalistic ambitions are swelling alongside its
financial resources. The service has added almost 200 reporters in
the last eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler said the hoax was a chance for Bloomberg to improve its
standards and encourage its reporters to think more critically
about unexpected news. ``This event to me is an opportunity for us
to get to a much higher level,'' he said. ``What I'm trying to do
after last week is to try to get people to think.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Winkler is intensifying efforts to have reporters
prepare for events they know are coming, like earnings releases. If
a release is unusual, reporters will be able to react immediately,
confirming the authenticity of the release.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bloomberg may not be able to put the hoax in the past as
quickly as it would like. The Emulex shareholder who says he lost
$15,000 as a result of the hoax sued Bloomberg and Internet Wire on
Thursday in federal court in New York, claiming they recklessly
disseminated misleading information about Emulex.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg and Internet Wire declined to comment on the suit,
which seeks class-action status. Floyd Abrams, an expert in First
Amendment law, said the plaintiffs face an uphill battle. The First
Amendment protects honest mistakes in news gathering, and
information about a publicly traded company is by definition of
interest to the public, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say Bloomberg would have a powerful defense, and the
only circumstances they would not is if they knew what they were
publishing was false,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ This summer, Microsoft executives have been
coyly popping a videotape into a VCR here and showing visitors the
Computer Age equivalent of the blinding power of a race car
dragster on nitro fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The tape reveals a photo-realistic schoolroom where an invisible
hand is poised to drop a table-tennis ball with an X on it. As it
falls, the viewer sees that it is about to land in a sea of 1,024
similar balls, each perched on a hair-trigger mousetrap.
</P>
<P>
   When the ball hits, mayhem ensues; table-tennis balls _ each one
accurately shaded and shadowed _ explode in all directions,
bouncing and ricocheting in concert and then slowly coming to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Rendering such an image in what the digerati call ``real time,''
with all the computing done as the balls collide so that each
collision can be altered on the fly, is today beyond the ability of
all but the most powerful supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if all goes according to plan, Microsoft hopes to begin
selling a game computer with this kind of computing power for
around $300 in October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The machine, called Xbox, is both a technical tour de force by
the world's largest software publisher and a shot fired across the
bow of the giant Sony Corp., which now dominates the $20 billion
videogame industry.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is serving notice that it is intent upon extending its
reach from the office into the living room.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also an immense gamble by a company that has vowed to
commit $500 million to elbow its way into a consumer electronics
market governed today by a business model that is anathema to most
of the strategies Microsoft has, until now, pursued in the personal
computer software business. Unlike the PC software business, which
allows some independence, the game industry is based on a model
that requires the payment of royalties by software developers to
device makers, a model that would require Microsoft to depend on
other companies to ensure the success of its product.
</P>
<P>
   Will Microsoft be able to move with impunity into one of the
world's most lucrative consumer electronics markets, or is this an
act of hubris, evidence that the software titan, in its desperate
push for growth, has finally overreached?
</P>
<P>
   While the company's specmanship has been greeted
enthusiastically by those involved with videogames, some analysts
are far from convinced that Microsoft will have an easy road in a
marketplace that is unfamiliar and that is already dominated by
Japanese consumer powerhouses like Sony, Nintendo and Sega
Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about Sony's crown jewels,'' said Peter Sealey,
a professor of marketing at the Haas School of Business of the
University of California at Berkeley, where he also serves as
co-director of the Center for Marketing and Technology. ``Their
installed base is enormous and the kids are with them, and
Microsoft's greatest danger is in spreading itself too thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand and demographics may well conspire against Microsoft.
Since July 1998, the penetration of videogame consoles in the
nation's homes has begun to decline, to 35 percent from 37 percent.
The reason, according to the San Francisco-based market research
firm Odyssey, is that the home PC is also increasingly a game
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Until now Microsoft has largely eschewed hardware manufacturing,
preferring to let its hundreds of business partners take the risks
in a market that is known for razor-thin margins and brutal
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Microsoft has long prided itself as being what it calls an
``open systems'' software developer. No licenses are required to
write software that is compatible with Microsoft operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, in the videogame industry, software developers pay
fees to have their programs run on the manufacturer's game systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has little expertise in the world of the ``razors and
razor blades'' business model, in which game machines are sold
below cost and losses are made up from the profits on hit software
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, in the videogame business Microsoft will be
confronted by a hurdle its rivals know well, the same
``applications barrier to entry'' that the judge in the federal
antitrust case against Microsoft cited as being at the core of the
company's software monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tables are turned. When Xbox is shipped next fall,
Microsoft is likely to have only a handful of programs to sell with
its machine _ perhaps 12 to 20 _ while Sony will have hundreds of
titles for it Playstation 2 machine, as well as the thousands of
older Playstation games that will also run on its second-generation
machine.
</P>
<P>
   All of those obstacles are things Microsoft says it has
considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the games,'' said Robert Bach, the Microsoft
executive who is leading the development program. ``If you have
great games, you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bach, who was previously the head of the company's Microsoft
Office business, now heads the company's game division. In a recent
interview on Microsoft's campus here, he said that in practical
terms his focus had increasingly been on making sure Xbox reaches
the market successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is counting on the fact that there is nothing
sacrosanct about Sony's lead in the videogame business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bach pointed out that the dominant videogame
manufacturer had shifted with each new generation going back as far
as the Atari Corp. two decades ago. As the videogame approaches the
next generation this year and next, there is no reason the lead
should not shift again.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But there is one more obstacle just over the horizon: Microsoft
is betting that unlike the personal computer, the videogame-player
market will remain a stable one. While PCs have increased in power
every year, the game platform market has generally remained
unchanged for as long as five years, giving consumer electronics
companies time to recoup their investments.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sony, which has sold more than 73 million Playstations
worldwide and has more than 51 percent of the U.S. market, is
preparing to change the rules of the videogame business, according
to people familiar with the company's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft is making its flashy demonstrations and
releasing specification sheets showing supercomputer performance
next year, Sony has been preparing its own multimillion-dollar
campaign for the October rollout of the Playstation 2, which will
sell for about the same price as Microsoft's entry.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the most powerful videogame player ever introduced,
yet it is also a harbinger that the pace of technological change in
the videogame business is likely to accelerate quickly.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft will take the performance lead in 2001, it will
be with a powerful machine and little software.
</P>
<P>
   Sony could then trump Microsoft with a faster machine in a year
or two that could spell trouble for the software publisher: If the
videogame business becomes more like the PC hardware industry,
Microsoft may find itself locked in a bitter war over profit
margins in which it lacks the comfortable software cushion it
enjoys in the PC business. Sony has not publicly acknowledged that
it plans to speed up the pace but it has quietly sent signals to
its developers.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Sony has been engaging in its own game of
specmanship. This summer, what is almost certainly the world's
fastest graphics supercomputer could be found in a faded one-story
office building on a side street in Mountain View, Calif.,
birthplace of the semiconductor chip.
</P>
<P>
   The site's anonymity underscores the special significance of the
GS-Cube, a prototype Sony videogame computer that is being used by
a low-profile group of Silicon Valley programmers to aid a future
generation of game designers in creating software that is far more
lifelike than today's programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sony used the new machine to offer demonstrations on par with
Microsoft's this year at the annual Siggraph computer graphics
exhibition in New Orleans. One had impact similar to the Xbox
table-tennis ball demonstration: a real-time rendition taken from
the Hollywood movie ``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   The GS-Cube is composed of 16 enhanced Sony Playstation 2
computers. When harnessed together they are capable of drawing more
than 200 million polygons a second. That speed is more than 16
times faster than today's Playstation and more than twice as fast
as a Silicon Graphics Reality Engine, a supercomputer that is the
most powerful commercial graphics machine.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly Sony will say only that the system is intended to blur
the line between the videogame world and digital entertainment in
Hollywood. Some developers, however, believe the machine could
become a commercial product as early as 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony is going for rapid change of the platform, while
Microsoft is new to the old world of the stable platform,'' said
Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a computer industry
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Bach acknowledges the difference in strategy. The PC business
has historically been a marketplace of incremental change, he said,
while the &QL; 
videogame has followed a more stable ``stair step'' evolution.
</P>
<P>
   It may also signify that Microsoft, which until now has been one
of the principal beneficiaries of Moore's Law _ the observation
about the exponential pace of change in the chip industry _ could
find that it has become the principal victim.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Microsoft will have to lose money on each Xbox it
makes, Michael Jones, the chief executive of Intrinsic Graphics, a
maker of videogame-developer tools in Mountain View, Calif., asked:
``How many Xbox's can Microsoft afford to sell?''

BOOTLEGGED RACIST DISCS CIRCULATING ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early '80s the outlaw country singer David Allan Coe
released very small quantities of two underground albums of songs
that are among the most racist, misogynist, homophobic and obscene
songs recorded by a popular songwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Bootlegged by fans and college fraternity members for years,
those songs have recently been stirring up new trouble on the
Internet: They are being passed around as e-mail files accompanied
by sexually explicit and racist animation, and they are being
posted as computer files on Web sites like www.whitesonly.net.
</P>
<P>
   Coe, who has long distanced himself from the music and toned
down his act for his last record deal with Sony/Lucky Dog, has
decided to start making money from the old music anyway. He is
selling the songs on one CD on his own Web site for $45 plus
shipping ($25 for cassette), though he refuses to put his name on
the disc or packaging.
</P>
<P>
   All of this comes as Coe is being exposed to a new audience,
thanks to the Detroit rap-metal star Kid Rock, who invited Coe to
be an opening act on his current tour, which ended Friday. The pair
also recently recorded several songs together in a Detroit studio.
Some music fans are wondering how Kid Rock, who has collaborated
with black rappers and has made a living through appropriating
their music, can be touring with a songwriter responsible for
blatantly anti-black material.
</P>
<P>
   In one song on Coe's ``X-Rated Hits'' CD, he rails against white
women who sleep with black men, singing that it makes him want to
throw up; in another, the chorus has it that some blacks ``never
die/They just smell that way.'' The lyrics are a far cry from the
songs Coe is better known for writing: Johnny Paycheck's ``Take
This Job and Shove It,'' Tanya Tucker's ``Would You Lay With Me (In
a Field of Stone)'' and his own hits like ``The Ride'' and
``Willie, Waylon and Me.'' In fact many of Coe's ``X-Rated Hits''
even make Eminem's heavily attacked recent album seem
tenderhearted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in my office _ black, white, male, female _ is going
to Napster and downloading these Coe songs,'' said Randy Weiner,
who is president of Aka.com, a network of hip-hop and rock Web
sites. ``And the reaction is always the same: They laugh at the
first song they hear, thinking it's a funny country parody. But by
the third or fourth song about hating women and black people, they
start to get uncomfortable and angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Coe rarely performs his obscene and racist material in
public, despite fan requests, he does sell the ``X-Rated Hits'' CD
at his shows. It is unclear, however, whether he is also selling
the music at Kid Rock concerts because of conflicting reports from
fans and spokesmen for both acts. Despite being called several
times, Coe's manager, Bill Quisenberry, would not speak on the
record about his client's ``X-Rated'' recordings or their sale. A
spokeswoman for Kid Rock said that she was unable to reach the
singer or his management for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kid Rock is a strange amalgam of influences, reveling in
white-trash culture while appropriating black music, imagery and
terminology. Embodying the contradictions of the mainstream genre
of rap-metal, Kid Rock drops black slang into his songs, like
saying that he ``macks like a real G.'' At the same time he says he
is ``a John Deere-driving ... hick.'' On one hand, hiring Coe to
open his shows is a natural fit for the side of Kid Rock that
proudly says he was brought up in a trailer (though, like Coe's
unsubstantiated boast that he killed a fellow inmate who tried to
seduce him in prison, it's a dubious assertion).
</P>
<P>
   Kelefa Sanneh, the deputy editor of Transition, a journal of
black culture, said the concert pairing is evidence that hip-hop
has infiltrated so deeply into American culture that it is no
longer necessary to be hip, multicultural and cosmopolitan _ or
even to care about black culture _ to be a part of it. ``It's no
different than when Southern rock bands in the '70s were playing
blues-rock and flying the Confederate flag,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coe's obscene songs were released briefly in 1980 and 1982 as
two homemade albums _ ``Underground'' and ``Nothing Sacred'' _ and
sold through biker magazines. ``He recorded those when he was
riding with an outlaw motorcycle gang,'' said Bill Davis, a Web
designer who runs a David Allan Coe fan site. ``They were biker
humor records, but then they became a big hit. It seems like he
gets a lot of the young college kids with the `X-Rated' stuff, and
that then turns them on to his real music.''
</P>
<P>
   On Coe's official Web site, it is explained that Coe decided to
reissue the material on one CD as ``a collector's item'' on his own
label because he was tired of seeing other people make money by
selling bootleg copies. The Web site adds that ``he will not agree
to using his name on the records or to promote their sale.''

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ All around the National D-Day Museum, which landed
here on June 6, an invasion of art is refashioning New Orleans'
once forlorn warehouse district into a chic enclave of culture and
condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Old cotton mills and warehouses that stockpiled cargoes from the
Mississippi River as far back as the 1830s are being transformed
into art galleries, artists' studios, lofts, hotels, cafes and
restaurants in an expanding area of some 50 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   A museum of Southern art is rising near a former German brewery
that tells the story of the victory over Hitler, and an old
industrial building is being turned into artist studios, antidotes
to the crime that long plagued the derelict warehouse district,
which is sandwiched between the French Quarter and the Garden
District.
</P>
<P>
   While it began as a renewal district bounded by Poydras Street
and Howard Avenue from Convention Center Boulevard to Magazine
Street, by some definitions its western boundary has been pushed
back close to the Superdome, almost doubling its territory and
taking in much of the business district.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was skid row,'' said Donna Perret, director of Galerie
Simone Stern, one of the early arrivals. She recalled warily
walking the district's streets. ``I had a guard to make sure I
wasn't mugged and could get to my car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now gallery hopping in the warehouse district is joining the
city's traditional infatuations with dining and jazz. In an
open-house program called ``Art for Art's Sake,'' the 20 or so
galleries sprinkled around Julia Street stay open late on the first
Saturday of each month.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of revelers converged on the district on Aug. 5 for
the sixth annual White Linen Night, featuring gallery receptions
and (this being New Orleans) street music and cash bars,
culminating in a party at the Contemporary Arts Center, a converted
pharmaceuticals warehouse that became a home for visual and
performing arts programs in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   There was ample cause for celebration, said Patricia Gay,
executive director of the Preservation Resource Center, a private
nonprofit organization that has been guiding the revival from an
1832 town house on Julia Street. ``Whatever we do, we end up having
a party,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing frivolous about much of the art on display.
One prime showcase, the Arthur Roger Gallery on Julia Street,
featured the patterned paintings of Robert Gordy, the fanciful
sculptures and paintings of Ida Kohlmeyer and the work of the
Shreveport sculptor Clyde Connell, known for her totemic figures.
</P>
<P>
   It also recently showed giant granite monoliths sculptured by
Jesus Bautista Moroles of Rockport, Texas, who was featured in a
show of Hispanic artists at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, in New
York, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Many industrial districts, from SoHo in New York to the
downtowns of Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Newark, N.J., can claim a
certain amount of revival sparked by arts projects. But the
comeback here seems at least partly attributable to a commercial
debacle: the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition nearby at the
riverfront.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal-tainted fair, with accusations of improprieties,
including kickbacks, lost $130 million when expected crowds failed
to materialize. But by forestalling other development while drawing
architectural talent to the city, the flop appears to have planted
seeds for today's preservation and redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the fair was an economic failure, it revitalized
the district,'' said Lea Sinclair Filson, director of public
relations for the ultraluxurious Windsor Court Hotel downtown, not
far from the district. (In 1998 Conde Nast Traveler called it the
best hotel in the world.)
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, an architect, recently moved into a
warehouse that they renovated. ``It brought locals back to the
river, like a renaissance,'' she said. ``We have fond memories of
the world's fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Success, when it came, seems to have priced out many artists.
``We never went through the loft phase,'' said Gay, contrasting the
New Orleans experience with that of, say, New York, where artists
colonized cheap manufacturing lofts, only to be priced out by the
gentrification they had engendered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some artists have taken up residence in the warehouse
district, which abuts (some would say encompasses) another historic
district, Lafayette Square. ``We just sort of discovered it,'' said
Ellen Pincus, a jeweler whose work in silver and gemstones is on
display in Ariodante, a crafts gallery on Julia Street.
</P>
<P>
   She and her boyfriend, who both moved here in February from
Chicago, pay $920 a month for a one-bedroom apartment in a
converted cotton mill on Poeyfarr Street. She said they would like
more space but find the rents steep.
</P>
<P>
   But she said they love the warehouse district and the
opportunities. They were promptly put on a jury for the independent
film festival at the Contemporary Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chicago I couldn't have gotten on a jury,'' she said.
``It's like they were thanking us for just showing up. It's very
bizarre here, actually.'' But best of all, she said, she sold some
earrings to the novelist Anne Rice, who has a house in the Garden
District.
</P>
<P>
   Two other big openings in the warehouse district are set for
next year: the Ogden Museum of Southern Art of the University of
New Orleans, housing one of the largest such collections in the
nation, and Louisiana ArtWorks, a 78,000-square-foot complex of
ateliers and demonstration studios for artists inside the preserved
shell of the old Bradford Furniture Store, put up before World War
I.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the Ogden, being built around 1,200 works donated by
the philanthropist and businessman Roger H. Ogden, has opened a
temporary site two blocks away on Julia Street. One recent
exhibition featured artists' views of daily life in the South
during World War II, a show intended to mesh with themes at the
D-Day museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Ogden's new director, J. Richard Gruber, who came from
Atlanta, where he was founding director of the Morris Museum of
Southern Art, said the gallery scene was already more concentrated
here than in Atlanta and benefited particularly from the strong
emotional draw of the D-Day museum.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the biggest sign of the turnaround is the D-Day
building, a reconstruction of the Weckerling Brewery. Built in
1887, it has been expanded to 70,000 square feet at Magazine Street
and the former Howard Avenue, which was recently renamed Andrew
Higgins Drive in honor of the New Orleans shipbuilder who produced
the war's crucial 20,000 invasion boats.
</P>
<P>
   With its stark wartime artifacts and mixed-media exhibitions,
the museum has proved so popular, particularly with World War II
veterans and their families, that it issues timed-entry tickets to
ease the flow of 1,300 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   A second phase of construction is expected to expand the
museum's scope to the Pacific war, with the opening of a
5,000-square-foot exhibition scheduled for Dec. 7, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But the boom has its downside. ``We recently lost two artists
because someone bought the building,'' said Perret, the gallery
director. ``They had to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a far cry from the problems of old, as remembered
by Beverly Gianna, vice president for public affairs at the
Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau. It was not so long
ago, she said, that the population of the warehouse district
numbered two, both of them living on the street. Now, she said,
some 5,000 people have moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Perret of Galerie Simone Stern noted that ``crime is down
because people are stabilizing the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than a patina,'' she said. ``It's settled. It's
going to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Perret said she found the warehouse district more alluring even
than the somewhat larger French Quarter that remains the city's
biggest tourist draw. ``I love the Quarter like a village,'' she
said. ``But there's an energy here.''

 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Labor Day signals the start of the peak season for sports fans,
who can finally supplement their baseball-only diets with
smatterings of professional football, basketball and hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites like Viacom's CBSSportsline.com, Disney's ESPN.com and
the News  &UR; Corp. &LR; 's FoxSports.com cheer the coming of autumn, as
well, as fans increasingly flock to their PCs to trade gossip,
scores and injury reports.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, many of those sites also promoted new online stores,
as they figured fans would snap up jerseys, caps and other sporting
goods while checking up on their teams. Forget the fact that those
media companies had almost no experience in retailing: this was
during the high-water mark for e-commerce, when the mere mention of
the term was enough to send an Internet company's stock soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months later, these so-called ``sports content'' sites
are putting as much distance as they can between themselves and
their e-commerce experiments. They have seen the misery visited on
electronic retailers by investors, and they have seen, first hand,
the reasons Wall Street turned a cold shoulder to Web merchants. It
is costly, difficult work, offering few prospects for profit in the
short term.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say the sports sites are eschewing e-commerce
altogether. Rather, many of them are taking a new approach to
selling goods online, one that gives content sites a way to glean
the benefits of e-commerce while avoiding the headaches such an
effort can cause.
</P>
<P>
   The newest strategy is to place the site's store in the hands of
an outside company. This approach has not only given sports sites a
reliable source of revenue and a way to keep fans on their sites,
but it has also given rise to a new category of behind-the-scenes
e-commerce companies, who, analysts said, may be better positioned
for long-term success than some of the more well-known online
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives the sports content guys an easy way to monetize
their traffic,'' said Shawn Milne, e-commerce analyst for
E(asterisk)Offering, an online investment firm. ``And it lets them
get back to what they do best.''
</P>
<P>
   Milne said the leading company providing such services to
sports-related sites was Global Sports Interactive, which created
and runs the online stores of the Sports Authority and Group
Rallye's Athlete's Foot, among other retailers. More recently, it
has begun to do the same for FoxSports.com, with other sites to
follow, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rubin, the chief executive at Global Sports, says the
company handles all aspects of the store for the clients, including
customer service, order fulfillment and returns. In exchange, it
keeps roughly 92 percent of the site's revenue. ``All of my
partners are making money on e-commerce, while everybody else is
out there spending their brains out on marketing and building the
infrastructure,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the company's success, Rubin said, is that it
operates in a highly fragmented market. ``This is a $50-billion
market, and the biggest retailer is Sports Authority, which has
$1.5 billion in sales,'' he said. ``So there's really no one with
the critical mass to do e-commerce successfully on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, sporting goods stores sell 85 percent
to 90 percent of the same inventory. So instead of many companies
building Web sites, call centers and warehouses filled with the
same 90,000 items, Global Sports operates a central warehouse
carrying those items. It also has a single call center in which
representatives handle each store's customers separately. And the
fact that Global Sports operates anonymously _ customers have no
idea that they are not actually buying from the Web site they are
on _ means that it can avoid the marketing costs that have sunk
other e-commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   But such anonymity also carries a degree of risk for the Web
sites, analysts said. If their customers have problems, the Web
site's reputation suffers, rather than that of Global Sports. Jon
Richmond, who oversees FoxSports.com as president of News Corp.'s
digital media group, said that risk was small.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been pretty vigorous about testing and checking their
approach so they maintain quality standards for us,'' Richmond
said. He added that Fox Sports just rolled out its online store
with Global Sports last week, ``so it's a little early still.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the two companies shared information on
customer satisfaction, ``so we'll know what's happening there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Global Sports isn't doing this just for us,'' Richmond
said. ``They're doing it for Kmart, Sports Authority and others
who'll demand that they stay vigilant about things like customer
service and fulfillment.''
</P>
<P>
   Other behind-the-scenes e-commerce companies have found
increasing demand among sports content sites, as well.
EFanShop.com, for one, recently created a store for MSNBCsports.com
featuring licensed sports goods with the logos of professional and
college teams. Marc Andres, eFanShop's chief executive, said sports
content sites were ideally suited to such impulse purchases as team
jerseys and caps, ``because no one really wakes up in the morning
to say, `I think I'll buy a Chipper Jones jersey,''' he said.
``They do it while they're checking scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Andres said eFanShop relied on distributors or vendors to ship
75 percent of its products directly to consumers, and kept the
other 25 percent in a fulfillment center that is run by SameDay, a
company that specializes in shipping and handling e-commerce
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy White, MSNBC's vice president for business development,
said she was approaching the company's Fan Shop, as it is called,
as an experiment that could lead to stores in other areas of the
site. ``If there's a context for it _ say, a book review, and we
want to give someone the opportunity to buy the book _ we could do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The sports section of the site is an obvious place to start, she
said. About 20 percent of MSNBC.com's visitors head to the sports
section of the site, and sports merchandise lends itself well to
contextual selling, in which sites offer goods related to the
stories on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The two most-visited sports content sites, CBSSportsline.com and
ESPN.com, have also abandoned their in-house electronic commerce
strategies, but they have taken different paths. In December,
CBSSportsline sold its e-commerce business to MVP.com, which
operates its own online sporting goods store, in addition to stores
of corporate partners. For the right to operate the CBSSportsline
store, MVP.com agreed to pay $120 million in cash over 10 years,
said Michael Levy, CBSSportsline's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN.com shut down its store in August, and will reopen it in
mid-December. But unlike other sports sites, it will create an
online sports mall where different sporting goods stores will sell
their goods to customers. The general manager of ESPN.com, John
Skipper, would not name the stores that will participate in the
mall, but if the stores include all the leading sporting-goods
stores, that is likely to mean that Global Sports will essentially
be selling goods on ESPN.com's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Skipper said he was relieved to be free of
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good at creating sports content, aggregating a large
audience and working with marketers to sell goods to those
people,'' he said. ``We don't have expertise in figuring out what
jerseys or caps to buy. Retailing is a high-risk business anyway.
You exacerbate that risk by not being good at it.''

<P>
   ``Remember a few years ago when you ran a recipe for cracked
goat shins?'' a reader is liable to write.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are I don't remember and my only excuse is that I have
passed on approximately 3,800 recipes since this column was
hatched.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sieger swears he has read most of them and suggests that
I republish some of the best recipes. What he specifically had in
mind were three chicken-wing marinades first published about 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but first I have to tell you _ again _ about chickens, and
their night flights over Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they're sneaky about it. By day they cluck around the
barnyard looking aerodynamically unsound. And they try to prove it
with an occasional five-yard flight ending in an explosion of
feathers and chicken curses.
</P>
<P>
   By night, however, they soar into the clouds, headed for distant
barnyards and foreign lovers.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of their flight is overwhelming. Each chicken is
equipped with two (2) wings, standard issue for ducks, robins and
Boeing 747s. They have wings, ergo they fly. And they must fly
pretty far since their wings are savored from the Texas Panhandle
to Peking (that's what we called Beijing 30 years ago) and
Pakistan, enhanced by various marinades.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, chickens and chicken wings are found in
supermarkets, vendor stalls and county markets on every continent.
</P>
<P>
   Poultry distributors are all somewhat embarrassed by all this.
Hardly anyone gets to see the chickens fly. Yet here they are
trying to peddle wings. As a consequence they are often offered to
customers like Richard Sieger at distress prices.
</P>
<P>
   None of these marinades are very expensive, either.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
</P>

</P>
<P>
   1 smashed clove garlic
</P>

</P>

<P>
   1/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sherry
</P>
<P>
   2 minced green onions
</P>
<P>
   Combine in pan, heat until sugar dissolves, and pour over wings.
</P>

   PANHANDLE
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup ketchup

<P>
   1/4 teaspoon oregano
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup fruit juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Tabasco
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   Boil two minutes, and pour over the wings.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you cook them you should first cut the tips off
each wing and discard or save to make chicken stock. Then whack the
wings at the second joint so you have two pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Marinate refrigerated for at least a couple of hours. To cook
place on a lightly greased pan and cover loosely with aluminum
foil. Shove the pan into a 350 oven for 25 or 30 minutes, removing
foil twice to baste.
</P>
<P>
   To crisp the wings remove the foil and return to oven for
another 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The quantities of marinades listed above vary, according to the
number of chickens that crash-land in your yard between 10 p.m. and
4 a.m.

WON'T ANYONE QUIT? `BIG BROTHER' HAS PLANS FOR A NEW FACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to ignite viewer interest in ``Big Brother,'' the CBS
reality television show whose ratings have paled in comparison with
those of CBS's summer runaway hit, ``Survivor,'' the producers plan
to pay one of the six remaining contestants $10,000 to quit this
week, allowing the show to introduce a fresh face.
</P>
<P>
   The producers hope that the new entrant into the camera-filled
house, where the contestants have been confined for the past eight
weeks, will be dynamic enough to instill some dramatic tension into
the occupants' personal relationships. Dramatic tension is an
element the producers _ and apparently most viewers _ have found
distressingly absent from ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least from the American ``Big Brother.'' Unlike the
contestants in versions of the show in other parts of the world,
the American participants are overly aware that they are on
television, the producers said. Also, American viewers seem
unwilling to accept contestants who stray from mainstream values or
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely frustrating and confounding,'' said Douglas
Ross, one of the show's executive producers. ``Will and Jordan and
Karen and Brittany have given us some great television.''
Unfortunately, they are the four contestants the audience has
decided to eliminate. (The house's members nominate two potential
losers for the audience to vote on in elections held every other
week.)
</P>
<P>
   Left with six contestants who the producers say seem to be doing
everything possible to appear inoffensive, the show's creators have
decided to ``introduce a new impulse,'' said Paul Romer, the
producer from the Dutch company Endemol, which developed ``Big
Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Wednesday night the contestants will be presented with a
briefcase filled with $10,000 and given two minutes to decide
whether one of them will take the money and run. (The ultimate
winner of the game will receive $500,000.) What they will not know
is that if a contestant does leave, Beth, a 22-year-old from
Florida and a former alternate for ``Big Brother,'' will enter the
house as a replacement. (The producers revealed no other personal
details about Beth, other than Ross' observation that she was
``very attractive.'')
</P>
<P>
   This move has always been an option because the rules allow
anyone voluntarily exiting the game to be replaced. The producers
are resorting to the strategy, which CBS agreed to after some
initial reluctance, to stir up some conflict in a group in which
seldom is heard a discouraging word. Although the producers are
confident that someone will take the $10,000, if no one volunteers
_ or if the contestants cannot decide among themselves _ they will
withdraw the money and probably offer it again later.
</P>
<P>
   In another departure from the European versions of ``Big
Brother,'' no one here has volunteered to quit. ``It's something in
the American mentality,'' Romer said. ``You don't want to be seen
as a quitter.''
</P>
<P>
   That mentality seems to have affected ``Big Brother'' in other
ways, too, beginning with the extreme media awareness of the U.S.
contestants. ``In the American house, our contestants never forget
they're on camera,'' Romer said. ``In Europe they stopped thinking
of the cameras very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The American group, Ross added, ``are all trying to produce
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The American show is also completely devoid of sexual tension.
``Europeans have seen people hooking up in the house,'' Romer said.
``Americans are a little more prudish. Nudity is a bigger issue
here.'' Indeed, in the German version one female contestant courted
popularity by flashing her breasts on camera ``every 10 minutes,''
Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a bit of problem on CBS,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing has stunned the producers more than the vote last
week to dump Brittany Petros, a 25-year-old pharmaceutical
saleswoman from Minneapolis, distinguished on the show by her
avowed virginity and her green hair. She had previously won an
online contest as the most popular occupant of the house, but in
the recent audience telephone election to dismiss someone, she
easily received the most votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very surprised,'' Romer said. ``But maybe the audience
felt she was too out of the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly seems to be what Petros believes. ``It's got to
be the older people who didn't like the chick with green hair on TV
maybe becoming a role model,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' thrived largely because its most overtly scheming
character, Richard Hatch, took control of the game; but the
audience, which loved to hate Richard, never had a chance to vote
him off the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Richard would have been voted out of the house the
first week on our show,'' Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is clearly a large part of the problem with ``Big
Brother.'' American television viewers may love their villains, but
if you ask them to vote, they will choose more with their hearts
than with their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a traditional scripted show, audiences get hooked on the
villain,'' said Ross, whose production company, Evolution, has
created many other reality shows for American television. ``In
reality television, people start to think of the people on the show
as their friends, and so they seek to protect their friends from
the villain.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer said that in all the ``Big Brother'' versions, anyone
exhibiting ``antisocial behavior'' was quickly dispatched by the
viewers. But in the American version the threat of expulsion seems
to hang over anyone who appears the least nonconformist.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the producers should not have been surprised. Tom Smith,
the director of the General Social Survey for the National Opinion
Research Center at the University of Chicago, said that the
audience preference for inoffensive personalities on ``Big
Brother'' is little different from the ``conflict-avoidance''
exemplified by American politics.
</P>
<P>
   It is the reason, Smith said, that ``we have two political
parties that run to the middle, with both trying to outdo the other
in looking more moderate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We penalize parties and people who are extreme,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bland politicians and, apparently, bland contestants on reality
shows like ``Big Brother'' are the results.
</P>
<P>
   Petros said that she suspected that her expression of strong
opinions had inspired as many people to dislike her as to like her.
``Some of the others are just kind of `there,''' she said. ``How
can you dislike someone who's just kind of `there?'''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Big Brother'' producers were concerned enough about the
lack of a strong personality to propose a radical way to fill the
opening that might be created by one contestant walking away with
the $10,000. They were going to bring back Jordan, the student and
former part-time exotic dancer who was kicked off the show more
than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   After some negotiation about the terms of her reassignment, the
deal fell through.
</P>
<P>
   If Beth from Florida gets into the house, she will have her work
cut out for her. She hasn't been watching the show because she was
so disappointed over not being one of the original choices. And she
can probably expect a less than warm welcome. In Europe, every time
a new contestant entered the game, he or she was immediately
singled out for expulsion by the disgruntled holdover cast members.
No replacement contestant has ever won the game in any other
country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the producers believe this move is worth a try. ``We want
to give the show more energy,'' Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   And if this doesn't work, ``we have more ideas to stir things
up,'' he added. ``I'm sure things will start to happen. In the last
two or three weeks the prospect of winning the money is there. A
lot of scheming will go on.''

NEW ECONOMY: WHOSE NAME IS IT ANYWAY? 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a little-noticed decision in July, the World Intellectual
Property Organization forced an American woman, Virginia Comito, to
hand over the Internet address www.tonsil.com to Sued-Chemie, a
German chemicals company that had held a trademark on the word
since 1952. The address was deemed ``identical or confusingly
similar'' to a bleaching product called Tonsil.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, an arbitration panel of the organization ruled
that David Sallen, a Boston entrepreneur, would have to turn over
the domain name corinthians.com to the Corinthians, a Brazilian
soccer team. The panel decided that Sallen, whose site published a
handful of biblical quotations, had acted in bad faith, determining
that, among other things, he had hoped to profit from selling the
name to the Brazilian team.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the trademark holder prevailed. In the continuing
battles between the owners of trademarks and individuals with
Internet domain addresses identical to them or nearly so, the
trademark owners appear to be far ahead. Of 1,000 cases that have
gone before four approved arbitration boards (of which the World
Intellectual Property Organization is one), three quarters have
been won by trademark owners.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Gurry, the organization's assistant director-general,
points out that it would only make sense that trademark holders
prevail, as only companies that are fairly sure that domain holders
are acting in bad faith take their cases to arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The procedure is not for cases where you have some rights and
I have some rights,'' Gurry said in an interview from his office in
Geneva. ``These are supposed to be black-and-white cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew McLaughlin, president of the Internet Corp. for Assigned
Names and Numbers, the international nonprofit group that
administers the domain-name system, which is also known as ICANN,
defended the arbitration process, which started last December as a
way of giving trademark holders an easy way to resolve the growing
number of battles over names. He says ICANN plans a formal review
of the process later this year.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin pointed out that the statistics on domain name
arbitration are skewed because many domain name holders do not even
bother to defend their positions.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of ICANN's domain name arbitration system is the
Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy, a set of rules for determining
if a domain name holder is acting in bad faith or is out to hijack
a trademarked name. Only trademark holders can take their case to
one of the arbitration and mediation centers. The decision of the
arbitrators is not binding; companies and individuals can still
take thecase to court. And in November, the Clinton administration
passed the federal Anti-cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act,
giving trademark holders the right to take speculators to court and
to collect damages. But the arbitrators' decisions are enforced by
domain-name registrars, who carry them out by transferring domain
names, or canceling them.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four arbitration and mediation centers approved by ICANN,
the World Intellectual Property Organization hears most of the
cases, followed by the National Arbitration Forum in Minneapolis;
Disputes.org/eResolutions Consortium in Amherst, Mass., and
Montreal; and C.P.R Institute for Dispute Resolutions in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The intellectual property organization has come under scrutiny
lately by critics who say it is biased in favor of trademark
holders.
</P>
<P>
   James Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, a
consumer advocacy group based in Washington, says the
organization's decisions de-emphasize free speech in favor of
protecting commercial interests. ``The ability to call attention to
your information is important,'' Love said. ``To say that big
companies can do that and individuals can't is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, sorting out domain name rights is no easy job. Take the
case surrounding corinthians.com, which Sallen has not taken down
despite the ruling. For starters, there is the fact that the Web
site operated by Sallen contains little more than a few biblical
quotations and a missive stating ``This website is about to be
pirated by a huge corporation in Brazil.'' (Lawyers for the
Brazilian team argue that the biblical quotations appeared after
the complaint was filed, presumably to make it appear the domain
name was being actively used when it was not.)
</P>
<P>
   Sallen had earlier sent the Brazilian team an e-mail offer to
sell it the address, raising a red flag for arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the organization's litmus test of ``confusingly
similar'' is, well, confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Yahoo, which has just successfully argued that
several dozen domain names registered by the Data Art Corp. and
others, including ayhoo.com, eeeyahoo.com and yafoo.com, are too
easily confused with yahoo.com.
</P>
<P>
   A related question arises from the abundance of parody and
protest sites, some of which attach a disparaging or crude word
onto the trademarked name, as in the case of the London-based
electronics chain Dixons and a parody site with a similar and
suggestive name. Is anybody really likely to confuse one address
with the other? According to the intellectual property
organization, they could. The ``adoption'' of the Dixons name in
the address ``is inherently likely to lead some people to believe
that the complainant is connected with it,'' the panel wrote in its
ruling, which favored the electronics store and forced the parody
site to give up the address.
</P>
<P>
   Another case heard by the board was that of the World Wrestling
Federation, which argued that a California man was trying to profit
from reselling the domain name www.worldwrestlingfederation.com.
The federation, which has long maintained a site at www.wwf.com,
dating back to when domain names were limited to only 22
characters, took the case to the intellectual property
organization, which ruled that the address holder had acted in bad
faith, hoping only to profit from reselling the name, and gave the
name to the federation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, consumer advocates like Love argue that the rulings lack
balance and create precedents that may have far-reaching effects.
The domain name problem, he says, stems from the scarcity of domain
names, much of which will be alleviated when ICANN next year
approves new domain names to supplement .com, .gov, .org and .net.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a rash of celebrity domain name cases should
help keep the arbitrators busy. A case brought by the entertainer
Madonna against a California pornographer who until last year
published a site at www.madonna.com is pending. Madonna, who has
her own site at Madonnafanclub.com, is widely expected to win. But
the singer Sting, whose real name is Gordon Sumner, lost his battle
for the address www.sting.com after arbitrators ruled that the word
sting is generic and that Sumner had not trademarked it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when it comes to registering the domain names of
famous celebrities, it may take more than arbitration to solve some
cases. In May, the organization ordered the operator of a parody
site about Julia Roberts to hand over the domain name
juliaroberts.com to the actress. The operator, Russell Boyd, is
fighting back and has sued Roberts. But he confesses on his site
that what he really wants is a phone call from her.

RADIO STATION LEAVES EARTH AND ENTERS CYBERSPACE
</HEADLINE>
  By JORDAN RAPHAEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly before 9 a.m. last Monday, the disc jockeys on Channel
103.1-FM, Nicole Sandler and Andy Chanley, ended the station's run
of nearly two years by playing ``Come A Long Way'' by the pop-folk
singer Michelle Shocked. ``We'll see you on the other side,''
Sandler told listeners, and moments later, the
adult-alternative-format station, in Santa Monica, Calif., ceased
on-air transmission and began broadcasting exclusively on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly the first radio station to discover the Internet.
There are currently thousands of traditional radio outlets
streaming audio online, as well as several hundred more Web-only
radio operations.
</P>
<P>
   But Channel 103.1 was the first American broadcaster to depart
the FM dial and continue on the Internet without an interruption in
programming, according to the National Association of Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   The new Web-only entity, available at Channel1031.com and
WorldClassRock.com, is an experiment by its parent company, Clear
Channel Communications, which sold the station's two frequencies,
along with 83 others, to allay Justice Department concerns about
its recently completed $23.8 billion purchase of AMFM Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet provides us another means for people to consume
our programming content,'' said Charlie Rahilly, senior vice
president for sales for Clear Channel in Los Angeles. ``We're
trying to see if we can make this migration from over-the-air to
over-the-Web work, if we can monetize it and produce positive
operating results.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the station was not exactly a powerhouse in the Los
Angeles market; its weak signal did not provide full-market
coverage, and only 400,000 listeners tuned in during an average
week, giving it lower ratings than at least one local National
Public Radio station.
</P>
<P>
   But Channel 103.1 was an ideal candidate for a Web-only trial
run, Rahilly said, because its listeners were loyal _ more than
24,000 of them filled out an online petition supporting the
Internet move _ and composed mainly of affluent, well-educated
people aged 25 to 54, a demographic group highly prized by
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   By switching to the Web, the station no longer has to deal with
reception problems. Its digital stream of programming _ an eclectic
blend of techno-pop, reggae, new wave and folk _ is available, like
all Internet radio, from Kentucky to Kazakhstan, using free audio
player software like RealAudio's RealPlayer or Microsoft's Media
Player.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda O'Brien, 42, an administrator at an Internet start-up in
Boulder, Colo., has listened to Channel 103.1 online since she
discovered the station last year while on a business trip to Los
Angeles. Although O'Brien can tune her radio to KBCO, a broadcast
station with a similar format, she logs on at Channel1031.com 10 to
12 hours a day. ``I like the DJs in L.A. better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite listeners like O'Brien and the station's slogan,
``Worldwide on WorldClassRock.com,'' Channel1031.com is still
aiming at Los Angeles listeners, limiting its global marketing to
hyperlinks on the Web sites of other stations owned by Clear
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Regional advertisers do not have much use for a worldwide
audience, Rahilly said. ``If we were to attract too many streamers
from around the world and not be able to monetize all that
bandwidth, that would be the biggest sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel executives are also sticking to radio's
traditional financial model: selling spot audio advertisements
rather than interactive ad banners. To bring Channel 103.1's
advertisers on board, ad rates have been cut in half, Rahilly said,
adding that the station has already converted more than one-third
of its clients.
</P>
<P>
   The universe of potential listeners for online radio outfits
like Channel1031.com is expanding rapidly. According to a
soon-to-be-released study by Arbitron/Edison Media Research,
roughly 57 million people listened to radio stations online in July
2000. A recent survey by Forrester Research found that 56 percent
of Internet users receive audio on their PC's at least once a week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a lot of competition for those listeners,
and not just from other land-transmitted radio stations. Streaming
audio is available from a number of Internet outfits, ranging from
the software download site Tucows.com; to niche independent sites
like Dublab.com, which plays only formats like electronica and drum
and bass; to Webcasters like Live365.com, where aspiring DJs can
start their own online radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   BRS Media, an Internet company that tracks Web radio, found
nearly 4,500 online stations as of August 2000, compared with only
56 in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The way to pierce the dense digital clutter, said Sandler, who
is also Channel-1031.com's program director, is to run a
professional radio studio and give users a reason to seek it out
online. That, she added, means scrutinizing the music list even
harder, delving deeper into albums and increasing the percentage of
new music. ``I think people will come to us over, say, a SonicNet,
where you create your own jukebox,'' she said, referring to one of
MTV's online music services. ``They trust us to filter out the good
from the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest obstacles facing Internet radio are
technological. Listening to online audio is so far a very PC-based
experience; that could change soon with the advent of wireless
Internet technologies and devices like Kima from Akoo.com, which
transmits signals from a PC to a stereo. And, despite improvements
in compression and streaming technologies, Webcasts can still be
painful for users without broadband connections, punctuated by
breaks in the music.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Nelson, 30, a city prosecutor in Los Angeles, experienced
some problems when he tried to follow Channel 103.1 online. It took
him 20 minutes to download the audio software with his 56-kilobyte
modem, and another 10 minutes to make it work. The broadcast also
stops every 15 minutes or so because of Internet congestion, Nelson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it were still on the radio,'' he added. ``My wife and I
went out Monday night and spent $150 on CDs so we would have
something to listen to in the car. There's not much else to listen
to in L.A.''

`IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS': PERCEPTIONS, AND REALITIES, ABOUT RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
Maureen Corrigan, who teaches literature at Georgetown University,
is the book critic for the National Public Radio program ``Fresh
Air.'' 
 By MAUREEN CORRIGAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   It's not easy being white. Consider, for instance, the plight of
a white reader of Lena Williams' ``It's the Little Things,'' a
popular exploration of how racial prejudice in America affects even
the most casual social transactions.
</P>
<P>
   According to the black people (including herself) Williams
quotes, we white folks smell like dogs when we're wet, generally
look a lot older than our age (unlike blacks, who look younger,
since, as the saying goes, ``black don't crack''), shamelessly
coddle our misbehaving children (unlike black parents, who come
down hard on children ``showing out in public'') and, of course,
can't dance, party, cook or jump.
</P>
<P>
   White women go around flipping their long, straight manes in
public, which annoys surrounding blacks, who are sensitive about
their hair, while in locker rooms across the land, white men cower
in corners when black men undress.
</P>
<P>
   A white reader of ``It's the Little Things'' seemingly has only
two choices: either to kowtow to all the genial mau-mauing here or
to get defensive and, thus, confirm what the black people whom
Williams quotes also seem to think _ that white people are
close-minded, arrogant and often just plain dumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Little Things'' grew out of an article that Williams,
a longtime reporter and now a sportswriter for The New York Times,
wrote for The Times in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The article provoked such intense reaction, particularly to the
business about whites ``flipping and flopping and slinging'' their
hair, that Williams expanded her investigations into this book,
which is clearly modeled on Deborah Tannen's megabest seller, ``You
Just Don't Understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Tannen explored misunderstandings between the sexes that she
ascribed to different male and female linguistic styles; Williams
aims to chronicle ``the racial slights and indignities'' that occur
between the races _ the everyday kinds of ``little things'' that
wouldn't get mentioned in more formal racial discussions sponsored
by government or academia.
</P>
<P>
   For several months, Williams traveled around the country
participating in and sometimes mediating mixed-race focus groups.
Although ``It's the Little Things'' purports to expose remarks,
gestures and assumptions that offend Americans on either side of
the racial divide, black voices and views predominate here.
</P>
<P>
   Williams acknowledges that ``blacks appeared more willing than
whites to speak openly and honestly about their racial attitudes _
perhaps because we feel we have less to lose. Whites who shared
their thoughts and opinions did so, for the most part, only with
the assurance of anonymity.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of those anonymous whites pipe up in this book to register
resentment at affirmative action, at the O.J. Simpson verdict and
at blacks who talk back to movie screens, but even then Williams or
her black interviewees have the last rectifying word. ``We are a
vocal people,'' Williams asserts in answer to the complaint about
chattering movie-theater audiences.
</P>
<P>
   As Williams correctly notes, blacks have necessarily been
studying white behavior for centuries. But from the evidence of
this book, this hard-won experience has not necessarily generated
wisdom. Williams' interviewees spout off a lot of racial
generalizations and summon up all manner of stray anecdotes and gut
feelings to back up their essentialist convictions. Even when these
remarks seem true _ as they often do _ those truths are well known
and rarely provoke more thought.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling of the kinds of observations and musings, all
made by black interviewees, that compose much of the book: ``We all
know that once whites get in, they want to take over. They want to
be in charge, whether it's our fraternities, sororities or our
churches.'' ``Whites act as though they got all their jobs because
they were qualified. For years whites got jobs because their dad
played golf with the boss or their mother belonged to the same
bridge club as the boss's wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams does little to synthesize the remarks she has elicited
from others and weighs in herself with comments like ``Deep down,
many whites truly feel that most blacks look alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Since ``It's the Little Things'' deals with people's perceptions
rather than realities about race, the book doesn't have to trouble
itself over the accuracy of these remarks. And since hardly anyone
Williams quotes brings up the issue of class, neither does she,
although a recognition of class differences would have been a
welcome corrective to the prevailing impression here that all white
people are well connected and that all black people belong to an
undifferentiated mass.
</P>
<P>
   (``An American Story,'' the new memoir by the black journalist
and lawyer Debra Dickerson, offers a smart, nuanced counterpoint to
the strange silence about class in this book _ as does much of the
great African-American fiction and autobiography of the 20th
century, from Ralph Ellison to Malcolm X to Toni Morrison.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Williams' relentless depiction of the vast incommensurability of
blacks and whites makes even their most modest social interactions
seem as fraught with incomprehension as a lunch for Captain Kirk
and the Klingons. In the pages of this book blacks seem at once
utterly different from whites yet not at all differentiated from
one another.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the sociologist Orlando Patterson _ from whom on any single
page of his works one learns more about race in America than in
this entire book _ observes in ``The Ordeal of Integration'' that
Afro-Americans (his term of choice) are quintessentially American
in their values and traditions but have as much intragroup
heterogeneity as the many European-derived variations of white
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with ``It's the Little Things'' is the
paucity of its argument. Williams offers no tips to bridge the
racial divide that she highlights, beyond her suggestion toward the
book's end that we all lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the quality of the insights found here don't rise
above the level of your average Internet chat room, one wonders
what the point of this book is, beyond what one wag noted some
years ago when blacks began to earnestly squeeze toilet paper and
hysterically suffer from heartburn in television commercials:
Foolishness is the birthright of blacks and whites alike.

ICAHN'S MOVE FORCES GM TO CONSIDER HUGHES DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When General Motors announced last month that Carl Icahn was
buying its stock, Wall Street analysts quickly surmised that he saw
potential in the Hughes Electronics Corp., the satellite-television
unit.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, which acquired Hughes Aircraft in 1985, has
sought ways in recent years to unlock the value of the fast-growing
unit, whose coveted satellite TV operation known as DirecTV is
expected to have 10 million subscribers by year-end. Early on, GM
issued a Hughes tracking stock, which reflects the performance of
the unit. This year, the company distributed more Hughes stock to
shareholders. But the moves have done little to appease Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Icahn, who is known for identifying undervalued assets and
who recently made a $600 million profit on his Nabisco holdings,
has raised investors' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Harry Pearce, vice chairman of
General Motors, said GM was considering an outright sale of the
company, a merger, or partnerships and joint ventures with other
companies. ``We clearly believe that the market is not properly
valuing the company,'' Pearce said. ``We are carefully evaluating
the different options.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearce declined to name Hughes suitors but outlined the three
types of businesses that GM considered likely partners: direct
broadcasters and competitors of DirecTV, media companies and
Internet or broadband concerns.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, however, has several issues to sort out before a
deal can be brokered, and any announcement is probably months away.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that an outright sale of Hughes could create a
big tax liability. General Motors bought Hughes for $5.3 billion in
cash and stock, and some analysts suggest that it could fetch $60
billion today.
</P>
<P>
   Second, General Motors gets a credit rating boost by owning
Hughes, a valuable asset, and analysts say it would be unlikely to
take any action that would jeopardize that rating. They note that a
lower rating would adversely effect its robust consumer lending
business, which accounted for 26 percent of GM's profit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most stock analysts expect General Motors to do some type of an
equity transaction, a merger or stock exchange perhaps, with a cash
component. Pearce, too, was quick to point out that ``cash is
king.''
</P>
<P>
   But the automaker must decide what stock _ media, Internet or
otherwise _ it is willing to accept in any transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The most logical partner, according to stock analysts, would be
a media company. They point to renewed interest from Rupert
Murdoch, chairman of the News Corp., the media giant that held
discussions with Hughes earlier this year, according to people who
were briefed on the talks. Hughes' DirecTV would give Murdoch the
distribution he desires in the United States. But the News Corp. is
taking public Sky Global Networks, a satellite service for pay
television, Internet and data services, and it is not clear how
much Murdoch could offer and whether General Motors would be
willing to accept Sky Global stock.
</P>
<P>
   People who have been informed about the various discussions said
that General Motors is also mulling some type of combination with
several other media companies, including Disney, Viacom, and NBC, a
unit of General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Nabi, who follows satellite communications companies for
Merrill Lynch, said an acquirer might have to offer $60 billion for
the Hughes assets. But he warned that the acquirer or partner that
Hughes prefers might not be the one General Motors would pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a betting man, I think General Motors wants to let
Hughes think about it and come to them with an idea,'' Nabi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will go to the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   Icahn has not discussed his wishes but has simply notified GM
that he is seeking to buy at least $15 million in GM stock, and no
more than 15 percent of the company. News of his interest pushed up
both GM's stock and the Hughes tracking stock. GM's shares closed
the week at $73.125, well off its recent high of $94.625 in April.
The Hughes shares, GM's class H, closed at $34.813, also well off
their $47 high point earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   From a strategic point of view, Pearce said Hughes is grappling
with whether it should align itself with one company or strike
alliances with several content providers. ``We see competing
approaches,'' he said. ``We're trying to sort that out.''
</P>
<P>
   General Motors also has to decide whether nonmedia partners
would make more sense for Hughes. For instance, it could try to
merge with a competitor like Echostar Communications, which would
expand the customer list but might raise antitrust questions.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce did not discount the possibility of a merger between
Hughes and Echostar. Satellite makers now compete with cable and
telecommunications operators to provide Internet access to homes
and businesses. As such, they should be able to argue that cable
and telecommunications companies are the competition, not each
other, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes could even opt to merge with an Internet company _ an
approach considered less likely. Hughes is developing new satellite
programs that it hopes will create two-way transmission not only
with television sets, but also with personal computers and other
devices. So becoming a bigger part of the online revolution is not
out of the question.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the height of the Internet land rush in 1998, an
unusual story stood out from the rest: the tiny nation of Tuvalu
sold, for $50 million, the rights to its chunk of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvalu, a string of islands halfway between Hawaii and Australia
with a population of just 10,600, had rarely made world headlines.
But the multimillion-dollar sale, to an ambitious Web entrepreneur
in Canada, changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   The story really began when Tuvalu, along with dozens of other
nations and territories, was assigned its own two-letter suffix
that signifies an Internet domain. Under the assignment, Britain
received .uk, France received .fr, and Tuvalu received .tv.
</P>
<P>
   Into this picture came Jason Chapnik, a 28-year-old entrepreneur
from Toronto. Chapnik says he came up with the idea of registering
names within the .tv domain as early as 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started brainstorming,'' Chapnik recalled in a telephone
interview from his home. ``If we could have dot-anything, what
would we want? We made lists _ dot-info, dot-law. Once we hit on
dot-tv as a concept, we knew we had it.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting the rights to the .tv domain from Tuvalu would not
be easy. Chapnik sent written proposals and spent months
researching and making contacts with the Tuvalu government. By
1997, other people had come up with the same idea. By 1998, the
Tuvalu government had narrowed the prospects down to three
companies. So Chapnik and his wife, Jodi, took a vacation and went
to the islands to make their pitch. In the fall of 1998, after
months of negotiation, Tuvalu made its decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my wife won it for us,'' Chapnik said. ``Family is
very important to them. Coming down with my wife and not business
partners spoke volumes to them.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Chapnik secured millions of dollars in
backing from a leading Internet incubator, Idealab, which provided
expertise and the capital needed to pay Tuvalu and build the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Tuvalu is to receive the $50 million over the
next 12 years. Already, the company has paid the country $18
million. The payments so far have increased the country's gross
domestic product by 50 percent and allowed the government to put
electricity on the outer islands and create scholarships for its
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Chapnik had succeeded at turning his idea into a viable Internet
business company, dotTV, which is now 50 percent owned by Idealab.
</P>
<P>
   The company's business plan is simple. It wants to be the next
Network Solutions. As the wholesaler to the registrars of .com,
.net and .org, Network Solutions made millions of dollars
registering Internet addresses, largely because of the aura of the
popular .com domain.
</P>
<P>
   DotTV believes it can have the same kind of success with its
domain, which it says is made up of the most recognizable two
letters on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has its own site at www.tv, registers
addresses on its Web site and through third parties like Dotster
and GreatDomains.com. Most prices start at $100. Words and letter
combinations with higher perceived value, like call letters of a
television station, are auctioned off, starting at $1,000. Three
names _ free.tv, china.tv and net.tv _ have each sold for $100,000,
the company said last month.
</P>
<P>
   DotTV also has tried to sell domains in more unconventional
ways. In July, it partnered with the Internet auctioneer Ibidlive
to sell domains in an auction shown on television. The auction,
which ran during a commercial break of a Seinfeld episode in Santa
Barbara, Calif., made three domain names available and encouraged
viewers to bid online. One, beach.tv, sold for $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The company's most recent success involved the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences, which agreed to relocate from
emmys.org and emmycast.com to emmys.tv. It also sold .tv domains to
the Pax broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry that is exploding,'' said Craig Francis,
dotTV's chief operating officer. ``Even at $100 a pop, which is
what most names go for,'' he added, ``this has the potential to be
very profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis would not say how many names had been sold so far, only
that it was in the tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   To sell more names, dotTV is trying to make the .tv domain
synonymous with ``rich'' media on the Web, singling out
organizations that will use video, audio and interactive features
on their sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there is this fundamental shift in the Internet from
static text to rich and engaging information that is much more
television-like,'' Francis said. ``We want the .tv domain to tell
people that this is what a site is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But achieving .com-like status for the new domain could still
prove a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Shirky, a partner at Accelerator Group, a consulting firm
that works with Web start-ups, says the company's plan is based on
the scarcity of commercially available domain names _ a scarcity
that he says is not going to last.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that most of the `good' .com names have been
taken,'' Shirky said. ``But the crash of the Internet market has
cooled people's desire to pay buckets of cash for an
easy-to-remember domain name.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to dotTV's hurdles, the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names
and Numbers, the international group charged with administering the
domain-name system, plans to release a set of new domains, which
might include suffixes like .web, .store and .sex, early next year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only clear winner is Tuvalu. With some of the money
it earned in the dotTV deal, it has financed the process to join
the United Nations. On Tuesday at the United Nations, the
organization will have a flag-raising ceremony for Tuvalu.
</P>
<P>
   Koloa Talake, chairman of the nation's public sector reform
program and a member of the board of dotTV, is quick to see a
connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's recognition of Tuvalu as an independent country
has been made possible by the relationship with dotTV,'' he said,
adding that the company was helping Tuvalu ``get into the 21st
century.''

   &UR; BOTANISTS IRATE OVER CALIFORNIA STAMP &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A 33-cent postage stamp to be unveiled on  &LR; Friday, commemorating
California's 150th anniversary, features a plant that some
botanists say is responsible for ruining the California coastline.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp's image is an  &UR; Art Wolfe  &LR; photograph of the rugged
Pacific coastline with plant-covered cliffs in the foreground. The
trouble, wrote botanist  &UR; Tony Morosco &LR; , vice president of the East
Bay Chapter of the California Native Plant Society, in a letter to
the postmaster, is that the plants pictured are  &LR; Carpobrotus
edulis &LR; , iceplant in common parlance.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is true that they produce very beautiful purple
flowers,'' said Morosco's letter, submitted to the postmaster two
weeks ago, ``this species is actively smothering native California
wildflowers while converting pristine coastal dune, cliff and
prairie habitats into desolate biological wastelands that our
native flora and fauna cannot survive in. It is now so widespread
and difficult to eradicate that it is understandable how it would
show up in the final round of images selected for this stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Morosco points out that the pictured plant came from Africa,
well after Europeans first came to California. The plant is
classified as an exotic pest plant. To use a stamp glorifying it
``does not celebrate the rich history of the state of California,''
he writes, ``but features one of its worst problems.''

<P>
   Morosco hasn't received an answer to his letter. The postal

are thrilled'' by the new stamp. ``They like the iceplant.''

   &UR; BOTANISTS IRATE OVER CALIFORNIA STAMP &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A 33-cent postage stamp to be unveiled on  &LR; Friday, commemorating
California's 150th anniversary, features a plant that some
botanists say is responsible for ruining the California coastline.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp's image is an  &UR; Art Wolfe  &LR; photograph of the rugged
Pacific coastline with plant-covered cliffs in the foreground. The
trouble, wrote botanist  &UR; Tony Morosco &LR; , vice president of the East
Bay Chapter of the California Native Plant Society, in a letter to
the postmaster, is that the plants pictured are  &LR; Carpobrotus
edulis &LR; , iceplant in common parlance.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is true that they produce very beautiful purple
flowers,'' said Morosco's letter, submitted to the postmaster two
weeks ago, ``this species is actively smothering native California
wildflowers while converting pristine coastal dune, cliff and
prairie habitats into desolate biological wastelands that our

BIG WEB PORTALS LOSE INFLUENCE TO SITES WITH GAMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   As Internet companies try to find more efficient ways to acquire
customers, a subtle shift is taking place in the balance of power
between retailers and the major Web portals they have relied on to
send them business.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas portals like Yahoo, AOL.com and the Microsoft Network
once held almost singular sway over where their users went to buy
flowers, music or other goods, recent data indicate that this
influence _ though still significant _ is being challenged by
shifting Internet traffic patterns.
</P>
<P>
   A study to be released this week by the Internet audience
measurement service Nielsen/NetRatings confirms this trend, finding
that the portals are losing their dominant position as the source
of traffic for e-commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the portals were the top source of referrals for 54
percent of all e-commerce sites, the study found, compared with 46
percent of e-commerce sites today. The leading referral site,
Yahoo, was the top source of traffic for 30 percent of e-commerce
sites last July, but only 18 percent of Internet retailers this
summer. The data for the survey was based on 809 sites tracked by
Nielsen/NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Kaldor, vice president for e-commerce for
Nielsen/NetRatings, said retailers were seeking out partnerships
with types of Internet companies other than portals. Moreover, the
study found a new category of sites is gaining influence in the
referral arena: sweepstakes and lottery sites, like Iwon.com,
Freelotto.com and Gamesville.com, in part because those sites offer
partners an alternative business model.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, less than 1 percent of referral traffic
to e-commerce sites came from sweepstakes or game sites in July
1999, but by July 2000, that figure was nearly 8 percent. Kaldor
said these sites were gaining influence partly because they
generally offered partners a ``pay per click'' advertising model,
in which a retailer pays the referring site only for customers who
click on a link to the retailer's site, at a rate of about 40 cents
a referral.
</P>
<P>
   Kaldor acknowledged that there were drawbacks to relying on
sweepstakes sites to refer customers. Users of lottery sites tend
be in lower income brackets, and it is not clear whether visitors
referred from these sites _ who sometimes earn points for clicking
on retailers' links _ ever become long-term customers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Kaldor said the sweepstakes sites bear watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the trend continues,'' he said, ``they do pose a serious
threat to the traditional portals.''

   Personal Online Advice on Selecting a College
</P>
<P>
   Live, one-on-one college advisory services, offered until now
primarily offline, became available on the Internet last Friday
through a new Web site, PureAdvice.com. It is offering tools and
services to help high school students identify and apply to
colleges appropriate for them and apply for and obtain financial
aid.
</P>
<P>
   Some information, like extensive data on all the colleges in the
United States, and a calculator that estimates the total expense of
going to college, is free.
</P>
<P>
   But live, one-on-one counseling sessions with experienced
guidance counselors, financial aid experts and former college
admissions officials involve fees that start at $75 for a 45-minute
session. Included in this fee is a written report summarizing the
session, which is sent to the student and to the student's guidance
counselor, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   PureAdvice.com's president, Steven Ehrlich, said 140 advisers
from across the country, each with a minimum of five years'
experience, conduct the online sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In-school guidance counselors are often overburdened.
PureAdvice will help change that, giving students, their parents
and guidance counselors the tools and personalized attention they
deserve,'' Ehrlich said.
</P>
<P>
   PureAdvice also receives fees for referring visitors to vendors
_ like student loan providers _ that are listed on its site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company has formed a partnership with U.S. News
&AMP; World Report to provide its counseling services on the portion of
the magazine's Web site that carries its annual college survey.
Ehrlich said U.S. News &AMP; World Report would receive a fee for each
referral to PureAdvice.com.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Achieva.com, a three-year-old, San Mateo, Calif.,
company that also helps high school students with the college
admissions process, appeared undaunted by the East Coast start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Feuling, Achieva.com's vice president for marketing, said
his company's $295 online college program ``takes you through
everything, not just college selection and the financial aid
piece.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We help you with test preparation, developing an
extra-curricular resume, with an application strategy.'' The
company also offers live counseling, but not online. He said more
than half Achieva's income was derived from sales directly to
school systems. &QL;

WILLOW BAY MOVES WEST TO CO-ANCHOR `MONEYLINE'  
 SEPARATING `HAVE ITS' FROM `HAVE IT NOTS'
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With CNN in flux after a corporate restructuring that was
announced last week, Willow Bay, an anchor on its ``Moneyline News
Hour'' program, will begin doing her job from Los Angeles Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Her co-anchor, Stuart Varney, will remain in New York, making
the 6:30 p.m., EDT, financial news program bicoastal. The program
will also include a ticker and new graphics.
</P>
<P>
   When CNN executives announced last winter that Bay would move to
Los Angeles, they said it would serve two purposes: It would give
``Moneyline'' a presence on the West Coast while also allowing Bay
to live some semblance of a normal life with her husband, Robert A.
Iger, the president of Walt Disney, who had been asked to move from
New York to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bay, who did not want a bicoastal marriage, told CNN that she
would likely have to leave ``Moneyline'' for some other duty. They
said they would rather make the show bicoastal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moneyline'' had been steadily losing ratings to its CNBC
competitor, ``Business Center,'' in the months after its longtime
anchor, Lou Dobbs, left the network. It has never recovered and has
become somewhat of a symbol of the ratings failures at CNN, which
is owned by Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The executives believed that by creating a Los Angeles anchor,
they could rejuvenate the program. C. Shelby Coffey III, the
president of CNN's financial network, CNNfn, who is in charge of
``Moneyline,'' had wanted to bolster coverage of the West Coast
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, executives were planning to build up attention for
the program's new format. But then the president of CNN's
operations in the United States, Richard N. Kaplan, resigned,
sending those plans into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, like Bay, was formerly of ABC News. Bay, like others who
were close to Kaplan, acknowledged some uneasiness now that he was
gone. ``With Rick's departure, we lose a `Moneyline' supporter, and
I'm obviously personally very distressed that he's leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been specifically assured that the current CNN
management fully supports and embraces a bicoastal `Moneyline,'''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, she added, ``CNN management has been very generous
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, while CNN executives have said they could make a lot
of changes to the programming schedule, ``Moneyline'' is still a
major moneymaker and has lost fewer viewers than other programs.
</P>
<P>
   But there will certainly be pressure for it to do better in the
ratings. Bay and Varney said they believed the changes should help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being out there on the West Coast, in the middle of the new
economy, I think that's a plus,'' Varney said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEPARATING `HAVE ITS' FROM `HAVE IT NOTS' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So just how do you get to be an ``It girl?''
</P>
<P>
   ``By having `It' bigger and better and more fabulously than
others,'' said Kristina Stewart, the society editor for Vanity
Fair, which features ``The `It' Parade'' as the cover article of
its September issue. And if you generate a little controversy, too,
well then so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said she began choosing women with ``It'' some months
ago, when she ``dumped a big stack of contender photos'' on the
desk of the editor of Vanity Fair, Graydon Carter. They and several
other editors then ``dished for the better part of an afternoon,''
she said, before choosing 14 women who ``dance on the tables'' and
``change the chemistry of a room just by entering it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them: the cover subject Gwyneth Paltrow (the ``uber `It'
Girl,'' according to Stewart), scions of wealthy and well-known
families, including Patricia Herrera, daughter of the fashion
designer Carolina Herrera, and self-made ``Its,'' like Cecilia
Dean, a magazine editor who also teaches at the Parsons School of
Design (``Who needs money when every designer wants to dress you?''
the magazine asks.)
</P>
<P>
   Was Vanity Fair besieged by public relations representatives?
No, said Stewart, who noted that ``It'' women are so in demand that
they use public relations people to decline invitations, not get
them. ``The girls we chose all had to be arm-wrestled into being in
the feature,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be. But Vanity Fair has received some criticism.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, an article by Gabriel Snyder in The New York
Observer noted that the magazine's seekers of ``It'' hadn't had to
go very far _ or even to leave their building _ in their search for
Herrera, who works for the magazine, or in finding Plum Sykes, a
``bon vivant'' who works for Vogue, a sister publication of Advance
Publications' Conde Nast unit. Sykes' table-top dancing was said to
have recently resulted in the destruction of 350 champagne glasses
at a Manhattan restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder never actually uttered the word nepotism, though he
implied it. And he quoted Aimee Bell, Vanity Fair's senior articles
editor, who said the omission of Herrera and Sykes would have been
a ``disservice'' to the ``scholars of `It-girldom.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Entertainment Weekly's managing editor, James W. Seymore
Jr., was not so diplomatic. In a letter sent to Carter, he said
Vanity Fair had engaged in ``imitation'' and ``misappropriation''
in publishing its story, which he said was ``very, very similar''
to an ``It List'' cover that Entertainment Weekly runs annually
about ``the 100 most creative people in entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Seymore's letter was reported in The New York Post, which
printed much of it verbatim. Stewart called it a ``thinly-veiled
publicity stunt,'' and noted that The Vanity Fair article was
nothing like the one in Seymore's magazine, which focuses on people
who are prominent in the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feature didn't even mention Hollywood,'' she said. ``It
concerned itself only with society.''
</P>
<P>
   Seymore was out of town last week, and Sandy Drayton, an
Entertainment Weekly spokeswoman, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim's letter stands on its own,'' she said. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monday will be the last day of dull, sticky weather on the
Northeast coast. A strengthening cold front will push across New
England and upstate New York with a few thundershowers. Much cooler
air will surge into the region on brisk winds from the north Monday
night. Tuesday will bring more autumnal conditions in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will continue in the Southeast as
sultry air remains across the region. The heat wave in the southern
Plains and lower Mississippi Valley will be unabated with more
record high temperatures expected from Texas to Kansas and east to
Mississippi. A few rain storms will bring temporary relief from the
heat to Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Very cool air will hover over the Great Lakes. Thundershowers
will erupt as hot air returns to the western Dakotas. Much of the
West will be cooler with patches of showers in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: ALASKAN CHILL
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Fairbanks have lost their opportunity for a final
fling of summer weather. The tally from August indicates that
Fairbanks had its lowest day temperatures since records began in
1905. The average daytime maximum did not reach 60 degrees for the
first time. However, night readings were closer to seasonal levels
so that the month concluded as the fifth chilliest August on
record. Much of the unusually cool air can be attributed to an
abundance of daytime clouds. Only four days had sunny skies last
month.

HUMBLED IN ATLANTA, IBM ENTERS ITS FINAL OLYMPIC GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the computer system IBM built to report results at the 1996
Summer Olympics in Atlanta malfunctioned, the proud computing giant
learned the hard way what it was like to stumble with the whole
world watching.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Summer Olympics set to begin this month in Sydney,
Australia, and IBM's 40-year run as a technology supplier for the
Olympics set to end in December, Big Blue is pushing hard to make
sure it brings home some public relations gold.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, which decided two years ago to end its involvement in the
Games, intends to use television and the Internet to widely
advertise its role as the 2000 Olympics' chief provider and
integrator of information technology. The centerpiece of the
campaign will be the official Olympic Games site it has set up to
handle a projected 6 billion user visits during the games, 10 times
the traffic during the 1998 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is also setting up Internet stations called Surf Shacks in
Sydney. Athletes in the Olympic Village will be able to go online
with more than 60 IBM personal computers; the public's Surf Shack,
on a barge docked in Sydney's harbor, will also show off IBM's
voice-recognition technology.
</P>
<P>
   The most crucial audience, though, may be the 1,000 or so major
customers IBM will entertain in Sydney. The visitors, including
executives from telecommunications, transportation, finance, health
care and computer services companies, will be shown the full range
of IBM's Olympics products and services at an executive briefing
center. The hoped-for payoff is the chance to discuss problems in
their businesses that IBM might solve for them. ``It's very
strategic marketing,'' said Elizabeth Primrose-Smith, the IBM vice
president in charge of sports sponsorships. ``We've found it's very
helpful for them to see us in action.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology challenge in Sydney is akin to creating a huge,
transitory multinational business almost from scratch under the
pressure of immovable deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials said that the Sydney Olympic Committee would
spend more than $100 million on information technology and
communications and receive donated goods and services from IBM and
others worth several times that amount.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to building the official Web site and systems that
handle scoring, link results to background data about the athletes
and the events, and distribute results, IBM is involved in such
diverse activities as accreditation, accommodations and management
of the athletes' medical records.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is not doing all the work itself. The accreditation system,
for example, has been subcontracted to the Sema Group, a
British-French technology services company. But IBM is the overall
systems integrator, and its Tivoli products will manage the entire
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The company has deployed about 850 computer technicians, who,
among other things, have written 12.4 million lines of code, and
who weeded out 4,000 bugs in the first six months of the year.
On-site equipment testing began last September.
</P>
<P>
   The work is winning praise from some technology managers who had
a front-row seat on the Atlanta problems. ``It's my impression
they've got everything right this time,'' said Klaus Sprick, vice
president for technology at Deutsche Press-Agentur, a German news
agency that found IBM's data feeds ``totally unreliable'' in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Atlanta humiliation was magnified because the system that
failed was the one delivering scores, times and other results to
the news media, so the problem was widely reported. The news
agencies and newspapers that had paid for the data service were
furious. Ridicule was heaped atop the anger when reports spread
that some information passed along included nonsense like tied
final scores in basketball and boxers listed as 2 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Though IBM's corporate pride suffered, the company's quarterly
earnings, issued during the Games, beat expectations and IBM's
shares jumped.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said its market researchers found that potential customers
did not seem put off, either.
</P>
<P>
   Both IBM and the International Olympic Committee say that the
problems in Atlanta had nothing to do with IBM's decision to end
its association after the Sydney games. IBM had been an Olympic
sponsor and technology supplier since 1960, but its role had
steadily expanded since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, when it came time to negotiate life after Sydney, IBM
was basking in praise for its successful role in the 1998 Winter
Games in Nagano, Japan, and wondering how much longer it wanted to
spend ever-increasing amounts on the Games. Though IBM issues no
accounting of its Olympics spending, analysts estimated that it
invested about $100 million in Nagano. Because the Summer Games are
bigger, it was certain to end up with much higher expenses for
Sydney _ perhaps double, the analysts said. If it was to continue,
it wanted more cash from the local organizing committees to offset
the costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the IOC felt that putting so much of the technology in IBM's
hands was leading to needlessly expensive technical solutions. It
also wanted to handle sponsorship of Internet-related products and
services separately from the rest of information technology so that
it could raise more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them the Internet isn't available exclusively at any
price,'' said Michael R. Payne, the committee's marketing director,
adding that the two sides disagreed over whether the Internet was a
medium or a product category that should be covered by the
information technology contract. ``We would love to have IBM
involved in some aspects as part of a consortium, as in Barcelona''
in 1992, he added, ``but they're saying that's not in their
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The man on the spot in Sydney is Thomas E. Furey, who has worked
at IBM for 37 years and who got his first Olympics challenge soon
after Atlanta when he was assigned to investigate why things had
gone so wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One problem was that the Atlanta Operating Committee's
technology staff had run the project, making it hard for IBM and
other technology vendors to deal directly with the sports
organizations and other end users. It did not help that IBM's own
services group, which did much of the project management work for
the Atlanta committee, was at the time independent from the rest of
IBM, Furey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Games also came as the industry was moving from mainframe to
PC-based computing and lacked many of the tools, like Tivoli, that
were later developed to manage distributed computing systems where
processing jobs are spread over many smaller computers supported by
larger servers.
</P>
<P>
   Given the job of overseeing Nagano and then Sydney, Furey
insisted that IBM get more control over the deployment of
technology and more time for testing. ``We also lowered the
threshold of risk,'' he said. ``We didn't use any bleeding-edge
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than trumpeting new products, IBM marketers are
emphasizing that many of the Internet applications being deployed
at Sydney are already being used by customers in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   After IBM announced its withdrawal from Olympic sponsorship, the
IOC signed up Sema to take on, through 2008, the bulk of the
software and systems work IBM is doing in Sydney. Gateway will
replace IBM as hardware vendor for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work for the 2004 Summer Games in Athens will not be
parceled out until after an IOC meeting in December, Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we read and hear about the IOC's future
direction, our role probably will prove unique,'' Craig A. Lowder,
an IBM spokesman, said. ``No single company has ever been
responsible for as much technology as we have at Sydney, and it
doesn't look like any one will be again soon.''

WON'T ANYONE QUIT? `BIG BROTHER' HAS PLANS FOR A NEW FACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (Eds: SUBS to add that Petros' hair has also been purple and adds
Jordan's full name.) 
By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to ignite viewer interest in ``Big Brother,'' the CBS
reality television show whose ratings have paled in comparison with
those of CBS's summer runaway hit, ``Survivor,'' the producers plan
to pay one of the six remaining contestants $10,000 to quit this
week, allowing the show to introduce a fresh face.
</P>
<P>
   The producers hope that the new entrant into the camera-filled
house, where the contestants have been confined for eight weeks,
will be dynamic enough to instill some dramatic tension into the
occupants' personal relationships. Dramatic tension is an element
the producers _ and apparently most viewers _ have found
distressingly absent from ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least from the American ``Big Brother.'' Unlike the
contestants in versions of the show in other parts of the world,
the American participants are overly aware that they are on
television, the producers said. Also, American viewers seem
unwilling to accept contestants who stray from mainstream values or
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely frustrating and confounding,'' said Douglas
Ross, one of the show's executive producers. ``Will and Jordan and
Karen and Brittany have given us some great television.'' But they
are the four contestants the audience decided to eliminate. (The
house's members nominate two potential losers for the audience to
vote on in elections held every other week.)
</P>
<P>
   Left with six contestants who the producers say seem to be doing
everything possible to appear inoffensive, the show's creators have
decided to ``introduce a new impulse,'' said Paul Romer, the
producer from the Dutch company Endemol, which developed ``Big
Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Wednesday night the contestants will be presented with a
briefcase filled with $10,000 and given two minutes to decide
whether one of them will take the money and run. (The ultimate
winner of the game will receive $500,000.) What they will not know
is that if a contestant does leave, Beth, a 22-year-old from
Florida and a former alternate for ``Big Brother,'' will enter the
house as a replacement. (The producers revealed no other personal
details about Beth, other than Ross' observation that she was
``very attractive.'')
</P>
<P>
   This move has always been an option because the rules allow
anyone voluntarily exiting the game to be replaced. The producers
are resorting to the strategy, which CBS agreed to after some
initial reluctance, to stir up some conflict in a group in which
seldom is heard a discouraging word. Although the producers say
they are confident that someone will take the $10,000, if no one
volunteers _ or if the contestants cannot decide among themselves _
they will withdraw the money and probably offer it again later.
</P>
<P>
   In another departure from the European versions of ``Big
Brother,'' no one here has volunteered to quit. ``It's something in
the American mentality,'' Romer said. ``You don't want to be seen
as a quitter.''
</P>
<P>
   That mentality seems to have affected ``Big Brother'' in other
ways, too, beginning with the extreme media awareness of the U.S.
contestants. ``In the American house, our contestants never forget
they're on camera,'' Romer said. ``In Europe they stopped thinking
of the cameras very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The American group, Ross added, ``are all trying to produce
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The American show also has much less sexual tension than the
other versions. ``Europeans have seen people hooking up in the
house,'' Romer said. ``Americans are a little more prudish. Nudity
is a bigger issue here.'' Indeed, in the German version one female
contestant courted popularity by flashing her breasts on camera
``every 10 minutes,'' Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a bit of a problem on CBS,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing has stunned the producers more than the vote last
week to dump Brittany Petros, a 25-year-old pharmaceutical
saleswoman from Minneapolis, distinguished on the show by her
avowed virginity and her hair's changing colors (including purple
and green). She had previously won an online contest as the most
popular occupant of the house, but in the recent audience telephone
election to dismiss someone, she easily received the most votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very surprised,'' Romer said. ``But maybe the audience
felt she was too out of the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly seems to be what Petros believes. ``It's got to
be the older people who didn't like the chick with green hair on TV
maybe becoming a role model,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' thrived largely because its most overtly scheming
character, Richard Hatch, took control of the game; but the
audience, which loved to hate Richard, never had a chance to vote
him off the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Richard would have been voted out of the house the
first week on our show,'' Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is clearly a large part of the problem with ``Big
Brother.'' American television viewers may love their villains, but
if you ask them to vote, they will choose more with their hearts
than with their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a traditional scripted show, audiences get hooked on the
villain,'' said Ross, whose production company, Evolution, has
created many other reality shows for American television. ``In
reality television, people start to think of the people on the show
as their friends, and so they seek to protect their friends from
the villain.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer said that in all the ``Big Brother'' versions, anyone
exhibiting ``antisocial behavior'' was quickly dispatched by the
viewers. But in the American version the threat of expulsion seems
to hang over anyone who appears the least nonconformist.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the producers should not have been surprised. Tom Smith,
the director of the General Social Survey for the National Opinion
Research Center at the University of Chicago, said that the
audience preference for inoffensive personalities on ``Big
Brother'' is little different from the conflict-avoidance
exemplified by American politics.
</P>
<P>
   It is the reason, Smith said, that ``we have two political
parties that run to the middle, with both trying to outdo the other
in looking more moderate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We penalize parties and people who are extreme,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bland politicians and, apparently, bland contestants on reality
shows like ``Big Brother'' are the results.
</P>
<P>
   Petros said that she suspected that her expression of strong
opinions had inspired as many people to dislike her as to like her.
``Some of the others are just kind of `there,''' she said. ``How
can you dislike someone who's just kind of `there?'''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Big Brother'' producers were concerned enough about the
lack of a strong personality to propose a radical way to fill the
opening that might be created by one contestant walking away with
the $10,000. They were going to bring back Jean Jordan, known only
as Jordan on the show, the student and former part-time exotic
dancer who was kicked off more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   After some negotiation about the terms of her reassignment, the
deal fell through.
</P>
<P>
   If Beth from Florida moves into the house, she will have her
work cut out for her. She has not been watching the show because
she was so disappointed over not being one of the original choices.
And she can probably expect a less than warm welcome. In Europe,
every time a new contestant entered the game, he or she was
immediately singled out for expulsion by the disgruntled holdover
cast members. No replacement contestant has ever won the game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the producers believe this move is worth a try. ``We want
to give the show more energy,'' Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   And if this doesn't work, ``we have more ideas to stir things
up,'' he added. ``I'm sure things will start to happen. In the last
two or three weeks the prospect of winning the money is there. A
lot of scheming will go on.''

 &HT;    EDS: Fix in subhead.
 &HT;    Easy living for former Dolphins coach, Jimmy Johnson
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMORADA, Fla. _ He wasn't bluffing. Jimmy Johnson pledged to
disappear. He held a news conference that was carried live on ESPN
and began by telling the sports world that he was done coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' he said, ``it's final and forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, he waved goodbye, hopped in his black
Corvette and came here, a town in the Keys that says goodbye to
visitors with a sign that says, ``Catch you later!''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but eight months later, he hasn't let anybody catch him.
At least not anybody outside his close circle of friends and
family.
</P>
<P>
   He used to live between goal lines. Now, at age 57, he lives
between mile markers. MM 85 and MM 90, to be exact. This is his end
zone. Other than to head off into the ocean, he has left this
little stretch of land only five times since January. To help the
Dolphins with the NFL Draft. To meet with ABC. To pick up his
father at Miami International Airport. To attend the wedding of
Stuart Weinstein, the team's security investigator. To be on hand
for a party for Nick Christin, his agent.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour into Christin's party, he plopped into a chair,
explaining that his feet hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had shoes on in a month,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He could be coaching the Dolphins. He could be in the Monday
Night Football booth or in the CBS studio. Instead, he is doing
exactly what he said he would _ fishing, snorkeling, checking his
investments on the Internet and, most of all, spending time with
the loved ones that, by his own admission, he often forgot about
while he was coaching football.
</P>
<P>
   He has turned down dozens of interview requests, including one
for this story. ``He hasn't talked to anybody,'' Christin said.
``And I don't think that's going to change in the foreseeable
future.''
</P>
<P>
   He also hasn't made public appearances, unless you count the
footage of him shown at Pro Player Stadium during Dan Marino's
farewell tribute.
</P>
<P>
   His face was only there for a split second, just long enough to
show him tossing a game ball across the locker room to Marino. Yet,
that was all it took.
</P>
<P>
   The 52,000 fans filled the place with the kind of boos normally
reserved for the Jets or Bills. And even when the video moved on to
something else and the boos faded, some fans began a chant.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.J. sucks! J.J. sucks!''
</P>
<P>
   THE GUY WHO COULD MAKE IT HAPPEN
</P>
<P>
   Giddy. That was the word people used to describe the feeling on
Jan. 11, 1996, the day that Johnson took the Dolphins job.
</P>
<P>
   Every time an NFL team hires a new coach there is optimism. But
this was different. The headlines trumpeted, ``J.J.'s back.'' No
full name necessary. He had led the University of Miami to a
national title. He had worked miracles in Dallas. He would do the
same with the Dolphins. Nobody seemed to doubt this, least of all
the coach himself.
</P>
<P>
   The fans were giddy. The players were giddy. Even the owner was
giddy. Wayne Huizenga held up a doctored photo that had Johnson's
famous hair replaced with a shiny bald crown, just like his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the guy,'' Huizenga had said, ``who's going to make it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson made a lot happen, all right. He made South Florida
buzz. He created seemingly a controversy-a-week. He put the
Dolphins back in the playoffs. Three times in four years. But, in
the end, he didn't make IT happen. He didn't take the Dolphins to
the Super Bowl as promised. They lost in the second round each of
his last two years _ by 35 points at Denver and 55 at Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there was saga of Jimmy and Danny, South
Florida's favorite soap opera until Elian Gonzalez came ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together _ the breathless expectations, the somber
finishes and the friction with Marino _ and you have a massive
backlash. Bring up Johnson's name on talk radio and listen to the
venom. Put his face on a big screen and hear the boos. Mention his
initials to a couple eyeing the menu at Jimmy Johnson's Bar &AMP; Grill
in Miami Beach and they go into a Dennis Miller rant. And not
because J.J.'s Classic Margarita goes for $8.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he's off in the Keys, doing whatever he's doing,''
said Lisa Mason, 32. ``He should've gone there sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say it's hard to find Johnson supporters north of
Key Largo. Just stop by his former place of employment and ask what
people there think of the boos. Watch Dave Wannstedt's face tighten
with anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a joke,'' said Wannstedt, Johnson's successor and
longtime friend. ``That's ridiculous. . . . For people to react
that way, it makes no sense. It's almost so ridiculous that it's
not worth commenting on. That's how I feel. Anybody who has any
intelligence about this sport and understands how tough it is to
win, would understand my sentiments.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones, Dolphins president, borrows the words Marino used
when the fans booed Huizenga: ``That's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Trace Armstrong, the defensive end who as union leader
occasionally clashed with Johnson, is quick to defend his former
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of silly,'' he said. ``A lot of times, he
can be an easy target because he does go out on a limb.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as Armstrong points out, there aren't very many storybook
finishes in the NFL. John Elway, he says, spoiled it for everyone
else. Made everyone dream about going out on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL isn't about Cinderella stories,'' Armstrong said.
``There aren't too many happy endings.''
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL HERO
</P>
<P>
   It's shortly after noon on Tuesday, five days before the first
NFL games of the season, at a bar that claims to have the oldest
liquor license in the Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie White, a bartender at Harrah and Dunn's Oceanview Inn and
Sports Pub, is testing out a new contest that will make its debut
Sunday. She is holding up a toilet seat in front of the big-screen
TV. The handful of locals who are sitting at the bar are taking
turns trying to throw a Nerf football through the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to call it Dan's Can,'' she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   She points at the insignia on her shirt _ New England Patriots _
and insists that she has nothing against Marino. Still, if you're
looking for a place where they still love J.J., where it still
feels a little like the summer of '96, then this is it. The Keys.
The land of many marinas but no Marinos.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the Oceanview. It used to be a biker bar, a place
notorious for bloody fights. For the last five years, though, it
has been owned by a couple of former University of Miami players
and roommates.
</P>
<P>
   The bar menu includes ``Jimmy Johnson's Famous Fish Sandwich.''
And in one corner of the room, right below Dennis Harrah's Rams
jersey and a picture of Gary Dunn and the '79 Steelers, there is a
photo of Three Rings, the boat that, to South Florida's dismay,
never required a name change.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen people are on board. Right in the middle sits Johnson,
wearing a floral shirt, holding his dog Buttercup on his lap and
grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy isn't in the Oceanview on this day. But he and his wife,
Rhonda, have stopped in. They came in a couple days after the
retirement announcement. Played some games. Had a couple of beers.
Everybody pretty much left them alone. But as Johnson got ready to
leave, the guy everyone calls Kooc couldn't resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't you . . . ,'' he said, as if trying to place the face,
`` . . . Dan Marino.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson smiled and said, ``No, he's taller.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kooc is seated at a corner of the bar, sipping a draft
beer. He explains that his real name is Richard Hoffert. ``I'm the
cook,'' he says. ``So they call me Kooc _ like cook backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   He gives Johnson the ultimate compliment. Calls him a local, a
Conch. A rich Conch, but a Conch nonetheless. The man seated next
to Kooc _ he will only say everyone calls him ``Buck'' _ chimes in
with his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan should've retired earlier,'' he says. ``I thought Jimmy
did a good job. They give Dan that thing at the stadium and they
boo Jimmy? Down here, everyone treats him like a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's home is located within walking distance of everything
Buttercup could ever need _ Pet Stuff, Pet Groomer and the Upper
Keys Animal Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Johnson is a homebody. He occasionally is
seen at Woody's, the Old Tavernier Restaurant or Whale Harbor. And
he stops by Smuggler's Cove Marina about once a week. That's where
he fills up his boat's gas tank and gets a bite to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he'll buy everyone a drink,'' Buck says. ``Well, the
locals at least.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, he doesn't like to call attention to
himself. He likes to blend in, which can be tough considering some
of the people he has taken out on his boat in the last nine months
_ Wannstedt, Redskins coach Norv Turner and, surprise, former rival
Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The locals rarely talk football with him. Usually the
conversation sticks to safe topics. Like how the fish are biting.
But every so often, someone will toss out the bait _ a question
about Marino _ and wait for Johnson to lunge at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never does,'' said one Smuggler's Cove employee. ``He only
has nice things to say about Dan. And he really likes Huizenga. . .
. He seems to want to enjoy his life now. He seems very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what everyone who has seen him in in the last nine months
says. From afar, this might not look like a happy ending. Up close,
they insist, Johnson is happier than ever. No matter what people up
in Miami are doing when they see his face on a giant screen.

   The Internet music start-up MP3.com has been on the losing side
of a legal battle with the record industry ever since a federal
judge decided in April that it had violated the copyrights of the
major record companies by creating a central database of CDs to
allow users to listen to music from their own collections on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff is set to rule this week on
whether MP3.com willfully broke the law or started the service in
good faith. Based on that decision, the damages he awards Universal
Music Group _ the only one of the five major companies that has not
reached a settlement with the company _ could range from $200 to
$750,000 a compact disc.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what happens in this round, MP3.com hopes to turn
the tables on Universal, a unit of the Seagram Co., in the final
phase of the trial, which will determine how many of the 4,740 of
Universal's copyrights in question the company will actually pay
damages on.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief that centers on perhaps the touchiest copyright issue
in the music industry today, one that has nothing to do with the
Internet, MP3.com's lawyers dispute the validity of nearly all of
Universal's sound recording copyright registrations because the
company designated them ``works for hire,'' a concept that, they
argue, has no legal basis, and that remains a subject of contention
between artists and record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Copyright experts said that the argument could fail tohave an
impact on how much MP3.com has to pay. But even so, the music
industry might be the worse for having aired in court a question to
which it has so far preferred to avoid obtaining a clear yes-or-no
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view at the end of the day most sound recordings don't
qualify as work-for-hire,'' said Peter Jaszi, a law professor at
American University. ``And that's something that recording
companies would like to avoid having too many courts say too
authoritatively. I don't know that this is a knock-out argument for
MP3, but from a tactical standpoint it raises the stakes in an
interesting way.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``work-for-hire'' terminology is the subject of a storied
battle between music artists and record labels dating to 1978, when
the federal copyright law was revised to set the term of a
copyright grant at 35 years, after which the rights revert back to
their original author. The legislation also identified nine
categories of works, including audio-visual works and ``works for
hire,'' for which the authors would never recapture the copyright.
</P>
<P>
   The record companies, which would like to control their
copyrights for as long as possible, have argued that sound
recordings fall under the work-for-hire category. But musicians
contend that they are not ``hired'' by a record label, and that
they are more like book authors, whose right to regain the rights
to their works is not disputed.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy reached its highest pitch late last year, when
the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group
representing the major record companies, succeeded in lobbying
Congress to add sound recordings to the categories of works whose
original authors could never reclaim their copyright. The group
argued that it was merely a technical correction to the existing
work-for-hire provision, and it was passed without hearings as part
of a budget bill on Nov. 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But after a surge of protest from outraged artists, Congress is
expected in the next few weeks to pass legislation rolling back the
statute to its original form, with language agreed on by the
recording industry trade group and several groups representing
artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming this legislation passes, and I have to think it will
pass, we're back to the argument of whether sound recordings are
works made for hire,'' said Jay Cooper, a Los Angeles music lawyer
who represents a large group of artists. ``And I don't think they
want that decision out there.''

SEPTEMBER FESTIVAL AT WORLD TRADE CENTER PLAZA PRIMES ECLECTIC MIX
OF DANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The term ``downtown dance'' takes on a whole new
meaning with the ``Evening Stars'' dance week that opens on Sunday
in an outdoor theater at the World Trade Center Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   True, the kind of avant-garde dance that is usually meant by the
term, created in lofts and studios south of 14th Street, will be
represented in the new series. But the six ``Evening Stars''
programs include an impressive variety of uptown stars and styles.
</P>
<P>
   That is not surprising, given that the project is the brainchild
of Liz Thompson, executive director of the Lower Manhattan Cultural
Council, the producer of the festival. Thompson has had a long
relationship with dance at its most glittering and most funky, from
early days as a performer of the now-defunct New York Dance
Festival in Central Park, to the directorship of the Jacob's Pillow
Dance Festival from 1979 to 1989. The Pillow was founded by Ted
Shawn, who championed eclectic dance programming. And at the
Central Park festival, held in the Delacorte Theater, one could
often see ballet, modern and ethnic dance all on the same night.
</P>
<P>
   The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, a service organization for
artists and a presenter of dance and visual arts in downtown
Manhattan for 25 years, has maintained a grass-roots approach while
changing with the neighborhood it was formed to serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were running away from downtown when LMCC was founded
by David Rockefeller and the Chase Bank,'' Thompson said in a
recent interview. ``The new downtown renaissance has allowed a
festival of this magnitude to come into being.''
</P>
<P>
   The council has traditionally provided artists with technical,
company redevelopment and grant-writing assistance and
full-production stagings. It provides work space to resident
artists, among them the dance duo Eiko and Koma, in raw space on
the 91st floor of Building 1 at the World Trade Center, where there
will be an open house on Sept. 23 and Sept. 24. Today the council
also sponsors a digital media showcase program called Thundergulch.
And with the ``Evening Stars'' week, it is moving into dance
production in a bigger and more wide-ranging way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evening Stars'' opens with the companies of Ronald Brown and
Rennie Harris, two young modern-dance choreographers. In the
dizzyingly varied ``Jazz Riffs'' on Sept. 11, tap will be
represented by the Silver Belles, a company of veteran female
dancers, and the stylish Young Hoofers. There will also be Broadway
jazz dance by Bob Fosse performed by ``A Few Good Men Dancin',''
and the avant-garde Jane Comfort and her company will perform
hip-hop-inspired work.
</P>
<P>
   The company of the downtown-dance pioneer Trisha Brown performs
on Sept. 13 in a program that includes a sneak preview of a new
work with a jazz score by Dave Douglas that will be performed live.
Ballet will be represented by the vibrant and adventurous American
Repertory Ballet of New Brunswick, N.J., on Sept. 14; the Parsons
Dance Co. presents a modern dance work on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The festival closes the Sept. 16 with ``... And Rising Stars,''
a hyper-eclectic mix of ballet and new modern dance works. The
performers include Gillian Murphy and Marcelo Gomes of American
Ballet Theater; dancers from the San Francisco Ballet; the
modern-dance troupes of Ellis Wood; the rollicking Irish-flavored
Sean Curran Co.; and RhythMEK, a new group of former Alvin Ailey
principals, who will dance in a new work by Donald Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   The criterion for the show was ``just good and interesting
work,'' Thompson said. ``I think we have to establish ourselves and
a body of work so that we can introduce more and more adventurous
dance, gently, over time. Trisha is world-renowned now but
considered avant-garde. American Repertory Ballet is a regional
company that has gone through some changes. It will be interesting
to see them in New York. David Parsons is a crowd pleaser. We open
with a dynamic double-header. And `Jazz Riffs' and `Rising Stars'
explore different aspects of dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Evening Stars'' festival was created last year when the
Port Authority, which owns the World Trade Center, was looking for
a way to make use of the plaza while it was being refurbished.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of vision at the Port Authority saw this as an
opportunity to bring world-class artists here and they got excited
about that,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   This year the festival presented three weeks of music, theater
and dance in June but added the new all-dance week for September.
</P>
<P>
   A special stage has been erected, facing out from Church Street
and framed by soaring skyscrapers. Next year Thompson said she
hopes to expand dance festival to three weeks and to offer open
daytime rehearsals that can be watched by passers-by and those
grabbing a lunchtime sandwich on the plaza.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I've tried to build new audiences wherever I've gone,''
Thompson said. ``This is a realization of a dream. The plaza is one
of the most democratic places. It's a clean, fresh space for dance
that attracts so many people: 45,000 people work in the Trade
Center buildings. Thousands pass through daily. Tourists, people
going out for lunch, people on their way to the PATH trains. Some
are CEOs, some do back-office work.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson envisions her audiences experiencing everything from
chance encounters to planned and affordable outings for families.
And if all goes as planned, some who are new to dance will fall in
love with the art and follow the companies as they perform at
uptown theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different people find beauty and meaning in a vast array of
forms,'' Thompson said. ``Now it is my passion and pleasure to try
to open paths for people to see with new eyes what they may not
necessarily have grown up with or be accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful way for a diverse audience to see a very
diverse program,'' she added. ``Just pray it doesn't rain.''

TWO ARTISTS, SHARING A MUSEUM BUT WORLDVIEWS APART 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Note language in 3rd-last graf.) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's hardly a surprise to be told that every good
artist creates a world of her or his own. But to move from the
world of Alice Neel to that of Barbara Kruger (separated by a
single floor at the Whitney Museum of American Art) is to feel you
have moved from one species to another, from people who claim their
individuality as a natural right to people who see the world as one
big central casting agency in which everyone, not least themselves,
is a desirable or an undesirable type.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it's a question of temperament. Neel was a humanist
who treated her subjects with clinical compassion. Kruger is a
critic and muckraker who treats hers with satirical fury. But
history separates these artists every bit as much as temperament.
Neel was born in 1900. She came of age when the particulars of
neighborhood, region, faces and bodies, however unlovely, dominated
the culture's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many artists during the Depression, Neel worked for the
Federal Arts Project, painting all the neighborhoods of New York
City. But her love of portraiture and place had begun in the 1920s,
when she was living la vie de boheme in Greenwich Village, and it
continued through her years in Spanish Harlem and midtown
Manhattan. (It seems she never met a visual abstraction she much
liked.)
</P>
<P>
   Kruger was born midcentury, in 1945. The mass media were already
revved up in the 1920s, but baby boomers grew up during their
imperial expansion years when everything from newspapers to
televisions to computers made their way into every home and
sometimes every room of every home.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasies of advertising, movies and television belong as
much to our unconscious as do those Greek tragedies and German
fairy tales that psychoanalysts dissected in such detail. (Or as an
analyst friend of mine once said about someone: ``I get it. His
inner life is based on Tom and Jerry.'')
</P>
<P>
   Neel, who died in 1984, was a purist about her medium, devoted
to painting and painting only. Kruger is an insistent hybrid: She
reworks old (but rarely pre-1940s) and contemporary photographs
that she finds in all kinds of places _ business, movie and fashion
magazines, how-to books and manuals _ and then joins them to
uncluttered (even stark) graphic design.
</P>
<P>
   Every picture has its verbal element. And words come at you; she
covers floors and walls with them. They shout, they sneer, they
challenge. (``If you're so successful, why do you feel like a
fake?'')
</P>
<P>
   They insist on their power and righteousness, be it social,
religious, ethnic or sexual. ``What I love is more compelling than
what you love. More profound, more riveting, sexier. My taste is
more developed than yours. Hipper, more knowing, more evolved.''
And: ``God said it. I believe it. And that settles it.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything is fortissimo. The images are just as strong but more
layered and fractured; her reworkings move everyday photographs
toward the gothic.
</P>
<P>
   See a middle-aged white man with strangely crumpled skin and one
eye at the bottom of his forehead. Look at the black rectangle on
his chin and read the words ``Look like us'' in white type. A large
pair of scissors lies partly open. They look black and cast a
gray-black shadow on the white surface. Between the blades is a red
box with the question ``Who speaks?'' in white type. Beneath the
handle is an identical box with the words ``Who is silent?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to get back to the human,'' I heard a woman say as
we entered Neel's exhibition space. That was no indictment of
Kruger but rather a stricken acknowledgment of the artist's power.
``Back to the human'': Neel lets us go back and see ourselves as
people who have life outside ruthless cultural and political
scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Look at her aged mother in ``Last Sickness'': the scared eyes
and the mouth pressed into a tight little line; the messy hair and
the dowdy bathrobe. It's that awful thing you see in the dying: the
physical letting go and the emotional holding on.
</P>
<P>
   The young man from Spanish Harlem in ``Call Me Joe'' is a beauty
with his pompadour and elegant long-sleeved white T-shirt beneath a
short-sleeved print shirt? Why is he so melancholy? What does he
know about his future that we don't?
</P>
<P>
   And did Henry Geldhazer, the curator of 20th-century art at the
Metropolitan Museum when Neel painted him, really want to be seen
with that chilly, rather petulant expression, trying so hard to
look languid and at ease? (Did he see that portrait before he left
Neel out of the show he was then organizing, ``New York Painting
and Sculpture: 1940-1970''?)
</P>
<P>
   Portraiture invites people to honor what sets _ or at least
appears to set _ one person apart from others. This must be why it
has become so popular again among those wealthy enough to
commission portraits of themselves and their families for
posterity.
</P>
<P>
   Work like Kruger's insists that we see ourselves in the grip of
generic thoughts, gestures and words; always on the verge of
turning into media objects or receptors.
</P>
<P>
   That both these artists did portraits of Andy Warhol says
everything about the cultural shifts that they _ and we _ have
lived through. Warhol was the white-faced, white-blond wizard of
metamorphosis, turning fine art into mass art, high culture into
pop culture. That one-of-a-kind painting became the endlessly
reproducible photograph and print; introspection became
advertising; and the individual as psychological subject became an
icon for mass worship.
</P>
<P>
   Neel turned Warhol back into a psychological subject. She
painted him with his shirt off, in 1970, two years after he had
been shot by Valerie Solanis. His eyes are closed; his hands are
pressed between his knees; his breasts sag and he wears a stomach
brace. He looks like the weary old working-class man, born Andy
Warhola, that he might have become had he not remade himself so
relentlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Kruger places Warhol on the border between the private and the
public, or between the psychological and the iconographic. In her
photograph he looks cannily boyish, as he did at his peak. But wary
too (look at how his hand touches his cheek). All this wizardry had
its price. And there in the middle of his face are the words ``Not
cruel enough.''
</P>
<P>
   And framing his face, in red, are words that serve as an elegy
not unlike the one that F. Scott Fitzgerald had a nameless mourner
offer at Jay Gatsby's funeral: ``The poor son of a bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruger's four-square elegy reads: ``Not beautiful enough.''
``Not man enough.'' ``Not real enough.'' ``Not pathetic enough.''
She does the same thing with portraits of Malcolm X, Eleanor
Roosevelt and Marilyn Monroe. They form a quartet of cautionary
ghost stories.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the work of these women makes me think artists worry
too much about being ahead of their time. Maybe the hardest thing
of all is to be a real part of one's time, to take it in with all
the courage and imagination one can muster.

   Labor Day celebrates industry and work with the ultimate salute:
a day off. The rest of the year, inventors strive to find ways to
make work and everyday tasks easier.
</P>
<P>
   Roofers who install tiles on houses may appreciate a pair of
work shoes patented by James Mills. He has invented footwear with
adjustable pitch, so that a roofer, or a firefighter or chimney
sweep, standing on a steep roof can remain upright. His shoes are
actually shoe boards that fit over the foot, with or without
conventional shoes. The boards attach to a base that holds a
contact pad made of foam rubber. Brackets extending from the
underside of the shoe board to the top of the base are connected
with a rod. A series of holes in the brackets allow the pitch of
the footwear to be adjusted with a pin to match the slant of a
roof. A wearer would use the shoes standing with one leg downroof
from the other. Mills, who lives in Valparaiso, Ind., received
patent 6,035,557.
</P>
<P>
   Any parent whose daily tasks include picking up plastic building
block toys may like the vacuum cleaner attachment patented by
Anthony Vandenberg. Vandenberg's curved pipe can be attached to a
standard vacuum cleaner hose so blocks can be suctioned off the
floor. A plate inside the pipe directs the blocks into a channel
connected to a transparent container. Vandenberg says in his patent
that dirt and dust could still flow into the vacuum cleaner bag,
and that a spring-loaded probe would clear out any blocks stuck in
the pipe. The container comes with a hinged bottom so the blocks
can be dumped into a toy box. Vandenberg received patent 6,048,249.
</P>
<P>
   HELP WITH COOKING, IN THE KITCHEN OR OUT
</P>
<P>
   Cooks will be interested in Leonhard May's remotely programmable
oven. May, who lives in North Royalton, Ohio, has patented an oven
that cooks can control via computer modem. A cook can dial into a
microprocessor on his oven and program cooking mode, temperature
and duration. A cook can modify those directions later, and bring
up the oven's progress on his computer screen. May received patent
6,080,972.
</P>
<P>
   Any chef compiling an omelette might welcome Stephen Herbruck's
patented egg carton. The box has compartments shaped to hold eggs,
like a traditional egg carton, but adds compartments intended to
hold other ingredients. Herbruck, from Saranac, Mich., designed his
carton so that the number of ``other'' compartments match the
number of egg holders, so the carton can carry the correct amount
of ingredients for an omelette or any egg dish, or even Easter egg
painting supplies. He received patent 5,927,501.
</P>
<P>
   For those who like the convenience of store-bought cookies but
the luxury of fresh-baked ones, there's the toaster cookie invented
by Sarath Katta, Sambasiva Chigurupati and Wayne Moore, all from
Omaha. The cookies are pre-baked so that after they're bought, the
baking can be finished in a home toaster oven. Each one is coated
with flavors so that when the cookies are heated, the flavors
release a scent. After a few minutes in a toaster oven, the cookies
are soft, chewy and smell like fresh-baked, the inventors said in
their application. Their patent, which belongs to ConAgra Corp., is
6,093,437.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen clean-up could be improved with a couple of patents for
dishwashers. In Baljit Singh's design for a combination sink and
dishwasher, a dishwasher is installed adjacent to a sink. A common
wall divides the two. A basket slides from within the dishwasher,
through an opening in the common wall, until it rests in the sink.
Dirty dishes can be rinsed and loaded into the basket, which is
then returned to the dishwasher. Singh, who lives in Norwalk,
Calif., won patent 5,934,298.
</P>
<P>
   In Alan Cassalia's patented dishwasher, the bottom rack extends
and retracts like the conventional lower racks that holds pots,
dishes and a flatware basket. But Cassalia, who lives in Richboro,
Pa., added scissor-arm support brackets that allow the lower rack
to be pulled out and then raised to the same height as the upper
rack. He received patent 5,971,513.
</P>
<P>
   SOFTWARE THAT BOLSTERs WEAK GRAMMAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone whose job involves writing could probably use the
``grammar-check'' invented by Anthony Krueger and Ronald Fein for
the Microsoft Corp. Their invention works like the spell-check
function included in word-processing software. When someone working
on a document stops typing, the patented software takes advantage
of the idle time to extract sentences from the text and analyze
them for ``proper grammatical composition,'' the patent says. If
the sentence includes bad English, an error icon will appear on the
computer screen. The writer can click on the icon to bring up a
menu with suggested corrections that the inventors say will ``most
likely correct each error.'' They received patent 6,012,075.
</P>
<P>
   Any worker who relies on a laptop might appreciate the portable
stand patented by John Troyer. The stand has a pair of feet, a pair
of support posts, and a horizontal platform with wings to hold a
laptop. The stand parts are collapsible so that it will fit in a
suitcase, but when it is fully extended it ``is capable of holding
a laptop computer at the proper height and angle for use,'' Troyer,
who is from Cincinnati, wrote in his patent. He received patent
6,076,787.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C., 20231.

JAPAN TURNS EARTHQUAKE DRILL INTO MILITARY EXERCISE 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ As smoke pots simulating fires spewed yellow fumes from
the buildings, military trucks rumbled into a dilapidated quarter
of Tokyo on Sunday, rushing in olive-uniformed reinforcements for
civilian rescue squads overwhelmed by the wounded.
</P>
<P>
   With clattering helicopters dancing green against the blue skies
above, just when the action seemed to reach its peak, this show's
director swooped in. With clockwork precision, he stuck to an
elaborate schedule of visits to Tokyo neighborhoods to view staged
earthquake devastation.
</P>
<P>
   The choreographer of all of this action was Shintaro Ishihara,
the very pleased-looking governor of Tokyo prefecture who has long
been known as a populist conservative showman. It was clearly a
moment of glory for this politician, who had turned a hitherto
boring annual earthquake-readiness drill _ traditionally held in
early September in recognition of the Great Tokyo Earthquake on
Sept. 1, 1923 _ into one of the largest military exercises that
most Japanese have seen since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister had to content himself with a low-profile
visit to a basement command room of Japan's Self Defense Forces to
monitor the drill's progress before rushing off to greet the
visiting Russian president.
</P>
<P>
   But Ishihara, who flitted from one neighborhood to another all
day aboard a red rescue helicopter, was fulfilling a nationalist's
dream: returning the military to the national stage, and being
hugged by female admirers at every step.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the rope lines of eager supporters who waved to the
governor all along his passage on Sunday, the appearance of more
than 7,000 uniformed soldiers in the streets of central Tokyo also
revived discussions of a militarist past that is fast fading from
living memory.
</P>
<P>
   Political activism may be feeble in Japan, but pacifism here
still runs deep. Many Japanese who questioned the need for a
military drill on this scale said that they see the exercise, Tokyo
Big Rescue, as being as much a public relations operation for the
military as a disaster-preparedness drill.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese politics have been inching rightward in recent years,
these critics say, and one of the cherished goals of many in the
governing Liberal Democratic Party is a revision of the
Constitution to allow Japan to field a full-fledged army for the
first time since its defeat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two purposes behind this exercise,'' said Atsuo
Nakamura, an opposition member of Parliament. ``Ishihara wants to
change the Constitution, and turn Japan into a big military country
again. The other purpose is that Japan is in very bad economic
condition, and politicians like this are trying to blame people of
other nationalities for our troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a very classic way of dealing with problems, just like
Hitler did. The Japanese people are very nationalistic, and he
wants to awaken this feeling to become more popular.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The earthquake drill's link to questions of constitutional
reform, nationalism and xenophobia is the doing of Ishihara, who
has made a career of right-wing causes, from planting Japanese
flags on tiny islands disputed between Japan and China to
worshipping at shrines associated with war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Ishihara set a divisive tone for the exercise while
addressing members of the Self Defense Force. ``Third-country
nationals and foreigners who have entered Japan illegally have
perpetrated heinous crimes,'' he said. ``In the event of a major
earthquake, riots could break out, and there is a limit to the
police's ability to cope with such a situation alone. I want you to
carry out your mission, not only to deal with natural disasters,
but also to maintain law and order.''
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara has since apologized to Tokyo's foreign residents for
his remarks, after being reminded that as many as 6,000 Koreans
were massacred by Japanese troops and civilians during the turmoil
caused by the 1923 earthquake, after rumors spread that they were
committing sabotage or even had caused the natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   His aides have since tried to focus the debate on the need to
use the rarely activated army to assist in disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   But his office continues to make xenophobic statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking the Koreans have made a good adjustment to
this country, but we still have many illegal Chinese who are
penetrating this country illegally and are carrying out terrible
crimes,'' said Atsuyuki Sassa, a security adviser to Ishihara.
``There are Iranians, and others. We have many new problems as a
result of this. And what Mr. Ishihara was saying is that we must
maintain peace and order in the case of a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Several associations of foreign residents in Japan have
responded warily to the drill, counting it as the latest sign of
mounting hostility toward other Asians in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right wing in Japan has always been very hostile to
Koreans and Chinese,'' said So Chungo-On, director of Chosensoren,
an association of residents of Korean descent. ``These kinds of
people feel that the past history of the military in Japan is
glorious. All we can do is hope that this drill is not aimed at us.
More than 55 years has passed since the war ended, and the old ways
of thinking should have changed by now as we enter the century of
internationalization. The governor himself should be a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In Shirohige Nishi, an area of grassy plots and collapsing
hovels chosen for the drills, Kudo Chisato, a lifelong resident,
peered out from her shingled home, one of the few sturdy buildings
remaining in the area. She declared the drills great entertainment,
as the first helicopters appeared and firemen began extinguishing
imaginary blazes with their hoses.
</P>
<P>
   But asked if such a show of force was needed to reign in lawless
foreigners, she scoffed. ``I'm not worried at all,'' she said,
before referring to the 1923 quake, with its massacres. ``What
happened before was 80 years ago. The Japanese are gentle now, and
it is unlikely that foreigners would pose a threat either.''

SPORTS COLUMN: SOUL SEARCHING AT ALABAMA AND PENN STATE, AND BOOS
AT FLORIDA
</HEADLINE>
  By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ Here are three reasons why the college
football season matters as soon as the ball is teed up on the first
full weekend of games:
</P>
<P>
   --The first national title casualty was recorded as
underappreciated UCLA beat over-rated Alabama, 35-24.
</P>
<P>
   --Little Toledo of the Mid-American Conference prompted soul
searching in no less a gridiron icon than Joe Paterno by whipping
the Nittany Lions, 24-6, on Penn State's home field.
</P>
<P>
   --Florida fans booed the sloppy performance of their team and
Coach Steve Spurrier punted on third-and-26 rather than watch his
inept offense stumble through another play. The Gators were beating
Ball State, 33-19, at the time!
</P>
<P>
   Name another sport where opening day matters as much it does in
college football, where standards vary from program to program and
so often are interconnected.
</P>
<P>
   Here on Saturday afternoon, Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie bounced
off the field, hugged his athletic director, Kevin White (who may
or may not fire him) and raised his hands asking a sellout crowd
for more noise. The Irish had outlasted Texas A&AMP;M, which was ranked
No. 25, by 24-10 for their first victory since midseason last
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day in Columbia, S.C., Davie's predecessor, Lou
Holtz, had to chase goal-post-seeking fans off the field so South
Carolina could officially finish a 31-0 shutout of New Mexico
State. It was the Gamecocks' first victory in 21 games _ 11 of
those losses were under Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought that an Alabama team ranked No. 3 in the
nation would go to the Rose Bowl to begin a national title drive
against a U.C.L.A. team that had the 107th-ranked defense in the
nation last year, only to leave there upset and preoccupied with
different numbers? Mainly, the number of losses by other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have an opportunity to achieve all our goals,''
Alabama offensive guard Griff Redmill said. ``They say if you're
going to lose, lose early. You can't lose any earlier than we lost
today.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible for the Crimson Tide to climb back to the Bowl
Championship Series title game. In 1993, Florida State lost to
Notre Dame during the season and earned the title. In 1996, Florida
lost to Florida State but was declared national champion after
winning a rematch against the Seminoles in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unlikely. Alabama must win its next 10 games, as well
as the Southeastern Conference championship game, and hope that
only one other team goes undefeated. Then they must hope that the
computers and the polls rank them as the toughest of the one-loss
teams. Either way it makes for a tense season.
</P>
<P>
   And who would have thought that Paterno might have to wait until
next year to notch the seven victories needed to pass Bear Bryant
as the coach with the most Division I-A victories at 324? Seven
victories come as sure as the cold to Happy Valley in autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Nittany Lions lost the defensive stars LaVar Arrington
and Courtney Brown to the National Football League and their opener
to Southern California. Yes, quarterback Rashard Casey may be
distracted after being arrested on May 14 and charged in the
assault of an off-duty police officer in his hometown, Hoboken,
N.J. But Toledo? In Beaver Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to take a realistic look at whether we are any
good,'' Paterno said after the loss. ``We have not played a decent
offensive game in two weeks.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You expect the caustic Spurrier to show his disgust when
quarterback Jess Palmer goes 21 of 46 against a team that had not
won in 17 consecutive games. Spurrier did _ midway through the
third quarter when, facing third-and-26, he decided to punt. ``It
was like third-and-50,'' he said. ``We were just hoping to not get
it blocked.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the thickest-skinned Gators were stunned on the
subsequent drive when the Florida Field crowd serenaded them with
boos after Ball State blocked a punt and recovered it on Florida's
13-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever been booed by my own fans,'' tailback
Bo Carroll said. ``It wasn't exactly the outcome we wanted. The
fans weren't thrilled either. Maybe everyone gets a little spoiled.
They're used to us throwing up 60.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida forced a Ball State turnover and went on to a 40-19
victory. But Spurrier was not surprised at how the school's fans
treated his team. ``We didn't play that super,'' he said. ``We
won't be too full of ourselves after this one. We've got a lot of
improving to do.''
</P>
<P>
   They better. As Week 1 demonstrated, the college football season
can be over for some teams almost as soon as it begins. &QL;

   GORE-LABOR _ COLUMBUS, Ohio _ If organized labor's muscle helps
Democrat Al Gore carry Ohio in this year's presidential election,
much of the push will come from union members like Mary Kay Thomas.
Thomas, 43, doesn't drive a truck, assemble automobiles or bend
steel _ muscular jobs historically associated with the labor
movement. Instead, Thomas, deputy clerk for the Dayton Municipal
Court, is a public employee and a member of Local 101 of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
(AFSCME). As a member of a public employees' union, Thomas
increasingly represents the face of organized labor on this first

   RAMLE, Israel _ It was quite a send-off for a felonious
politician.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside a drab prison, on a huge stage erected for a
going-away party, the rabbis took their seats. In the crowd below,
acolytes of Aryeh Deri, the former leader of the Orthodox Shas
Party, danced rhapsodically as a religious rock group warmed up
with a few electric bars of last year's hit song, ``He's
Innocent.'' Thousands chanted ``Police state!'' under the impassive
surveillance of blue-uniformed Israeli police officers.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just the beginning of a three-hour rally that
culminated in Deri's solemn march from dais to prison. Accompanied
by a phalanx of officers, he clung to the rabbis' parting gift, a
velvet-covered Torah scroll to keep him company during his
three-year sentence for corruption. While the clanging prison door
seemed to seal his downfall, the crowd saw him elevated instead,
from charismatic politician to ``tzaddik,'' or righteous man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aryeh Deri is a symbol for all of us who were born in Morocco
and Iran and Iraq and Egypt,'' said Ayala Yosef, 37, a mother of
five. ``Today represents the apex of the persecution they inflicted
on him throughout his political career for standing up for us. But
it will backfire. Shas will only grow because they put him in
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   That is far from certain. Weakened by the loss of Deri's
charismatic leadership, by the taint of his conviction and by
internal conflicts, Shas has had a rocky year under the stewardship
of its new leader, Eli Yishai.
</P>
<P>
   Shas pulled out of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government
several months ago. Now, with Deri behind bars, Yishai and the
party's rabbis will try to figure out what lies ahead for them and
whether the party's fate is finally unbound from Deri's.
</P>
<P>
   After sequestering himself in religious studies for the last
year, Deri pronounced his own political career over. But he would
be eligible to run for Parliament after serving his term, and he
could even become a cabinet minister again in 10 years. He is only
41, and he has a passionate following.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came all the way from New York to see him off to prison,''
said Yoram Siman-tov, an Israeli immigrant who lives in Queens.
``And I will return again in a few years to welcome him out. I'm a
frequent flier.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 15 years, Deri built from scratch a political,
social and religious movement that blossomed into a linchpin
political party and Israel's third largest. Shas' leadership is
Orthodox, but its adherents include many traditional, but not
strictly religious, Jews of Middle Eastern descent who are drawn to
the party's second identity as an ethnic pride movement.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, as they developed a sizable religious school
system and social service program, Deri and his associates took
advantage of his position as a public servant, according to the
judges who convicted him last year of fraud and bribery. Deri
appealed the conviction and recently lost.
</P>
<P>
   The case brought ethnic, religious and class tensions to the
surface. Many secular Israelis saw Deri's behavior as a threat to
the rule of law by the leader of a party that answers to divine law
first.
</P>
<P>
   Many Shas supporters saw the legal system's behavior as an elite
crusade to bring down a powerful Moroccan-born Jew. On Sunday those
supporters contrasted Deri's conviction with the state's decision
not to prosecute Ezer Weizman, the former president, who accepted
substantial cash gifts from a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what color can do,'' said Sunday's posters, comparing
Weizman's supposed self-imposed punishment _ retirement to his
beach house in Ceasarea _ with the jail term handed Deri. Sephardic
Jews here often refer to themselves as black and to members of the
Ashkenazic elite, like Weizman, as white.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's rally, Deri asked forgiveness from everyone whose
path he had crossed in the recent past and urged his followers to
``rechannel the pain they've caused us into continuing the Jewish
revolution.'' A leading rabbi, Reuven Elbaz, pronounced ``this day,
the third of Elul,'' according to the Jewish calendar, ``as the
very start of the revolution, Bastille Day for the Sephardic
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Deri faded from public life after the elections last spring, but
the tensions raised by his trial did not fade. They were worsened
by Shas' difficult relationship with Barak. After Shas resigned
from his government, the prime minister announced a ``civil
revolution'' to divest the religious parties and the authorities of
their entrenched power. On Sunday, his cabinet voted to dismantle
the Ministry of Religious Affairs, a longtime power base of the
religious parties and, until several months ago, of Shas.
</P>
<P>
   Those recent political developments fueled the
anti-establishment sentiment at Deri's goodbye party on Sunday.
Highlighting the increasingly bitter relationship between secular
Israelis and Shas, several motorized hang-gliders zoomed back and
forth over the rally with pointed messages: ``Cursed be the one who
takes the bribes,'' said one banner, citing a verse from the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the civil revolution of Ehud Barak,'' said Mordechai
Ohayon, 25, pointing skyward. ``He will create a government of the
secular elite that holds its cabinet meetings on Sheinkin Street in
Tel Aviv, with pork chops for all his ministers.'' Sheinkin Street
is considered the epicenter of secular Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Most mainstream Israeli newspapers denounced ``Prison Day'' for
furthering a cult of persecution and victimization around Deri.
``Felon, not martyr,'' said the editorial in The Jerusalem Post.
``It behooves the Sephardi party's leaders to understand that the
facile canonization of a criminal is, in essence, an insufferable
attack on the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood on Sunday was frantic and festive at the same time, as
thousands of Orthodox men and women _ segregated by sex _ prayed,
sang and dance under the broiling summer sun. Yeshiva students in
black frock coats and fedoras jangled fund-raising boxes in time
with the beat of the rock group's pounding bass.

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Ogen Rintzler came from Israel to the
blue-green waters of the Black Sea on Sunday afternoon to say
farewell to his parents and to heal a wound even deeper than their
loss. Chefner Tudor made the journey in memory of his best friend.
Ilana Blum came to acknowledge the father whose death she had long
refused to accept.
</P>
<P>
   They were among 70 relatives and friends from around the world
who gathered for a memorial service at sea honoring 778 Romanian
Jews and crew members who died in 1942 when a Russian submarine
sank their disabled ship, the Struma.
</P>
<P>
   They all had their own memories of loss as a cantor's voice
carried the song of the dead across the calm, sun-drenched water.
They wept, they held each other and they seemed to find solace in
finally saying goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can pass this memory to the next generation so that
they don't forget the Struma,'' said Rintzler, 73.
</P>
<P>
   The sinking of the Struma was a wartime horror that the world
had largely forgotten. But some of the sensitivities surrounding
the episode were resurrected by the effort led by a grandson of two
of the victims to locate the wreckage and to conduct the memorial
service. The Turkish government refused at first to grant
permission for dives to try to find the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   When the divers went down anyway, their vessel was boarded by
the Turkish Coast Guard and the crew was held for several hours.
Their release came only through the intervention of one of the
country's wealthiest families.
</P>
<P>
   Approval for the dives finally came after Prime Minister Ehud
Barak of Israel raised the issue with his Turkish counterpart,
Bulent Ecevit, during a state visit late last month. By then, time
was too short to find the wreck. But the search leader said he was
confident it was in 250 feet of water, about 5 miles offshore near
where the Bosporus joins the Black Sea north of Istanbul. They also
discovered the graves of seven victims in the cemetery of a coastal
village.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the modern search for the Struma was enmeshed in
politics, so was its sinking at the height of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Struma left the Romanian port of Constanza on Dec. 11, 1941,
carrying Romanian Jews fleeing persecution and heading for
Palestine. Its engine failed on the Black Sea and it was towed into
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, trying to remain neutral, refused to allow anyone off
the ship. The British, who controlled Palestine, were refusing
entry to large numbers of Jews because they did not want to
antagonize the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very clear policy of restricting immigration to
Palestine,'' said David Logan, the British ambassador to Turkey,
who attended Sunday's service with his wife, Judy. ``In retrospect,
we could obviously have adopted a more humane attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The Struma sat in Istanbul for 70 days, growing more squalid by
the day. The ship was a converted steamer with a single outlet for
fresh water. The only food came from the city's Jews. Efforts to
repair the engine failed.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 23, 1942, the police towed the Struma up the Bosporus as
passengers hung signs from its sides pleading ``Help us.'' The ship
was set adrift in the Black Sea and at dawn the next day it was
sunk by a Russian submarine for unknown reasons. Only one person
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was the biggest loss of life in the exodus to
Palestine, the episode might have remained relegated to academic
studies if not for Greg Buxton, a computer programmer from
Birmingham, England, whose paternal grandparents perished on the
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Buxton spent two years and all of his money organizing the
search. He said Sunday that he expects that future efforts by the
governments of Israel and Turkey will find the ship. But from the
outset, he said the more important goal was remembering those who
died with the memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Ogen Rintzler was 14 in early 1941 when his father and mother,
Ahron and Fanni Rintzler, sent him, their only child, to Palestine.
His parents had visited the country in the 1930s and his father
fell in love with the dream of a Jewish homeland. His parents
booked passage on the Struma to join him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire family was against my parents getting on the
Struma,'' Rintzler said. ``They sent a rabbi to convince my father
not to take the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Rintzler has remained in Israel, marrying, building a business
career, raising his own children. He learned to live with the
deaths of his parents, but several years ago he discovered
something that renewed and increased his sorrow. An uncle told him
that his mother was pregnant when she boarded the ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the heaviest blow,'' Rintzler said mournfully,
looking at a photograph of himself as a boy with his parents in
Bucharest. ``Knowing what they suffered, what my mother suffered
while she was pregnant, it was worse than the deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Chefner Tudor, 80, came to Istanbul from Haifa, Israel, to honor
his best boyhood friend, Norbert Storfer. Were it not for an
accident of history, someone might have been there Sunday
remembering Tudor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was registered on the Struma, but there were delays and
another ship became available,'' Tudor said. ``I told Norbert he
should come with me, but he said he was enrolled on the Struma and
he would wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Tudor sailed on the Dorian II, arriving in Istanbul with about
600 Jews from Romania and Bulgaria. The people from that earlier
ship were allowed to disembark and proceed to Palestine by train
and bus, and Tudor has lived there ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Horia Lobel was the doctor on the Struma. His pregnant wife
stayed behind and planned to join him with the baby in Palestine
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was always waiting for him to send for us,'' said
Ilana Blum, the daughter Lobel never knew. ``There were rumors of
survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   Blum, a professor at a Tel Aviv medical school, and her mother
were given shelter by a Christian family in the Romanian mountains
during the war. She was 14 before she knew she was Jewish. She was
58 before she accepted her father's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, I always thought that maybe he somehow survived,''
she said sadly as flowers tossed onto the sea by mourners floated
past the ship. ``Now I have closed the circle.''

GORE AIDE EARNS HER STRIPES ON PASSION AND COMMITMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wispy young woman paces at the back of the crowd, nodding
incessantly as Al Gore makes another arcane point about the
intricacies of Medicare. She claps tentatively and pumps her fist a
little, almost as if afraid that someone will see. It is not every
27-year-old, after all, who can be driven to ecstasy by a
candidate's pledge to put the Medicare surplus in a lock box.
</P>
<P>
   But Sarah A. Bianchi is not just any twenty-something. In the
five years since she graduated from Harvard, where she shared a
suite in Leverett House with Gore's eldest daughter, Karenna Gore
Schiff, Bianchi has worked as an assistant to the associate
director for health at the Office of Management and Budget and an
assistant director for health policy at the president's domestic
policy council. From there, she became the senior health care
adviser to the vice president and now serves as deputy issues
director of the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore has increasingly built his politics on his passion for
policy, Bianchi has become one of his most visible staff members.
Last week, after pulling near all-nighters to compile briefing
papers on health care, she worked the campaign's press filing
centers doggedly and sat in on conference calls, answering
reporters' questions about the details of Gore's proposals and
taking shots at those of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, at a health care forum in Albuquerque, N.M., a woman
in the audience asked Gore whether his proposal to expand the
federal Children's Health Insurance Program would cover prenatal
care. He had no idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Sarah out there somewhere?'' Gore pleaded, scanning the
crowd. She wasn't, having stayed in a nearby filing center, where
reporters and Gore aides were watching the event on closed-circuit
television.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing her name, Bianchi scurried to his rescue. She assured
the woman, and Gore, that the proposal would restore prenatal care
coverage that had been eliminated several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that Gore's been fighting for for a long
time,'' Bianchi told the woman.
</P>
<P>
   And then Gore, laughing at himself, said, ``As I was saying,
part of my proposal is to restore the coverage for people in that
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the campaign, according to Gore and his
aides, Bianchi has earned a place at the table with a passionate
commitment to social policy, a steel-trap mind for numbers, a quiet
confidence that belies her age, and a determination that policy not
be compromised by politics. If some Gore aides once dismissed her
because of her youth, they now know that she has the vice
president's complete confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in an interview, described Bianchi _ ``Sarah B.'' to the
Gore family _ as ``scary smart,'' and possessing an encyclopedic
expertise on health and welfare policy.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't it make him nervous to place someone so young in a
position of such responsibility and visibility? ``Yes,'' he said,
``it did. For about a week. After that I lost any apprehension at
all. She handles herself like a seasoned pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi, an Atlanta native, has long been enamored of policy. In
college, she wrote a senior thesis about welfare reform in Georgia.
Her father is the founding headmaster of a progressive private
school. Her mother is a developmental psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   She came to know the Gores through her ties to Schiff. But
several Gore aides said she had risen on her merits, and Ronald
Klain, Gore's former chief of staff, said he first hired her
without even knowing of her connections to the Gores.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns, of course, are often populated with bright young
people who are valued for their enthusiasm, their stamina and their
willingness to sleep on futons. Gore's research director, David
Ginsberg, is 25. Michael B. Feldman, a senior adviser, is 31.
Gore's national field director, Donnie Fowler, is 32, as is his
speechwriter, Eli Attie. His press secretary, Chris Lehane, is 33.
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi, a fan of black pinstripes, fuels her days with candy
bars and Diet Cokes. Her cell phone has become an appendage, and
she acknowledges that she has no life outside the campaign. But
youth, she suggests, can be overcome, particularly with a resume as
deep as hers and a long list of mentors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable,'' Bianchi said, ``that I've had a lot of
experiences that, though they were quick, have built on each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   She admitted feeling the doubts of her colleagues in early
strategy sessions, but said that Gore had helped establish her
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there have been meetings with senior staff where they
come in and think, `What is she doing here?''' Bianchi said. ``But
then he'll call on me and say, `Sarah, tell us about that
program.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi's most important role, said several Gore aides, may be
in fighting the temptation to push the campaign's rhetoric beyond
the limits of its policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have definitely been moments when far more important
people than me were advocating a position that I was not,'' she
said. ``You know, it's `Why can't we say it this way?' and I have
to say, `Because it's not true.' And then they say, `Well, can't we
just make it true?' And you have to say, `No.'''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff said that Bianchi was ``not afraid to be the buzz kill''
in staff meetings. ``When there's something that might play well
politically,'' Schiff said, ``Sarah's always the reality check.''

BRITAIN'S ABBEY NATIONAL TO BUY INSURER SCOTTISH PROVIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Abbey National, Britain's second-largest mortgage
lender, has won a bidding contest to acquire Scottish Provident, an
Edinburgh-based mutual life insurer for about 2 billion pounds, or
$2.9 billion, executives close to the deal said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   British mortgage lenders are increasingly looking to diversify
their businesses into other sectors as competition has brought down
margins in their traditional mortgage and savings lines of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Abbey National's bid beat offers by Royal London and Liverpool &AMP;
Victoria, ending a five-month auction for the Scottish life
insurance company, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Abbey National hopes to use its extensive branch network to sell
Scottish Provident's products, as well as those of Scottish Mutual,
a life insurer it acquired in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the deal said Scottish Provident would sell
its 38 percent stake in Aberdeen Asset Management before it was
sold to Abbey National.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have estimated that Aberdeen could be worth as much as
400 million pounds, or $585.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Aberdeen will still manage Scottish
Provident's funds under contract, the executives said.

RELIABLE MATHEMATICS TO PREDICT ELECTIONS STILL ELUDE POLITICAL
SCIENTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Political Memo) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For many people who live here, presidential
politics is an exciting and uncertain enterprise, where the fate of
an ideological principle or, more important, a career, may hang on
a slip in a debate or a brilliant 30-second commercial.
</P>
<P>
   But for seven visitors seeking to impose a precision and
predictability on political life that even those in its midst
cannot divine, Vice President Al Gore has already beaten Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Those seven political scientists, among the more than 2,000 who
gathered here this weekend for the 96th annual meeting of the
American Political Science Association, have precise mathematical
formulas that, if taken at face value, mean that the candidates,
their handlers and the press should take the next nine weeks off.
They presented their results in a panel discussion Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Election Day, everyone could look up to see
whether Gore's winning margin was the 52.8 percent of the two-party
vote forecast by James Campbell of the State University of New York
at Buffalo, the 60.3 percent expected by Thomas Holbrook of the
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, or something in between.
</P>
<P>
   The predictions of six of the formulas depend heavily on the
health of the economy, by one measure or another, and on
presidential popularity or the candidates' standings in Labor Day
polls. The seventh, offered by Helmut Norpoth of the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, depends on how the nominee
of the incumbent party did in the New Hampshire primary. Norpoth's
formula, which allows a forecast as soon as the incumbent party's
nominee is clear (in March this year), gave Gore 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At one level, the formulas reflect the continuing tendency of
political science to seek mathematic precision by relating
disparate facts: comparing roll call votes with House re-election
rates, for example, or the frequency of pork-barrel spending by
senators of different parties. In recent decades, one trend in
political science as a discipline has been a struggle to seem as
precise as physics, with equations as the tool.
</P>
<P>
   But at another level, these formulas reflect an underlying
advantage for the Gore campaign, an economics-based edge that these
students of past elections say it will take major efforts by one or
both campaigns to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Abramowitz of Emory University in Atlanta said the data
reflected the assumption that presidential elections are ``largely
a reflection on the performance of the incumbent president and the
state of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But his formula _ and some of the others _ also include a
handicap when a party is seeking to hold the White House for more a
third term or more. That is one reason why despite President
Clinton's high poll ratings and a booming economy, Abramowitz's
forecast was toward the lower end of the range, projecting Gore
with 53.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook said his formula and the others assumed that ``both
candidates will run pretty good campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he acknowledged, Bush's father outperformed the
predictions because his opponent, Gov. Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts, ran a poor general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, the lone acknowledged Republican on the panel
Thursday, said that in the past ``glitches and gaffes'' had
accounted for no more than 1 or 2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us are predicting that the fundamentals will shift the
campaign so that it's pretty remote'' that Bush will win, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere at the convention, the forecast panelists' colleagues
were treating the election as something still worth studying. One
group listened while television advertising producers discounted
their own importance. Ray Strother, a Democratic media consultant,
said often television campaign advertising doesn't ``work
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that they are shown much more frequently than they were
30 years ago, he asked, ``If ads are better, why do we have to show
them three times more often to make them work?''
</P>
<P>
   At another session, three Rutgers University political
scientists examined press coverage of Elizabeth Dole's campaign for
the Republican nomination. Caroline Heldman, Susan Carroll and
Stephanie Olson argued that ``the repeated references to Bob Dole
in article after article may have subtly undermined her independent
stature as a presidential candidate in the minds of voters.''
</P>
<P>
   But the forecasters, taking comfort in their unanimity of
expected result, were sticking by what the panel's chairman, James
Garand of Louisiana State University, admitted some colleagues
sneered at as ``recreational political science.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Wiezien of the University of Houston forecast a 55.2
percent victory for Gore, but observed: ``He still might lose, but
based on our analysis, it's not very likely.''

WORLDCOM SAID TO BE IN TALKS TO BUY INTERMEDIA
</HEADLINE>
 By   ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The WorldCom Corp. is in advanced talks to acquire Intermedia
Communications Inc., a telecommunications operator, for almost $3
billion in cash and stock, executives close to the negotiations
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Intermedia, based in Tampa, Fla., has been an extremely
attractive takeover target because it has a 54 percent stake in
Digex Inc., a Web hosting company, which provides storage for
corporate Web sites, monitors their performance and maintains
Internet connections. It is viewed as the crown jewel of
Intermedia, which sells phone services to businesses and government
agencies and Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to the deal, WorldCom entered
negotiations with Intermedia last week after talks between
Intermedia and Global Crossing, the telecommunications company
based in Hamilton, Bermuda, broke down. A third suitor, Exodus
Communications Inc., offered to acquire Digex, based in Beltsville,
Md., for close to $8.5 billion in stock but was rebuffed by
Intermedia.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Intermedia put its Digex stake, for which it paid $150
million in cash in July 1997, up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   According to the executives, WorldCom is negotiating to pay
about $39 a share for Intermedia and take on nearly $3 billion of
the company's debt. That would represent about a 70 percent premium
to Intermedia's closing price on Friday of $22.88.
</P>
<P>
   The executives cautioned that the deal could still fall apart
and that Digex could quash the deal. A purchase of Intermedia would
be WorldCom's first significant deal since its proposed merger with
the Sprint Corp.oration collapsed because of opposition from
antitrust regulators.

RICHARDSON SUPPORTS RUSSIAN PLAN TO BUILD NUCLEAR-FUEL STORAGE
SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After touring a secret nuclear submarine base on
Russia's Pacific Coast, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson indicated
Sunday that he will support a Kremlin request for help in building
a high-security storage site for nuclear fuel from decommissioned
Russian subs.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and other American experts, including Assistant
Secretary of Defense Ted Warner, were given broad access to the
naval base at Petropavlovsk, on the Kamchatka peninsula, where
roughly 20 submarines already are docked and awaiting dismantling.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian navy has asked the United States to assume half the
cost of building a $200 million floating dry-dock that would store
radioactive reactor casings and nuclear fuel. U.S. law allows for
such aid, but only when it can be clearly shown to benefit American
national security.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Sunday from Anchorage, a stopover on
his return flight to Washington, Richardson said he believes the
site is needed to protect Russian reactor fuels from the dangers of
terrorist theft and so-called insider sales by Russians desperate
for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some hard work'' he said, to convince the
Congress ``that this is a worthy project; that it makes sense to
defuel and decommission these nuclear subs on the basis of
nonproliferation. ``But we think it makes sense to make this a
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Energy Department official said the navy has made a
convincing case that it lacks the money to dismantle and defuel the
subs by itself. Nor do the 20 submarines appear sufficiently
seaworthy to be towed to the nearest port, at Vladivostok, where
another American-built site could accommodate the fuel and reactor
parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy says that if you try to tow these subs, they'll break
apart and we'll end up with reactors on the bottom,'' that official
said. ``And nobody wants that.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's Kamchatka stop concluded a weeklong swing through
the former Soviet Union that was largely devoted to promoting
nuclear non-proliferation and improving good will with his Russian
counterparts. Americans on the trip have said they are impressed
with the openness of the Russians, who have escorted them through
an atomic-weapons plant and, Sunday, a nuclear sub base despite
obvious tensions in the American-Russian relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, some Russian military leaders have stopped barely
short of accusing the United States or other NATO powers of sinking
the Russian submarine Kursk in a covered-up collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signal thing about this trip today was the degree to which
the navy was willing to come forward and say, `We have a huge
problem and all our historic concerns about secrecy, we're going to
drop,''' the senior Energy Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal outlined Sunday, the American money would
help build a so-called interim storage site for reactor parts and
fuel, while the Russians would pay for dismantling the remainder of
the subs. The reactor fuel, which the Russians say is pure enough
to be used in nuclear weapons, would be shipped to a Ural Mountains
plant for reprocessing into fuel for nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Kremlin announced Sunday that the two nations
have signed a treaty committing each government to dispose of 34
tons of weapons-grade plutonium, either by converting it to
nuclear-reactor fuel or by immobilizing it in a nuclear-waste
disposal site.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will spend about $4 billion to carry out its
obligations under the treaty. Russia will spend about $1.7 billion,
and the United States has promised to help Moscow secure
international loans to help pay that cost.

 &HT;    Gore may benefit from increased numbers of unionized public
employeesBy William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ If organized labor's muscle helps Democrat Al
Gore carry Ohio in this year's presidential election, much of the
push will come from union members like Mary Kay Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 43, doesn't drive a truck, assemble automobiles or bend
steel _ muscular jobs historically associated with the labor
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Thomas, deputy clerk for the Dayton Municipal Court, is
a public employee and a member of Local 101 of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME).
</P>
<P>
   As a member of a public employees' union, Thomas increasingly
represents the face of organized labor on this first Labor Day of a
new century.
</P>
<P>
   Both nationally and in Ohio, the percentage of public employees
in the labor movement is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 43 percent of the nation's 16.5 million union members
were public employees, up from 32 percent in 1983, the first year
the U.S. Census used sample sizes large enough to provide reliable
state-by-state breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, the percentage went from 24 percent in 1983 to 35
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the percentage of all public sector workers
belonging to unions has been increasing while the percentage of
private sector workers with union cards has declined.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, 22.5 percent of private employees were union members in
1983, compared to 13.4 percent in 1999. The percentage of Ohio
public employees belonging to unions has increased from 39.3
percent in 1983 to 47.7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio labor leaders, such as state AFL-CIO President William
Burga, say there's unity between these two streams of the labor
movement. Detractors, such as economist Leo Troy of Rutgers
University, say private sector and public sector workers have
different political and economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of this year's presidential election could turn on
who's right.
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND LABOR'S CHANGING FACE
</P>
<P>
   Thomas enthusiastically backs Gore for president. She
particularly liked what she considered his sparkling performance at
the Democratic National Convention and his choice of Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut as his running mate. Lieberman, an
Orthodox Jew, is the first person of his faith to run on a major
party's presidential ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good. I'm energized,'' said Thomas. ``I got a positive
outlook for Gore since he picked a running mate. It added some
diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and Gore, she said, are for the ``working folks,''
while Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his running mate Dick Cheney
aren't.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time during this presidential season, whatever
sparkle Gore has as a presidential candidate didn't attract some of
the nation's old-line private sector unions. The United Auto
Workers briefly flirted with endorsing consumer advocate Ralph
Nader before throwing in with Gore just before the Democratic
convention last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters still haven't endorsed a candidate, although
they're expected to do so in the next week or two.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's support for normalizing trade relations with China
chilled his relations with the auto workers and other industrial
unions. As Bill Clinton's vice president, he also supported the
North American Free Trade Agreement, which industrial unions
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned. There's still concern,'' said Burga, formerly
a steelworker. ``I think it's dissipating. We're seeing a lot of
enthusiasm now.''
</P>
<P>
   Burga said Gore helped himself at the convention by pledging to
support making workers' rights part of trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Bush won't listen to us,'' Burga said. ``We think
we have a chance of Gore doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said she understands how industrial workers feel about
the trade issue, although it doesn't affect her directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess as public employees we're not part of the trade
agreement. We're not shipping off a lot of our main jobs,'' she
said. ``I'm very sympathetic to their causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy, distinguished professor of economics, said, however,
public employees generally ``don't give one hoot'' about trade
agreements. In fact, said Troy, they benefit by lower prices for
consumer goods that result from free trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This labor solidarity is just a slogan,'' he contended. ``In
reality it's like Swiss Cheese. It's full of holes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said public employee unions seek more government spending
that will result in more jobs for their members, while well-paid
union members in the private sector, such as auto workers, don't
want to pay the high taxes that come with more public spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush can tap into that, he'll take a lot of private-sector
(union members),'' Troy said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kate Bronfrenbrenner, director of labor education at Cornell
University, said Troy misjudges public employees.
</P>
<P>
   In states like Ohio, she said, industrial workers have raised
the consciousness of public employees on the trade issue. Public
employees understand that the loss of industrial jobs due to unfair
trade practices will affect the tax base and, ultimately, affect
their jobs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade deficits hurt the public sector,'' Bronfrenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   SHRINKING PRIVATE UNIONS AND GROWING PUBLIC UNIONS
</P>
<P>
   Trade deficits, said Ohio AFL-CIO president Burga, are bad for
unions and for the country.
</P>
<P>
   They mean fewer American manufacturing jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we end up losing manufacturing, at some point it will cost
our economy because this country cannot survive on a service and
high-technology economy. We have to have manufacturing to survive
in this world or else we'll just continue a downward standard of
living,'' Burga said.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of union members in manufacturing has been dramatic
both in overall numbers and percentages. The total number of
members in unions representing auto, steel and other manufacturing
workers went from 5.3 million in 1983 to 3 million last year. In
Ohio, the drop was from 461,916 manufacturing union members in 1983
to 304,452 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing unions no longer dominate Ohio's labor landscape.
The two biggest unions in the state represent public employees _
the Ohio Education Association, with 117,000 active members,
including teachers and education support employees ; and AFSCME,
Mary Kay Thomas' union, with 104,069 members, representing a broad
cross section of public sector workers.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Leibensperger, secretary-treasurer of the OEA, said his
group historically has ``supported our brothers and sisters in the
labor movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The OEA's major focus, however, is on education _ improving the
work lives of school employees and the conditions for learning in
public schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a major reason why the OEA and its parent organization,
the National Education Association, back Gore, he said. For
example, he said, Gore opposes vouchers which would let parents use
public money to send their children to private schools while Bush
favors them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are very much energized by the voucher issue,''
Leibensperger said.
</P>
<P>
   A LABOR CAST OF 400 FOR THE ELECTION
</P>
<P>
   As always, the outcome of the presidential election will depend
on which side does better at getting its voters to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Burga said electing Gore is the top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 400 local union activists who are serving as
(election) coordinators,'' Burga said. ``We're going to have more
people than we ever had working full time (on the election).''
</P>
<P>
   In Dayton, Wes Wells, executive director of the AFL-CIO Regional
Labor Council, which covers 11 counties, said his group will have
100 people working for Gore and other labor-backed candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do our job, which we intend on doing, you're going to
see labor being a main player in this election,'' Wells said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEWATER, Vt. _ A couple of years ago, a very wealthy couple
finished building a very large house in this southern Vermont
hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   It was truly a fine house, built of stone, nearly 13,000 square
feet, set on 460 acres near the top of Stonegate Mountain, with
panoramic views of verdant Vermont wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a house so large and so fine, in fact, that when it came
time to bill its owners for property tax, the town's Board of
Listers, as assessors here are known, put its value at about $6
million, a nearly unheard-of sum in a modest rural state where log
cabins are still far more common than starter mansions.
</P>
<P>
   That's not fair, protested the property owners _ Jim P. Manzi,
former head of Lotus Development, whose stock in the company was
worth $78 million when IBM bought the business in 1995, and his
wife, Glenda _ faced with an annual property tax bill of more than
$100,000. (Or rather, their lawyers said it.) The house may have
cost nearly $6 million to build, they asserted, but it is so
idiosyncratic that no buyer would ever pay so much for it. The
value of a property, they argued, is what it would bring on the
market. They set the house's value at less than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   No, responded the Bridgewater listers. Under a Vermont Supreme
Court ruling, cost is a valid measure of such a property's value,
they argued; plus, by their calculations, $6 million was close to
what recent sales of comparable property indicated the house would
bring if sold. An insurance company appraisal also coincided with
the $6 million figure. It was unheard-of, they said, but it was
right, particularly in a super-charged economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last five years or so, Vermont has become like the
coast of Maine was _ the super-rich are starting to discover it,
and we are seeing that happen here,'' said Thomas K. Standish,
chairman of the three-person Board of Listers. ``We're the first to
confront the fact that very high-end properties are scarce as hen's
teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the Manzis' claims, the home's features as described by
the listers sound luxurious but hardly eccentric: seven fireplaces,
radiant heat in the floors, stonework in the bathrooms and beams
from old barns used in some of the construction.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Manzis' third home, according to the listers.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, is now about two years old, with another hearing
scheduled next week, but this much is clear: in a boom-time of
got-rich-quick millionaires indulging their house fantasies, such
tussles abound from the mountains of Vermont to the shores of Puget
Sound.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Bill Gates briefly questioned the assessors' estimate
that the 40,000-square-foot high-tech mansion his Microsoft
billions built near Seattle was worth more than $50 million, saying
no one else would pay such a price. He later withdrew the
objection, and the assessment has since risen to about $110
million, putting his annual property tax at over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1997, Michael Dell, the Dell Computer mogul, challenged
his county property-appraisal office in Austin because it said his
new 33,000-square-foot home was worth more than $22 million; he
maintained it was worth no more than $5 million or $6 million. The
two sides reached a compromise of $12 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, there may be several hundred such disputes about
extra-luxurious houses under way around the country, said Dick
Netzer, a professor of economics and public administration at New
York University and an expert on property taxation. And the
conflicts are not limited to houses: in a classic tax case, he
noted, the owners of the New York Stock Exchange argued decades ago
that it should not be assessed at what it cost to build, because it
had virtually no value to anyone but the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In towns like Bridgewater, with a population of about 960 people
mainly of modest means, these tax conflicts can take on a tinge of
David versus Goliath, with the town's resources looking decidedly
David-sized next to a homeowner with millions. Studies on other
regions have found that the fanciest of houses are routinely
under-assessed, both because it is hard to place a value on unique
properties and, some say, because towns lack the resources to fight
legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   When towns are challenged, ``They very frequently give way on
legal battles about property taxes and zoning, in order to avoid
the costs of litigation,'' Netzer said. ``It happens all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But not in Bridgewater. Standish and his two fellow listers,
elected officials paid $9 an hour for their time, have devoted more
than 1,000 hours, they estimate, to fighting the Manzis' appeal,
and they show no signs of flagging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument that the rich don't know what they're doing with
their money, and will build toys they'll never get their money back
out of, is not a credible one, in our opinion,'' Standish said.
</P>
<P>
   Manzi, through his Boston lawyer, Michael Lynch, declined
comment on the dispute. Lynch provided only this written statement:
``All property taxes assessed against the Manzis' Bridgewater
property have been timely paid and will continue to be paid in the
future. Any further comment would be inappropriate in light of the
pending litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Lee, the chairman of the town Board of Selectmen, said
that Vermont's recent property tax reform is already hurting
Bridgewater, and cases like the Manzi's fuel an anger among
old-style Vermonters that is visible these days in the thousands of
``Take Back Vermont'' signs spotting the state's roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``People born in Vermont are having to give up their properties
because of the tax rate being rammed down their throat by people
who are like the Manzis,'' he said. ``It's happening in Colorado,
it's happening in Maine'' he added. ``You should see what's going
on there. The gentrification and the tastelessness _ and the
disregard of the local guy.''

PROGRESS REPORTED IN TALKS AT FIRESTONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiators for Bridgestone/Firestone and the union representing
8,000 of its workers continued talks in St. Louis on Sunday as they
sought to reach a tentative contract and avert a threatened strike.
</P>
<P>
   The union, the United Steelworkers of America, said there had
been enough progress in the talks to warrant keeping workers on the
job even though the union originally planned to begin a strike
early Saturday if no agreement was reached by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still slogging away,'' said John Duray, a union
spokesman. ``If progress weren't being made, we wouldn't still be
at the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Bridgestone/Firestone, which is based in
Nashville, also said Sunday that they were optimistic that a
settlement could be reached without a walkout threatened at nine of
its 11 U.S. factories.
</P>
<P>
   A strike would involve workers at factories in Akron, Ohio;
Bloomington, Ill.; Decatur, Ill.; Des Moines, Iowa; Noblesville,
Ind.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; Russellville, Ark.; LaVergne, Tenn.;
and Warren County, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Smith, mobilization coordinator for Steelworkers Local
1055 in LaVergne, said the workers were poised to go on strike if
the talks fall apart. ``We're on the ready whether to have a work
stoppage or a tentative agreement,'' Smith said. ``And if they want
us to help them rebuild their reputation, then we're ready to do
that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 8,000 union members are covered by a master contract
that expired on April 23. Since then, they have been working under
a temporary contract extension.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For moviegoers weary of long lines, sticky floors and
poor sight lines, the two huge new theaters facing each other on
Times Square at 42nd Street near Eighth Avenue _ a block once home
to several seedy flophouses _ are a welcome improvement. They offer
comfortable stadium seating, clean surroundings and the latest
digital-sound technology. Together, they have 38 screens and more
than 8,100 seats.
</P>
<P>
   But for analysts who follow the movie theater industry, those
two costly new movie houses, the Loews Cineplex 42nd Street E-Walk
and the AMC Empire 25, are examples of an industry in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Longstanding distribution practices force them to compete with
each other for films, and there are just not enough hits to go
around, especially during a lackluster summer like the current one.
Since theater companies do not allow any film to be shown in more
than one theater in a ``film zone,'' which usually encompasses an
area of three to five square miles. The Loews multiplex theater
that opened in the basement of the Virgin Megastore in Times Square
just four years ago is relegated to showing movies well past their
prime.
</P>
<P>
   After AMC opened a popular 24-screen theater in Dallas in 1995,
developers and theater companies began building gigantic
multiplexes at a frenzied pace. In five years, the number of movie
screens in the country has grown to more than 37,000 from slightly
fewer than 28,000, the number that most analysts agree is the
maximum that can exist profitably.
</P>
<P>
   As companies open large, luxurious megaplexes _ which generally
have at least 14 screens and always offer stadium seating _ they
often find themselves taking business away from older, smaller
megaplexes that lack the most up-to-the-minute amenities. Often
stuck with long-term leases, the exhibitors have not been able to
close unprofitable theaters fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mass suicide,'' Sean J. Egan, the managing director
of Egan-Jones Ratings Co., a bond-rating firm in Wynnewood, Pa.,
said of the building spree. ``They see their competitors putting up
new attractive theaters so they think that to be competitive they
have to do that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the publicly-traded theater companies have
watched their stock prices plunge. Bond ratings have plummeted. A
few companies, like Carmike Cinemas, a chain based in Columbus,
Ga., and Edwards Theaters, of Newport Beach, Calif., have filed for
bankruptcy protection. Others, like Regal Cinemas and United
Artists, are teetering on the edge or struggling. AMC, for example,
cut administrative costs by $20 million last year, including
dismissing more than 100 people. Most recently, Loews Cineplex, the
nation's fourth-largest movie-theater chain and the dominant
company in New York, said on Aug. 25 that it might default on its
debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is somewhat of a universal problem for the industry,''
said Dick Westerling, a spokesman for Regal Cinemas in Knoxville,
Tenn. ``We've had a heavily leveraged scenario that has accompanied
the overbuilding. And to have a future, you had to build. It's a
challenging time for all of us in exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these industry-wide problems, more new megaplexes are
being built in New York and elsewhere in the country because of
competitive pressure or commitments that predate the theater
industry's overbuilding and steep financial reversals. Loews
Cineplex plans to open a 14-screen theater on 34th Street and
Eighth Avenue in 18 months. In Ontario, Calif., two new megaplexes
run by Edwards Theaters and AMC face one another across a parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   The theater-building boom began during flush times for the movie
business. In the 90s box-office grosses were steadily increasing,
financing was cheap and there was clearly a need to improve the
movie-going experience. Many of the cramped older multiplexes had
been incorporated into shopping centers almost as an afterthought,
merely to bring in evening traffic. Audiences were grumbling about
inconvenient show times, sold-out showings and tiny screens. There
was concern that more affordable home entertainment equipment and
other technological advances would prove more attractive
alternatives for moviegoers. At first, exhibitors that opened in
new, underserved markets did well, said David H. Allen, a media and
entertainment analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``All the big
players were getting returns on their capital of 20 or 30
percent,'' he said. ``It was like minting money.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry expected its new theaters to be popular, but it had
not anticipated a major change in moviegoing habits: As megaplexes
proliferated, people began bypass the older multiplexes closer to
their homes and to travel farther to go to one of the newer
megaplexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew from the outset the broad geographic appeal that a
megaplex would have,'' said a spokesman for AMC, Richard J. King,
``but we did underestimate the effect they would have on the older
multiplexes. We were a little surprised by the pace.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Besides cannibalizing their multiplexes, the exhibitors cut into
their revenues by having so many screens in each megaplex. With
multiple screens, an exhibitor can show widely anticipated movies
like this summer's ``The Perfect Storm'' or ``The Patriot'' in
several auditoriums at once, staggering starting times and making
it unlikely that anyone will be turned away. But that means a film
will have a shorter life in the theater, because most people who
want to see a particular movie will catch it during the first two
weeks of its run, when the lion's share of the proceeds go to the
film studio, not the exhibitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in their best interest for a film to be under their roof
for eight weeks,'' said Jeffrey S. Thomison, an analyst for
Hilliard Lyons, a securities firm in Louisville, Ky., said of the
theater companies.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the industry's problems was a disappointing summer
at the box office. Paul Dergarabedian, the president of Exhibitor
Relations, a Los Angeles company that monitors box-office
performance, estimates that gross box office revenue from this
summer's movie season, which ends Monday, will be seven percent
lower than last summer's, $2.7 billion, compared with $2.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And although some movies attracted large audiences, none
generated the excitement of last year's ``Star Wars: Episode One _
The Phantom Menace'' or this summer's television hit ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To fill that many seats,'' Dergarabedian said, ``you have to
have a marketplace that's really psyched up, that's excited not
only see the movie they came out to see, but to see another movie
next week.'' But instead of building momentum through the summer,
attendance has been dropping, he said.
</P>
<P>
   AMC officials acknowledge that the absence of a box-office
stampede has hurt its Empire 25, the company's first theater in New
York, more than its Times Square competitor, although they say both
theaters are doing well.
</P>
<P>
   The AMC spokesman, King, said that his company's interest in
Times Square dates to the early days of the neighborhood's
revitalization, long before the Loews Cineplex E-Walk was
contemplated. But AMC's complicated project took many years to
complete, in part because it involved the renovation and relocation
of a 1912 theater. The Empire 25 opened in April, five months after
the E-walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed to find that we wouldn't have that trade
area to ourselves,'' King said. After encountering competition, AMC
decided to dedicate the top floor of its new theater to arthouse
films, a market sector that has also had a slow summer.
</P>
<P>
   Loews, which has 128 screens in New York (83 of them in
Manhattan alone) and is 40 percent owned by Sony Pictures
Entertainment, a major movie studio, has more clout with
distributors and often gets first crack at the most-anticipated
pictures. As of July 31, E-Walk was the 12 highest-grossing theater
in the country, said Daniel Marks, the executive vice president of
ACNeilsen EDI, which tracks box-office returns. (Marks said AMC's
Empire 25 was too new to be ranked.)
</P>
<P>
   King said he expected AMC to get more top films eventually. ``A
newcomer doesn't get full allocation immediately,'' he said.
``Normally, it takes one or two seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Theater companies are taking various steps to reduce their debt,
including closing unprofitable theaters, renegotiating bank loans
and slowing the pace of construction. And moviegoers themselves are
likely to notice some of their efforts, including pre-movie
advertising, kiosks selling movie paraphernalia in theater lobbies
and more ads on popcorn bags and everywhere else exhibitors can
think of. ``We're all exploring ancillary revenue streams,'' said a
spokesman for Regal Cinemas, Dick Westerling. ``People will become
more creative.''

UNPARALLELED INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS HAVING A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE
ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As employers clamor for more foreign-born workers and as tens of
thousands of Mexicans slip across the border each year, the
percentage of immigrant workers in the nation's labor force has
climbed to its highest level in seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   New figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the
number of immigrant workers jumped to 15.7 million last year, up 17
percent from three years earlier. Immigration experts estimate that
nearly 5 million of these workers are illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   This influx _ immigrants now make up 12 percent of the nation's
workers _ is having profound effects on the work force and the
economy, helping to hold down wages in unskilled occupations and
giving many companies the employees they need to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants dominate dozens of job categories, especially
arduous, low-paying ones: poultry plant workers, meat packers,
gardeners, hotel maids, seamstresses, restaurant workers,
building-demolition workers, and fruit and vegetable pickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigrants are now a critical part of the labor force across
the board,'' said Dimitri Papademetriou, co-director of
international migration policy at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace. ``We are into a new world of immigrants
basically spreading throughout the economy. This is something that
is going to continue and intensify.''
</P>
<P>
   With a jobless rate of 4.1 percent in August, near its lowest
point in 40 years, the debate about immigrant workers has shifted
considerably from five years ago, when many politicians called for
more restrictive policies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, software companies, farmers, hotel chains and other
employers desperate for more workers are pressuring Congress to
enact legislation that would admit hundreds of thousands of
additional immigrants each year.
</P>
<P>
   But some groups, most notably labor unions and engineers'
associations, are fighting such an easing, fearing that it will
depress wages and cost jobs for American workers. At the same time,
organized labor has softened its once hard-line stance toward
illegal immigrants already in the country, as it seeks to unionize
them.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and demographers see a continuing surge in immigrant
workers unless there is a major economic downturn. Under existing
quotas, about 800,000 immigrants enter the nation legally each
year. An estimated 300,000 enter illegally.
</P>
<P>
   These workers range from supermarket deliverymen who often
receive an illegally low $3 an hour, far less than the minimum wage
of $5.15 an hour, to $100,000-a-year software developers from
India.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of immigrant workers has soared, Americans are
voicing less anger and anxiety about immigration than in the
mid-1990s. The reason, political analysts said, is that the
economic boom and low jobless rate have reduced economic
insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, politicians who led the attack against immigrants
_ with measures to cut government benefits to the children of
illegal immigrants _ have seen their efforts backfire, especially
in California. There, the fast-growing Hispanic and Asian
populations have moved to punish anti-immigrant politicians in the
voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a very robust economy and full employment, and that
always changes the terms of debate on immigration,'' said James P.
Smith, an economist with the Rand Corp. who served as chairman of a
1997 National Academy of Sciences study on the effects of
immigration. ``When there are plenty of jobs around, the finger
pointing that goes on about immigration goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in some places, like Farmingville, N.Y., residents have
complained that dozens of immigrant day laborers who assemble in
streets and parking lots each morning to be picked up by employers
are an unsightly horde who litter, commit crimes and drive down
property values. At the same time, many Americans feel thankful
that the stream of immigrants has provided them with affordable
gardeners, nannies, housekeepers _ even manicurists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans rely very much on low-cost immigrant labor to
maintain their living standards, which means everything from lawn
care to inexpensive agricultural production to the construction
business,'' Papademetriou said.
</P>
<P>
   One unhappy result of the influx of immigrants is a wave of
violations of the nation's labor laws. Unscrupulous employers often
refuse to provide workers compensation to immigrants injured on the
job and frequently do not pay the minimum wage or time-and-half
overtime to immigrants required to work 70- and 80-hour weeks. Some
female immigrants complain that their bosses sexually harass them,
and they fear that if they protest, their bosses will report them
to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   One such immigrant, Silverio Otero, a grocery store worker on
New York's Lower East Side, complained that for a long time he was
paid $240 a week even though the storeowner required him to work 72
hours a week. That came to $3.33 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't treat us very nice,'' said Otero, a 29-year-old
native of Mexico who will receive $7,000 in back wages because of a
settlement arranged by Eliot Spitzer, the New York state attorney
general. ``They took advantage of us because we were immigrants and
they didn't think we would speak up.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from a coalition of industries that are pushing
Congress to grant several hundred thousand more temporary immigrant
worker visas each year said they are not looking for
easy-to-exploit workers, but simply for workers. Among the groups
pressing for such legislation are the National Restaurant
Association and the American Hotel and Motel Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it easier for employers who are facing
shortages to hire foreign workers,'' said John F. Gay, co-chairman
of the industry group, the Essential Worker Immigration Coalition.
``We've tried everything we could think of to bring more American
workers into the labor force, but with this booming economy it
hasn't been enough. It's not a question of finding cheaper bodies.
It's a question of finding bodies.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other powerful industries are making similar pleas. The
agricultural industry wants Congress to allow in more foreigners to
plant and pick produce. Computer and software companies have asked
that more three-year visas be granted each year to foreigners with
high-technology expertise. In 1998, Congress expanded that program
to allow in 115,000 workers, up from 65,000, and now the
high-technology industry wants that quota lifted to more than
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many labor groups, including the United Farm Workers and the
AFL-CIO, are fighting these proposals. The unions argue that
workers brought in under such programs drive down wages and
essentially are easy-to-exploit captives restricted to working for
one company.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, mindful of Silicon Valley's campaign
contributions and organized labor's political muscle, has signaled
that it favors increasing the number of high-technology visas, but
not those for unskilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high technology, we are now trying to meet a real spot
shortage,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. ``But when you talk
about jobs in the hotel industry and other areas, there's still a
lot of untapped employment potential in the nation, and I believe
that we can meet those demands with Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   This debate is influenced heavily by the way immigration creates
different winners and losers. American businesses, ranging from
motels and lettuce farms to corporate giants like Intel and Apple,
benefit from the influx of immigrants. But the National Academy of
Sciences study found that the flood of immigrants, especially
undocumented, unskilled workers from Mexico and the rest of Latin
America, has pushed down wages for native-born workers with less
than a high school education by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That study found that immigration increased the size of the
nation's economy by $10 billion _ a tiny amount in a country with a
gross domestic product of nearly $10 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real impact of immigration is not to increase the size of
the pie, but to redistribute the pie,'' said George J. Borjas, a
Harvard University professor of public policy. ``If you happen to
have the type of job that competes with immigrants, you're often
hurt, but if you're a company or an upper-middle-class person who
hires immigrants, then you benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Many economists say the large immigrant work force has played a
major role in making the American economy one of the most
competitive industrial nations in the world, helping keep wages
well below those of industrial countries like Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, one of the biggest changes involving immigrant
workers is the labor union's softening stance on illegal
immigrants. The AFL-CIO has called for repealing the law that bars
employers from hiring illegal immigrants _ a law organized labor
lobbied for in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   While still favoring strict limits on the number of immigrants
entering the country, the AFL-CIO has reversed itself by calling
for regularizing the status of hundreds of thousands of illegal
immigrants already in the country. Giving them legal status, union
officials said, would make it harder for employers to exploit them
and hold down their wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a recognition of how immigrants are being
discriminated against and of the indignities they suffer,'' said
John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO. ``We saw that the
present immigration policies weren't working and that it was time
to call for a fairer policy that treats these people in a more
humane way.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of this shift, many unions that once sought to keep
immigrants out of their fields now are eager to organize those
workers.

   RAMLE, Israel _ It was quite a send-off for a felonious
politician.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside a drab prison, on a huge stage erected for a
going-away party, the rabbis took their seats. In the crowd below,
acolytes of Aryeh Deri, the former leader of the Orthodox Shas
Party, danced rhapsodically as a religious rock group warmed up
with a few electric bars of last year's hit song, ``He's
Innocent.'' Thousands chanted ``Police state!'' under the impassive
surveillance of blue-uniformed Israeli police officers.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just the beginning of a three-hour rally that
culminated in Deri's solemn march from dais to prison. Accompanied
by a phalanx of officers, he clung to the rabbis' parting gift, a
velvet-covered Torah scroll to keep him company during his
three-year sentence for corruption. While the clanging prison door
seemed to seal his downfall, the crowd saw him elevated instead,
from charismatic politician to ``tzaddik,'' or righteous man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aryeh Deri is a symbol for all of us who were born in Morocco
and Iran and Iraq and Egypt,'' said Ayala Yosef, 37, a mother of
five. ``Today represents the apex of the persecution they inflicted
on him throughout his political career for standing up for us. But
it will backfire. Shas will only grow because they put him in
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   That is far from certain. Weakened by the loss of Deri's
charismatic leadership, by the taint of his conviction and by
internal conflicts, Shas has had a rocky year under the stewardship
of its new leader, Eli Yishai.
</P>
<P>
   Shas pulled out of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government
several months ago. Now, with Deri behind bars, Yishai and the
party's rabbis will try to figure out what lies ahead for them and
whether the party's fate is finally unbound from Deri's.
</P>
<P>
   After sequestering himself in religious studies for the last
year, Deri pronounced his own political career over. But he would
be eligible to run for Parliament after serving his term, and he
could even become a cabinet minister again in 10 years. He is only
41, and he has a passionate following.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came all the way from New York to see him off to prison,''
said Yoram Siman-tov, an Israeli immigrant who lives in Queens.
``And I will return again in a few years to welcome him out. I'm a
frequent flier.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 15 years, Deri built from scratch a political,
social and religious movement that blossomed into a linchpin
political party and Israel's third largest. Shas' leadership is
Orthodox, but its adherents include many traditional, but not
strictly religious, Jews of Middle Eastern descent who are drawn to
the party's second identity as an ethnic pride movement.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, as they developed a sizable religious school
system and social service program, Deri and his associates took
advantage of his position as a public servant, according to the
judges who convicted him last year of fraud and bribery. Deri
appealed the conviction and recently lost.
</P>
<P>
   The case brought ethnic, religious and class tensions to the
surface. Many secular Israelis saw Deri's behavior as a threat to
the rule of law by the leader of a party that answers to divine law
first.
</P>
<P>
   Many Shas supporters saw the legal system's behavior as an elite
crusade to bring down a powerful Moroccan-born Jew. On Sunday those
supporters contrasted Deri's conviction with the state's decision
not to prosecute Ezer Weizman, the former president, who accepted
substantial cash gifts from a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what color can do,'' said Sunday's posters, comparing
Weizman's supposed self-imposed punishment _ retirement to his
beach house in Caesarea _ with the jail term handed Deri. Sephardic
Jews here often refer to themselves as black and to members of the
Ashkenazic elite, like Weizman, as white.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's rally, Deri asked forgiveness from everyone whose
path he had crossed in the recent past and urged his followers to
``rechannel the pain they've caused us into continuing the Jewish
revolution.'' A leading rabbi, Reuven Elbaz, pronounced ``this day,
the third of Elul,'' according to the Jewish calendar, ``as the
very start of the revolution, Bastille Day for the Sephardic
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Deri faded from public life after the elections last spring, but
the tensions raised by his trial did not fade. They were worsened
by Shas' difficult relationship with Barak. After Shas resigned
from his government, the prime minister announced a ``civil
revolution'' to divest the religious parties and the authorities of
their entrenched power. On Sunday, his cabinet voted to dismantle
the Ministry of Religious Affairs, a longtime power base of the
religious parties and, until several months ago, of Shas.
</P>
<P>
   Those recent political developments fueled the
anti-establishment sentiment at Deri's goodbye party on Sunday.
Highlighting the increasingly bitter relationship between secular
Israelis and Shas, several motorized hang-gliders zoomed back and
forth over the rally with pointed messages: ``Cursed be the one who
takes the bribes,'' said one banner, citing a verse from the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the civil revolution of Ehud Barak,'' said Mordechai
Ohayon, 25, pointing skyward. ``He will create a government of the
secular elite that holds its cabinet meetings on Sheinkin Street in
Tel Aviv, with pork chops for all his ministers.'' Sheinkin Street
is considered the epicenter of secular Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Most mainstream Israeli newspapers denounced ``Prison Day'' for
furthering a cult of persecution and victimization around Deri.
``Felon, not martyr,'' said the editorial in The Jerusalem Post.
``It behooves the Sephardi party's leaders to understand that the
facile canonization of a criminal is, in essence, an insufferable
attack on the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood on Sunday was frantic and festive at the same time, as
thousands of Orthodox men and women _ segregated by sex _ prayed,
sang and dance under the broiling summer sun. Yeshiva students in
black frock coats and fedoras jangled fund-raising boxes in time
with the beat of the rock group's pounding bass.

EARTHQUAKE IN CALIFORNIA'S WINE COUNTRY REVEALS NEW FAULT LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 rattled
Northern California's wine country early Sunday morning, taking
place along a previously undiscovered fault line and catching
seismologists by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter of the earthquake was three miles southwest of
Yountville, Calif., under Mount Veeders, the most prominent peak in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not put it on any known fault, making it a totally
new event,'' said Pat Jorgenson, a spokeswoman for the U.S.
Geological Survey in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual because with all today's technology we really
feel we have most of the faults located,'' Jorgenson said. ``But
then something like this happens and we go, `Oops, I'll be
darned.'''
</P>
<P>
   The agency will analyze the fault line, add it to maps and
eventually name it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake occurred at 1:36 a.m. PDT and lasted 18 seconds.
Two aftershocks, of magnitude 1.5 and 1.8 were reported later on
Sunday. A magnitude 5 earthquake is felt by everyone in the
immediate area, moves heavy furniture and can slightly damage some
buildings, according to the Geological Survey. An earthquake of
magnitude 6 can cause severe damage.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen minor injuries were attributed to Sunday's
earthquake, and at least three people suffered more serious
injuries when they fell or were hit by falling objects.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 residents lost power and 500 lost gas service,
according to Pacific Gas and Electric, which expected all service
to be restored by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While most restaurants and wineries seem to have been spared
major damage, Bistro Don Giovanni in Napa, about six miles from
Yountville, lost about 60 percent of its wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in our bar came down, everything in our wine room
came down, everything in our kitchen all came crashing down,'' said
Bettina Rouas, the restaurant's general manager. ``The walls in the
office are all cracked. We were hit directly, very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Many residents who had experienced earthquakes described Sunday
morning's episode as a sudden, violent shock, compared with the
fluid rolling action they had felt in other quakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it was a big one,'' said Mimi Ramirez, a 27-year-old
cashier at a 7-11, who was sleeping when the earthquake hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I opened my eyes, it was like a shock, like thunder
storming, you know. And I felt like the ground was opening,''
Ramirez said. ``It sounded, felt like construction, those big
machines or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the ground shook most severely near Napa, lighter
tremors were felt from San Francisco to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I heard it and thought someone was trying to
open our garage,'' said Arnita Leneir, 34, of Sacramento. ``Then
after a while we both just kind of sat up in bed and said, `Oh my
God, that was an earthquake.'''
</P>
<P>
   Earthquake or no earthquake, the crowds flocking to wine country
this holiday weekend for its culinary and scenic diversions were
not changing their plans much.
</P>
<P>
   Crowded as ever, the Napa Valley wine train chugged out for its
three-hour gourmet run around the region on schedule. And hot air
balloons floating over the vineyards touched down right on time for
the accustomed champagne brunch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been absolutely no disruption for our tourists,''
said Dave Means, a volunteer at the Napa Valley Conference and
Visitors Center.

<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Ousted Prime Minister Rafik Hariri dealt a
crushing electoral blow to Lebanon's Syrian-appointed government in
the final round of parliamentary voting on Sunday, early results
showed, sweeping all of Beirut's seats and gaining a powerful
majority of backers in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In a modern, extravagantly financed campaign the likes of which
this traditionally clan-dominated city has never seen, thousands of
the swashbuckling multibillionaire's supporters swarmed the
streets, showering every passing car with palm cards listing his
ticket. Twelve hours of criss-crossing the city turned up only four
workers in orange T-shirts distributing cards for his Sunni Moslem
rival, Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
   Official vote results are to be announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighteen of eighteen.'' Salim Diab, Hariri's campaign manager,
said an hour after the polls closed, slumping back tired but proud
in his operations room as supporters danced and cheered outside.
</P>
<P>
   Diab said Hariri's operation had 8,000 workers on the streets of
Beirut on Sunday, along with roughly 3,000 cars and taxicabs to
ferry voters to the polls. There were even ambulances to take the
ill.
</P>
<P>
   While the voting, in one of the bitterest campaigns ever here,
will not eliminate Syria's hold on Lebanon, it appears to have
drastically altered the political status quo.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Hariri defeated the two men handpicked as Lebanon's
leaders two years ago by Bashar Assad, the untried 34-year old heir
to Syrian power, during his internship here in preparation for
assuming the mantle of his father, Hafez Assad, who had run both
countries with wily, ruthless skill.
</P>
<P>
   President Emile Lahoud, the Maronite Catholic former military
commander that the young Assad chose in 1998, detests Hariri and
mounted a strong campaign with all the government's resources
against him, including hours of denunciation on the state run
television station.
</P>
<P>
   And the sitting prime minister, Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem
political fixture for decades, lost his seat in parliament despite
efforts by Syria to gerrymander Beirut into three electoral
districts and guarantee his victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hoss, an academic, is widely regarded as a decent and honest
man, unusually immune to corruption. But he is also viewed as
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   In what many analysts see as the most significant aspect of the
upset, both Hoss and Salam, according to the early results, were
swept away in the landslide.
</P>
<P>
   For many, it is a stunning political turnaround. Only a month
and a half ago, political pundits here were writing that Lahoud was
hoping for a two-thirds majority in parliament so that the
constitution could be amended to extend his six-year term, which
expires in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with the battering the government took in last week's
round of elections _ with 41 of 63 seats going to the opposition _
and Sunday's voting for the 128 seat body, Lahoud is faced with the
prospect of either accepting, or trying to find a way around,
naming his sworn enemy, Hariri, as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 18 seats Hariri appeared to have won in
Beirut _ along with the remaining 19th seat he gained in a backroom
deal with the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah on Friday _ the former prime
minister is expected to be supported by 23 winning candidates on
the joint Amal-Hezbollah ticket in southern Lebanon and at least a
dozen more from the Bekaa region in Sunday's voting.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 Taif agreement that helped end the bloody 15 year civil
war says the president is to appoint the prime minister with
support from a simple majority of parliament. And the removal of
Hoss and Salam from the political scene puts Lahoud and the Syrians
in a further bind. Under the unwritten National Accord here the
prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim and the alternative pool of
prominent candidates is now sharply reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1998, Hariri, as prime minister, built a series
of showy projects, including a rebuilding of the graceful old city
center that had been a ruined battleground called the Green Line
during the civil war. But Lahoud, who in his inaugural address
denounced all Lebanese politicians as a class, accused him of
corruption and driving the country into overwhelming debt.

DESPITE LOW PROFILE, STEINBRENNER HAS NOT CHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The full-page front-page picture and blaring tabloid
headline instantly took one reader back more than 20 years, back to
a Saturday afternoon at Yankee Stadium when a George Steinbrenner
minion tapped him on the shoulder in the press box and said:
``George is in his office. Why don't you go see him?''
</P>
<P>
   The rare invitation for an audience with the Yankees' principal
owner came 21 years to the day before his verbal anti-personnel
bomb landed on Jeff Nelson, Mike Stanton and Chuck Knoblauch. In
the earlier instance, Ken Clay was the target of Steinbrenner's
contrived wrath.
</P>
<P>
   As on that occasion, a Steinbrenner henchman facilitated this
one by reaching out to a reporter and suggesting that he call the
owner in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The tap on the shoulder 21 years earlier came after Clay, a
struggling young pitcher, squandered a 5-0 lead his teammates gave
him in the first inning. He let Kansas City score a run in the
second inning and three runs in the third. Clay did not survive the
third inning of a game the Royals would win, 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, uncertain what to expect, walked into
Steinbrenner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask me about Ken Clay,'' Steinbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about Ken Clay?'' the reporter asked against his better
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner proceeded to tell the reporter what about Clay:
``In horse racing we have what we call a morning glory. The horse
works a great 3 or 4 furlongs in the morning workout and looks
sensational. Then when the race comes, he starts sweating during
the parade to the post and when he gets in the gate and the race
starts, he stinks the place out. He spits the bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny Clay is a morning glory. He spits the bit. He doesn't
have the courage. That may be harsh, but that's the way I feel. He
goes one good outing and three putrid ones. This was putrid. He
looks great in the bullpen, but he gets on the mound and chokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was scared stiff out there. He's one of the biggest
disappointments I've had since I've had the Yankees. He gets five
runs, goes out and spits the bit, chokes. Word is around he doesn't
have the guts. Give the guy the benefit of the doubt and he goes
out and chokes like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Steinbrenner has adopted a low-key public profile in
recent seasons, some people think he has mellowed. He would
probably feel insulted if someone said that to his face, but he
doesn't have to worry that his tough-boss image is fading. He
hasn't changed one bit. The Yankees just haven't given him many
chances to pull out the old George.
</P>
<P>
   What can even Steinbrenner find to fault with a team that wins
114 games in a season, that loses only three postseason games in
two years, that wins three World Series in four years, that wins 12
consecutive World Series games?
</P>
<P>
   How many fat toads come along to rouse his public ire?
</P>
<P>
   But this season the Yankees, for the most part, have not been
their dominating selves. They have never been in danger of falling
short of the postseason, but they weren't moving toward it with
their late 1990s intimidation. They weren't burying Boston and
Toronto in the standings. They weren't implementing the
scorched-earth style that Steinbrenner demands.
</P>
<P>
   And then their pre-Rivera relief tandem of Nelson and Stanton
began giving up game-altering home runs and assorted other hits and
walks. Knoblauch, already having frustrated the owner along with
everyone else with a mysterious throwing problem, languished on the
disabled list with a mysterious elbow ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the window of Steinbrenner's opportunity was open, and
he leaped through it, mouth first. His timing, however, was weird.
</P>
<P>
   Despite suffering whatever problems the owner perceived as
undermining the immediate future of the most expensive team in
baseball history, the Yankees have been winning with regularity.
Seventeen victories in the 25 games before Sunday represented their
best 25-game stretch since the first month of the season. Their
six-game lead over the Red Sox was their largest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But as if to fuel Steinbrenner's worst fears, the Yankees
suffered an improbable loss Sunday, 2-1 in 10 innings to the
Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees with their $100 million-plus payroll and Roger
Clemens, a five-time Cy Young award winner, against the team with
the major leagues' lowest payroll ($14,887,500) and a rookie
pitcher making his third major-league start. Ten players in the
Twins' starting lineup earning a collective $5,252,500 against 10
players in the Yankees' lineup with salaries totaling $58,507,143,
with half the Yankees' starters each earning more than the entire
Twins' lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biggest number in Vegas,'' Tom Kelly, the Minnesota manager,
said of the betting odds on the game. ``You look at that number and
you go, `Oh my.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Matt Kinney, the 23-year-old rookie, stifled the Yankees on
one run and two hits in six innings. Three relievers kept the
Yankees stifled the rest of the way. A couple more games like this
one, and the owner will be storming through the press box, telling
reporters to ask him about Bernie Williams and David Justice and
Glenallen Hill.

BUCCANEERS DOMINATE PATRIOTS WITH RELENTLESS PRESSURE ON BLEDSOE 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ The game's first play and its last one caused
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to shiver.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every play in-between, though, shook the New England
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The first play: Tampa Bay fumbled the game's opening kickoff at
its own 28-yard line and that led to a Patriots' field goal. The
final play: With one second remaining in the game, with New England
at the Tampa Bay 22 with a chance to win, the Patriots' final fling
from Drew Bledsoe, under siege, fell harmlessly out of the end zone
without a Patriot close to making the winning catch.
</P>
<P>
   So Tampa Bay won this lopsided scramble, 21-16. New England
scored its field goal after the game's opening turnover, scored on
a Troy Brown 66-yard punt return in the second quarter and scored
on a 39-yard pass play with 3 minutes 1 second left. Other than
that, it was complete domination by the Tampa Bay defensive line
versus the New England offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   It was a decisive and ugly domination.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was hit so many times his head is probably still
ringing. On most Patriots' snaps, he would barely gather the ball
from center before some young Buc was in his face _ tackle Warren
Sapp or end Marcus Jones or linebacker Shelton Quarles or the
blitzing cornerback Ronde Barber among others. Bledsoe was sacked
six times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, I'm beat up,'' Bledsoe said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, he looked beat up, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking to him all day, telling him it was going to be
a long day,'' said Bucs end Chidi Ahanotu. ``He said, `Yeah, yeah,
you're right, it's a long day.' When you can pin your ears back and
let it fly, well, you like games like that when you can just hound
the quarterback. They tried a version of the no-huddle to counter
us and they seemed more uncomfortable with it than we did. The
one-on-one matchups were good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapp, the all-pro, said he read in a newspaper before the game
that he had been ``handled'' during the preseason. Sapp was hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, that upset me so much, I couldn't eat breakfast,''
Sapp said. ``I was sick to my stomach. But we came out and showed
what we do. We get after the quarterback and get him, and that's
the ultimate prize. We're a team unit _ somebody strikes a match
and then everybody pours gas on it.''
</P>
<P>
   And New England's offense was singed.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were a pitiful 4 of 17 (24 percent) in third-down
conversions. They gained more yards on kickoff and punt returns
(118) than they did rushing (88). Bledsoe was 26 of 39 for 216
yards with those six sacks, a touchdown pass to receiver Terry
Glenn and no interceptions. Even on his touchdown _ a heave, a lob
into the end zone just as he was crushed once again by the Tampa
Bay defense _ Bledsoe barely stood upright long enough to get it
off.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively immobile quarterback and a leaky offensive line
against a fierce pass rush and menacing defense.
</P>
<P>
   A wicked combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some trouble on pass protection,'' said Patriots Coach
Bill Belichick, who lost in his first regular-season game as the
team's head coach. ``They mixed it up some but kept us off balance.
They did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Tampa Bay offense did just enough, scoring 14
second-quarter points to lead by 14-10 at halftime. Fullback Mike
Alstott scored on a 5-yard run and receiver Reidel Anthony scored
on an 8-yard pass from quarterback Shaun King. On that play, King
acted like he was going to spike the ball but threw it into the end
zone instead, a fake-spike-play like the one the former Miami
quarterback Dan Marino performed a few seasons ago against the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Buccaneers scored the only points of the third quarter
when Alstott started inside and then bounced outside for a 3-yard
run. That play made it 21-10 with 3:09 left in the quarter. The
score was set up by a forced fumble _ Bucs linebacker Derrick
Brooks on Patriots running back Kevin Faulk _ at the New England
24. The ball was recovered by safety John Lynch. It looked like
Tampa Bay would cruise from there, but Bledsoe to Glenn gave New
England a chance and the last play of the game could have turned
the whole affair upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay defense would not let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the right spot,'' Brooks, who made a game-high 15
tackles, said of his forced fumble on Faulk. ``I wanted to be
physical and finish my tackles because I had seen that some of
their backs have a tendency to put the ball on the ground.
Fortunately, we got it.''
</P>
<P>
   King said: ``If our defense can dominate like that we will be
something.''
</P>
<P>
   King (12 of 24, 167 passing yards, 1 touchdown and no
interceptions) made big plays, too, especially by converting on
seven third-down passing plays. He completed four passes to
Keyshawn Johnson for 64 yards, and Johnson opened passing lanes for
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we were supposed to do,'' Johnson said, ``and we
came out and won.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dungy, Tampa Bay's coach, said: ``Those third-down plays
Shaun made were plays we weren't making throughout last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Bucs have more team balance, but make no mistake, its
defense rules.
</P>
<P>
   `` I know we're going to improve,'' Ahantou said. ``But I don't
think we've ever been this far along as a defense at this point in
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   That's enough to shake up the rest of the league.

YUGOSLAV CANDIDATE SEEN AS STRONGEST CHALLENGE YET TO MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Vojislav Kostunica, a constitutional
lawyer, was fired from the Belgrade University law faculty in 1974
for defending a senior professor jailed for criticizing the
government. In 1989, when Serbia's leader, Slobodan Milosevic,
tried to co-opt intellectuals and was offering to rehire those who
had been fired, only Kostunica refused.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kostunica, a moderate nationalist, anti-Communist and
democrat, is trying to take Milosevic's job as Yugoslav president
in elections later this month. He is the most serious opposition
candidate ever to challenge Milosevic, and polls suggest that
Kostunica, 56, ought to be able to win.
</P>
<P>
   It is an election being closely watched by Washington and NATO,
which bombed Yugoslavia for 78 days last year over Kosovo and have
labored since to push Milosevic out of office.
</P>
<P>
   For Milosevic, who has been indicted for war crimes, this
election has turned into a battle for political survival. He called
it nine months early to shore up his international legitimacy, but
now he may be forced to steal votes massively in order to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, it's a matter of life and death for him,''
Kostunica said in a long interview here. ``It's why I hesitated in
the beginning. I thought Milosevic must have considered everything
very carefully, but I overestimated the rational in his decision.
Now I think he miscalculated, and I'm sure he did not expect my
candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, who describes himself as a generally pessimistic man,
now senses ``a feeling of victory in the air.'' He said: ``This is
the moment _ people can't keep living, or surviving, like this.
Individuals come up to me and say, `Save us,' and they are sincere.
And they say, `I'm hungry.' People know that if Milosevic stays in
power they will go on living like this. It's an important feeling.
But it frightens me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``It's frightening because the stakes are so high for
him,'' Kostunica said slowly. ``Milosevic will do everything he can
to win in the first round,'' even if it risks popular anger over
possible vote stealing, sets off a new round of opposition
demonstrations and undermines the renewed democratic legitimacy he
seeks.
</P>
<P>
   With four main candidates, if no one wins over 50 percent of the
votes on Sept. 24, there would be a second-round runoff between the
two top finishers on Oct. 8. In a free and fair, head-to-head race
with Milosevic, all the polls show, Kostunica (pronounced
kosh-TOON-itza) is almost sure to win.
</P>
<P>
   But Kostunica is not convinced that Milosevic will allow himself
to be beaten or has any intention of handing over power peacefully.
He expects widespread vote stealing and even raises the possibility
that Milosevic will postpone these elections by creating some
military ``emergency,'' Kostunica believes.
</P>
<P>
   This skepticism about the election results _ no matter the vote
_ is widespread, and is among the opposition's greatest problems.
While some 35 percent of voters in the polls back Kostunica
compared to some 25 percent for Milosevic, about 16 percent back
other candidates and 24 percent say they will not vote or are
undecided. But more than 45 percent say they expect Milosevic will
remain in power after the elections in any case.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fatalistic about the way they see these
elections,'' Kostunica concedes. ``Our biggest challenge is to
convince people that their vote, which does not require too much
investment from them, can change Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, on the other hand, with state television and a
disciplined party behind him, will try to keep turnout low, while
seeking to win with high and uncheckable vote totals from Kosovo
itself, refugees from Kosovo in southern Serbia, the army and the
police, Kostunica said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's campaign is concentrating on his defense of the
Serbs against the united might and perceived injustice of the West,
his administrative competence, his work to rebuild the country
after the bombing and his promises of stability and development.
His slogan is ``Under the flag of freedom, for Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a Milosevic defeat would not suddenly change Yugoslavia,
Kostunica cautions. With Montenegro's government boycotting the
election, Milosevic's coalition should retain control over the
federal Parliament, as it continues to run Serbia, the larger of
Yugoslavia's remaining two republics since the country all but
disintegrated in the 1990s. And with the opposition still divided
on the local level, despite American pressure to unite, the ruling
parties could win back some cities they lost in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the moment when the first step will be made,''
Kostunica said. ``What's problematic is that the first step is the
presidential elections, where Milosevic is running, and so where
it's the easiest, it's also the hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Yugoslavs, Kostunica's virtues are many: a reputation
for modesty, honesty and principle; a belief in democracy and the
rule of law; a career untainted by any previous cooperation with
the Milosevic regime; a clear patriotism and sense of nationhood;
and a nuanced but sharply critical stance toward the United States
and the Western countries that bombed Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   His main campaign poster plays on his incorruptibility, saying:
``Who can look you straight in the eyes? Kostunica.'' It is a quiet
commentary on the accusations often made against other opposition
leaders like Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement and
Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party, who are seen as having been
tarnished by their past associations either with Milosevic or the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica's patriotism, his criticism of the war-crimes tribunal
in The Hague, Netherlands, as a political instrument, his support
for Serbs in Kosovo and his skepticism toward the West made him a
good choice for a democratic opposition accused over and over again
by Milosevic of being traitors in the pay of Washington and the
NATO countries that bombed Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy for the regime and state television to attack
Djindjic and Draskovic, who was filmed kissing the hand of
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, for being Western lackeys.
But it can accuse Kostunica only of being allied with them _ of
shaking the hand of the man who kissed the hand of Albright.

<P>
   As the federal information minister, Goran Matic, said: ``The
West picked Kostunica because he could look like a genuine Serbian
candidate. But he is the candidate of Madeleine Albright, and
Milosevic is the candidate of the people of Yugoslavia, and they
will vote for the man who defended them.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few personal attacks. The Radical Party
leader, Vojislav Seselj, has insinuated that Kostunica is somehow
unmanly because, although married, he has no children and is very
fond of his two cats. ``I think it's just silly,'' Kostunica said.
``A friend told me that when he heard the story about the cats he
realized they couldn't find anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   State-controlled media have also made contradictory charges that
Kostunica, who was once pictured with an assault rifle in Kosovo,
is too nationalist, but that he also intends to break up Serbia,
since he is supported by Muslim parties in Sandzak and opposition
parties in Vojvodina that seek greater autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   In the interests of unity, Djindjic and other opposition leaders
threw their support to Kostunica; only Draskovic refused to join
the united opposition, naming his own presidential candidate, the
Belgrade mayor, Vojislav Mihailovic, whose presence in the race
will make it nearly impossible for Kostunica to win in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a rally Friday night kicking off his campaign, Kostunica
vowed to defend Yugoslavia and bring it back into Europe; promised
generosity and no revenge toward the regime and its servants; and
pledged his ``word of honor'' to ``try to change this state of ours
for the better in accordance with God's and human laws, and to
never let power change me.''
</P>
<P>
   A rather shy and reserved man, he seemed almost overwhelmed by
the response to his words.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, despite his criticism of Western arrogance and
hypocrisy now, is a believer in democracy and the rule of law. He
translated the Federalist Papers into Serbo-Croatian in 1981, and
was a member of a committee to defend freedom of speech in the
early 1980s, when the post-Tito regime cracked down on advocates of
nationalism ranging from Franjo Tudjman in Croatia and Seselj in
Serbia to Alija Izetbegovic in Bosnia and Adem Demaci in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He helped found the Democratic Party in 1989, when, as he said,
``I lived in that democratic air. But my picture of the West was
rather idealistic. I haven't changed my values or pro-Western
attitudes despite my criticism of the United States during the war;
I see it as defending the West from itself, insisting on original
democratic and liberal values.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he thinks there must be a counterbalance to
American power, that the tribunal in The Hague is an instrument of
American political goals rather than a model of legal justice, and
that Washington too often insists on supporting politicians, like
Biljana Plavsic and Milorad Dodik in Bosnia, who do not have
realistic support in the larger population. He thinks Washington
has helped Milosevic remain in power first by supporting him and
then by attacking him and punishing all Serbs with bombs and
sanctions, making the country hostages in ``a private war.''
</P>
<P>
   Tactically, of course, it is also important for Kostunica to
keep his distance from Western verbal and financial support for the
opposition here and for his own candidacy. He has set up his own
campaign structure, separate from the alliance operation Djindjic
runs, to protect himself from too much Western taint. And Kostunica
has criticized the Americans for setting up a Belgrade embassy in
exile in Budapest, Hungary, to assist Serbia's democrats, saying
that such a goal is a ``kiss of death for all truly democratic and
patriotic forces in Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says, he wants Yugoslavia to rejoin Europe and the
West, ``and I'm prepared to take steps to ensure it.'' Handing over
Milosevic to The Hague, however, would not be a priority, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in this country is in need of some stability and
peace,'' Kostunica said. ``That's my message to the state
apparatus, the army and the police, who need it, too. They also
don't see a clear future if nothing changes here, and many of them
are also tired of all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica finds it hopeful that ``someone who has never been
part of the Communist nomenklatura appears to have a chance'' to
take the country into a different future. ``I sometimes have a
vague, irrational feeling that if it happens, it would be a form of
justice,'' he said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a validation of the beliefs that our families had
for the last 50 years, and it would be some sort of God's
justice.''

U.S. MUST DECIDE ON U.N. COMMITMENT, U.S. AMBASSADOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With President Clinton preparing to visit New York this week for
a meeting of world leaders at the United Nations, the American
ambassador, Richard Holbrooke, said on Saturday that the United
States must focus more on its relations with the organization,
which he called ``indispensable'' to American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``American dollars spent on the United Nations are worthwhile,''
Holbrooke said in an interview. ``We need to fix it and save it,
rather than walk away from it or weaken it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton will open a three-day series of speeches
and round-table discussions by more than 150 heads of government,
many of whom will also be talking privately with each other in
dozens of specially constructed conference nooks, partitioned from
delegate lounges, or in diplomatic missions around New York.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who is completing a year as ambassador to the United
Nations, has found much of his time consumed in lobbying his
administration colleagues on international issues and in carrying
out demands made by Congress. A group of congressmen who have often
been hostile to the United Nations have established multiple
hurdles to full American participation, blocking payment of past
dues and some new assessments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. will have to have a more profound discussion on how
the U.N. fits into its security objectives,'' Holbrooke said.
``With all its flaws, the U.N. is an indispensable organization for
American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's potential foreign policy role in a new Democratic
administration _ if Vice President Al Gore wins the presidency in
November _ is the focus of unending speculation among other
diplomats. But he said he intended to ``work straight through until
Jan. 20'' no matter what the outcome of the election. His arrival
here was delayed a year by congressional blocks and federal ethics
investigations, largely into his contacts with American embassies
after he left a federal post. After serving as U.S. Ambassador to
Germany from 1993-1994, Holbrooke was appointed by Clinton as
assistant secretary of state, but left that post to become vice
chairman at the investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston from
1996 to 1999, during which time he was concurrently appointed by
Clinton as special presidential envoy on missions to Cyprus, Bosnia
and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said that he did not disagree that reform is still
needed in the United Nations and that, in his dealings with the
organization's international civil servants, he had been ``dismayed
at the bureaucratic behavior and obstructionism.''
</P>
<P>
   He has strongly supported strengthening the U.N. peacekeeping
department and initiatives by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
reform other areas of U.N. administration. Holbrooke's next target,
he said, is the U.N. department of public information, which he
contends is overstaffed and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   But while Holbrooke has been vocal in criticizing U.N.
shortcomings, especially when members of Congress are visiting,
there is no doubt that his job has been made more difficult by
congressional restrictions imposed in the name of reform, other
diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke and Donald Hays, another ambassador who is a budget
and management expert assigned full time to the U.S. mission to the
United Nations, have spent many hours fighting to get American dues
to the organization reduced: down to 22 percent of the regular U.N.
budget from the 25 percent; and peacekeeping dues down to 25
percent of from just more than 30 percent. Congress has demanded
the reduction, but other member nations regard any reduction as a
violation of international treaty obligations.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from certain the U.S. mission will succeed, most other
diplomats say, since 188 other nations will have to agree.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. delegation has also had to expend much diplomatic
capital this year to get the United States back on an important
U.N. budget committee, where it had lost its seat because of other
nations' anger at the U.S. failure to pay its dues.
</P>
<P>
   When any peacekeeping operation is planned, Holbrooke must hold
up a final decision by the Security Council for 15 days to notify
Congress and give members the right to object. At the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, a spokesman said that this was a
pledge made voluntarily by the Clinton administration, not a
congressional rule, and that it reflected the administration's
unwillingness to fight on Capitol Hill over issues involving the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has criticized the administration for asking Congress
for too little money in peacekeeping budget assessments. When money
is withheld, as it has been recently for missions in Africa, the
United Nations has to scramble to pay for adequate field
operations. Other Security Council members now say that they have
to take U.S. congressional notification into account even in times
of crisis, and that slows down the organization's response.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.N. officials and diplomats, including some from friendly
European nations, also say that Holbrooke has often been more eager
to act quickly in times of crisis than officials in Washington.
Last September, as violence in East Timor was raging on the day
Holbrooke arrived at the United Nations, both the Security Council
and the Clinton administration were slow to react. That left Annan
a lone voice of warning to Indonesia about the violence that
accompanied East Timor's vote to become independent.
</P>
<P>
   In May, when a botched peacekeeping operation in Sierra Leone
resulted in the capture of 500 peacekeepers by rebels, the
administration was again silent, refusing help to Annan. Diplomats
say that Holbrooke was known to have wanted some show of American
power, and perhaps logistical support for the United Nations, short
of the use of American troops. He is known to be impatient with the
work of some special envoys dispatched to trouble spots by the
White House.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite uneven patches, however, Holbrooke said in the interview
that he was convinced that relations between the United Nations and
the United States were better after visits to the organization by
Gore, several cabinet members and about 80 members of Congress.
Holbrooke organized a visit to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee for the whole Security Council, an unheard of gesture for
both sides. Council members said they went _ a few reluctantly _ in
the hope that it would ease the gridlock with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been enormously impressed by the amount of good will
the member states have for the United States, and the desire for a
high degree of U.S. engagement,'' Holbrooke said, adding that the
United States should reciprocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, the United States will have to decide how
important this organization is, with all its flaws. The U.S. is
stronger now in the U.N., and the U.N. is stronger in the U.S. _
but we still have a way to go.''

BASKETBALL COLUMN: IVERSON HAUNTS BROWN, EVEN ACROSS THE PACIFIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ Larry Brown was reminiscing recently about a much
simpler time in international competition, when an Olympic
basketball player for the United States had no one to carry his
bags during training camp in Hawaii, when you could not order
coconut shrimp as an appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in '64 had ever been to Hawaii that I know of,'' said
Brown, an assistant coach with the 2000 team and in 1964 a point
guard for Hank Iba's Olympic team that played in Tokyo, which also
featured Bill Bradley, Walt Hazzard and Jim Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like we got bags, jackets, shirts and shoes like
this group,'' he added. ``In '64, they hit us with a lei, put us on
a military bus and drove us to Pearl Harbor. We stayed in the
enlisted men's quarters, which was one big room. We ate in the
military mess hall, cafeteria-style.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has always been skilled at delivering in-my-day rants,
going on about the hardships and realities of old-school players.
But he is especially good on this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``To wake us up, they came in with a garbage can and a shovel
and banged on it,'' Brown said. ``That was our alarm clock. We got
on a bus to the Marine base, where we practiced on an open court.
The top was covered, but the sides were open. We had two-a-day
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Iba didn't have a curfew, but there was no way we were
going. We were too tired. Besides, they had one of those
military-police guys with a gun if you wanted to leave. We were
there for 31 straight days. We had a half a day off where we were
allowed to go to the other side of the island if we wanted to swim
or surf. A half-day in 31 days. That was my Hawaiian experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Allen and Allan Houston overheard Brown and shook their
heads in disbelief. They and 10 teammates stayed at a five-star
Maui hotel for more than a week. If they wanted, butlers drew
orchid baths for them for $50. The pool bar had some concoction
called a Lava Flow that was more dessert than drink.
</P>
<P>
   These are not college kids who have never been abroad. They are
multimillionaire basketball players, living large in paradise. They
work hard, they play hard. It is the only way Olympic officials
could get National Basketball Association All-Stars to come.
Private charters, bell men and concierges are all they have known
since they turned pro.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson would like it here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have loved for him to be here,'' Brown said of
Iverson, the Philadelphia 76ers point guard with whom he seems to
be locked in an eternal power struggle. ``Allen needs something
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the old-school coach and the Slam magazine point
guard trying to coexist is already collecting dust. Iverson takes a
day off, Brown blows up, trade rumors swirl and, usually in less
than a week, they make up and promise to do right by each other.
Just as Brown's patience has reached its threshold, the education
of Iverson continues. For better or worse _ or until a megadeal
does them part _ this is the dance they do.
</P>
<P>
   But even across the Pacific Ocean, you can see the worry in
Brown's eyes. After all the skipped practices and insurrections, he
does not want to see Iverson, one of the most talented players in
the world, waste his gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking him to do anything that any other coach
wouldn't ask a player to do,'' said Brown, who said he had not
spoken to Iverson over the summer. ``What he said to other players
and our management is that he wants to do all those things. It's a
nonissue if he does. If he doesn't, there's no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   No hope?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's irreconcilable if he doesn't show up to practice,'' Brown
said. ``I'll lose my whole team. You ask any one of our players.
Anybody that works for you, if they're constantly late, or they
don't show up or they don't want to work. If he does the right
things, we got no problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never criticized his game or his heart. But he tells me
he wants to be the leader, the captain and a great player. And my
response to him is: `You've got control over all that. Not me.' If
any player on any team did the things that have happened in the
past with him, you got no chance. I'm hopeful that's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown will attend his team's NBA training camp the day after he
returns from the Games in Sydney, Australia, just as many of the
Olympians will. Unless a trade is swung before then, Brown will
meet up with Iverson there. He will try not to sound like the
father who tells his son how many miles he had to walk to school in
the snow.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a pivotal juncture in the career of Allen Iverson. A
bit of history may be what the future needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt his hope would be around Patrick or Alonzo or
Karl Malone,'' Brown said, citing Patrick Ewing and Alonzo
Mourning. ``It's about pitting him with a guy that has so much
respect for the game and has accomplished so much and is so
professional. He needs to see that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys are professional and I have as many warriors on my
team as anybody in the league _ respect the game, respect your
teammates _ but they don't have the reputation or the credentials
that Zo, Malone or Patrick would have. To have them to say
something to him or to show him the right way is really meaningful.
I feel bad he hasn't been exposed to that.''

   ``It's unbelievable coming to work here every day and being a
part of something like this,'' Edmonds said.
</P>
<P>
   For the third game in a row, the Cardinals beat the Mets Sunday
on the final pitch of the game for a sweep of the three-game
series. Two of the game-winners were home runs by Edmonds, who
smashed a high fastball from Rick White into the right-field
bullpen to give St. Louis a 4-3 victory in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were elated, bouncing in unison as they swarmed
Edmonds at home plate. The Mets, who managed only five hits and are
slumbering as an offense, were frustrated _ and nobody more so than
White.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Edmonds to hit them both is even worse,'' White said.
``He's more of an `I'm-the-hero' guy instead of just, `We won.' He
likes to appease himself more than his team.'' That, White added,
is what angers him most.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds was dogged by that reputation before joining the
Cardinals in a trade from Anaheim this spring. It is a label he
said is unfair, a creation of the media, and he did not take
White's criticism seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty unfortunate that a guy who doesn't have any idea
who I am or anything about me would say something that silly,''
Edmonds said.
</P>
<P>
   White had not gotten over the home run after the game and said
he will think about it until he meets up with his family on Monday
in Cincinnati, where the Mets play the Reds. Another reunion should
lift the Mets' spirits: John Franco, out with a sore left pectoral
muscle, could be available on Monday after an encouraging bullpen
session Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets need Franco, who probably would have been pitching in
the ninth inning Friday, when Pat Mahomes gave up the game-winner
to Edmonds. The Mets could have used Franco Sunday in the eighth
inning, when Turk Wendell and Dennis Cook failed to protect a 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scratched one run off Rick Ankiel Sunday and got seven
shutout innings from Glendon Rusch, who tired in the 98-degree
heat. But Wendell allowed a leadoff walk and a single in the
eighth, and Cook came in to face a pinch-hitter, Placido Polanco.
</P>
<P>
   Franco has not allowed an earned run since June 21, but Cook has
been erratic. His third pitch to Polanco was a hanging slider, and
Polanco ripped it into the left-field bullpen for a three-run homer
that gave the Cardinals a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My slider's definitely a feel pitch,'' Cook said. ``I had a
real good one the other day. Today, I threw some good ones. The one
he hit wasn't real good at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The ineffectiveness of Wendell and Cook wasted what might have
been Rusch's best effort of the year. Rusch kept the Cardinals
off-balance with his change-up, allowing only four singles over
seven innings. No Cardinals got past first base as Rusch struck out
seven and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   But as usual, Rusch was given meager run support. Rusch has the
lowest run support of any pitcher in the majors, with just 3.54
runs per nine innings. Scoring has been especially difficult for
the Mets recently. The Mets have batted .198 since pounding Randy
Johnson and the Arizona Diamondbacks on Aug. 25, scoring 18 runs in
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through it before,'' said catcher Mike Piazza.
``Everybody wants to be the one guy that gets us over the hump.
Bubba had a great day today. Unfortunately, no one else could help
him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Bubba Trammell, making his first start since Aug.
15, was 2 for 4 and knocked in all three Mets runs. With two outs
in the ninth, belted a two-run, game-tying homer off Dave Veres, a
right-hander. Manager Bobby Valentine had left-handed options on
the bench, but he stuck with the right-handed Trammell, a power
hitter, and Trammell delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one time that you think about hitting a home run,
that'd be it,'' Trammell said. ``I was trying to drive the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Trammell's other hit Sunday was the Mets' first off Ankiel, a
rookie left-hander they had never faced before. Ankiel overpowered
them with a mid-90s fastball and a curveball tumbling in 20 miles
per hour slower, working three perfect innings to start the game
and getting six strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Ankiel and Darryl Kile had pitched the equivalent
of a perfect game over two days; Kile retired the last 18 Mets to
bat on Saturday, and Ankiel the first nine Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But after walking two in the fourth, Ankiel walked Jay Payton
with two outs in the fifth. He had Payton picked off first, but
Payton eluded the tag of second baseman Fernando Vina and slid
safely into second. That put Payton in position when Trammell
looped a curveball into center for the game's first run.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick also had two hits and Edgardo Alfonzo had one, but
the rest of the Mets' bats were dormant for another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is we haven't hit for the last week or 10 days,''
Valentine said. ``The good news is, we're going to hit a lot. We
play this brand of baseball every day for the rest of the way,
we'll be very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   A loss is a loss, said Mets first baseman Todd Zeile; walking
off the field at the end makes no difference. But the Mets and
Cardinals could meet in October, and this series has emboldened St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a little hope that if we ever run into them in the
playoffs, we'll have a chance,'' Edmonds said.
</P>

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri dealt a
crushing electoral blow to Lebanon's Syrian-appointed government in
final parliamentary voting on Sunday, early results showed,
sweeping all of Beirut's seats and gaining a powerful majority of
backers in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In a modern, extravagantly financed campaign the likes of which
this traditionally clan-dominated city had never seen, thousands of
the swashbuckling multibillionaire's supporters swarmed the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri's campaigners were clustered on street corners throughout
the city all day, clad in blue, green and tan T-shirts bearing his
visage. Twelve hours of criss-crossing the city turned up only four
workers in orange T-shirts distributing cards for his Sunni Muslim
rival, Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
   Official vote totals are to be announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighteen of eighteen.'' Salim Diab, Hariri's campaign manager,
said in his headquarters an hour after the polls closed, indicating
they had won all the seats contested, as supporters danced and
cheered outside.
</P>
<P>
   While the voting in one of the bitterest campaigns ever here was
far from eliminating Syria's hold on Lebanon _ since all of the
major figures here, not least Hariri himself, have ties to Damascus
_ it appears to have drastically altered the political status quo.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Hariri defeated the two men handpicked as Lebanon's
leaders two years ago by Bashar Assad, the untried 34-year-old heir
to Syrian power, during his internship here in preparation for
assuming the mantle of his father, Hafez Assad, who had run both
countries with wily, ruthless skill.
</P>
<P>
   President Emile Lahoud, the Maronite Catholic former military
commander whom the young Assad chose to be president in 1998,
detests Hariri and mounted a strong campaign with all the
government's resources against him, including hours of denunciation
on the state-run television station.
</P>
<P>
   And Hoss, the sitting prime minister and a political fixture for
decades, lost his seat in Parliament despite efforts by Syria to
gerrymander Beirut into three electoral districts and guarantee his
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional political wisdom here was that tradition _
along with Syria's desire to see a number of possibly contending
Sunni Muslim leaders _ would make safe the seats of Hoss and of
Tamman Salam, the son of the late Saab Salam, the longtime zaim, or
leader, of Beirut's major family and a former prime minister,
himself.
</P>
<P>
   But, in what many analysts see as the most significant measure
of Hariri's victory, both Hoss and Salam, according to the early
results, were swept away in the landslide.
</P>
<P>
   It is a stunning political turnaround. Only a month and a half
ago, political pundits here were writing that Lahoud was hoping for
a two-thirds majority in Parliament so that the Constitution could
be amended to extend his six-year term, which expires in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with the battering the government took in last week's
round of elections _ with 41 of 63 seats going to the opposition _
and today's voting for the 128-seat body, he is faced with the
prospect of either accepting, or trying to find a way around
naming, his sworn enemy, Hariri, as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 18 seats Hariri appeared to have won in
Beirut _ along with the remaining 19th seat he gained in a backroom
deal with the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah on Friday _ he is expected to
be supported by 23 winning candidates on the joint Amal-Hezbollah
ticket in southern Lebanon and at least a dozen more from the Bekaa
region in today's voting.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 Taif agreement that helped end the 15-year civil war
here says that the president must appoint the prime minister with
the support of a simple majority of Parliament. And the removal of
Hoss and Salam from the political scene puts Lahoud and the Syrians
in a further bind. Under the unwritten National Accord here, the
prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim and the alternative pool of
prominent candidates is now sharply reduced.

ROBERT MONTGOMERY JR., 77, ENTERTAINMENT LAWYER 
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert H. Montgomery Jr., 77, a lawyer for prominent
film, theater and art figures and the trustee of the Cole Porter
Musical and Literary Property Trusts, died Saturday at his home in
Sag Harbor, N.Y. The cause of death was lung cancer, said his wife,
Henriette.
</P>
<P>
   His career at the Manhattan law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton &AMP; Garrison, where he was a partner, spanned 40 years.
Montgomery's clients included Andrew Lloyd Weber, the composer;
Louis Malle, the director; Marilyn Monroe, Andy Warhol and Isabella
Rosellini, said Peter Felcher, who succeeded him as the trustee for
the Porter Trusts.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the law firm in 1950, Montgomery worked with
Porter before the composer's death in 1964, and became the trustee
for the property trusts in 1977. ``When Bob took over the trusts,
he really was responsible for getting the word out, to maximize
people's exposure to Porter,'' Felcher said. The job called for
vigilance in protecting the integrity of the composer's work.
Montgomery used to tell the story of how, through an oversight, a
Cole Porter song was licensed to a maker of a toilet-bowl cleaner,
who changed the lyrics to ``I've Got You Under My Rim.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery was given credit for the current revival of Cole
Porter's ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' because he worked for years to find a
producer for the show. ``It was really through Bob's perseverance
that the show was produced'' Felcher said. ``It was a 20-year
quest.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kimball, the artistic adviser to the Porter Trusts,
agreed. ``He found the right people to produce it, and waited for
so many decades for the revival,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery headed the entertainment department of his law firm,
expanding it to include motion picture and television clients.
``Many people referred to him as the dean of the entertainment
lawyers,'' Felcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery also helped represent the late producer Joseph Papp
in a legal battle against New York City, paving the way for decades
of performances of Shakespeare in the Park, Felcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery was born in Boston on April 1, 1923, and graduated
from Harvard College and Columbia Law School. He served as a
sergeant in the Army, working as a cryptanalyst decoding messages
in Japanese during World War II. He was on duty to decipher news of
the Japanese surrender, which he passed on to his boss, who
informed the White House, Mrs. Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery also served as a trustee of Vassar College and as
chairman of the Alliance for the Arts. He also served on the boards
of the literary journal Partisan Review, the Bay Street Theater in
Sag Harbor, and the Manhattan School of Music.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Samuel, of Los
Angeles; a daughter, Margaret, of New York, and two grandchildren.
There will be no funeral, Mrs. Montgomery said. A memorial service
will be held in Manhattan at a date to be determined.

 &HT;    Counterculture thrives at Burning Man festival
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACK ROCK CITY, Nev. _ The Man is in flames and thousands dance
around the pyre. Luminescent fish swim through the desert air. Drum
choirs and techno music pound contrapuntal polyrhythms. Green
lasers undulate high overhead, illuminating the mountain ranges six
miles distant. And Dr. MegaVolt stands between his truck-mounted
Tesla coils, absorbing million-volt sparks into his body.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Richards, from Decatur, Ga., observes the scene with
undisguised glee and raises his voice in a brief salute of
thanksgiving: ``There is a counterculture.''
</P>
<P>
   Very counter. This is Burning Man. And unlike your grandfather's
meek, Thoreauvian alternative society, these folks aren't satisfied
with quietly contemplating the natural world. Burning Man goes to
the wilderness and rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong Burning Man art festival, which drew about 37,000
hardy souls to the second biggest empty place in the Northern
Hemisphere, and climaxed this Labor Day weekend, is tough to
characterize. Imagine a conglomeration of artists, ravers, bohos
and techies. Now place them in the forbidding Black Rock desert,
two hours northeast of Reno, a 400-square-mile alkali plain, devoid
of life, buffeted by 70 mph winds, baked in the day to a 100-degree
crispness and frozen at night.
</P>
<P>
   Now provide them with enormous disposable income from the
Internet boom, and sprinkle with creativity and a pinch of
psychoactive chemistry. The result is a 24-hour-a-day party in a
tent-city Shangri La, where ostentation takes the form of wild
clothing _ or no clothing _ spectacular art installations, and a
sustained effort to make each other laugh.

<P>
   For its week of existence this encampment, called Black Rock
City, is the sixth biggest municipality in Nevada. It has its own
post office (which stays open ``until we're too drunk to cancel
stamps,'' says one volunteer postal worker), its own newspaper,
public safety force and Department of Public Works, and provides
most city services. But bring your own water.
</P>
<P>
   Burning Man almost turned into Raining Man this year, with an
unseasonable sustained downpour Friday evening, which, combined
with chilly temperatures, drove some revelers back to their tents.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, says artist Charlie Smith. ``It made people put
their clothes back on,'' he shrugs. The party continued.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is in the center of the nine-square-mile encampment, a
clearing that is dotted with monumental sculpture and
installations, arrayed in a kind of Mall radiating out from the
commanding 50-foot wooden effigy known simply as The Man. He is
inspecting his own contribution, a 21-foot, two-ton sheet metal
heart, heated by a wood-fired cauldron to a red-hot glow. Smith
crafted the structure in an Atlanta warehouse, and with the help of
collaborator Syd Klinge, shipped it west in 50 pieces, and
reassembled it here. ``Can you think of a better place to show
sculpture?'' asks the burly 34-year-old. ``This is the gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, there is trouble in paradise. The federal Bureau of
Land Management, which leases the site to the Burning Man
corporation, has steadily raised its fees and regulations. Some
naysayers fret about the environmental impact of event, and vow to
block Burning Man 2001. And as the group has grown from its humble
origins in 1986, when San Francisco artist Larry Harvey burned an
8-foot effigy in front of a group of about 40 friends, its nature
has changed from wild and woolly rebels to a highly controlled
mini-community.
</P>
<P>
   It's safer, says Austin Richards, aka Dr. MegaVolt, who
remembers the days when more hard-core participants roamed the
playa with their own flame-throwers, and the amusements included a
drive-by firing range.
</P>
<P>
   Now weapons are banned. Also campfires, explosives and urinating
on the playa. But Richards, a high-energy physicist from Santa
Barbara, Calif., is doing his part to bring back danger. He and his
15-person crew roam the event at night, donning metal suits,
harmlessly absorbing spectacular 15-foot arcs from their twin
coils, sometimes holding blocks of wood or stuffed animals that
burst into flame in their arms.
</P>
<P>
   Says Peter Richards, who is the Dr.'s fiftysomething daddy, and
a teacher, ``I am very proud of my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Other concerns: Success. ``Are dot.com yuppies ruining Burning
Man?'' asks the headline in an alternative publication. Certainly
they are building bigger and wilder theme camps, like the Space
Cowboy encampment, with its gasoline-powered margarita blender.
</P>
<P>
   Such debate wouldn't occur in most other cultural institutions,
where more money is always better, but founder Harvey has high
ideals for this event. He sees it as a way to change passive
consumers into active participants, in a place where experience is
no longer bought and sold, but created.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, almost nothing (but ice and coffee) is for sale
in Black Rock City. It is a gift economy, says Harvey, where
commerce is replaced by self-reliance. ``Try to live without
commerce'' in the real world, he told Reason magazine earlier this
year. ``Good luck. You'll be dead in a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, at Burning Man you really do encounter people
struggling to give things away. ``Waitresses'' in starched aprons
offer canapes to passers-by on the main esplanade. Bay-area lawyer
Robin Hopkins hands out iron-on transfers from her encampment, and
offers a generator-powered iron to do the job with. The
ever-popular Freezing Man plies the boulevards in his van, handing
out popsicles and ice cream sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   The van is one of the few motor vehicles allowed on the playa by
the Department of Mutant Vehicles. Only art cars are allowed, like
the three-wheeler that resembles a Jules Verne submarine, or the
60-foot fire-breathing dragon, or the very comfortable
battery-driven sofa, that will do 15 mph when the way is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it is all things not boring suburbia,'' says Erik
Haagensen, 29, of Atlanta, relaxing in a handsome wooden yurt with
fellow Atlantan Luba Sharapan, 30.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the playa _ a prehistoric lake bed so flat that the
curvature of the earth is visible _ Burning Man's participants
cheer and amble, each outdoing the other in costume. Electro
luminescent wire is the decoration of choice this year. Some have
decorated themselves and their bicycles, towing homemade billboards
embroidered with glowing animals. In the dark the bicycles
disappear; one sees a school of iridescent fish darting through the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Richards is rightfully boggled by the scene. If this event
were a band, he knows what he'd call it: ``Thirty Thousand
Maniacs.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Vice President Al Gore begins the fall stretch of
the presidential campaign buoyant in the polls and brimming with
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the strongest sign of this self-assurance is the Gore
campaign's visible grab for Florida, a state that has been
perceived as pro-Bush for months and where Bush's brother Jeb is
the governor. Gore operatives say they are now slightly ahead in
Florida. Gore has visited the state twice in the last week and is
popping into Tampa on Monday morning during his 24-hour whirlwind
Labor Day tour.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, advisers said, either Gore or Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, Gore's running mate, will visit Florida at least once a
week from now through the November election, as they will regularly
visit other battleground states that are becoming increasingly more
plausible for the Democrats: Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   And while the campaign has already bought television time in
three swing markets in Florida _ Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach
_ it is also planning a big investment in Miami, Tallahassee and
other areas as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we turn on the lights there,'' said one top Democrat,
``watch out!''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the Gore team is pumped and basking in
a spate of positive media coverage. But its newfound euphoria is
tempered with caution. There are tricky shoals for Gore to
navigate, and the campaign has some important decisions to make.
These concern how he will respond to attacks from Bush, how to
present himself as a change from President Clinton even while
advocating many of Clinton's policies, and how to counter voters'
impression that Gore is weaker on certain personality traits.
</P>
<P>
   A memorandum from Hickman-Brown Research Inc., a firm that polls
for the Gore campaign, says that Gore has made strides in important
ways: His personal popularity is up, it says; voters agree with his
positions on most issues that are most important to them and have
more faith in him than in Bush to carry out certain presidential
duties, like managing foreign policy and preparing the country for
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum also says that Gore has shown major improvements
in some areas of vulnerability. The pollsters refer to these as
``key personal dimensions,'' which they define as traits related to
leadership and trustworthiness, although Republicans still perceive
Gore as vulnerable on matters of credibility.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is an aggressive opponent, flush with cash, and he has
already demonstrated that he will not lie down for a Gore
steamrollering. The Republicans, who have spent twice as much as
Gore on television commercials, are on the air now skewering Gore's
credibility on improving the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is also stepping up his criticism that the Clinton
administration has squandered the opportunities of the last eight
years. Republicans say that new commercials in the works show
Clinton making the same promises in 1992 _ for a middle-class tax
cut, for a prescription drug benefit for the elderly _ that Gore is
making today.
</P>
<P>
   How severely _ and how soon _ should Gore respond? He has a
reputation as a cutthroat competitor whose aggressiveness can fire
up the partisans but alienate independents and swing voters. The
Gore team is deploying countless surrogates, including Lieberman,
to make the case against Bush. But there is some internal debate
about the level on which Gore should engage.
</P>
<P>
   His challenge last week that Bush should ``put up or shut up'' _
an attempt to goad the governor into being more specific on his
policy proposals _ was ridiculed by the Bush campaign as a
playground taunt, but gave a hint of Gore's eagerness to get in the
fight. The Democrats also withheld a commercial they had prepared
last week criticizing Bush's record in Texas. That is likely to be
broadcast in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most nettlesome question for the Gore campaign is
how to take advantage of the humming economy. In times of peace and
prosperity, the incumbent party is almost always rewarded. The good
news for the Gore campaign is that internal polling suggests that
in several important states, a majority of voters perceive the
nation to be on the right track. This has historically been one of
the most important indicators for whether or not incumbents are
re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   But for Gore to have climbed to his place in the polls only now
suggests that other factors are at work. The central concern is
that while voters appreciate the good times, there is lingering
resentment toward Clinton over his personal behavior, creating a
complex web of emotion that seems to ensnare Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Allan J. Lichtman, a political analyst at American University
who has written about the basic factors on which people vote, said:
``The fundamentals are in Gore's favor. Peace, prosperity,
tranquillity at home and a united incumbent party. Why has the race
even been close? The Clinton scandals.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, said that of all the issues
that voters rank as important, one, declining moral values, hurts
Gore the most. ``This is the aftereffect of impeachment,'' Goeas
said. ``Voters didn't want Republicans to impeach Clinton because
they thought it would rock the boat. Now that that is no longer an
issue, they are indulging in a second emotion _ they didn't want
Clinton impeached, but they think what he did was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Gore pay for that? He has worked hard to close the Clinton
chapter, staging a ``passing of the baton'' ceremony before his
convention last month and declaring himself in his acceptance
speech his ``own man.'' Still, the centerpiece of his campaign is
the thriving economy, and the economy is the most sterling part of
the Clinton legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are often open to change, but there are questions about
how much change Gore actually represents. He says he is not running
for a third Clinton term, and yet he has vowed to continue much of
the Clinton doctrine and certainly the current prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is not an award for past performance,'' Gore
told workers at a construction site here Sunday. ``I'm not asking
you to vote for me on the basis of the economy we had; I'm asking
for your support on the basis of the better, fairer, stronger
economy that we're going to create together over the next four
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The coming week should reveal more of the Gore strategy as the
vice president focuses on the economy, including in a major speech
in Cleveland on Wednesday. His economic speeches this year _
drafted with the help of Clinton's former treasury secretary,
Robert Rubin _ have emphasized fiscal discipline and paying down
the debt. This has reflected the centrist ``New Democrat'' approach
advanced by Clinton. Over the last several weeks the vice president
has relentlessly pounded a populist theme that analysts said has
raised questions for some voters about whether he wants to go back
to old-style big-government spending and the financing of programs
for the poor.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Gore's current strategy is to stick to the issues, and to try to
make the campaign about the issues on which he has an advantage.
Internal polling suggests that undecided voters side with Gore on
health care, Social Security and the economy. They side with Bush
on crime and moral values, and in many states rate the candidates
about even on education.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials indicated that they were not so worried
about the lack of support on crime, noting that it is not as big an
issue as it was in 1992, it is not an issue that swing voters are
making their decisions on, and few voters think Gore has had
anything to do with crime rates anyway, so it is not very fertile
ground for him.
</P>
<P>
   But declining moral values is another matter. Gore is well aware
of this, and it goes a long way toward explaining why he picked
Lieberman, with his reputation for rectitude and his history of
criticism of Clinton's personal behavior, as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Goeas, the Republican pollster, said that education and values
ranked as the two top issues for married women, and that married
women, who make up 60 percent of female voters, tended to support
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has done a good job of, at worst, neutralizing education,
but he is overwhelmingly ahead on moral values,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tad Devine, a chief strategist for the Gore campaign, said that
at this point the campaign was trying to reach as broad an audience
as possible. Over the next few weeks, he said, different groups of
people will click in to the election, and they will be
``persuadable'' at different times. He said the campaign was
talking about broad themes now, but as the pool of persuadable
voters shifted and shrank, the campaign would deliver its message
more to specific audiences, largely through direct-mail letters,
radio advertising (which reaches more identifiable groups of voters
than television does) and campaign destinations.

 McBRIDE'S GOAL POWERS U.S. OVER GUATEMALA  
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two strategic substitutions by U.S. coach Bruce
Arena turned out for the best and for the worst in a World Cup
qualifying game Sunday afternoon against Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The insertion of Cobi Jones paid the highest dividend. He
created the game's only goal, with a perfect cross to Brian
McBride, in the United States' 1-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The victory came before a sellout crowd at RFK Stadium and put
the Americans a step closer to advancing to the regional finals.
That six-nation round-robin tournament next year will decide the
three nations that will represent the North and Central American
and Caribbean region in the 2002 World Cup finals in Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who entered the game in the 57th minute, took a pass from
Jovan Kirovski on the right flank. He accelerated to the penalty
area and then crossed the ball to McBride at the far post, who
scored from 6 yards with a low, left-footed shot in the 72nd
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a goal,'' Arena said of his decision to insert Jones
for Tony Sanneh and Eddie Lewis for Ernie Stewart. The United
States then went to a 3-5-2 formation _ three defenders, five
midfielders and two forwards _ after having used a 4-4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was ejected seven minutes after he entered for a violent
foul on Guatemala's Fabricio Benitez. His ejection left the
Americans a man short against a well disciplined and determined
Guatemala defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``One change worked, the other didn't,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones found a way to make the right play after the Americans had
failed repeatedly to come up with the right formula to beat the
Guatemalan defense and goalkeeper Edgar Estrada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cobi basically made a perfect ball,'' McBride said of the
pass. ``He teased the goalkeeper a little to the point he had to
come out and left me with an easy job.''
</P>
<P>
   It was McBride's second goal of this qualifying round, and 13th
in 45 international appearances for the United States. He scored
the team's only goal in the 2-1 loss to Iran in the 1998 World Cup
that left the Americans last among the 32 countries in France.
</P>
<P>
   The United States (2-1-1) is second in its regional semifinal
group with seven points. Costa Rica (3-1), which posted a 3-0
victory Sunday over Barbados, is first with nine points. Guatemala
(1-2-1) is third with four points. The Americans have two games
left in the group, against Costa Rica (Oct. 11 in Columbus, Ohio)
and at Barbados (1-3) on Nov. 15. The top two teams will qualify
for the regional finals.
</P>
<P>
   Before McBride scored, the Americans had little offensive
success. Their crosses from the flanks were elementary to defend
and they were losing their air battles at both ends of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Arena decided to start Kirovski in place of Jones because he
wanted to have the flexibility of changing strategies during the
game. ``Jovan is the most natural-looking player who can become a
third forward if we decide to change tactics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great win for our confidence,'' Arena added.
``Guatemala is a tough team to break down. It was a great play by
Cobi on the goal. We expected this to be a 1-0 game. The crowd was
also 50-50, and it was good for us.''

TIRE CHANGES WERE NEVER ENACTED AFTER 1978 RECALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ After the last huge Firestone recall in 1978, when
tread-separation problems resulted in hundreds of crashes and
dozens of deaths, Congress and regulators recommended a series of
proposals to tighten federal tire standards. But the rules were
never revised, and many of the same problems have arisen again in
the 14.4 million Firestone tires being recalled now.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional report on the 1978 recall of 14 million
Firestone 500 tires pointed out that the steel-belted radial tires
had easily passed the government's tests _ devised in the late
1960s for biased-ply tires, an earlier technology _ but still
failed in large numbers on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Carter administration officials began drafting new tire
regulations and imposed one new requirement on the auto industry in
1980, but many other initiatives were still in the rule-making
process when President Carter left office in 1981, documents from
that period show.
</P>
<P>
   All the moves to tighten tire regulation were stopped after
Ronald Reagan became president and sought to reduce the regulatory
burden on the then-beleaguered U.S. auto industry. The only new
rule, involving the disclosure of tires' capacity to carry weight,
was rescinded. Also canceled were plans for more stringent tests
and for mandatory devices to warn motorists when their tires became
underinflated.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the regulatory initiatives abandoned in 1981 are likely
to come up again this week, as congressional committees hold
hearings into the current recall.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has received
more than 1,400 complaints about Firestone ATX, ATX II and
Wilderness AT tires, the bulk involving tires installed on Ford
Explorers. The complaints and data supplied to the agency by
Firestone attribute 88 deaths to the tires. Firestone has recalled
all ATX and ATX II tires of the P235/75R15 size, which were made
from 1990 to 1996, and has recalled Wilderness tires of the same
size made since 1996 at its factory in Decatur, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The safety agency is also reviewing whether many more Firestone
tires may need to be recalled. On Friday it issued a consumer
advisory suggesting that motorists replace another 1.4 million
tires that Firestone has refused to recall.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone estimates that 6.5 million of the 14.4 million tires
covered in the current recall are on the road, and fewer than half
those covered by the advisory.
</P>
<P>
   Two provisions dropped in the early 1980s clearly would have
made the current episode easier for consumers. One would have
required that identification numbers be printed on exterior rather
than interior sidewalls, making it much simpler for consumers to
determine if their tires were included in a recall or advisory.
</P>
<P>
   Another, enacted before the 1978 recall, required that
independent tire dealers keep track of the addresses of buyers, so
that those customers could be contacted during any recall.
</P>
<P>
   The year before the huge recall of 1978, Firestone had recalled
400,000 similar tires made in Decatur. The company insisted then,
as it does now, that the problem was confined to that plant, but
company documents obtained by regulators in 1978 showed that
Firestone knew of a design defect affecting tires from other
factories as well.
</P>
<P>
   The 1978 recall and the current one are the two largest, by a
wide margin, since tire regulation began in the 1960s. The earlier
recall produced more than 14,000 complaints to regulators, but
those complaints cited just 41 deaths. Firestone 500s were car
tires, and few cars rolled over when their tires failed. The
current recall involves far fewer complaints but more deaths, most
of which have occurred when Explorers and other sport utility
vehicles rolled over after the tires lost treads.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the recall, House and Senate conferees were
scheduled to decide in the next several weeks whether to let
regulators proceed with plans to provide consumers with information
on vehicles' tendency to roll over. One of the hearings this week
will be held by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who has led efforts to
block the release of the information. Shelby, who has been
traveling in Africa for the past month, has declined interview
requests through aides.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for safety and the
environment, said in a recent news conference that Ford would favor
any new tire regulations that improved safety. Ford opposes
regulators' plans to rate vehicles' tendency to roll over,
contending that the proposal does not measure this tendency
accurately enough.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have defended their plan, pointing out that
automakers have opposed every attempt to measure rollover
propensity since regulators began studying the issue in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The government tests tires for endurance by running them for 34
hours at 50 miles per hour and for speed by running them for 90
minutes at 70 to 85 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen R. Kratzke, the associate administrator of the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, confirmed that regulators
were considering more stringent tests, notably for speed. Any new
rules would probably not be limited to tires for sport utility
vehicles and other light trucks, he said, but would also extend to
car tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly true that light trucks are more prone to roll
over with something like this,'' Kratzke said in a recent
interview. ``But this kind of failure scares me, and I don't think
people in cars will be comfortable with it either.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to disclosures that Ford subsidiaries overseas began
replacing the tires last year, Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater said Sunday on the ABC program ``This Week'' that the
Clinton administration also wanted legislation requiring
manufacturers to report recalls abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone officials declined to comment on whether they felt new
tire regulations were needed. But Chuck Sinclair, a spokesman for
Goodyear, the market-share leader, said Sunday night that the
company did ``see a need for change in the regulations'' and had
been working on this even before the current recall.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cause of the problems with the tires in 1978 was
never publicly determined, Firestone did make changes to them, and
the problems stopped. But the episode crippled the company
financially and contributed to its takeover in 1988 by Bridgestone
Corporation of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone recovered from the 1978 recall by replacing virtually
all the tires itself, which kept customers coming back to its
dealers. But Ford has insisted that Firestone reimburse customers
who buy other brands this time.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In 1981, as the Reagan administration began reviewing its
predecessor's regulatory backlog, the U.S. auto industry had laid
off 500,000 workers and was close to bankruptcy. Chrysler had just
been rescued with a government loan.
</P>
<P>
   While high interest rates and high gasoline prices were partly
responsible, auto executives also blamed the high cost of
government regulation, and Reagan sought to ease this burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president recognizes the importance of protecting health,
safety and the environment,'' a White House announcement on the
auto industry said on April 6, 1981. ``Nevertheless, some of the
regulations governing the auto industry's plants and products are
unnecessarily stringent, and can be relaxed or rescinded with
little or no cost to worthwhile regulatory goals.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most controversial tire regulations proposed at the
end of the Carter administration, and canceled by Reagan, would
have required that vehicles alert their owners to low tire
pressure, either with a light on the dashboard or with a red button
that would pop up from the tire's valve.
</P>
<P>
   The April 1981 statement said that the tire-inflation
requirement would cost at least $130 million per year. Keeping
tires inflated, it said, ``is arguably more directly and
efficiently addressed as a public/consumer issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for such warnings was questioned at the time, partly
because full-service gas stations were still common and many
Americans had their tires checked whenever they refilled their gas
tanks. Most Americans now use self-service stations, and air for
tires is not always free, if it is available at all.
</P>
<P>
   Tire inflation has been a big issue in the current recall.
Firestone has recommended that Explorer tires be inflated to 30
pounds per square inch, after acquiescing for a decade in Ford's
recommendation of 26 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   For drivers accustomed to a car's ride, softer tires help
cushion the stiffness almost inevitable in the suspension of a
pickup-truck-based sport utility like the Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Baughman, Ford's director of light-truck engineering, has
acknowledged that Explorer tires could suffer damage if the
pressure falls below 20 pounds, but said that 26 pounds provided an
adequate margin of safety. Firestone was heavily criticized in 1978
for not having done more to tell customers of the dangers of
underinflation, and the company is emphasizing the issue now.

GIANTS SHOW UNEXPECTED FLASH AMID THUNDER AND LIGHTNING 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Given the customary symbolism affixed to
season-opening games, the Giants' season debut Sunday was not
particularly nouveau in style nor stylishly notable. In the Arizona
Cardinals, the favored Giants recognized a team in disarray and
quickly stomped to a large early lead they gingerly protected in a
21-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Giants, a team with few achievements in recent
seasons, there was an execution of purpose _ and an unexpected
flash _ within Sunday's solid, clean victory at Giants Stadium. The
Giants may have defeated a team that could be the least proficient
of any Giants opponent this season, but there is always some credit
to following a plan as designed.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had set out to run the football and gained 223
rushing yards, the most in three years. They had set out to win the
turnover battle, and they created four while committing just two
turnovers of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line, a fidgety, unsure lot that disrupted the
offense's rhythm with its penalties and breakdowns last season, did
not have a penalty and did not yield a sack. The defense sagged
late but stuffed the Cardinals early, holding them to three points
in the first three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the thunder and lightning. Above Giants Stadium
Sunday, with a bolt and a crash, it appeared to the west of Giants
Stadium, bringing about a 23-minute delay of the game in the early
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On the new grass field of the stadium, the self-labeled Thunder
and Lightning combination of Giants running backs Ron Dayne and
Tiki Barber scored three touchdowns. Barber had the Giants first
two scores, one on a crazy-legged touchdown dash from sideline to
sideline and another on a 78-yard burst up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play to win the game and that's what we did,'' said Giants
Coach Jim Fassel, who is now undefeated in four season openers. ``I
know there were things that didn't go exactly right at the end.
We'll work on that. But let's not forget all the good parts of the
game, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the Giants, the best part is they didn't flop in a game
they probably couldn't afford to lose. Not with the Philadelphia
Eagles, who overpowered the Cowboys in Dallas Sunday, playing host
to the Giants next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is that we beat a team we were supposed to
beat,'' said Lomas Brown, the Giants new, but 15-year veteran, left
tackle. ``Yeah, we've got to play better. But this is a big first
step.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants played with poise and confidence from the beginning
Sunday - at least until the fourth quarter _ and showed cohesion
that belied all the turnover on the roster. Compared with their
starting lineup in last year's opening game, there were nine new
starters. But the Giants looked tight, sending an early message
when they sent the Cardinals off the field after just three plays
as the game dawned. Offensively, the Giants moved the football
early, taking a lead they never relinquished on their second
possession.
</P>
<P>
   On that 66-yard, 10-play drive, Giants quarterback Kerry
Collins, who completed 17 of 25 passes for 172 yards, converted on
consecutive third-down plays with a 24-yard pass to Ike Hilliard
and a 13-yard screen pass to fullback Greg Comella. Barber and
Dayne, who had 78 yards on 23 rushing carries, brought the Giants
to the Cardinals' 10-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Barber then took a toss to the right but found a host of
Cardinals waiting for him. Barber said he followed his instincts,
which meant reversing his field to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risk and reward type of thing when you do that,''
Barber said.
</P>
<P>
   Barber's speed, brought on in part by added strength and a few
less pounds, reduced the risk. He outraced two Arizona defenders to
the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second quarter, after an 11-yard pass from Collins
to wide receiver Amani Toomer eased the Cardinals safeties off the
line of scrimmage slightly, the Giants gave the ball to Barber
again, this time on a quick slant to the right side.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' remade offensive line, which steadily protected
Collins and opened a variety of holes for the running game,
provided Barber an impressive gap to run through. Barber dashed
between center Dusty Zeigler and right guard Ron Stone _ with right
tackle Luke Petitgout sealing the outside. Barber out-ran
cornerbacks Aeneas Williams and Tom Knight to the end zone, the
78-yard scoring play the fourth-longest running play in team
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm getting a little faster in my old age,'' said
Barber, who added that he expected to have a big day. ``I hope to
have 15 more big days.''
</P>
<P>
   It is part of the Giants strategy, if all goes as designed, that
Barber can help the Giants get a lead and Dayne can help them
protect it. To that end, Dayne saved his best running between the
tackles for the fourth quarter. And on the final play of a 15-play
drive, Dayne powered in over right guard for a 7-yard touchdown
that gave the Giants a 21-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we saw a little of what Ron can do for us,'' Fassel
said of Dayne, who had 36 yards on six attempts on the last
touchdown drive. ``And he'll get better.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Giants took their 18-point lead, the Cardinals began
to take more chances _ and the Giants played more prevent defense.
That combination led to two touchdown passes from Arizona
quarterback Jake Plummer to wide receiver David Boston, the second
coming with just 39 seconds remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's two touchdown passes did not negate his three
interceptions, and though he threw for 318 yards while completing
28 of 49 passes, it did not make up for an otherwise sloppy game by
the Cardinals offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a game that we controlled,'' Giants linebacker
Jessie Armstead said. ``We needed that. Opening day is about
getting off on the right foot and feeling good about yourself. We
got both those things done.''

DEFINING MILITARY'S COMBAT READINESS TILTS AT WINDMILL OF
BUREAUCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush kicked off a heated
political debate when he declared that two of the Army's 10 active
divisions were ``not ready for duty, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he wanted to highlight the complexities of measuring
military readiness, however, he could have looked closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   The 49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard _
nominally under the governor's command _ has the lowest ranking for
war-time readiness that the Pentagon gives, according to military
officials. It has been that way for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Pentagon disputes that its active-duty forces
are not ready for combat, the 49th Guard Division's case reveals a
far more difficult question about the overall state of the American
military. It involves an arcane, sometimes subjective readiness
accounting system that can be misleading and is not easily reduced
to the sound bites of a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush and his running mate on the Republican ticket, Dick
Cheney, the former defense secretary, who has joined heartily in
the criticism, do not dispute that the American military is
technologically advanced, highly trained and well equipped.
</P>
<P>
   The real question, and one that the candidates on both sides
have only glanced on, is how the next administration intends to
prepare its forces, and for what and where.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not if you're ready,'' as a senior military officer at
the Pentagon put it, ``it's what you're ready for.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in assessing the state of today's military is
that the Pentagon's system for measuring readiness ultimately
measures only one thing: fighting a major ground war with air and
naval support. Any units doing anything else _ and thus not
preparing for that worst case _ can run afoul of the system's
subjective but merciless readiness classifications.
</P>
<P>
   And so the two divisions cited by Bush _ the 10th Mountain and
the 1st Mechanized Infantry _ were briefly classified as unready
for war last fall, not because they suffered from budget cuts and
low morale, as Bush suggested, but rather because large parts of
the divisions were keeping peace in Bosnia and Kosovo, according to
Army and Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that it counts if you're training to fight Saddam,
but doesn't count if you're actually deploying deterring Milosevic
or containing conflict in the Balkans is a strange artifact of our
national military strategy, and makes little sense,'' said Michael
O'Hanlon, a defense analyst at the Brookings Institute in
Washington who has informally consulted for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For the 49th Guard Division in Texas, the meager readiness
rating it holds may not be the best indicator of its ability to
conduct military operations. According to the Pentagon's system,
the 49th is unfit to fight a war. Since March, however, nearly 700
men and women of the 49th, including its headquarters company and
most of its commanders, have overseen the American sector of NATO's
peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and, by all accounts, doing it
well.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the 49th is sending roughly 300 more combat troops to
Bosnia. In October, the Texas Air National Guard is sending the
unit Bush once served in, the 111th Fighter Squadron, to patrol the
no-fly zone over southern Iraq, where American pilots are routinely
responding to Iraqi antiaircraft fire with air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sort of combat the unit never saw when Bush trained as
a fighter pilot in the Texas National Guard during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Pentagon's accounting system serves a purpose,
which is to prioritize dollars for the armed services and their
combat units. The system's ratings are based on the national
military strategy, which since Cheney was secretary of defense has
called on the military to be prepared to fight and win two major
regional wars _ for example, in the Persian Gulf and on the Korean
peninsula _ at nearly the same time.
</P>
<P>
   On that scale, the Pentagon's latest quarterly readiness report
to Congress, issued last week, concluded that ``most major combat
and key support forces are ready to meet assigned taskings,
although there are force readiness and capability shortfalls that
increase risk in executing operations.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hillen, a retired Army captain who has served as a defense
policy adviser to the Bush campaign, said, ``These things are so
eminently capricious and fungible that the readiness ratings are
not really significant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a lawyer,'' Hillen said, ``you could say that,
technically, both sides are right.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the two-war scenario, the Army would need all 10 of its
active divisions, supplemented by units from the Army Reserve and
the National Guard, to satisfy the plans. That is the standard by
which the divisions are measured for readiness, but it is one that
ignores how the Army is using its forces today, and how it is
likely to keep doing so, whoever is elected in November.
</P>
<P>
   The oddity of the readiness measuring system is that forces
involved in actual military operations score lower under it. After
the Persian Gulf War in 1991, several Air Force squadrons returned
home only to be classified as unready since they had not been doing
the training that had to be checked off to qualify as ready. Never
mind that those squadrons had just returned from waging one of the
most successful air campaigns in history.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the Army is keeping peace in Bosnia or Kosovo, or
conducting exercises in Kuwait, or fighting fires in the Western
United States, those units will not be doing what it takes to meet
the system's highest standards for the war plans. After an extended
peacekeeping mission, for example, it can take months for units to
regain the highest level of readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You face very different scenarios in a peacekeeping mission,''
said one Army officer involved in monitoring readiness. ``You're
not going to move, attack and defend the way you have to in the
war-fighting mission. Those are skills that have to be practiced
over and over again until they're almost subconscious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army, like the other services, has begun to address the
problem by relying more heavily than ever on the National Guard and
Reserves. But because the Army's eight Guard divisions are not, for
now, in the nation's war plans, they have received a lower priority
when it comes to financing for equipment and training. The Army
does not expect them to be at the highest level of readiness.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Guard's 49th Division slipped to the lowest level three
years ago because of shortages in training time, equipment and
personnel, according to officials in Texas and Washington. Even
though he is commander in chief of the Texas National Guard, Bush
has little impact on the 49th's readiness, since the state provides
only 5 percent of the Guard's budget.
</P>
<P>
   But the 49th's deployment to Bosnia has freed up another
division to concentrate on the war mission. By the time the 29th
Infantry Division from Virginia takes over the American sector in
Bosnia, almost all the American troops in Bosnia will be
reservists, compared with 25 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has gone even further, proposing to include Guard
divisions in the war plans. That would relieve the strain on the
active divisions, but it could cost billions of dollars since the
Guard divisions would have to bring themselves up to a higher level
of readiness.
</P>
<P>
   So far in the campaign, neither Bush nor his Democratic
opponent, Vice President Al Gore, has proposed ways to address the
fundamental problems, at least as measured by the traditional
readiness accounting system. Bush has proposed increasing the
modernization budget by $20 billion to design, building new weapons
systems, and raising pay and benefits by $1 billion, or nearly $750
for each person in uniform. Gore, too, has proposed increasing
benefits for the troops.
</P>
<P>
   While those address problems like increasing morale or creating
new weapons, they do little to fix the problems outlined by Cheney
this week. Daily needs like spare parts and training rarely receive
attention from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And no one in either campaign has talked about the easiest
solution. If the next administration decided to change the national
military strategy, concluding that two major wars were not very
likely to happen at once, the question about whether forces are
ready would disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fix the problem,'' Hillen said, ``by changing the way
you measure it.''

DE LA HOYA-ARUM RIFF IS JUST BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only a few years ago that Oscar De la Hoya gave Bob Arum
his Olympic gold medal one emotional evening to thank the promoter
for his role in the fighter's phenomenal success.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, De La Hoya sued Arum to end their eight-year
association.
</P>
<P>
   During that eight years, Arum often described De La Hoya as one
of the best people he's encountered in a nasty business.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he used expletives to describe the one-time Golden
Boy and cited a character flaw: Lack of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Sad? Perhaps. Surprising? Not really. De La Hoya is that greedy
and Arum that egotistical.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya apparently was livid over recent comments made by
Arum suggesting the fighter should retire. And, although Arum said
he never meant to suggest such a thing, De La Hoya's reaction is
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya also wasn't too happy with anyone immediately after
Shane Mosley outpointed him in June. He implied irrationally that
the fight was fixed in Mosley's favor so those associated with the
promotion would reap another windfall for a lucrative rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Logic says he was referring to Arum, at least as much as anyone
else. Arum said the two haven't spoken since the day after the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   However, for De La Hoya, this appears to be more about business
than any perceived slights.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya had been trying to wriggle out of the contract (which
has three years remaining) long before the comments about
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been trying for some time to buy his contract _ reportedly
for $3 million _ but Arum has refused to let go. In effect, the
lawsuit was the last resort to gain complete control of his own
destiny and earnings.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time De La Hoya has done such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mittleman and Steve Nelson came up with more money than
they'd ever seen _ $1 million _ to become De La Hoya's first
managers after the 1992 Olympics. About 1 1/2 years later, De La
Hoya came to the realization they were making a lot of money that
could be going into his pocket and did the logical thing: He paid
them off to get rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, De La Hoya came to the same realization with Arum.
</P>
<P>
   He's made a lot of money with Arum, more than $100 million in
ring earnings. Arum said De La Hoya walked away with $45 million
for his last three bouts alone. Their 80-20 split of the profits, a
stipulation since they renegotiated their contract in 1997, means
Arum made in the neighborhood of $11 million for those fights.
</P>
<P>
   A comment De La Hoya made after the decision to let Mittleman
and Nelson go comes to mind. It went something like this: ``I'm
paying these guys all this money for what? Making a few phone
calls?''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, De La Hoya doesn't believe he needs Arum to make
phone calls any longer: He remains one of the most marketable
athletes in the world _ even though he's lost his last two
significant bouts _ and figures he can make plenty as a freelance
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Arum doesn't really need De La Hoya, either.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most successful promoters in boxing history is a
multimillionaire himself. He doesn't really need the money De La
Hoya offered him to break the contract, the money he might make if
he sues De La Hoya for breach of contract or the money he might've
made in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Arum's primary motivation apparently is this: He doesn't want to
be just another employee of sorts whom De La Hoya discards because
he's deemed no longer useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't do that to me,'' Arum said. ``I'm going to fight them
tooth and nail. And he's gonna end up realizing that in time he's
going to pay for what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   So who's the bad guy? Neither, really.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is a businessman and the business world is a tough
place, particularly when millions of dollars are involved. Sure, he
could continue to earn ungodly sums with Arum. He simply believes
he could make more on his own _ however misguided that might be and
it's his right to try.
</P>
<P>
   He could be criticized for failing to honor a contract he
signed. However, he has plenty of company: How many other athletes
have tried to get out of a contract in search of more money?
</P>
<P>
   Arum? Well, he's one of boxing's great promoters. Again, he's
not going to let some punk kid (a term he's probably used in the
last several days) push him around. Can you blame him?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this whole thing is just part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   TIME RUNNING OUT: De La Hoya still would like to fight Mosley in
January. However, it doesn't appear this mess will be cleaned up in
time for that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley probably will fight Arturo Gatti in December and De La
Hoya a few months after that, assuming the conflict with Arum is
solved.
</P>
<P>
   MITCH HALPERN: What drove one of the world's top referees, Mitch
Halpern, to suicide remains unclear, as police have released few
details.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern, divorced about a year ago and the father of a
4-year-old girl, apparently was engaged at the time of his death.
It appears a quarrel with his fiancee might've played a role in the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern had refereed about 90 world-title fights since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   RABBIT PUNCHES: Mosley has been named fighter of the year by The
World Boxing Hall of Fame for a second time. Mosley's father, Jack
Mosley, is trainer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, Mosley has beaten Wilfredo Rivera, Willy Wise and De La
Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means a lot to me,'' Shane Mosley said. ``It's a step in
the right direction as far as making history. Me and my father
winning the awards I think is just great.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The Vernon Forrest-Raul Frank fight, which ended as a no-contest
after Frank was accidentally cut by a head butt on the Fernando
Vargas-Ross Thompson undercard two weeks ago, will be rescheduled
for late this year or early 2001, Main Events said. ...
</P>
<P>
   Main Events will end the year with a bang: The promotional firm
will co-promote three major pay-per-view fights in October,
November and December: Andrew Golota-Mike Tyson, Lennox Lewis-David
Tua and Vargas-Felix Trinidad. ...
</P>
<P>
   An excellent Showtime card is set for Sept. 16 in Las Vegas. The
fights: William Joppy-Hacine Cherifi, Fabrice Tiozzo-Virgil Hill,
Joel Casamayor-Radford Beasley and Sharmba Mitchell-Felix Flores.
</P>
<P>
   The card is so deep, only highlights of the Mitchell-Flores
fight will be shown on TV. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Tony Ayala-Johnny Tapia rematch a 10-round non-title bout _
is set for Oct. 7 on Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Their first fight, won by Ayala, was fight of the year in 1999.

   Gatti is scheduled to face unbeaten Joe Hutchinson on Friday in
Montreal. The fight is on ESPN2. ...

   The first true Webcast of a football game had its expected
glitches _ mostly caused because of the volume of users _ but the
otherwise successful venture by FoxSports.com in carrying
Saturday's Nebraska-San Jose State game at least established a
beginning point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's emerging technology,'' said Danny Greenberg, senior vice
president of FoxSports.com. ``It is not perfect yet. It will
continue to improve.''
</P>

   The game was nowhere on TV, so sports bars in Nebraska did the
next best thing, putting the Webcast onto TV screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than listening to it on the radio,'' customer Tim
Goodman, who sat at DJ's Dugout bar in Omaha, sporting a Nebraska
jersey, told the Associated Press. ``It is a little delayed, but
it's good.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In putting off a decision on a national missile defense on
Friday, President Clinton said that the earliest such a shield
could be put in place was 2006 or 2007. But the president made a
decision on just one system. What he did not say, and what the
debate over that system has obscured, is that a number of
lesser-known anti-missile weapons might be candidates for the same
job.
</P>
<P>
   They are known as theater missile defense systems, and they are
designed to protect American troops and bases in relatively small
regions of conflict, much as was attempted during the Persian Gulf
War. But some, already under development, could be expanded,
potentially, to protect larger areas and perhaps even the entire
United States, according to analysts both inside and outside the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these systems have yet to be tested for the purpose for
which they were originally designed, let alone for a new, more
ambitious one, and the difficulty of adapting them would range from
making simple changes in their computer software to perhaps adding
sophisticated new sensors or other hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with several of these weapons scheduled to be available
as theater defenses by 2007, the delay announced by Clinton is
bringing them much closer scrutiny and has reopened debate over
whether these systems might themselves eventually provide some form
of national defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does debunk the argument of the Pentagon that if you want
missile defense soon, your only choice is the missile defense
system they've been pushing,'' said Dr. Michael O'Hanlon, a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes military
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the plan Clinton has delayed, which would shoot down
warheads as they descended in space, many of the so-called theater
defenses use interceptors, lasers or fragmentation explosives fired
from ships or airplanes that could maneuver relatively close to
small countries like North Korea, whose missile program has been
cited as one reason for needing a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these theater systems are currently designed to shoot
down short- and medium-range missiles in midflight or on their way
down to a target, but proponents say they might be adapted to
destroy the kinds of faster, long-range missiles that would be the
object of a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   This could be done by adding long-range sensors that would
potentially give theater systems enough time to destroy missiles in
midflight, or by targeting missiles soon after they were launched,
in the so-called boost phase. Other theater defenses have been
specifically designed to work in the boost phase.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of boost-phase interception was even endorsed this
summer by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who suggested that
Russia might cooperate with the United States in developing it.
Russia has opposed a national missile shield, arguing that it would
threaten to undermine its arsenal and violate the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty the United States signed with the former Soviet
Union in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not objected to theater systems that work in the
boost phase. One reason is that because of Russia's large size,
interceptors cannot be positioned close enough to attack Russian
rockets while they are being launched, and thus Moscow does not
consider such a system a threat to its land-based arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   China, however, in addition to its objections to a national
defense system, does see theater defenses as a threat because they
could theoretically be used to protect Taiwan and Japan, its
potential adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, theater defenses have not generated the
same kind of debate at home or abroad as the Pentagon's idea for a
national missile defense, because the theater defenses have not so
far been designed to offer the kind of blanket protection from
missile attack that would challenge existing theories of arms
control, which are based on mutual vulnerability. Nor do they
violate the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   This would undoubtedly change if they were expanded to protect
the whole of the United States, and any defense system that did so
would probably violate the ABM treaty, according to arms control
experts. Some critics have seen these theater systems as an attempt
to bring in a national missile defense through the back door.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Friday, Clinton said that Russia had agreed to
cooperate with the United States ``in areas such as theater missile
defense,'' but he did not mention the systems' wider potential.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia might agree to changing the ABM treaty to allow for
adapting to broader use a theater missile defense system that it
does not view as a direct threat, said Dr. Harold Brown, secretary
of defense in the Carter administration. ``This is a way of
possibly preserving the ABM treaty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no clear, technical distinction between the theater
and national missile defense systems,'' said Dr. Dean Wilkening,
director of the science program at Stanford University's Center for
International Security and Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a Navy system that would shoot down missiles with
shipboard interceptors, Wilkening said, ``they are well down the
road to being fully capable national missile defense systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The $5.1 billion that the United States will spend on missile
defense in fiscal year 2001 will be equally divided between theater
defenses and national missile defense, according to the nonpartisan
Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   That contrasts starkly with the situation in the 1980s, when
expenditures on national defenses dominated spending.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the theater programs _ which have names like the Theater
High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), the Patriot Advanced
Capability-3, and the Navy Theater Wide and Navy Area defenses _
use interceptors fired from ships or trailors that attempt to ram
an enemy missile or explode near it.
</P>
<P>
   Of those systems, extensive testing has already been done for
the new Patriot, scheduled to be put in the field starting next
year. Unlike the version used in the Gulf war, which exploded near
descending missiles, this one aims to ram them. THAAD has also been
extensively tested and is expected to be deployed by 2007. Current
plans have the Navy Theater Wide defense available for emergency
use in 2007 and fully deployed three years later, while the
shorter-range Navy Area defense should be ready sooner.
</P>
<P>
   One program that is receiving generous funding but little
publicity is development of a powerful laser to shoot down
ballistic missiles from a platform in space, intended for use by
2013.
</P>
<P>
   The Airborne Laser program, run by the Air Force, aims to put a
similar laser aboard a modified Boeing 747 and begin shooting down
test missiles by 2003. Seven planes are expected to be in operation
by 2009, according to a spokesman for the program, if Congress
provides the money. The laser systems could be designed to work as
either national or theater defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Some proponents of adapting theater defenses favor using them in
the boost phase, since decoys like balloons or fake warheads
separate from the missile at higher altitudes and make the job of
finding and shooting down the real warhead that much harder.
Missile defenses have been compared to shooting a bullet with a
bullet, and the boost phase approach in effect means using a bullet
to shoot the gun.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Others insist that this is not the only way, and that the
protection that midcourse interceptions could offer against large
or inaccessible countries, like Russia, China or Iran, would be
indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, those who would use the theater missile defenses, or
TMD, to replace the Pentagon's favored system, say that their
mobility and flexibility make them a better choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A national missile defense capability that evolves from TMD
will probably be cheaper, better contribute to defense against both
long- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, and allow for more
effective growth in capability as the threat increases,'' wrote
John Deutch, Brown and John P. White in the summer issue of Foreign
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch, a former director of the CIA and deputy defense
secretary, and White, a lecturer in public policy at Harvard's John
F. Kennedy School of Government and a former deputy defense
secretary, both served under Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On the conservative side of the political spectrum, which has
long supported expansive national missile defenses, enthusiasm for
theater defenses runs high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sea-based, or mobile, you can move and align your forces based
on the threat,'' said J.D. Williams, a retired vice admiral and
former director of naval warfare who has studied the concept for
both the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization and the
conservative Heritage Foundation. He said that land-based defenses
could be added if the funding was available.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of long-range sensors, Williams added, ``one
ship could take care of about a third of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely what additional improvements might be necessary to
convert these systems into a national defense by intercepting
missiles in midflight is still not entirely clear, Wilkening of
Stanford said, since most of them are still under development and
recent amendments to the 1972 ABM Treaty, which have not been
ratified by Congress, prohibit testing theater defenses against
intercontinental ballistic missiles directly.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most important element needed to turn those theater
defenses into potential national defenses are long-range sensors,
said Dr. David Wright, a senior staff scientist at the Union of
Concerned Scientists and a researcher at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   With that sensor technology, which the United States already
plans to deploy in space and possibly on the ground over the next
decade, the Navy system ``starts to look like an interceptor which
could, in principle, shoot down strategic missiles,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of converting theater systems say that the change would
be far more difficult _ requiring, for example, interceptors vastly
faster and more maneuverable than the theater systems could muster.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the sensors carried aboard the interceptors for homing in
on a target might have to be improved. Wright pointed out that the
system would have to be able to discriminate missiles from the
decoys that would surely accompany an enemy attack.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said that enthusiasts of conversion
were overstating their case. ``They seem to imply that you don't
need to go the NMD route that this administration is taking,'' the
official said, referring to national missile defense. ``There are
flaws in these glib statements and analyses.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the administration has no plans to convert theater
defenses into national defenses, the official said. ``It would be
very difficult for the United States, as a practical matter, to
develop a system and label it as one thing with the intent of
surreptitiously being able to fulfill a completely different
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Pentagon official dismissed the notion that the
theater systems have intrinsic technical limitations, saying that
even the most basic Navy Theater Wide system could intercept
missiles while they were being launched. Moreover, upgrades to the
interceptor planned for that program would allow for the rockets to
be intercepted in space, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these systems can have applicability to both theater
and national missile defense,'' said Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, a
spokesman for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, who
agreed that the systems would require modifications for an expanded
role. ``It just depends on which direction the nation wants to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Modified theater defenses would not be the only way to create
such a defense. According to some analysts, the simplest and
cheapest solution would be to start from scratch with faster
interceptors launched from military cargo ships, a strategy
advocated by Dr. Richard L. Garwin, a physicist at the Council on
Foreign Relations, or from airplanes, an approach that Wilkening
has studied.
</P>
<P>
   But the Air Force is developing a system, called the Airborne
Laser, based on an entirely different technology that is targeted
toward the boost phase. An eight-year, $1.6 billion development
program that aims for a missile shoot-down in 2003, the system is
expected to include a laser mounted in the nose of a converted
Boeing 747.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force is designing the laser to destroy short- and
medium-range missiles while they are being launched by rupturing
their metal skin. If the system works _ in tests, a ground-based
laser using similar technology recently destroyed a small rocket in
flight _ it could potentially be used against intercontinental
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``ICBMs are actually an easier target in some ways, because
they're typically made of thinner material than the Scuds, and they
also burn longer,'' said Col. David Harrell, deputy director of the
Air Borne Laser system program office at Kirtland Air Force Base in
New Mexico. Scuds are Russian-made missiles that Iraq used in the
Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The laser program will receive $148 million in fiscal year 2001,
and would cost $2 billion to $3 billion through its first planned
missile shootdown from space in 2013, said Dr. Douglas P. Crawford,
the space-based laser project integrator at the Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization.
</P>
<P>
   If it works, the laser could be used against either theater or
national threats, Crawford said. (This is the only boost-phase
defense that would threaten Russia directly since the laser could
be fired from a distance.) He added that the technology has been
receiving a much more positive reception than it had for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Star Wars' moniker was a term of derision through the
late 80s and early '90s,'' he said, ``but I haven't heard it
recently.''

WITH LEAD GONE, BUSH TURNS FOCUS TO REFINING ATTACKS ON GORE

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For most of the spring and summer, with a
seemingly durable advantage in the polls, Gov. George W. Bush
chatted genially with voters about his own good intentions, and his
swipes at Vice President Al Gore were fairly perfunctory. When Gore
belittled him, Bush expressed something akin to bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   No more. As Labor Day opens the curtain on the pivotal act in
the 2000 presidential campaign and Bush confronts the evaporation
of his lead, he and his advisers said that it is no longer enough
to tell Americans why they should want the Texas governor in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Voters must also be convinced that they do not want Gore there.
And that is precisely what the Bush campaign intends to do, as it
readjusts and adapts its strategy to the higher stakes of the race
and the relentless ticking of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over the last few days, Republican officials tied
to the Bush campaign said that a new Republican television
commercial last week that cast Gore as an untrustworthy, untruthful
chameleon was a harbinger of similar salvos to be fired over the
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   And it signaled what will be a generally heightened
aggressiveness by the Bush campaign, apparent Sunday at a news
conference here in which Bush sought to gain the upper hand on the
debate over presidential debates, which Gore has been winning.
</P>
<P>
   With nine weeks until Election Day, Bush's advisers said that
they would also begin picking apart and poking holes in Gore's
policies more assiduously and raising more pointed questions about
his leadership abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are left after the conventions are the hard
sells,'' said Karl Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush
campaign, referring to the small, crucial cluster of undecided
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are no longer going to be driven just by the exposition
of a positive agenda,'' Rove said. ``They're going to say, `That's
fine, but how does that differ from the other guy's?' And that
means drawing sharp distinctions and differences in an appropriate
way.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Bush this week begins discussing a plan for prescription
drug benefits under the Medicare program, he will not simply
promote his ideas, his advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   He will also tell senior citizens that Gore's proposal, which
involves more federal regulation, smacks of nationalized health
care and represents a bid for ``the government to be their
pharmacist,'' said Karen Hughes, the campaign's director of
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes was previewing more than a sound bite; she was making
clear that the Bush campaign, with increasing vigor, would portray
Gore as an old-style Democrat bent on intrusive government
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Other Bush campaign officials said that they planned to put a
more exacting microscope over Gore's calls for increased government
spending and assert that the vice president's appetite for new
programs endangered projected federal surpluses. Gore has levied
the same charge against Bush's sweeping tax cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is also paying close attention to other
aspects of the campaign, for example, monitoring polls in
battleground states so that Bush can tailor his schedule to those
fluctuating yardsticks.
</P>
<P>
   After meetings on Saturday during which Bush's aides hashed over
new evidence that Gore was pulling ahead in Pennsylvania, the Bush
campaign extended his schedule for this week to include a second
visit, on Friday, to that crucial state. Bush was already planning
to be there Tuesday for the unveiling of his prescription drug
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be agile and flexible and change things around
as we go,'' said one Bush aide.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush is already deep into preparing himself for the debates.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, a close
Republican ally of Bush's, visited Austin in his role as the
stand-in for Gore in rehearsals, according to one of Bush's
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser said that Gregg and Bush did not actually position
themselves at lecterns or simulate the formal trappings of a
debate, but practiced the kind of back-and-forth exchanges that
would probably occur between the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this activity, Rove's use of the phrase ``an
appropriate way'' to describe how Bush would distinguish himself
from Gore pointed to a potential problem for the Bush campaign as
it gets more aggressive. Sharp attacks on Gore could come across as
a hypocritical contradiction of Bush's pledge to ``change the
tone'' of politics.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican officials said that pitches like the one used in
last week's commercial _ which mocked Gore's appearance in 1996 at
a fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple and his boasts about creating
the Internet _ had tested well with swing voters in focus groups
conducted by the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush, in an interview on Friday, hinted that there was
plenty more ammunition against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of different things we could have used,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush was on a day trip to Louisiana and Arkansas that reflected
the campaign's ongoing analysis of the electoral map. Neither of
those states belongs firmly to either candidate.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers expect him to dominate elsewhere in the South and
will thus focus most strongly on Florida, where Gore is mounting a
strong challenge. Its 25 electoral votes are the the nation's
fourth richest prize, behind California and New York, where Gore
should prevail, and Texas, which is a cinch for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush will visit California next week and his advisers
want to force Gore to spend time and money there, their only
genuine hope on the West Coast seems to be Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast, with the exceptions of New Hampshire and possibly
Maine, is also a stronghold for Gore, which leaves the states in or
abutting the Midwest as the most intense war zone.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers regard Indiana as an almost sure win and Ohio and
Missouri as likely victories that need tending. As these advisers
seem to see it, Illinois and Minnesota are likely losses, although
Illinois will get some attention.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin and Iowa are possibilities. And then come Michigan and
Pennsylvania, ripe with electoral votes. Bush will pass through
both of these states more than once this week, along with visits to
Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of events, the Bush campaign plans to extend to other
issues its practice of introducing middle-class families who would
benefit from his proposed tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will probably stand alongside senior citizens who prefer
his prescription drug plan to Gore's and people in their 20s or 30s
who like his call for the option of private investment accounts
within the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   But several of his advisers acknowledged that Bush's message had
to transcend _ and, in a sense, trump _ policy details, because
polls show that more voters see Gore's positions on issues as
compatible to their own.
</P>
<P>
   So Bush will assert that no matter where Gore stands, he cannot
deliver, because he lacks the ability to forge bipartisan
cooperation. And Bush will talk, as he has since last year, about
Gore's prescriptions being the reflections of a man who believes in
government as the font of all wisdom while his own remedies are a
gesture of faith in people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if it got to be about specific issue positions, you're
playing on Gore's turf,'' one adviser to the Bush campaign said.
``But if you make issues about broader realities and broader
dynamics, you're on our turf.''

<P>
   RAMLE, Israel _ It was quite a send-off for a felonious
politician.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside a drab prison, on a huge stage erected for a
going-away party, the rabbis took their seats. In the crowd below,
acolytes of Aryeh Deri, the former leader of the Orthodox Shas
Party, danced rhapsodically as a religious rock group warmed up
with a few electric bars of last year's hit song, ``He's
Innocent.'' Thousands chanted ``Police state!'' under the impassive
surveillance of blue-uniformed Israeli police officers.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just the beginning of a three-hour rally that
culminated in Deri's solemn march from dais to prison. Accompanied
by a phalanx of officers, he clung to the rabbis' parting gift, a
velvet-covered Torah scroll to keep him company during his
three-year sentence for corruption. While the clanging prison door
seemed to seal his downfall, the crowd saw him elevated instead,
from charismatic politician to ``tzaddik,'' or righteous man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aryeh Deri is a symbol for all of us who were born in Morocco
and Iran and Iraq and Egypt,'' said Ayala Yosef, 37, a mother of
five. ``Today represents the apex of the persecution they inflicted
on him throughout his political career for standing up for us. But
it will backfire. Shas will only grow because they put him in
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   That is far from certain. Weakened by the loss of Deri's
charismatic leadership, by the taint of his conviction and by
internal conflicts, Shas has had a rocky year under the stewardship
of its new leader, Eli Yishai.
</P>
<P>
   Shas pulled out of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government
several months ago. Now, with Deri behind bars, Yishai and the
party's rabbis will try to figure out what lies ahead for them and
whether the party's fate is finally unbound from Deri's.
</P>
<P>
   After sequestering himself in religious studies for the last
year, Deri pronounced his own political career over. But he would
be eligible to run for Parliament after serving his term, and he
could even become a cabinet minister again in 10 years. He is only
41, and he has a passionate following.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came all the way from New York to see him off to prison,''
said Yoram Siman-tov, an Israeli immigrant who lives in Queens.
``And I will return again in a few years to welcome him out. I'm a
frequent flier.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 15 years, Deri built from scratch a political,
social and religious movement that blossomed into a linchpin
political party and Israel's third largest. Shas' leadership is
Orthodox, but its adherents include many traditional, but not
strictly religious, Jews of Middle Eastern descent who are drawn to
the party's second identity as an ethnic pride movement.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, as they developed a sizable religious school
system and social service program, Deri and his associates took
advantage of his position as a public servant, according to the
judges who convicted him last year of fraud and bribery. Deri
appealed the conviction and recently lost.
</P>
<P>
   The case brought ethnic, religious and class tensions to the
surface. Many secular Israelis saw Deri's behavior as a threat to
the rule of law by the leader of a party that answers to divine law
first.
</P>
<P>
   Many Shas supporters saw the legal system's behavior as an elite
crusade to bring down a powerful Moroccan-born Jew. On Sunday those
supporters contrasted Deri's conviction with the state's decision
not to prosecute Ezer Weizman, the former president, who accepted
substantial cash gifts from a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what color can do,'' said Sunday's posters, comparing
Weizman's supposed self-imposed punishment _ retirement to his
beach house in Caesarea _ with the jail term handed Deri. Sephardic
Jews here often refer to themselves as black and to members of the
Ashkenazic elite, like Weizman, as white.
</P>
<P>
   Deri faded from public life after the elections last spring, but
the tensions raised by his trial did not fade. They were worsened
by Shas' difficult relationship with Barak. After Shas resigned
from his government, the prime minister announced a ``civil
revolution'' to divest the religious parties and the authorities of
their entrenched power. On Sunday, his cabinet voted to dismantle
the Ministry of Religious Affairs, a longtime power base of the
religious parties and, until several months ago, of Shas.
</P>
<P>
   Most mainstream Israeli newspapers denounced ``Prison Day'' for
furthering a cult of persecution and victimization around Deri.
``Felon, not martyr,'' said the editorial in The Jerusalem Post.
``It behooves the Sephardi party's leaders to understand that the
facile canonization of a criminal is, in essence, an insufferable
attack on the rule of law.''

CARD DEALERS READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rob Veres admits he's ``stoked'' the NFL season's
finally here.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so he does have some financial stake in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real changing of the guard in the hobby,'' said the
owner of Burbank Sportscards. ``Where the guys like Elway, Marino,
Young, Rice dominated the last 10 years, now it's Peyton Manning,
Kurt Warner, Peter Warrick, Plaxico Burress, Daunte Culpepper,
Jamal Lewis, even LaVar Arrington, and he's a defensive player ...
the emphasis has switched in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Card collectors show their excitement by how much they spend. So
far, Veres says NFL card sales both at his store and his Web site
(www.burbanksportscards.com) have been brisk in anticipation of
who'll turn out to be the new hot commodity.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a half-dozen companies spitting out the shiny
cardboard in 2000, there's a need to separate the must-have from
the don't-bother. Veres breaks down his top five choices for the
best and brightest packs of cards for serious collectors (concerned
more with quality) as well as for the kids (who look to get more
for their money): &QL; 
SERIOUS COLLECTORS:
</P>
<P>
   1. Upper Deck Pros and Prospects ($9 for 5 cards). ``These are
flying off the shelves,'' said Veres. ``The Warrick card is already
at $350, and Arrington is $100.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Donruss Elite ($7 for 5 cards).
</P>
<P>
   3. Topps Chrome ($4 for 4 cards).
</P>
<P>
   4. Playoff Prestige ($7 for 4 cards). New feature insert are
swatch cards from rookie's college alma maters.
</P>
<P>
   5. Crown Royale ($6 for 6 cards), featuring the crown-shaped die
cut that ``still is very much a fringe card,'' said Veres. &QL; 
KIDS:
</P>
<P>
   1. Upper Deck MVP ($2 for 10 cards). Offers the best chance at
valuable insert cards.
</P>
<P>
   2. Impact ($1 for 10 cards). Don't underestimate the team-logo
tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   3. Victory ($1 for 12 cards).
</P>
<P>
   4. Topps ($1.50 for 10 cards). Always a good seller in any
sport, with a neat reproduction series of Johnny Unitas cards.
</P>
<P>
   5. Sky Box Dominions ($1.50 for 10 cards). &QL;

JAPAN TURNS EARTHQUAKE DRILL INTO MILITARY EXERCISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Inserts name of neighborhood where drill took place in 1st
graf; Changes wording and number of deaths in graf that begins
``Ishihara has since ...'' Inserts new graf, beginning ``And on
Saturday ...'')  By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ As smoke pots simulating fires spewed yellow fumes from
the buildings, military trucks rumbled into Shirohige Nishi, a
dilapidated quarter of Tokyo on Sunday, rushing in olive-uniformed
reinforcements for civilian rescue squads overwhelmed by the
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   With clattering helicopters dancing green against the blue skies
above, just when the action seemed to reach its peak, this show's
director swooped in. With clockwork precision, he stuck to an
elaborate schedule of visits to Tokyo neighborhoods to view staged
earthquake devastation.
</P>
<P>
   The choreographer of all of this action was Shintaro Ishihara,
the very pleased-looking governor of Tokyo prefecture who has long
been known as a populist conservative showman. It was clearly a
moment of glory for this politician, who had turned a hitherto
boring annual earthquake-readiness drill _ traditionally held in
early September in recognition of the Great Tokyo Earthquake on
Sept. 1, 1923 _ into one of the largest military exercises that
most Japanese have seen since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister had to content himself with a low-profile
visit to a basement command room of Japan's Self Defense Forces to
monitor the drill's progress before rushing off to greet the
visiting Russian president.
</P>
<P>
   But Ishihara, who flitted from one neighborhood to another all
day aboard a red rescue helicopter, was fulfilling a nationalist's
dream: returning the military to the national stage, and being
hugged by female admirers at every step.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the rope lines of eager supporters who waved to the
governor all along his passage on Sunday, the appearance of more
than 7,000 uniformed soldiers in the streets of central Tokyo also
revived discussions of a militarist past that is fast fading from
living memory.
</P>
<P>
   Political activism may be feeble in Japan, but pacifism here
still runs deep. Many Japanese who questioned the need for a
military drill on this scale said that they see the exercise, Tokyo
Big Rescue, as being as much a public relations operation for the
military as a disaster-preparedness drill.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese politics have been inching rightward in recent years,
these critics say, and one of the cherished goals of many in the
governing Liberal Democratic Party is a revision of the
Constitution to allow Japan to field a full-fledged army for the
first time since its defeat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two purposes behind this exercise,'' said Atsuo
Nakamura, an opposition member of Parliament. ``Ishihara wants to
change the Constitution, and turn Japan into a big military country
again. The other purpose is that Japan is in very bad economic
condition, and politicians like this are trying to blame people of
other nationalities for our troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a very classic way of dealing with problems, just like
Hitler did. The Japanese people are very nationalistic, and he
wants to awaken this feeling to become more popular.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The earthquake drill's link to questions of constitutional
reform, nationalism and xenophobia is the doing of Ishihara, who
has made a career of right-wing causes, from planting Japanese
flags on tiny islands disputed between Japan and China to
worshipping at shrines associated with war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Ishihara set a divisive tone for the exercise while
addressing members of the Self Defense Force. ``Third-country
nationals and foreigners who have entered Japan illegally have
perpetrated heinous crimes,'' he said. ``In the event of a major
earthquake, riots could break out, and there is a limit to the
police's ability to cope with such a situation alone. I want you to
carry out your mission, not only to deal with natural disasters,
but also to maintain law and order.''
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara has since apologized to Tokyo's foreign residents for
his remarks, after being reminded that as many as 7,000 Koreans
were killed in mob attacks by Japanese troops and civilians during
the turmoil of the 1923 earthquake, after rumors spread that they
were committing sabotage or even had caused the natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   His aides have since tried to focus the debate on the need to
use the rarely activated army to assist in disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   But his office continues to make xenophobic statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking the Koreans have made a good adjustment to
this country, but we still have many illegal Chinese who are
penetrating this country illegally and are carrying out terrible
crimes,'' said Atsuyuki Sassa, a security adviser to Ishihara.
``There are Iranians, and others. We have many new problems as a
result of this. And what Mr. Ishihara was saying is that we must
maintain peace and order in the case of a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Saturday, Ishihara himself dismissed critics of the drill
as ``left-wing idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   Several associations of foreign residents in Japan have
responded warily to the drill, counting it as the latest sign of
mounting hostility toward other Asians in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right wing in Japan has always been very hostile to
Koreans and Chinese,'' said So Chungo-On, director of Chosensoren,
an association of residents of Korean descent. ``These kinds of
people feel that the past history of the military in Japan is
glorious. All we can do is hope that this drill is not aimed at us.
More than 55 years has passed since the war ended, and the old ways
of thinking should have changed by now as we enter the century of
internationalization. The governor himself should be a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In Shirohige Nishi, an area of grassy plots and collapsing
hovels chosen for the drills, Kudo Chisato, a lifelong resident,
peered out from her shingled home, one of the few sturdy buildings
remaining in the area. She declared the drills great entertainment,
as the first helicopters appeared and firemen began extinguishing
imaginary blazes with their hoses.
</P>
<P>
   But asked if such a show of force was needed to reign in lawless
foreigners, she scoffed. ``I'm not worried at all,'' she said,
before referring to the 1923 quake, with its massacres. ``What
happened before was 80 years ago. The Japanese are gentle now, and
it is unlikely that foreigners would pose a threat either.''

GLAUS HITS 40TH HOMER, BREAKS REGGIE'S TEAM RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Troy Glaus turned 24 only a month ago, but Sunday he
broke the Angels' single-season home run record with his 40th of
the year in the sixth inning off White Sox pitcher Matt Ginter.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Jackson held the record with 39 since 1982, but Glaus
found no reason to feel satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what I'm about,'' said Glaus, who is hitting .281
and has 90 RBI. ``Individual records don't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates, though, are impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great accomplishment,'' said right fielder Tim Salmon,
who earlier this season passed Brian Downing to set the Angels'
career home run record. ``Am I surprised? No. The guy's going to
hit 40 home runs every year, at least. I'm happy for him, I'm
pushing for him to hit 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he stays here a long time, he's going to break all the
records. He's going to be one of those players people talk about
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   What seemed to overshadow Glaus' accomplishment, however, was
that it came in a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these guys offensively are putting up some tremendous
numbers, but it's no consolation unless we get to where we want to
be,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``That's what I like about this
club. (Records) are very hollow if we don't win. They're not happy
with personal numbers and they shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   SPIEZIO SIGHTING: Scott Spiezio couldn't be blamed if he sent
Scioscia a memo reminding him he still plays for the Angels. After
all, Spiezio has all but disappeared since the Angels traded for
Ron Gant on July 30.
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio got a rare start Sunday and responded by tying his
career high with four RBI, three coming in on his 14th homer of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   But before Sunday's game, Spiezio had just 26 at-bats since Gant
joined the team, including only 24 at-bats during the month of
August. Scioscia has gone primarily with Gant and Orlando Palmeiro
in the DH/part-time outfielder role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating, any time you're not in the lineup it's
frustrating,'' said Spiezio, who began spring training as a
candidate for the starting spot at second base. ``I want to be in
there every day, but it's not going to happen. Instead of sulking
and crying about it, I wait for an opportunity. If it's one at-bat,
it's one at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might sit for three days, then get one at-bat in the ninth
against a (John) Wetteland or a (Mariano) Rivera. If I'm sulking, I
have no chance against those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio's opportunities have been limited even more of late
because Darin Erstad has been in the DH spot while he nurses a
strained rib cage muscle. Gant and Palmeiro are natural
outfielders, while Spiezio's start Sunday was his first in the
outfield in his career.
</P>
<P>
   QUALITY TIME: Derrick Turnbow, the 22-year-old Rule V draftee,
got into a game Sunday that was still in question. All of his 19
previous appearances were during blowouts one way or the other, but
he entered Sunday's game in the sixth with the Angels holding an
11-9 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The first batter he faced _ Frank Thomas _ hit a home run. But
Turnbow retired the next three hitters, including a strikeout of
Herbert Perry with a 95 mph fastball.
</P>
<P>
   MERCKER TO SIT: Pitcher Kent Mercker said his strained rotator
cuff is something he's experienced before and simply requires rest.
However, he will not make his next scheduled start and will likely
go to the bullpen when he's healthy enough to pitch again.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Belcher is expected to take Mercker's start Thursday in
Detroit. &QL;

<P>
   Ten earthshaking developments for this NFL season, based on
seismic activity from Week 1:
</P>
<P>
   1. Danny Snyder will have overpaid.
</P>
<P>
   2. Ryan Leaf won't have the patience to last past Week 3.
</P>
<P>
   3. Troy Aikman won't have enough marbles left to survive past
Week 2.
</P>
<P>
   4. Cade McNown comparisons to Steve Young won't be too
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Culpepper to Kleinsasser'' won't cut it. ``Culpepper on a
keeper'' might.
</P>
<P>
   6. Neil O'Donnell won't look so bad to P'burgh. But then,
neither does Terry Hanratty.
</P>
<P>
   7. Today, Giants Stadium. Tomorrow, The Tiki Room.
</P>
<P>
   8. Chargers-Raiders not for the AFC title.
</P>
<P>
   9. Eagles-Bucs for the NFC title.
</P>
<P>
   10. ``Dark Angel'' looks pretty hot.
</P>
<P>
   -- The C'boys tribute to Tom Landry _ that patch on their jersey
of the small hounds-tooth hat _ magnifies one problem with today's
NFL head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   No style.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: That purple tarp Dennis Green fastens around himself.
...
</P>
<P>
   -- By any Darwinian logic, UCLA should be ranked higher today
than Alabama. Unfortunately, bad preseason-poll guesswork by those
who pretend to know prevents such radical reshuffling. ...
</P>
<P>
   -- Cory Paus, can you hold this clipboard, please? ...
</P>
<P>
   -- USC's strength-of-schedule rating shrivels by the week. ...
</P>
<P>

BUSH ANNOUNCES ALTERNATE PLAN FOR DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: 2nd take will move by 10 p.m. EST)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Trying to end questions about his willingness to
debate and turn the tables on his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush on
Sunday announced a schedule of three hand-picked debates that he
wanted to participate in, only one of which is guaranteed to be
broadcast on the three major networks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pointedly challenged Vice President Al Gore to meet him on
these chosen dates and terms. And he tried to turn Gore's response
into a referendum on the vice president's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent has said he will debate anytime, anywhere, and he
has already accepted the debates that I am accepting today,'' Bush
said. ``It's important for the American people to be able to trust
the next president to keep his commitments, and therefore I take Al
Gore at his word that he will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   In making his proposal, Bush was rebuffing a schedule set up by
the Commission on Presidential Debates, which was created by both
parties and has supervised the presidential debates since 1988.
That agency had proposed three debates, all to be broadcast on the
major networks, and Gore has accepted that plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who made his announcement at a hastily called news
conference on the lawn of the governor's mansion Sunday afternoon,
said he would debate Gore on a prime-time edition of NBC's ``Meet
the Press'' next Tuesday, on ``Larry King Live'' on CNN on Oct. 3,
and in St. Louis on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   His idea drew an immediate reaction from Gore, who said he was
``very disappointed,'' and from Gore's campaign manager, who flatly
rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Another Gore aide said that Bush's plan would be acceptable as
long as he agreed to the three commission debates. ``We've already
accepted these,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman. ``We have no
problem with these. We just want to make sure we do the three
presidential ones.''
</P>
<P>
   While the posturing and positioning on Sunday were over debates,
they were also an attempt by each campaign to make a statement
about the character of the opponent. Gore's aides have been
suggesting that Bush is afraid of a prime-time confrontation,
raising the question of whether he is up to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, with his move on Sunday, tried to make this a test of
Gore's character and credibility, because of his frequent promises
to debate Bush anytime, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Gore campaign's reaction to Bush's debate
proposal, Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said, ``We'll be there
and we'll see if Al Gore will keep his word.'' She added, ``After
eight years of prevaricating, after eight years of `no controlling
legal authority' and of debate over what the meaning of `is' is,
the American people deserve a president who will keep his word.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was just beginning his 24-hour Labor Day marathon tour
in Philadelphia, said only that he was ``disappointed.'' Speaking
to reporters outside Pat's Steaks, where he was getting a cheese
steak sandwich, he said: ``I'm very disappointed in this reaction,
because what's needed is to respect the rights of the American
people, to see the debates on all the networks in prime time.'' He
added: ``That's the way it's been done since 1988.''

COMMENTARY: WORKING HARDER, LONGER
</HEADLINE>
  By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a lot of good news to report this Labor Day.
Unemployment is very low and wages are rising. The benefits of the
booming economy are being widely distributed. Workers at the bottom
are finally enjoying significant increases in their
inflation-adjusted wages. Better yet, the U.S. is experiencing a
surge in the growth of labor productivity which, as noted in a
book-length report from the Economic Policy Institute, is
``probably the best indicator of an economy's capacity to provide
for the material needs of its population.''
</P>
<P>
   This good news is the result of the rapid economic growth and
most especially the sustained low unemployment that really got
rolling in the mid-1990s. The key issue has always been the same
for working people _ jobs, jobs, jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employment opportunities have expanded considerably,
especially for historically disadvantaged groups, including women,
blacks and Hispanics,'' the report said. ``The long-term rise in
job instability and job insecurity, which continued well into the
current economic recovery, finally appeared to have abated at the
end of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the share of workers in nonstandard _ often substandard _
work arrangements, such as temporary work and part-time work, has
declined as opportunities for regular full-time employment have
grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Nirvana, yes?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there's the time crunch. Families with children
have had to work harder and harder over the past few decades to
maintain a decent standard of living, and that phenomenon
continues. The number of earners per family has increased, as have
the average number of weeks worked per year, and the number of
hours worked per week.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't leave a lot of quality time for families to enjoy
the benefits of their added income. As a woman in New Jersey
recently said: ``We're a working family all right. That's all we do
is work.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the matter of indebtedness. The institute's
report, which is titled ``The State of Working America 2000-01''
and is published by Cornell University Press, makes it clear that
despite the rosy stock market stories of the past few years, the
typical American family accumulated more debt in the 1990s than it
made from the appreciation of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The authors wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``The total wealth of the typical American household improved
only marginally during the 1990s. The net worth of the typical
household rose about $2,200 in the 1990s _ from $58,800 in 1989 to
$61,000 in 1998. While this household's assets grew modestly _
stock assets were up by $5,500 and nonstock assets by $8,500 _ its
debt rose as well, by $11,800. Thus, the relatively modest gains in
stock and nonstock assets combined with the offsetting rise in
household debt meant that the 1990s were far less generous to
typical households than business-page headlines often suggest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Middle-income families are ahead of where they were four or
five years ago to the tune of two or three or four thousand
dollars, and that's not chicken feed,'' said Jared Bernstein, a
labor economist and one of the authors of the report. ``But they
are more indebted, working more and more hours, and the stock
market boom has largely passed them by.''
</P>
<P>
   The times may be terrific, but American working families are not
well-prepared for significant downside economic surprises. ``On
some level,'' said Bernstein, ``their future is largely dependent
on staying where we are with regard to unemployment and
productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the public profile of the poor has diminished almost
to the point of invisibility. But they are still there. Despite the
economic gains of the past few years, the national poverty rate in
1998 _ the latest year for which complete statistical data was
available _ was 12.7 percent, just one tenth of a percentage point
less than in 1989, and one full percentage point higher than in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in five American children lives in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The tight labor market is helping, and poor families are working
more. But the progress is painfully slow.
</P>
<P>
   Historians will look back at Labor Day 2000 and marvel at how
well America was doing. And then they will assess how wisely,
during these best of times, we invested our considerable resources
in the unfinished business of creating a brighter future for
everyone.

SPORTS COLUMN: DEDRIC WARD SHOWS HE'S BIG ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Ever since Keyshawn Johnson departed to Tampa
Bay in a flurry of contract demands, the question has hovered over
the Jets: Could Al Groh and Dedric Ward justify the deal?
</P>
<P>
   Groh for being willing to trade a Pro Bowl wide receiver. Ward
for being his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Jets opened Groh's tenure as coach with a 20-16
victory over the Packers Sunday, Ward made the biggest play _
snatching Vinny Testeverde's pass and streaking down the sideline
for a 61-yard gain to the Packers' 2-yard line that positioned
Testeverde's quick pass to Curtis Martin for the winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the 5-foot-9-inch Ward was about to debate Johnson's
persistent argument that he would be irreplaceable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into that,'' Ward said at his locker.
``We don't talk about the guys that are not here.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to talk about the guy that is not here. His big
play did all the talking for him. He showed that he's big enough.
But down deep, he had to feel proud of what he did in catching five
passes for 104 yards, a 20.8-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it like that,'' he said quietly. ``I just
think everybody's going to pick up the slack.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the big play itself, Ward preferred to credit Dan
Henning, the offensive coordinator who called it from the coaches'
booth upstairs at Lambeau Field, and Testeverde for throwing it so
accurately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a play we work on every week,'' Ward said. ``I'm not
going to tell you what the name of the play is other than it's our
`touchdown play.' The cornerback bit on it and Vinny made a great
read on it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also the type of play that Johnson, for all his talent,
seldom made _ the long gain that scores or sets up a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   With his size, Johnson was better at catching sideline passes
and slants over the middle, but he didn't have Ward's sheer speed
in being able to run away from most defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics doubted if the Jets' offense could survive with two
relatively small wide receivers; Wayne Chrebet, who caught five
passes for 47 yards Sunday, is only 5-10.
</P>
<P>
   But early in Dan Marino's career with the Miami Dolphins, he was
at his best in collaborating with two small wide receivers, Mark
Clayton and Mark Duper, for dozens of touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In pro football, it's not the height of the wide receivers that
counts as much as the skill of the quarterback throwing to them.
</P>
<P>
   For much of Sunday's game, Testeverde was understandably rusty.
In addition to returning from the left Achilles tendon torn in last
season's opener, he also suffered a turf-toe injury that limited
him to fewer than 45 snaps in the exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half, Testeverde completed only 11 of 25 passes
for 82 yards as running back Curtis Martin carried to a 10-10
halftime tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envisioned it being a little more crisp,'' the 36-year-old
quarterback said of his passes, ``than it was in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Testeverde had more the look of the
quarterback who had taken the Jets to the AFC championship game in
1998 before losing a shootout with John Elway's Broncos in Denver,
the quarterback the Jets need if they are to challenge the
Indianapolis Colts for the AFC title now that Bill Parcells is no
longer the coach.
</P>
<P>
   But in winning his opener as the Jets coach, Al Groh refused, at
least publicly, to celebrate. Or even to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very resolute,'' he said, ``to remove my personal
emotions from this situation. This was not a first-game win for me,
but a great win to start the season. It wasn't about me at all. My
ego is not such that I see this in terms of Al Groh at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the new coach was here all by himself. His longtime
boss and the Jets' former coach, Bill Parcells, did not make the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner, Woody Johnson, arrived by chartered jet and flew
home on the team's charter, but Parcells was nowhere to be seen.
When the Jets are in their training complex, he's in his office
there as the director of football operations, alias general
manager, but it's as if he doesn't really know how to act in that
role.
</P>
<P>
   He feels that if he's seen around Groh or the players too much,
he'll be accused of interfering. He also knows that if he's not
seen at all, if it seems that he too far removed, he will be
accused of not caring enough.
</P>
<P>
   But when other legendary coaches evolved into a general
manager's role, they were always visible _ Vince Lombardi and Bill
Walsh, for example. And then there is Al Davis, briefly a
successful coach with the Oakland Raiders, who sometimes was too
visible and too vocal as their managing general partner, alias
managing general genius.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fine line that Bill Parcells is walking. And as it turned
out, the Jets and Al Groh didn't miss him. But as a director of
football operations, he should be at his team's games. He wouldn't
be interfering. He would only be inspiring.

COMMENTARY: THE WHINING STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: `Dewey-eyed' in second to last graf is cq'd) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The difference between the presidential candidates
is not, as Ralph Nader claims, between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
As the strategy of calculated whining has been adopted by both
campaigns, the main difference is between Namby and Pamby.
</P>
<P>
   When Al Gore, seeking GOP specifics to denounce, went so far as
to suggest it was ``kind of put up or shut up time,'' George W.
Bush put on a hurt look and went into whining mode. ``That doesn't
sound very presidential to me. ... We have to do something to
change the tone of the discourse.'' He later added reverently that
``politics doesn't have to be ugly and mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Bush campaign dared to air a TV commercial suggesting
that Gore's eager participation in illegal 1996 Asian fund-raising
_ in contrast to his current embrace of campaign finance reform _
was evidence of a credibility problem. At this fairly gentle jab,
Gore went into full frontal whine. He dispatched his running mate
(slogan: ``Gore-Lieberman in 5761'') to intone ``these new attack
ads ... drag us back to the worst politics of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   In each party's Peace Room, the sign reads, ``It's the
mean-spiritedness, stupid.'' Skilled counter-whiners run to media
mamas sobbing, ``That big bully hit me, and he promised he
wouldn't!''
</P>
<P>
   ``GOP Goes on Attack in New Ad,'' headlines the easily horrified
Washington Post; ``Bush Approves New Attack Ad Mocking Gore,''
tut-tuts The New York Times. Reporters on the campaign trail grill
both candidates fiercely not so much for stories about sharp
disagreement with the opponent as for telltale signs of the great
no-no of negativity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pioneered the whining strategy in the primaries with his
orchestrated offense-taking at John McCain for slamming
evangelicals who were hinting the former captive was crazy; McCain
then retreated into the rictus of a forced smile. But when Bush
tried to repeat this don't-touch-Mr.-Nice-Guy tactic against an
expected Gore onslaught, he ran into world-class,
hand-over-the-heart counter-whining mournfully accusing him of
``changing his tune about changing the tone.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bush is being flayed for his criticism of the Gore
record. When he draws a distinction between what Gore did as vice
president with what he says now, that is described as ``a personal
attack on Gore for hypocrisy.'' Then comes the beauty part for
Democrats: because Bush promised to change the tone and then dared
to cast even lighthearted aspersions on Gore's mistakes and
exaggerations, it is Bush who is attacked for his hypocrisy, mocked
for his mockery, and pilloried endlessly for his unwillingness to
move on.
</P>
<P>
   What is the reason for the orchestrated adoption by both parties
of the childish, nasalized peevishness? The whining manipulation is
driven by the universal opinion of pollsters that most women voters
are tender flowers who cannot bear any expression on a candidate's
face other than earnest concern for their children. Nobody can
stand the heat, say the focus groupies, so get out of the kitchen _
just as all those women voters did.
</P>
<P>
   Because negativity is the supreme no-no, politicians are
persuaded that sunniness is next to godliness and outrage is outre.
That's why Bush is told to point with pride but rarely to view with
alarm. When Bush transgresses by criticizing the hollowed-out state
of our national defense, he risks the withering whining of Gore
about running down our brave men and women in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Thus has the declension of ``all politics is local'' gone from
``all criticism is an attack'' down to ``all attacks are
personal.'' In 2000, amiability is all. Gore has solemnly promised
that he is ``not going to say a single negative thing about my
opponents,'' leaving it to his once-removed surrogates to treat
Texas as a state governed by a despot who starves its poor and
fries its convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, whose convention theme song seemed to be a
Dewey-eyed ``Sheep May Safely Graze,'' thought they could attract
the don't-bicker crowd by constant choruses of ``Mean to Me.'' They
are coming to the Labor Day realization that Bush's technique of
compassionate complaining is being neatly countered by Gore's
systematic sniveling.
</P>
<P>
   To besmear legitimate criticism with the phrase ``personal
attack'' is a trick both campaigns play. Let's not fall for it. The
country would lose if the winner turned out to be the loudest
whiner.

A BIG FINISH GIVES THE JETS A WINNING START 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Curtis Martin wanted to do more this season,
wanted to squeeze more power and strength from his compact body to
fill the chasm in the Jets' offense created by the departure of
receiver Keyshawn Johnson. He had run in the stairwell of his
Florida condominium in preparation for this and then had best
preseason of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Jets gave their fans and opponents a glimpse of what
post-Johnson life will look like in a 20-16 victory over the Green
Bay Packers, and it looked an awful lot like a Martin highlight
reel.
</P>
<P>
   While quarterback Vinny Testaverde took the first half to scrape
off the rust that enveloped him from spare preseason action in his
return from an ankle injury, Martin propelled the Jets. He ran for
110 yards and a touchdown and caught six passes for 34 yards,
including one for the game-winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Packers rallying in the second half behind their
quarterback Brett Farve _ and with the Jets frequently
self-destructing under the weight of penalties and dropped balls _
the Jets needed a spectacular 61-yard reception by Dedric Ward to
set up the winning touchdown with 3 minutes 30 seconds to go and a
leaping interception by safety Victor Green with 1:08 remaining to
preserve Martin's gem.
</P>
<P>
   That had Al Groh celebrating his first victory as the head coach
and Testaverde weeping from the emotion of his comeback from the
devastating Achilles' tendon injury he sustained in last season's
opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said this game had the potential to be one of those games
that creates a team for the rest of the season,'' Groh said. ``This
is one, but a significant one for us, more than just the win. There
was an opportunity for our players' will to crack.''
</P>
<P>
   Was there ever. Testaverde was worried about how he would
perform after having so little work during a preseason when he was
hampered by a jammed toe, and his timing clearly suffered early.
</P>
<P>
   On the third play of the Jets' first drive, Testaverde expected
wide receiver Wayne Chrebet to cut to his left. Instead, Chrebet
ran straight and the Packers' Darren Sharper picked off the pass,
returning it to the 4-yard line. The Packers scored on the next
play on a 4-yard pass from Favre to Tyrone Davis to take a 7-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde completed just 11 of 25 passes for 82 yards in the
first half, so the Jets turned repeatedly to Martin. Of the 15-play
drive that culminated in Martin's 2-yard touchdown run that evened
the score late in the first quarter, Martin was in on 11 plays. And
when Martin missed the last drive of the first half because he had
sprained his left knee, the Jets were unable to pound the ball into
the end zone on three plays from within 11 yards, and settled for a
23-yard field goal by John Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Even Martin, who spoke frequently during training camp of
wanting an expanded role from his already enormous load, wasn't
expecting so much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking about me catching the ball more this
year,'' Martin said. ``I was surprised, but I believe I was ready
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, though, did not look ready in several areas for
stretches of the game. Twice they found themselves in the end zone
with apparent touchdowns, only to have one _ a 7-yard reception by
Chrebet _ called back because of a trip by tackle Jason Fabini and
another brought back because Ward bobbled the ball as he ran
through the end zone. The Jets also had 10 penalties for a total of
75 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets' defense _ which had been questioned for several
shaky preseason performances _ repeatedly kept the Packers out of
the end zone, forcing them to kick three field goals, even as
Farve, who had little preseason work because of elbow tendinitis,
slowly worked his way back to form. In all, the Jets held the
Packers to 211 yards of total offense.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to give Testaverde time to find his groove, and
he found it with Ward, who has been charged with being the No. 2
receiver now that Johnson has gone to Tampa Bay. Testaverde
finished with 23 completions in 44 attempts for 261 yards, and the
most spectacular of those yards came on the play that ultimately
won the game.
</P>
<P>
   With the Packers leading, 16-13, after yet another field goal
midway through the fourth quarter, the Jets took over at their
26-yard line. Three plays later, Ward streaked down the sideline.
This was the same play on which Testaverde had hit Chrebet for a
75-yard touchdown in the preseason against New Orleans. On that
play, Testaverde hit Chrebet over the middle. This time, he saw
Ward going down the sideline. He hit him in stride at the 30 and
Ward ran toward the end zone. He was pushed out at the 2. After two
unsuccessful runs, Martin peeked around a defender to grab
Testaverde's 3-yard touchdown pass that gave the Jets their final
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde would talk later about how the emotion of his
comeback _ coupled with memories of his late father _ sent him
weeping from the field. Testaverde sat at his locker and wept after
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt kind of silly bawling in front of my teammates,''
Testaverde said. ``It hit me all at once. Getting the win, feeling
the presence of my father, wishing he was here, all those things
made it emotional and made it special.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets needed one more special play to secure the victory.
With the Packers driving with less than two minutes to play, the
Jets were backing up. On second-and-3 at the Jets' 35, Farve reared
back and threw to the right sideline. Green leaped and grabbed the
ball at the 9, robbing Bill Schroeder of a possible touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good throw,'' Green said. ``But it was a better
catch.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was a better victory for a team beset by so many
questions entering the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we had character building last year,'' Martin said
of the Jets' disappointing 8-8 season. ``This year, this game,
showed the result of that character building. I'm not saying we're
there. But we're on our way.'' &QL;

FOR LABOR DAY, CAMPAIGN MARATHON BY GORE AND LIBERMAN TARGET UNION
WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Like college students pulling an all-nighter
together, Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Joseph Lieberman Sunday
kicked off a round-the-clock Labor Day campaign swing, designed to
make the case for them as the ticket for the working class.
</P>
<P>
   On the holiday weekend traditionally seen as the start of the
stretch run to the November election, Gore continued the populist
themes on which he has based his general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key difference in this election is we're for the people,
they're for the powerful,'' he told 100 cheering construction
workers inside the unfinished Hyatt Regency hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman set a packed schedule for themselves from
Sunday afternoon through Monday night, a gimmick the campaign
dubbed ``Al and Joe's Hard Day's Night Tour,'' meant to cram in as
many appearances in as many swing-state media markets as possible,
in a little more than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   They were scheduled to fly together from here to Flint, Mich.,
for a late-night meeting with hospital workers, and then to Tampa,
Fla., where they planned a pre-dawn visit to an all-night diner,
followed by breakfast with firefighters and a rally at a firehouse.
From there, they plan to double back north, with Gore taking part
in a Labor Day celebration in Pittsburgh, and ending his day with
another Labor Day event in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman planned to fly from Tampa to Detroit on Monday morning
for an AFL-CIO event, watch a game of the minor league Mud Hens
team in Toledo, Ohio, then wrap up the marathon in Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to think that vice presidential candidates
should have collective bargaining rights,'' Lieberman said of the
pace. ``You know, this guy's working me.''
</P>
<P>
   After stopping at Pat's, a well-known Philadelphia cheesesteak
restaurant, Gore and Lieberman made their way to the dusty
construction site, which leaked water in a driving rain. They
addressed a carefully screened group of construction workers _ some
who work on the project, and other who do not _ and tried out the
campaign's theme for the week, stewardship of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a job done right, have it done by union workers,''
Gore said. ``If you want a job done right on our economic policy,
take a look at the blueprint. There are two competing blueprints.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic plan, he said, would mean a balanced budget,
securing Social Security and Medicare, investing in education, and
targeted tax cuts for the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not accept the blueprint from the other side that
proposes to give away all the surplus in a giant tax cut to the
wealthy at the expense of the middle class, that stops our
prosperity and progress,'' he said. ``We tried the other side's
approach before, and you saw what happened eight years ago, with
the high unemployment and the big deficits.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the workers at the event acknowledged they knew little
about politics or economic policy, beyond the remarkable growth
they have seen under President Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Gore, but it's also the administration that got us to
where construction is these days, where it's booming,'' said Lee
Worthington, 50, an electrician.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Stafford, 21, also an electrician, said, ``Clinton did a
real good job with the economy, and Gore was his VP, so he's the
next-best thing to Clinton if we can't have Clinton. Also, Gore's
pro-union and Bush isn't.''

BUSH ANNOUNCES ALTERNATE PLAN FOR DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Adds 2nd take to earlier story.) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Trying to end questions about his willingness to
debate and turn the tables on his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush on
Sunday announced a schedule of three hand-picked debates that he
wanted to participate in, only one of which is guaranteed to be
broadcast on the three major networks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pointedly challenged Vice President Al Gore to meet him on
these chosen dates and terms. And he tried to turn Gore's response
into a referendum on the vice president's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent has said he will debate anytime, anywhere, and he
has already accepted the debates that I am accepting today,'' Bush
said. ``It's important for the American people to be able to trust
the next president to keep his commitments, and therefore I take Al
Gore at his word that he will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   In making his proposal, Bush was rebuffing a schedule set up by
the Commission on Presidential Debates, which was created by both
parties and has supervised the presidential debates since 1988.
That agency had proposed three debates, all to be broadcast on the
major networks, and Gore has accepted that plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who made his announcement at a hastily called news
conference on the lawn of the governor's mansion Sunday afternoon,
said he would debate Gore on a prime-time edition of NBC's ``Meet
the Press'' next Tuesday, on ``Larry King Live'' on CNN on Oct. 3,
and in St. Louis on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   His idea drew an immediate reaction from Gore, who said he was
``very disappointed,'' and from Gore's campaign manager, who flatly
rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Another Gore aide said that Bush's plan would be acceptable as
long as he agreed to the three commission debates. ``We've already
accepted these,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman. ``We have no
problem with these. We just want to make sure we do the three
presidential ones.''
</P>
<P>
   While the posturing and positioning on Sunday were over debates,
they were also an attempt by each campaign to make a statement
about the character of the opponent. Gore's aides have been
suggesting that Bush is afraid of a prime-time confrontation,
raising the question of whether he is up to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, with his move on Sunday, tried to make this a test of
Gore's character and credibility, because of his frequent promises
to debate Bush anytime, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Gore campaign's reaction to Bush's debate
proposal, Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said, ``We'll be there
and we'll see if Al Gore will keep his word.'' She added, ``After
eight years of prevaricating, after eight years of `no controlling
legal authority' and of debate over what the meaning of `is' is,
the American people deserve a president who will keep his word.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was just beginning his 24-hour Labor Day marathon tour
in Philadelphia, said only that he was ``disappointed.'' Speaking
to reporters outside Pat's Steaks, where he was getting a cheese
steak sandwich, he said: ``I'm very disappointed in this reaction,
because what's needed is to respect the rights of the American
people, to see the debates on all the networks in prime time.'' He
added: ``That's the way it's been done since 1988.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of the commission debates, Gore said: ``It is a bipartisan,
nonpartisan tradition, and it's not about Governor Bush, it's not
about me, it's about the American people and giving the American
people the chance they deserve to make an informed judgment as to
who they want to be the next president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers said that Bush was deliberately trying to shrink
the audience, because unless there was blanket coverage on all five
networks, viewers would likely stray to other programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless these debates are roadblocked, you don't get the kind
of viewership you do with the commission debates,'' said one aide,
noting that Bush's proposal for the NBC debate would bump up
against popular shows like ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire?'' and
``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how much exposure the noncommission debates
proposed by Bush would get or whether the television networks would
agree to broadcast debates held by a rival television news outlet.
Evans said that both NBC and CNN had offered to make their footage
available to other networks.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it clear what format there would be to the one
commission debate that Bush accepted. Evans said that this still
had to be negotiated and that all the Bush campaign had accepted
was the St. Louis venue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said on Sunday that his campaign would agree to two
vice presidential debates, one in Winston-Salem, N.C., sponsored by
the debate commission and another one in a forum yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Bush played video clips of Gore in
appearances with Tim Russert on ``Meet the Press'' in July and on
``Larry King Live'' in March in which he said he would be happy to
appear in debates on their shows. As the videos played, Bush stood
at a lectern tapping his foot.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is generally considered by political strategists to be a
weaker debater than Gore and his aides had been angling for
different formats. On Friday commission officials told aides to
Bush that they would not revise the locations of schedules for the
forums, because the work was too far advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had selected the three formats because they would
be varied and because he wanted one debate on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give the American people an opportunity to see the
candidates in a wide range of locations and formats, from a
free-flowing, spontaneous discussion with Larry King to tough
question-and-answer sessions with a moderator like Tim Russert,''
he said, ``to the more formal and structured setting of the
presidential debate commission. As I have said earlier, my opponent
has already accepted these invitations.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate over debates has simmered, Bush has appeared on
the defensive, looking as if he was seeking a better format for
himself. He and his aides were clearly trying to turn the tables
and use the struggle over debates to focus on Gore's character and
make him look untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   After Bush's news conference, Hughes, his communications
director, reminded reporters that Gore had said he would debate
anytime and anywhere. ``We take him at his word,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And on CNN, before Bush's news conference, Ari Fleischer a Bush
spokesman, also noted that the vice president had been accepting
numerous debate offers, and said, ``I predict to you, they're going
to change their position all of a sudden again.'' Using a favorite
refrain of the Bush campaign, Fleischer said of Gore, ``The vice
president will say one thing and do another.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush issued his challenge hours before flying to Chicago, where
he planned to begin the Labor Day kickoff of the general election
campaign. Polls show the race to be a dead heat or else give Gore a
slight lead. The debates are considered an important forum that
could well help undecided voters to make up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   By offering to hold the first debate next week, Bush portrayed
himself as eager for the confrontation. ``The debates we are
accepting begin early next week because we are eager to compare the
specifics of our plans for more individual freedom, choice and
responsibility, with our opponent's plans for a bigger, more
intrusive Washington bureaucracy that dictates and mandates from
afar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his senior advisers had been saying for weeks that they
wanted to explore options beyond those proposed by the bipartisan
debate commission, because they felt that there could be other
debates of equal or greater value to voters.
</P>
<P>
   But one adviser conceded Sunday night that in selecting debates
that would be moderated by the journalist Tim Russert in one case
and the talk-show host Larry King in another, Bush was guaranteeing
that he would be taking questions from people who had quizzed him
before, and with whom he felt familiarity and comfort. The
commission had not yet announced who would be moderating its
debates.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist in Washington said that by spurning
two of the three commission debates, which would be more
structured, Bush was showing ``that he's concerned about filling
the full two-minute answer'' in a debate with formal time
parameters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry will bail him out,'' said the strategist, referring to
King. ``Larry will keep it moving.'' The strategist added that the
two debates not sponsored by the commission ``aren't real debates.
They're performances on a talk show.''
</P>
<P>
   But several of Bush's advisers said that while journalists were
sure to deride Bush's decision, most voters would care only about
the fact that Bush was debating and would find all the noise
surrounding the negotiations to be meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not stupid. We've been looking at this,'' said one
adviser. ``Nobody knows who the commission is.''

   The wispy young woman paces at the back of the crowd, nodding
incessantly as Al Gore makes another arcane point about the
intricacies of Medicare. She claps tentatively and pumps her fist a
little, almost as if afraid that someone will see. It is not every
27-year-old, after all, who can be driven to ecstasy by a
candidate's pledge to put the Medicare surplus in a lock box.
</P>
<P>
   But Sarah A. Bianchi is not just any twenty-something. In the
five years since she graduated from Harvard, where she shared a
suite in Leverett House with Gore's eldest daughter, Karenna Gore
Schiff, Bianchi has worked as an assistant to the associate
director for health at the Office of Management and Budget and an
assistant director for health policy at the president's domestic
policy council. From there, she became the senior health care
adviser to the vice president and now serves as deputy issues
director of the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore has increasingly built his politics on his passion for
policy, Bianchi has become one of his most visible staff members.
Last week, after pulling near all-nighters to compile briefing
papers on health care, she worked the campaign's press filing
centers doggedly and sat in on conference calls, answering
reporters' questions about the details of Gore's proposals and
taking shots at those of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, at a health care forum in Albuquerque, N.M., a woman
in the audience asked Gore whether his proposal to expand the
federal Children's Health Insurance Program would cover prenatal
care. He had no idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Sarah out there somewhere?'' Gore pleaded, scanning the
crowd. She wasn't, having stayed in a nearby filing center, where
reporters and Gore aides were watching the event on closed-circuit
television.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing her name, Bianchi scurried to his rescue. She assured
the woman, and Gore, that the proposal would restore prenatal care
coverage that had been eliminated several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that Gore's been fighting for for a long
time,'' Bianchi told the woman.
</P>
<P>
   And then Gore, laughing at himself, said, ``As I was saying,
part of my proposal is to restore the coverage for people in that
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the campaign, according to Gore and his
aides, Bianchi has earned a place at the table with a passionate
commitment to social policy, a steel-trap mind for numbers, a quiet
confidence that belies her age, and a determination that policy not
be compromised by politics. If some Gore aides once dismissed her
because of her youth, they now know that she has the vice
president's complete confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in an interview, described Bianchi _ ``Sarah B.'' to the
Gore family _ as ``scary smart,'' and possessing an encyclopedic
expertise on health and welfare policy.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't it make him nervous to place someone so young in a
position of such responsibility and visibility? ``Yes,'' he said,
``it did. For about a week. After that I lost any apprehension at
all. She handles herself like a seasoned pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi, an Atlanta native, has long been enamored of policy. In
college, she wrote a senior thesis about welfare reform in Georgia.
Her father is the founding headmaster of a progressive private
school. Her mother is a developmental psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   She came to know the Gores through her ties to Schiff. But
several Gore aides said she had risen on her merits, and Ronald
Klain, Gore's former chief of staff, said he first hired her
without even knowing of her connections to the Gores.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns, of course, are often populated with bright young
people who are valued for their enthusiasm, their stamina and their
willingness to sleep on futons. Gore's research director, David
Ginsberg, is 25. Michael B. Feldman, a senior adviser, is 31.
Gore's national field director, Donnie Fowler, is 32, as is his
speechwriter, Eli Attie. His press secretary, Chris Lehane, is 33.
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi, a fan of black pinstripes, fuels her days with candy
bars and Diet Cokes. Her cell phone has become an appendage, and
she acknowledges that she has no life outside the campaign. But
youth, she suggests, can be overcome, particularly with a resume as
deep as hers and a long list of mentors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable,'' Bianchi said, ``that I've had a lot of
experiences that, though they were quick, have built on each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   She admitted feeling the doubts of her colleagues in early
strategy sessions, but said that Gore had helped establish her
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there have been meetings with senior staff where they
come in and think, `What is she doing here?''' Bianchi said. ``But
then he'll call on me and say, `Sarah, tell us about that
program.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi's most important role, said several Gore aides, may be
in fighting the temptation to push the campaign's rhetoric beyond
the limits of its policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have definitely been moments when far more important
people than me were advocating a position that I was not,'' she
said. ``You know, it's `Why can't we say it this way?' and I have
to say, `Because it's not true.' And then they say, `Well, can't we
just make it true?' And you have to say, `No.'''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff said that Bianchi was ``not afraid to be the buzz kill''
in staff meetings. ``When there's something that might play well
politically,'' Schiff said, ``Sarah's always the reality check.''

   In putting off a decision on a national missile defense on
Friday, President Clinton said that the earliest such a shield
could be put in place was 2006 or 2007. But the president made a
decision on just one system. What he did not say, and what the
debate over that system has obscured, is that a number of
lesser-known anti-missile weapons might be candidates for the same
job.
</P>
<P>
   They are known as theater missile defense systems, and they are
designed to protect American troops and bases in relatively small
regions of conflict, much as was attempted during the Persian Gulf
War. But some, already under development, could be expanded,
potentially, to protect larger areas and perhaps even the entire
United States, according to analysts both inside and outside the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these systems have yet to be tested for the purpose for
which they were originally designed, let alone for a new, more
ambitious one, and the difficulty of adapting them would range from
making simple changes in their computer software to perhaps adding
sophisticated new sensors or other hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with several of these weapons scheduled to be available
as theater defenses by 2007, the delay announced by Clinton is
bringing them much closer scrutiny and has reopened debate over
whether these systems might themselves eventually provide some form
of national defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does debunk the argument of the Pentagon that if you want
missile defense soon, your only choice is the missile defense
system they've been pushing,'' said Dr. Michael O'Hanlon, a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes military
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the plan Clinton has delayed, which would shoot down
warheads as they descended in space, many of the so-called theater
defenses use interceptors, lasers or fragmentation explosives fired
from ships or airplanes that could maneuver relatively close to
small countries like North Korea, whose missile program has been
cited as one reason for needing a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these theater systems are currently designed to shoot
down short- and medium-range missiles in midflight or on their way
down to a target, but proponents say they might be adapted to
destroy the kinds of faster, long-range missiles that would be the
object of a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   This could be done by adding long-range sensors that would
potentially give theater systems enough time to destroy missiles in
midflight, or by targeting missiles soon after they were launched,
in the so-called boost phase. Other theater defenses have been
specifically designed to work in the boost phase.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of boost-phase interception was even endorsed this
summer by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who suggested that
Russia might cooperate with the United States in developing it.
Russia has opposed a national missile shield, arguing that it would
threaten to undermine its arsenal and violate the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty the United States signed with the former Soviet
Union in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not objected to theater systems that work in the
boost phase. One reason is that because of Russia's large size,
interceptors cannot be positioned close enough to attack Russian
rockets while they are being launched, and thus Moscow does not
consider such a system a threat to its land-based arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   China, however, in addition to its objections to a national
defense system, does see theater defenses as a threat because they
could theoretically be used to protect Taiwan and Japan, its
potential adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, theater defenses have not generated the
same kind of debate at home or abroad as the Pentagon's idea for a
national missile defense, because the theater defenses have not so
far been designed to offer the kind of blanket protection from
missile attack that would challenge existing theories of arms
control, which are based on mutual vulnerability. Nor do they
violate the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   This would undoubtedly change if they were expanded to protect
the whole of the United States, and any defense system that did so
would probably violate the ABM treaty, according to arms control
experts. Some critics have seen these theater systems as an attempt
to bring in a national missile defense through the back door.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Friday, Clinton said that Russia had agreed to
cooperate with the United States ``in areas such as theater missile
defense,'' but he did not mention the systems' wider potential.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia might agree to changing the ABM treaty to allow for
adapting to broader use a theater missile defense system that it
does not view as a direct threat, said Dr. Harold Brown, secretary
of defense in the Carter administration. ``This is a way of
possibly preserving the ABM treaty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no clear, technical distinction between the theater
and national missile defense systems,'' said Dr. Dean Wilkening,
director of the science program at Stanford University's Center for
International Security and Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a Navy system that would shoot down missiles with
shipboard interceptors, Wilkening said, ``they are well down the
road to being fully capable national missile defense systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The $5.1 billion that the United States will spend on missile
defense in fiscal year 2001 will be equally divided between theater
defenses and national missile defense, according to the nonpartisan
Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   That contrasts starkly with the situation in the 1980s, when
expenditures on national defenses dominated spending.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the theater programs _ which have names like the Theater
High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), the Patriot Advanced
Capability-3, and the Navy Theater Wide and Navy Area defenses _
use interceptors fired from ships or trailers that attempt to ram
an enemy missile or explode near it.
</P>
<P>
   Of those systems, extensive testing has already been done for
the new Patriot, scheduled to be put in the field starting next
year. Unlike the version used in the Gulf war, which exploded near
descending missiles, this one aims to ram them. THAAD has also been
extensively tested and is expected to be deployed by 2007. Current
plans have the Navy Theater Wide defense available for emergency
use in 2007 and fully deployed three years later, while the
shorter-range Navy Area defense should be ready sooner.
</P>
<P>
   One program that is receiving generous funding but little
publicity is development of a powerful laser to shoot down
ballistic missiles from a platform in space, intended for use by
2013.
</P>
<P>
   The Airborne Laser program, run by the Air Force, aims to put a
similar laser aboard a modified Boeing 747 and begin shooting down
test missiles by 2003. Seven planes are expected to be in operation
by 2009, according to a spokesman for the program, if Congress
provides the money. The laser systems could be designed to work as
either national or theater defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Some proponents of adapting theater defenses favor using them in
the boost phase, since decoys like balloons or fake warheads
separate from the missile at higher altitudes and make the job of
finding and shooting down the real warhead that much harder.
Missile defenses have been compared to shooting a bullet with a
bullet, and the boost phase approach in effect means using a bullet
to shoot the gun.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Others insist that this is not the only way, and that the
protection that midcourse interceptions could offer against large
or inaccessible countries, like Russia, China or Iran, would be
indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, those who would use the theater missile defenses, or
TMD, to replace the Pentagon's favored system, say that their
mobility and flexibility make them a better choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A national missile defense capability that evolves from TMD
will probably be cheaper, better contribute to defense against both
long- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, and allow for more
effective growth in capability as the threat increases,'' wrote
John Deutch, Brown and John P. White in the summer issue of Foreign
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch, a former director of the CIA and deputy defense
secretary, and White, a lecturer in public policy at Harvard's John
F. Kennedy School of Government and a former deputy defense
secretary, both served under Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On the conservative side of the political spectrum, which has
long supported expansive national missile defenses, enthusiasm for
theater defenses runs high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sea-based, or mobile, you can move and align your forces based
on the threat,'' said J.D. Williams, a retired vice admiral and
former director of naval warfare who has studied the concept for
both the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization and the
conservative Heritage Foundation. He said that land-based defenses
could be added if the funding was available.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of long-range sensors, Williams added, ``one
ship could take care of about a third of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely what additional improvements might be necessary to
convert these systems into a national defense by intercepting
missiles in midflight is still not entirely clear, Wilkening of
Stanford said, since most of them are still under development and
recent amendments to the 1972 ABM Treaty, which have not been
ratified by Congress, prohibit testing theater defenses against
intercontinental ballistic missiles directly.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most important element needed to turn those theater
defenses into potential national defenses are long-range sensors,
said Dr. David Wright, a senior staff scientist at the Union of
Concerned Scientists and a researcher at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   With that sensor technology, which the United States already
plans to deploy in space and possibly on the ground over the next
decade, the Navy system ``starts to look like an interceptor which
could, in principle, shoot down strategic missiles,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of converting theater systems say that the change would
be far more difficult _ requiring, for example, interceptors vastly
faster and more maneuverable than the theater systems could muster.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the sensors carried aboard the interceptors for homing in
on a target might have to be improved. Wright pointed out that the
system would have to be able to discriminate missiles from the
decoys that would surely accompany an enemy attack.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said that enthusiasts of conversion
were overstating their case. ``They seem to imply that you don't
need to go the NMD route that this administration is taking,'' the
official said, referring to national missile defense. ``There are
flaws in these glib statements and analyses.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the administration has no plans to convert theater
defenses into national defenses, the official said. ``It would be
very difficult for the United States, as a practical matter, to
develop a system and label it as one thing with the intent of
surreptitiously being able to fulfill a completely different
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Pentagon official dismissed the notion that the
theater systems have intrinsic technical limitations, saying that
even the most basic Navy Theater Wide system could intercept
missiles while they were being launched. Moreover, upgrades to the
interceptor planned for that program would allow for the rockets to
be intercepted in space, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these systems can have applicability to both theater
and national missile defense,'' said Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, a
spokesman for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, who
agreed that the systems would require modifications for an expanded
role. ``It just depends on which direction the nation wants to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Modified theater defenses would not be the only way to create
such a defense. According to some analysts, the simplest and
cheapest solution would be to start from scratch with faster
interceptors launched from military cargo ships, a strategy
advocated by Dr. Richard L. Garwin, a physicist at the Council on
Foreign Relations, or from airplanes, an approach that Wilkening
has studied.
</P>
<P>
   But the Air Force is developing a system, called the Airborne
Laser, based on an entirely different technology that is targeted
toward the boost phase. An eight-year, $1.6 billion development
program that aims for a missile shoot-down in 2003, the system is
expected to include a laser mounted in the nose of a converted
Boeing 747.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force is designing the laser to destroy short- and
medium-range missiles while they are being launched by rupturing
their metal skin. If the system works _ in tests, a ground-based
laser using similar technology recently destroyed a small rocket in
flight _ it could potentially be used against intercontinental
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``ICBMs are actually an easier target in some ways, because
they're typically made of thinner material than the Scuds, and they
also burn longer,'' said Col. David Harrell, deputy director of the
Air Borne Laser system program office at Kirtland Air Force Base in
New Mexico. Scuds are Russian-made missiles that Iraq used in the
Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The laser program will receive $148 million in fiscal year 2001,
and would cost $2 billion to $3 billion through its first planned
missile shootdown from space in 2013, said Dr. Douglas P. Crawford,
the space-based laser project integrator at the Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization.
</P>
<P>
   If it works, the laser could be used against either theater or
national threats, Crawford said. (This is the only boost-phase
defense that would threaten Russia directly since the laser could
be fired from a distance.) He added that the technology has been
receiving a much more positive reception than it had for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Star Wars' moniker was a term of derision through the
late 80s and early '90s,'' he said, ``but I haven't heard it
recently.''

FOREIGN WORKERS AT HIGHEST LEVEL IN SEVEN DECADES
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 5th graf, ``Immigrants are ..., to correct first name to
Demetrios.) 
By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As employers clamor for more foreign-born workers and as tens of
thousands of Mexicans slip across the border each year, the
percentage of immigrant workers in the nation's labor force has
climbed to its highest level in seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   New figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the
number of immigrant workers jumped to 15.7 million last year, up 17
percent from three years earlier. Immigration experts estimate that
nearly 5 million of these workers are illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   This influx _ immigrants now make up 12 percent of the nation's
workers _ is having profound effects on the work force and the
economy, helping to hold down wages in unskilled occupations and
giving many companies the employees they need to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants dominate dozens of job categories, especially
arduous, low-paying ones: poultry plant workers, meat packers,
gardeners, hotel maids, seamstresses, restaurant workers,
building-demolition workers, and fruit and vegetable pickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigrants are now a critical part of the labor force across
the board,'' said Demetrios Papademetriou, co-director of
international migration policy at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace. ``We are into a new world of immigrants
basically spreading throughout the economy. This is something that
is going to continue and intensify.''
</P>
<P>
   With a jobless rate of 4.1 percent in August, near its lowest
point in 40 years, the debate about immigrant workers has shifted
considerably from five years ago, when many politicians called for
more restrictive policies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, software companies, farmers, hotel chains and other
employers desperate for more workers are pressuring Congress to
enact legislation that would admit hundreds of thousands of
additional immigrants each year.
</P>
<P>
   But some groups, most notably labor unions and engineers'
associations, are fighting such an easing, fearing that it will
depress wages and cost jobs for American workers. At the same time,
unions have softened its once hard-line stance toward illegal
immigrants already in the country, as they seek to unionize them.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and demographers see a continuing surge in immigrant
workers unless there is a major economic downturn. Under existing
quotas, about 800,000 immigrants enter the nation legally each
year. An estimated 300,000 enter illegally.
</P>
<P>
   These workers range from supermarket deliverymen who often
receive an illegally low $3 an hour, far less than the minimum wage
of $5.15 an hour, to $100,000-a-year software developers from
India.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of immigrant workers has soared, Americans are
voicing less anger and anxiety about immigration than in the
mid-1990s. The reason, political analysts said, is that the
economic boom and low jobless rate have reduced economic
insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, politicians who led the attack against immigrants
_ with measures to cut government benefits to the children of
illegal immigrants _ have seen their efforts backfire, especially
in California. There, the fast-growing Hispanic and Asian
populations have moved to punish anti-immigrant politicians in the
voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a very robust economy and full employment, and that
always changes the terms of debate on immigration,'' said James P.
Smith, an economist with the Rand Corp. who was chairman of a 1997
National Academy of Sciences study on the effects of immigration.
``When there are plenty of jobs around, the finger pointing that
goes on about immigration goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in some places, like Farmingville, N.Y., residents have
complained that dozens of immigrant day laborers who assemble in
streets and parking lots each morning to be picked up by employers
are an unsightly horde who litter, commit crimes and drive down
property values. At the same time, many Americans feel thankful
that the stream of immigrants has provided them with affordable
gardeners, nannies, housekeepers _ even manicurists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans rely very much on low-cost immigrant labor to
maintain their living standards, which means everything from lawn
care to inexpensive agricultural production to the construction
business,'' Papademetriou said.
</P>
<P>
   One unhappy result of the influx of immigrants is a wave of
violations of the nation's labor laws. Unscrupulous employers often
refuse to provide workers' compensation or pay the minimum wage or
time-and-half overtime to immigrants required to work 70 to 80
hours a week. Some female immigrants complain that their bosses
sexually harass them, and they fear that if they protest, their
bosses will report them to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   One such immigrant, Silverio Otero, a grocery store worker on
New York's Lower East Side, complained that for a long time he was
paid $240 a week even though the storeowner required him to work 72
hours a week. That came to $3.33 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't treat us very nice,'' said Otero, a 29-year-old
native of Mexico who will receive $7,000 in back wages because of a
settlement arranged by Eliot Spitzer, the New York state attorney
general. ``They took advantage of us because we were immigrants and
they didn't think we would speak up.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from a coalition of industries that were pushing
Congress to grant several hundred thousand more temporary immigrant
worker visas each year said they are not looking for
easy-to-exploit workers, but simply for workers. Among the groups
pressing for such legislation are the National Restaurant
Association and the American Hotel and Motel Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it easier for employers who are facing
shortages to hire foreign workers,'' said John F. Gay, co-chairman
of the industry group, the Essential Worker Immigration Coalition.
``We've tried everything we could think of to bring more American
workers into the labor force, but with this booming economy it
hasn't been enough. It's not a question of finding cheaper bodies.
It's a question of finding bodies.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other powerful industries are making similar pleas. The
agricultural industry wants Congress to allow in more foreigners to
plant and pick produce. Computer and software companies have asked
that more three-year visas be granted each year to foreigners with
high-technology expertise. In 1998, Congress expanded that program
to allow in 115,000 workers, up from 65,000, and now the
high-technology industry wants that quota lifted to more than
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many labor groups, including the United Farm Workers and the
AFL-CIO, are fighting these proposals. The unions argue that
workers brought in under such programs drive down wages and
essentially are easy-to-exploit captives restricted to working for
one company.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, mindful of Silicon Valley's campaign
contributions and organized labor's political muscle, has signaled
that it favors increasing the number of high-technology visas, but
not those for unskilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high technology, we are now trying to meet a real spot
shortage,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. ``But when you talk
about jobs in the hotel industry and other areas, there's still a
lot of untapped employment potential in the nation, and I believe
that we can meet those demands with Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   This debate is influenced heavily by the way immigration creates
different winners and losers. American businesses, ranging from
motels and lettuce farms to corporate giants like Intel and Apple,
benefit from the influx of immigrants. But the National Academy of
Sciences study found that the flood of immigrants, especially
undocumented, unskilled workers from Mexico and the rest of Latin
America, has pushed down wages for native-born workers with less
than a high school education by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That study found that immigration increased the size of the
nation's economy by $10 billion _ a tiny amount in a country with a
gross domestic product of nearly $10 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real impact of immigration is not to increase the size of
the pie, but to redistribute the pie,'' said George J. Borjas, a
Harvard University professor of public policy. ``If you happen to
have the type of job that competes with immigrants, you're often
hurt, but if you're a company or an upper-middle-class person who
hires immigrants, then you benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Many economists say the large immigrant work force has played a
major role in making the American economy one of the most
competitive industrial nations in the world, helping keep wages
well below those of industrial countries like Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, one of the biggest changes involving immigrant
workers is the labor union's softening stance on illegal
immigrants. The AFL-CIO has called for repealing the law that bars
employers from hiring illegal immigrants _ a law organized labor
lobbied for in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   While still favoring strict limits on the number of immigrants
entering the country, the AFL-CIO has reversed itself by calling
for the granting of legal status to hundreds of thousands of
illegal immigrants. Giving them legal status, union officials said,
would make it harder for employers to exploit them and hold down
their wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a recognition of how immigrants are being
discriminated against and of the indignities they suffer,'' said
John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO. ``We saw that the
present immigration policies weren't working and that it was time
to call for a fairer policy that treats these people in a more
humane way.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of this shift, many unions that once sought to keep
immigrants out of their fields now are eager to organize those
workers.

MEMORY OF DERRICK THOMAS NOT ENOUGH TO CARRY CHIEFS TO VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY COVITZ  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Edith Morgan greeted and hugged each Chiefs
player who emerged from the tunnel and onto the lush Arrowhead
Stadium turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all my sons now,'' said Morgan, the mother of the late
Derrick Thomas, whose memory was celebrated before Sunday
afternoon's season opener against the Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `DT is going to be out there with you,' '' Morgan
said. `` `Play the game as if he's there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs played their first regular-season game since Thomas,
the cornerstone of the franchise for 11 years, died in February
from injuries resulting from an automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, the Chiefs lost to the Colts 27-14, snapping
an NFL-longest streak of 11 straight victories in home openers, or
every opener since Thomas joined the team as its No. 1 draft pick
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of Thomas permeated the thoughts of the players from
both teams, as well as the crowd of 78,357, who were greeted with
temperatures only in the 90s and a second-quarter rain shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Derrick was with us today and gave us that cloud
cover,'' said Chiefs linebacker Lew Bush. ``We were expecting 105
degrees, but we had some great conditions to play out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the kickoff, Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt and
president//general manager Carl Peterson presented Morgan with 11
red and yellow roses, symbolic of the 11 seasons Thomas spent with
the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by a four-minute, 20-second tribute to Thomas
on the video board showing Thomas sacking John Elway and Steve
Young, delivering a speech at the Vietnam Memorial in Washington,
handing out holiday dinners to families in Kansas City, being
honored as the 1000th Point of Light by President George Bush, and
riding in the cockpit of a fighter jet in honor of his father,
Robert, an Air Force captain who was shot down and killed in 1972
during a mission in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more to today than a football game because of
the unfortunate passing of one of the most noted players in this
team's history, and the great tribute they had today makes it more
special,'' said former Chiefs linebacker Willie Lanier, a member of
the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   After a moment of silence, Tami Hart, a friend of Thomas',
performed the national anthem, highlighted by a flyover featuring a
B-52 aircraft from the Air Force base in Barksdale, La.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who was accompanied by her six children, had attended
the two home exhibition games but was not prepared for Sunday's
outpouring of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the Chiefs loved him, I knew that the city loved him,
but the love and the support they've shown today has been great,''
said Morgan, wearing a white T-shirt emblazoned with a red No. 58
helmet and the words ``Your Eternal Flame Will Burn in Our Hearts
Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those on the sidelines before the game were Marty
Schottenheimer, the Chiefs' head coach during Thomas' first 10
seasons, and former running back Marcus Allen. Both now work for
television networks but wanted to be in Kansas City for this
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The realization that Derrick is gone is always revisited when
you see that,'' Schottenheimer said of the video tribute. ``Being
here and knowing it was going to be foremost in a lot of the fans'
minds, it was good to be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' former teammates clearly were inspired at the start of
the game. Middle linebacker Marvcus Patton stopped the Colts' first
drive by ripping a fumble from running back Edgerrin James, and
linebacker Donnie Edwards blunted the next drive with an
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed Derrick's sacks,'' Edwards said of Thomas' ability
to get to the quarterback. ``He was always coming up with the
sack.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts were equally moved by the passion in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Colts linebacker Cornelius Bennett, a teammate of Thomas' at the
University of Alabama, provided tickets to Sunday's game for 200
students from the Third and Long Foundation, the program Thomas
initiated to promote literacy among inner-city children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew coming into the game what they were doing,'' Bennett
said of the pre-game ceremonies. ``I hope it's not the last time
the fans think about Derrick. That's why I did this, as far his
foundation is concerned, because we have to keep his dream alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the focus turned to football, and the Colts pulled
away by scoring 13 unanswered points in the fourth quarter. The
13-point margin tied for the Chiefs' worst home-opening loss since
1977. The Chiefs have lost just six home openers since a 23-7 loss
to San Diego in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played here several times before, and it's one of the few
times I've come in here and won,'' said Bennett, recalling 33-6 and
23-7 losses his Super Bowl-bound Buffalo teams absorbed in the
early 1990s. ``It's very special to win a game here.''
</P>
<P>
   The only consolation to Chiefs fans was the cooler-than-expected
weather. Activity at the first-aid station was light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overcast skies were a godsend for us,'' said Gene Barr,
director of security for Arrowhead Stadium. ``The temperature is
only 91 degrees, and we've treated less than a dozen people.''

FOREIGN WORKERS AT HIGHEST LEVEL IN SEVEN DECADES
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 5th graf, ``Immigrants are ..., to correct first name to
Demetrios.) 
By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As employers clamor for more foreign-born workers and as tens of
thousands of Mexicans slip across the border each year, the
percentage of immigrant workers in the nation's labor force has
climbed to its highest level in seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   New figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the
number of immigrant workers jumped to 15.7 million last year, up 17
percent from three years earlier. Immigration experts estimate that
nearly 5 million of these workers are illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   This influx _ immigrants now make up 12 percent of the nation's
workers _ is having profound effects on the work force and the
economy, helping to hold down wages in unskilled occupations and
giving many companies the employees they need to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants dominate dozens of job categories, especially
arduous, low-paying ones: poultry plant workers, meat packers,
gardeners, hotel maids, seamstresses, restaurant workers,
building-demolition workers, and fruit and vegetable pickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigrants are now a critical part of the labor force across
the board,'' said Demetrios Papademetriou, co-director of
international migration policy at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace. ``We are into a new world of immigrants
basically spreading throughout the economy. This is something that
is going to continue and intensify.''
</P>
<P>
   With a jobless rate of 4.1 percent in August, near its lowest
point in 40 years, the debate about immigrant workers has shifted
considerably from five years ago, when many politicians called for
more restrictive policies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, software companies, farmers, hotel chains and other
employers desperate for more workers are pressuring Congress to
enact legislation that would admit hundreds of thousands of
additional immigrants each year.
</P>
<P>
   But some groups, most notably labor unions and engineers'
associations, are fighting such an easing, fearing that it will
depress wages and cost jobs for American workers. At the same time,
unions have softened its once hard-line stance toward illegal
immigrants already in the country, as they seek to unionize them.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and demographers see a continuing surge in immigrant
workers unless there is a major economic downturn. Under existing
quotas, about 800,000 immigrants enter the nation legally each
year. An estimated 300,000 enter illegally.
</P>
<P>
   These workers range from supermarket deliverymen who often
receive an illegally low $3 an hour, far less than the minimum wage
of $5.15 an hour, to $100,000-a-year software developers from
India.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of immigrant workers has soared, Americans are
voicing less anger and anxiety about immigration than in the
mid-1990s. The reason, political analysts said, is that the
economic boom and low jobless rate have reduced economic
insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, politicians who led the attack against immigrants
_ with measures to cut government benefits to the children of
illegal immigrants _ have seen their efforts backfire, especially
in California. There, the fast-growing Hispanic and Asian
populations have moved to punish anti-immigrant politicians in the
voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a very robust economy and full employment, and that
always changes the terms of debate on immigration,'' said James P.
Smith, an economist with the Rand Corp. who was chairman of a 1997
National Academy of Sciences study on the effects of immigration.
``When there are plenty of jobs around, the finger pointing that
goes on about immigration goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in some places, like Farmingville, N.Y., residents have
complained that dozens of immigrant day laborers who assemble in
streets and parking lots each morning to be picked up by employers
are an unsightly horde who litter, commit crimes and drive down
property values. At the same time, many Americans feel thankful
that the stream of immigrants has provided them with affordable
gardeners, nannies, housekeepers _ even manicurists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans rely very much on low-cost immigrant labor to
maintain their living standards, which means everything from lawn
care to inexpensive agricultural production to the construction
business,'' Papademetriou said.
</P>
<P>
   One unhappy result of the influx of immigrants is a wave of
violations of the nation's labor laws. Unscrupulous employers often
refuse to provide workers' compensation or pay the minimum wage or
time-and-half overtime to immigrants required to work 70 to 80
hours a week. Some female immigrants complain that their bosses
sexually harass them, and they fear that if they protest, their
bosses will report them to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   One such immigrant, Silverio Otero, a grocery store worker on
New York's Lower East Side, complained that for a long time he was
paid $240 a week even though the storeowner required him to work 72
hours a week. That came to $3.33 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't treat us very nice,'' said Otero, a 29-year-old
native of Mexico who will receive $7,000 in back wages because of a
settlement arranged by Eliot Spitzer, the New York state attorney
general. ``They took advantage of us because we were immigrants and
they didn't think we would speak up.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from a coalition of industries that were pushing
Congress to grant several hundred thousand more temporary immigrant
worker visas each year said they are not looking for
easy-to-exploit workers, but simply for workers. Among the groups
pressing for such legislation are the National Restaurant
Association and the American Hotel and Motel Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it easier for employers who are facing
shortages to hire foreign workers,'' said John F. Gay, co-chairman
of the industry group, the Essential Worker Immigration Coalition.
``We've tried everything we could think of to bring more American
workers into the labor force, but with this booming economy it
hasn't been enough. It's not a question of finding cheaper bodies.
It's a question of finding bodies.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other powerful industries are making similar pleas. The
agricultural industry wants Congress to allow in more foreigners to
plant and pick produce. Computer and software companies have asked
that more three-year visas be granted each year to foreigners with
high-technology expertise. In 1998, Congress expanded that program
to allow in 115,000 workers, up from 65,000, and now the
high-technology industry wants that quota lifted to more than
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many labor groups, including the United Farm Workers and the
AFL-CIO, are fighting these proposals. The unions argue that
workers brought in under such programs drive down wages and
essentially are easy-to-exploit captives restricted to working for
one company.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, mindful of Silicon Valley's campaign
contributions and organized labor's political muscle, has signaled
that it favors increasing the number of high-technology visas, but
not those for unskilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high technology, we are now trying to meet a real spot
shortage,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. ``But when you talk
about jobs in the hotel industry and other areas, there's still a
lot of untapped employment potential in the nation, and I believe
that we can meet those demands with Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   This debate is influenced heavily by the way immigration creates
different winners and losers. American businesses, ranging from
motels and lettuce farms to corporate giants like Intel and Apple,
benefit from the influx of immigrants. But the National Academy of
Sciences study found that the flood of immigrants, especially
undocumented, unskilled workers from Mexico and the rest of Latin
America, has pushed down wages for native-born workers with less
than a high school education by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That study found that immigration increased the size of the
nation's economy by $10 billion _ a tiny amount in a country with a
gross domestic product of nearly $10 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real impact of immigration is not to increase the size of
the pie, but to redistribute the pie,'' said George J. Borjas, a
Harvard University professor of public policy. ``If you happen to
have the type of job that competes with immigrants, you're often
hurt, but if you're a company or an upper-middle-class person who
hires immigrants, then you benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Many economists say the large immigrant work force has played a
major role in making the American economy one of the most
competitive industrial nations in the world, helping keep wages
well below those of industrial countries like Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, one of the biggest changes involving immigrant
workers is the labor union's softening stance on illegal
immigrants. The AFL-CIO has called for repealing the law that bars
employers from hiring illegal immigrants _ a law organized labor
lobbied for in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   While still favoring strict limits on the number of immigrants
entering the country, the AFL-CIO has reversed itself by calling
for the granting of legal status to hundreds of thousands of
illegal immigrants. Giving them legal status, union officials said,
would make it harder for employers to exploit them and hold down
their wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a recognition of how immigrants are being
discriminated against and of the indignities they suffer,'' said
John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO. ``We saw that the
present immigration policies weren't working and that it was time
to call for a fairer policy that treats these people in a more
humane way.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of this shift, many unions that once sought to keep
immigrants out of their fields now are eager to organize those
workers.

DRIVER TOOK DISABLED MEN ON UNAUTHORIZED JOURNEY THAT TURNED
FATAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY and MIKE RICE  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Two developmentally disabled men who died
Saturday in a sweltering station wagon in Swope Park should never
have been taken there, according to the executive director of the
organization that housed them.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are investigating the incident, in which a
26-year-old caregiver took Steven Warren, 34, and Michael O'Neal,
55, from their group home to the park. Warren and O'Neal had lived
at the Community Living Opportunities Inc. group home at 9322 W.
50th Terrace in Merriam, Kan., for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trip to that area was unauthorized,'' said Michael
Strouse, executive director of Community Living Opportunities.
``The driver was acting independently.''
</P>
<P>
   Strouse said the two were supposed to have been taken on a short
trip to a fast-food restaurant in Johnson County, Kan., and
shouldn't have been taken anywhere near Swope Park in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies on Sunday showed that they died of heat-related
causes. No charges had been filed in the case Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of work to do in this case, a lot of interviews
to do,'' said Paul Morrison, Johnson County prosecutor. ``We're
going to check out the caregiver's story. We're going to be waiting
on lab results for a while. Both of the gentlemen were on
medication because of their physical problems, which can become a
factor in this kind of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Strouse said both men were severely disabled and were taking
medication that could cause adverse reactions in extreme heat. One
had a history of seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the hottest day of the year, with the temperature
reaching 106 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The caregiver said he left the men in the station wagon in the
park for a short time. When he returned, he found them unresponsive
in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   He then drove them to Shawnee Mission Medical Center's emergency
room about 5 p.m. A doctor there declared the men dead.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear why the caregiver took the men to Shawnee Mission
Medical Center, about 10 miles west of Swope Park, rather than to
Research Medical Center, just a few blocks from the park.
</P>
<P>
   Strouse said that during extreme weather conditions, such as
Saturday's, employees were to follow procedures on whether
residents can be outside and for how long.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know how long the men were in the station
wagon.
</P>
<P>
   The driver has been employed by Community Living Opportunities
for three months but had worked earlier in caretaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also had a career in the military and came here with good
references,'' Strouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Agency employees undergo extensive certification training and a
stringent background check, Strouse said. The driver had no
criminal background or history of incompetence and was fully
trained for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, a caretaker from another Community Living
Opportunities group home in Johnson County disappeared on a Friday
with three developmentally disabled women.
</P>
<P>
   They left the home to run errands but were found 31 hours later
in their van at Prospect and Independence avenues in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   In that incident, Robert L. Newsome was charged with three
felony counts of mistreatment of a dependent adult and two
misdemeanor counts of theft.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Strouse said, Newsome had more than a decade of
experience in social services and had impeccable references when he
was hired two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It's common for caretakers to take group home residents out for
activities, said Mark Elmore, executive director for Johnson County
Developmental Supports, which coordinates care and activity
programs for groups such as Community Living Opportunities that
help the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   But staff members must understand how important it is to watch
their charges closely, Elmore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really bad,'' he said of the deaths. ``My first
thoughts are with the families. The tragedy of this is that it
makes no sense. It's an outing gone bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Community Living Opportunities Inc. has several group homes in
Johnson County and operates a recycling center at 80th Street and
Metcalf Avenue, where some of the residents work. The agency was
founded in 1977 by John and Betty Pelot, whose son, Jimmy, was
autistic and didn't speak.

STUDENTS FROM CHINA VISIT KANSAS CITY TO STUDY LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Liu Ze has been in the United States just
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Liu, who goes by the name Derek, already sees a big
difference from his native Beijing. Here, when he walks around the
city, drivers let him cross in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   They even wave and smile when they do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a king,'' he said while talking about life as an
American college student. He sat in the office of professor Patrick
Randolph at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Liu is one of five Chinese citizens studying law this year at
UMKC.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph began teaching law in China seven years ago and the
last two years has persuaded Chinese students to come to Kansas
City to study law. The students get scholarship aid to study at
UMKC. They also have received some help from law school alumni and
professors.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Chinese students want to learn about the American
legal system because, as China's political and economic systems
become more open, the legal system there is changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more China understands and admires about America, the
better off we'll be,'' Randolph said.
</P>
<P>
   But as the students are learning about American law, they also
are learning about American life.
</P>
<P>
   When Zhang Xi, who goes by Simon, arrived in Kansas City last
year, he couldn't believe how mobile everyone was.
</P>
<P>
   He's used to a country where most people get around on bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he drives, too.
</P>
<P>
   Liu, who will be here one year to earn a master of laws degree,
is amazed that Americans form lines and stay in them without
cutting in and without arguing.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't happen in China.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes Americans' pragmatism. Many Chinese do a lot of
abstract thinking, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in America it's ``Let's do something, not hot air or just
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The students want to learn the American life while they're here,
but they also hope they can expose American students to Chinese
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is the unknown (in America),'' said Liu. ``It is
associated with evil. But now they can see Chinese people; they
eat, drink. They go to the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu laughed at his own remark, and Zhang joined in.
</P>
<P>
   Another Chinese student, Shen Fang, has realized how different
the countries' educational systems are.
</P>
<P>
   ``School is the best thing (for me) here, but also the worst
thing,'' she said, adding that she thinks American students work
much harder in school than students at many Chinese universities.
</P>
<P>
   She said China and America, although enemies in the past, have
much to share. She said China practically copied U.S. law when it
recently created a securities law.
</P>
<P>
   And the way the Chinese legal system uses mediation, rather than
constant bickering, could help the U.S. system, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Liu agreed: ``If Americans are humble enough, they can learn
from other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, wearing a shirt that said ``Washington, D.C., 2000'' and
depicted the U.S. Capitol and the American flag, said he wants to
learn American law because as China changes its economy, the legal
system will change, too.
</P>
<P>
   For example, as the country moves toward having more personal
property, real estate law needs to be developed and practiced.
</P>
<P>
   With increased trade and business ties with other countries and
global corporations, lawyers in China will need to know how
America's legal system works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be theearly bird,'' said Zhang, who plans to stay at
UMKC three years to earn a juris doctor degree. ``I come here and
study the law and hope I can use it in my home country.''

YEARS LATER, KOREAN WAR VETERAN CLAIMS HIS BRONZE STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN SHULTZ  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ Nothing can stop Fred Swearngin, or so
he's been told.
</P>
<P>
   Not the howling artillery shells North Korean troops tried to
drop in his hip pocket, nor the brain aneurysm that cut short his
combat time.
</P>
<P>
   There's a statement the 71-year-old throws out, one he says he
uses a lot and has heard from his friends just as frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky,'' he said. ``I was shot at _ I was shot at, but I
didn't get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   And after ducking the bullets, smaller ones on the field and a
big one at a hospital, he left the Army and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Swearngin, of Overland Park, got some closure to his
year of military life.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight years after his honorable discharge, Swearngin _ the
former military policeman, the former Prairie Village police
patrolman, the current security guard _ was presented the medals he
had won for his service in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   It was a handful, but the prize of the bunch was the Bronze
Star, awarded for bravery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952 Swearngin had passed up the star and the chance for the
awards for his service.
</P>
<P>
   No one took them to his bed at Walter Reed Army Medical Center
in Washington, D.C., where he recovered from brain surgery, and he
didn't bother to seek them out.
</P>
<P>
   He left the promise of the awards, outlined on his discharge
papers, in a safe-deposit box. He tried to leave much of the war
there with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of went on with life,'' he said. ``I didn't pursue
it.I've never said much about the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to talk about it. I lost a lot of my best
friends. One of my best buddies had his arm blown off. They
actually called (the war) a police actionbut that sure looked like
a war to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago he broke his silence. Swearngin pulled his Form
DD-214 from the box and wrote Washington for his medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the sad feelings now _ I'm a happy individual,''
he said. ``I feel that I did my small portion.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is still quiet when asked about the war, talking only in
short bursts.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about how he, at 22, was at Heartbreak Ridge, the
bloody battle over a seven-mile stretch of strategically placed
hills, and fought in the slow reclaiming of Seoul, both in 1951. He
talks about the artillery trucks he directed toward the front that
returned hauling bodies.
</P>
<P>
   He was a combat MP with the 25th Division, he said, not unlike a
traffic officer working under artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had very little protection,'' he said of the combat MPs.
``When troops are advancing, you're the first one out there. When
they pull back, you're the last.''
</P>
<P>
   No bullet struck him; no shell deafened or demolished him. But
he ended up in an Army hospital in Tokyo just the same.
</P>
<P>
   About eight months into his tour, his vision grew blurry,
Swearngin said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors there told him he had an aneurysm _ a bulge in an artery
that threatens to burst _ in his brain.
</P>
<P>
   It was from an earlier condition and was unrelated to combat. He
had five years to live, they said.
</P>
<P>
   He was sent back stateside, to Walter Reed, where doctors used
clips to shore up the artery. In May 1952, he was released from the
hospital and the Army. He quickly stashed his release papers,
locking them away.
</P>
<P>
   The time was hardly uneventful.
</P>
<P>
   A few years and a few jobs later, he became a police patrolman
in Prairie Village and then a traffic cop.
</P>
<P>
   He worked injury accidents and wrote citations _ about 600 one
month, , said a former co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a real superior producer,'' said Prairie Village Police
Sgt. Dennis Nealey. ``A real nice guy, probably one of the
better-known traffic cops in Johnson County.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the few people who could write somebody a
ticket, and they'd want to shake his hand for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Swearngin retired in 1983 and took a year vacation. Then he
jumped back into uniform, this time as a security guard at Shawnee
Mission Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   That's where he is now, where the younger people with whom he
works joke about never getting rid of him and hope they never do,
said Swearngin's supervisor, Charlie Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in law enforcement ever since Korea,'' Swearngin
said. ``I guess I like it.''

N.J. RACE FOR SENATE IS ABOUT MONEY, MONEY AND THE LACK OF MONEY
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ In the three months since the New Jersey
primaries, Rep. Bob Franks, the little-known Republican candidate
for U.S. Senate, has managed to raise just over $1 million for his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Corzine will spend more than that on television commercials
this week.
</P>
<P>
   That blunt contrast, more than anything else, is shaping the
fall campaign for the Senate as it begins in earnest on Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's riches have given him an advantage most first-time
candidates could only dream of. By spending $35 million in the
Democratic primary, shattering national records, Corzine, who
retired last year as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., turned
himself from a political unknown into a household name. Emboldened,
he has since adopted a kind of Rose Garden strategy, avoiding
face-to-face encounters with his rival.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, overmatched financially, is trying to make Corzine's
money a campaign issue, attacking him in press releases and news
conferences for refusing to disclose his tax returns and for
favoring costly social programs that Franks says would bankrupt the
government. By daring Corzine to debate him and criticizing him for
refusing, Franks is hoping to make voters question Corzine's
credibility and fortitude, even his intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Corzine's name-recognition advantage over Franks, a
series of recent independent polls has suggested that the Senate
race in New Jersey is tightening.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's advisers have expressed befuddlement at surveys
showing a closer race, wondering aloud what could be driving the
independent polls, since little of public interest has taken place
in the Senate campaign since the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But Cliff Zukin, director of the Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers
poll, said the Republican National Convention might have helped
Franks by getting voters' attention. ``Even though it's focused on
the presidential level, it brings Republicans home,'' Zukin said.
``They see the flag, they hear the speeches, and they remember why
they were Republicans to begin with. So it brings Republicans back
not just to the party's presidential nominee but to the Senate
candidates as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Corzine's campaign is not waiting to see
whether the race tightens any further. On Monday night, several of
his advisers said, Corzine will begin running the first two
commercials in his general-election television campaign. The
advertisements _ one 30 seconds long, the other a minute _ will be
broadcast in the New York City and Philadelphia media markets at a
cost of more than $1.1 million in the first week.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The advisers said the shorter commercial touched on education,
gun control and a prescription drug benefit for Medicare
recipients, and would argue that Corzine's stands on those issues
were aligned with New Jerseyans' values. The longer advertisement,
they said, reintroduces Corzine with a slightly altered message,
saying, for example, that he has ``the fiscal discipline of a
successful businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By beginning his air attack now, Corzine will be able to
communicate with New Jersey voters long before television stations
in New York and Philadelphia become saturated with advertisements
for the Senate candidates in New York and Pennsylvania as well as
the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bet is now, even if Franks has two or three weeks of
effective commercials, they'll be less effective,'' the adviser
said, ``because Franks is competing not just with Jon Corzine, but
with Hillary and Lazio in New York, with Rick Santorum and Ron
Klink in Pennsylvania, and with Al Gore and George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks' only defense, for now, is to warn of a voter backlash
against Corzine's methods. ``After spending $35 million, Jon
Corzine is not as popular as one would expect,'' said Franks'
campaign manager, Charlie Smith. ``It demonstrates to me that this
election is about more than just television advertising. It's about
being able to represent the values and concerns of people. And
voters are smart. They can't be bought.''
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine appears undeterred by one recent poll showing that
31 percent of voters were greatly bothered by his campaign
spending. Beginning his television campaign now, nine weeks before
the Nov. 7 election, means he could easily spend $15 million more
on television alone. And his aides said Corzine had bought $2
million worth of commercials to be shown only during Olympics
broadcasts in October.
</P>
<P>
   Money, meanwhile, is Franks' great weakness. His aides have said
he needs to raise at least $8 million to stand a chance, but since
the primary he has only raised about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He raised $500,000 at an event honoring Senator John McCain,
R-Ariz., and $140,000 at the Republican convention. But since then,
he has shown little success. Two events in Texas with Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison produced only $50,000, as did an event with Rep.
Rick Lazio of New York, and several days of campaigning and
fund-raising along the Jersey Shore produced $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest direct mail appeal for money, Franks asked
previous contributors to his congressional races to donate $99,
``or, if you prefer, a monthly contribution of $33 in each of the
three months remaining until Election Day.'' He added: ``I don't
have to match Jon Corzine's spending. I only need enough
advertising to let voters compare my record of fiscal
responsibility in Congress to Jon Corzine's agenda of irresponsible
`universal government.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kept to a shoestring budget, Franks is also resorting to some
pugnacious tactics. He sent two campaign workers to the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles last month, where they wangled
credentials to get inside the Staples Arena during Corzine's speech
and handed out critiques of it afterward. Even more puckishly, the
Franks campaign has set up a Web site, www.mruniversal.com, that
depicts Corzine's face over a cartooned muscleman's body, and
leavens Franks' more serious attacks with satirical barbs that
range from witty to sophomoric.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of such tactics, the Corzine campaign has become careful
almost to a fault. At the first joint appearance of the two
candidates, a forum set up by the Veterans of Foreign Wars at a
high school in Toms River last Tuesday night, Corzine's aides
refused to allow Franks even to sit in the auditorium while Corzine
spoke. Franks was forced to wait his turn behind a closed door in
an adjoining office.
</P>
<P>
   When Franks finally addressed the 200 or so veterans there, one
reason Corzine might not have wanted to share a stage with him
quickly became clear: Corzine was politely received, but Franks was
the more practiced speaker and took only a few seconds to get the
first of many rounds of applause.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Franks will need every edge he can muster. While Corzine
is free to campaign as little or as much as he likes _ he had a
full schedule of beach walks and street fairs this weekend _ Franks
is caught in a difficult vise. He is forced to spend as much time
as possible raising money, as he did all day Saturday. And on
Tuesday, when Congress resumes its session, he will have to leave
for Washington.

A GAFFE BY RIVERA HELPS TWINS BEAT YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Upset with himself for his uncharacteristic walk of
Torii Hunter, Mariano Rivera got into his windup and went through
his normal routine: he glanced toward the runner at first, then
looked away, all the while deciding where to throw the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But while Rivera contemplated a move, Hunter, proving to be
either sly or lucky, took off for second base. As the Minnesota
Twins' center fielder sprinted toward the bag, Rivera stood
unaware, oblivious to what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez and Derek Jeter began screaming at their seemingly
dazed teammate, yelling, ``Step off! Step off!'' But by the time
their shouts for Rivera to step off the rubber were heard, Hunter
was more than halfway to second, and the pitcher had already
committed to throwing the ball to first.
</P>
<P>
   The play was blown, and as a result, the Twins had the go-ahead
run in scoring position in the 10th inning of Sunday's game at
Yankee Stadium. Moments later, after manager Joe Torre ordered an
intentional walk of Jacque Jones, the No. 8 batter in the lineup,
Rivera served up a two-out single to pinch-hitter Denny Hocking,
who scored Hunter to give Minnesota a 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The odd play, which Rivera said he had never before experienced,
cost the Yankees a series sweep of the Twins and sullied another
strong performance by Roger Clemens, who threw eight solid innings,
nearly half of them in the rain, to continue his magnificent roll
of the past two months. Afterward, the typically reliable Rivera
was angry with himself not for taking his eyes off of the runner or
for throwing toward first, but for walking the speedy Hunter to
begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear `Step off' that means throw to second, but I was
already on my way to first,'' said Rivera, whose record dropped to
7-4 with the loss. ``If I had thrown to second, it would have been
a balk. But that's not the point. The point is that if I never
walked the guy that never would have happened. He just timed it
perfect. I was aware that he wanted to run, but I wasn't expecting
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said the Yankees work on that particular scenario
throughout the spring and that Rivera usually handles the situation
better than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He obviously didn't see the runner because normally you see
the runner and just step off _ that's your first natural
reaction,'' said Torre, before the Yankees left for Kansas City,
where they begin a four-game series Monday. ``We beat ourselves
basically with that play. It's unfortunate that we let this one get
away because at home you should win extra-inning games.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Yankees been able to solve Minnesota's rookie right
hander, Matt Kinney, who held them to two hits and one run over six
innings, Clemens would have emerged with his eighth straight
victory. Working masterfully through the Twins' lineup, Clemens
registered eight strikeouts while allowing only three hits and
walking just one batter. His one weak moment came in the seventh,
when Ray Coomer sent a fastball over the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Clemens was the dominating pitcher Yankees fans have
come to expect since his seeming rebirth began with his activation
from the disabled list on July 2. Sunday's outing was his 13th
straight without a loss since returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger was terrific,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, idealistic fans probably held out hopes of seeing a
perfect game from Clemens. Facing a lineup that entered with a .140
batting average (13 for 93) against him, Clemens retired the first
nine Twins batters. Minnesota's first hit came in the fourth, on a
ground ball to left field by Jay Canizaro.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens got the next three hitters out, and then the rain began
to come down. The umpires informed Clemens that a delay might soon
follow, so, for a moment, he admitted to slipping out of his
groove. Still, the Twins managed only one hit over the next two
innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, the rain began falling with all the speed and
ferocity of one of Clemens' fastballs, and after another 1-2-3
inning, Clemens walked slowly off the field, knowing that his work
was through. The tarp came next, signifying the start of a
54-minute delay.
</P>
<P>
   Kinney was not as powerful as Clemens, but his slick timing on
when to use his curveball kept the Yankees off balance. Only Tino
Martinez got to him, hammering his 13th home run of the season in
the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had pretty good stuff _ he was kind of funky,'' Martinez
said of Kinney. ``He threw hard and had a good breaking ball and a
funky delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez nearly ended the game in the ninth when he drove an
offering from Eddie Guardado, who earned his fifth victory of the
season, off the top of the right-center-field wall. When Martinez
connected, the Yankees in the dugout, including Torre, rose from
their seats, hoping the shot would clear the fence.
</P>
<P>
   When it didn't, the 10th inning, and Rivera's strange gaffe,
followed.

LAWRENCE HOMEOWNERS WANT TO LIMIT KU STUDENTS IN THEIR
NEIGHBORHOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRAD COOPER  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ These are the kind of tales that would lead you
to believe college students live like heathens:
</P>
<P>
   Garbage piled high on the front lawn. Boisterous parties late
into the night. Intoxicated partyers urinating in bushes.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of behavior that makes homeowners cringe.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the kind of behavior that some Lawrence residents say
is creeping into their neighborhoods near the University of Kansas
campus as landlords buy up single-family homes and then rent them
out, many to students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we have to put up with that in an area zoned for
single families?'' asked Mary Elizabeth Debicki, who lives just
west of campus.
</P>
<P>
   Some homeowners want the Lawrence City Commission to tweak the
city's zoning law so it limits to two the number of unrelated
persons who can live in a home in a single-family residential area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto is two is a family, three is a crowd,'' said Arly
Allen, who lives just south of the KU campus and is one of the
neighborhood leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not object to renters as long as they are two unrelated
people or they're a family.''
</P>
<P>
   The limit is now four, allowing students, especially those short
of cash, to band together and rent a house for $200 to $300 a month
per person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come to realize that four unrelated people living
together lead to five, six or seven unrelated people living in the
same place,'' Debicki said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They live a student life. When they are out of class, they
invite all their friends in. There is a lot of partying. That is
normal, acceptable college behavior, but just not in a
single-family neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance advocated by neighborhood residents would not
affect any of the university's dormitories, fraternities or
sororities.
</P>
<P>
   It is aimed only at parts of town that are zoned for
single-family residences, including an area just south of the KU
campus where the city has received complaints from residents about
rental property.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has distinct ramifications for the wallets of KU
students such as Luke Pfannenstiel, a biology senior from
Hutchinson who shares a house with three roommates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would definitely make housing more expensive,'' said
Pfannenstiel, who with his roommates shoulders a $1,200 monthly
rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the big draw of living with a big group of people in a
house is that the rent is split that many more ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing (the residents) are trying to avoid is large
house parties, and not everybody does that. We're fairly quiet, and
we don't have 500 people over on the weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of changing the law say it will exclude thousands of
KU students such as Pfannenstiel from affordable housing. They say
stories about uncooperative students are exaggerated. And if there
are problems, a city nuisance ordinance could be used to keep
neighbors in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens in Lawrence who are supporting this effort think
that college students inherently are disrupting to single-family
neighborhoods,'' said Holly Krebs, a student leader opposing the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's a fair assessment of college students or
our lifestyle. There are lots of students that aren't disruptive to
single-family neighborhoods. It seems like it's a very indirect way
of trying to address a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey of cities with universities in the Big 12 Conference
revealed only two cities _ Lincoln, Neb., and Lubbock, Texas _ with
laws that limited to two the number of unrelated persons living
together in single-family homes.
</P>
<P>
   Cities such as Manhattan, Kan.; College Station, Texas; and
Waco, Texas, allowed four, while others such as Austin, Texas, and
Boulder, Colo., had no limits, according to the study, which was
conducted by Lawrence administrators. Columbia, Mo., has set the
number at three.
</P>
<P>
   Krebs, 22, lives in a home just northwest of campus with two
other persons. She said she and her roommates got along with their
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I don't have a child or just because I don't have
a husband yet and don't have that family doesn't mean I cannot
contribute to that neighborhood,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of this zoning battle is the Lawrence City
Commission, which must balance the needs of its residents with the
needs of a college community that contributes to the vitality of
this city with a population of 77,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a very difficult issue,'' said City
Commissioner Martin Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the student population is a large asset for the
community. They do a lot for the community, and we realize they
need to have an economical place to rent to be able to go to
school. Balancing that with protecting our neighborhoods is one of
the main concerns we're facing.''
</P>
<P>
   The City Commission is scheduled to take up the issue when it
meets Tuesday night. Any proposal that is recommended by the
commission must go to the Planning Commission for consideration and
then back to the full commission for final action. The issue may
not be resolved until November or December.
</P>
<P>
   Two proposals are being sent to the City Commission. One drafted
by the neighbors would allow a three-year phaseout period for
landlords renting property to three or four persons.
</P>
<P>
   The other proposal drafted by city staff would require
properties that don't conform to the single-family zoning
designation to register with the city. After the lease expires, the
property would then come under the new law.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of policy, Lawrence generally enforces its zoning
laws when it receives complaints from residents or when city
inspectors observe violations. Unless the commission spells out a
different policy, the city probably would enforce the new law the
same way.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense among city commissioners that some
single-family neighborhoods are at risk as rental property
continues to pop up and the number of students living off campus
rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about neighborhood stability,'' said Lawrence
Mayor James Henry. ``It really bothers me to see what were once
single-family neighborhoods becoming rental districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors attribute the problem to the vast number of KU
students who do not live in university housing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, there were 24,313 students enrolled at KU, according to
a university report. Of that number, 13,764, or 58.8 percent, lived
in rooms or apartments in the city. By comparison, 4,845, or 20.7
percent, lived in on-campus housing last year.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood leader Allen suggests that the university do more
to house students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university has outgrown, from our perspective, the ability
to house students,'' Allen said. ``More students are coming to
Lawrence than the university can or cares to house.''
</P>
<P>
   KU student housing director Ken Stoner said the university was
accommodating everybody that applies to live in on-campus housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not turn away students for housing,'' Stoner said. ``We
are housing more students, and our demand is good. We adjust the
way we offer the space to make sure that the students who need
housing _ we get them housing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Columbia reduced from four to three the
number of unrelated persons allowed to live together in
single-family neighborhoods. Homes rented to four persons at the
time the ordinance was adopted were grandfathered in.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia senior planner Chuck Bondra said three seemed to
alleviate a lot of the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get pretty upset if somebody decides to convert their
house to a rental and then rent it out to four students with four
cars and girlfriends and boyfriends and everybody else,'' Bondra
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have struck a balance by allowing up to three. That seems
to be more tolerable because I think the complaints have gone down
since we did that.''

 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deep in the middle of the curious spectators inside
Arthur Ashe Stadium, Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati stood on
the court as grown-ups, with budding bags beneath their eyes and
hardly a giggle left in their old souls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was impossible not to flash back to 1991 and remember
two innocent teen-agers bashing balls in a U.S. Open semifinal with
uninhibited force. It was hard not to view both as victims _
Capriati because of self-destruction, Seles because of a stabbing _
and not wonder what kind of rivalry there could have been had they
not disappeared for so long.
</P>
<P>
   But recall is also unfair. When Seles and Capriati arrived to
play their fourth-round match Sunday night, they weren't there to
stage a re-enactment. They just wanted to win. And with her
patented two-fisted strokes that have not changed with time, a fit
Seles sliced through the thick heavy air to advance to the
quarterfinals at the U.S. Open, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone expected this to be the epic of '91,'' said Capriati,
who was 15 when she lost to Seles in that mesmerizing three-setter.
``That's history. It's a new day and age. It's completely different
now. In that sense, it's like, well, maybe it's not good enough now
like then.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an epic, but the 15th-seeded Capriati and sixth-seeded
Seles let their strokes rip and wowed the crowd with their
strength. Neither held anything back, but Seles' polish on the big
points was a clear sign of her progress toward threatening the
elite players. Capriati is still trying to find her niche.
</P>
<P>
   Both were just pleased to get through their night match without
the frustration of the downpours that nearly ruined the day
session.
</P>
<P>
   Through two tortuous rain delays, about a half-dozen unsettling
thoughts whirled around the head of Marat Safin as if they were
attached to a mobile. His focus was in decline, his serve was on
the blink, his attention span was....Wait, now where were his
socks?
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the locker room, as the rain poured outside, a
sweat-soaked Safin realized he didn't have clean clothes in his
duffel bag. At that moment, a daylong scavenger hunt began for
Safin. While searching for a solution to the sudden slide in his
game, he was also hunting down Jeff Tarango for a fresh pair of
socks, then Nicolas Kiefer for a new shirt and shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that the people, they will like it if somebody
smell on the court,'' Safin explained in his hearty Russian accent.
``I just forgot my socks in the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an absent-minded day for the sixth-seeded Safin. Instead
of securing his third-round match on Day 7 of the Open Sunday,
Safin lost his concentration and allowed a two-sets-to-none lead on
Sebastien Grosjean slip away.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, Safin was staring at a match locked up at 4-4 in
the fifth set when a rain delay of 1 hour 19 minutes arrived. Then,
after 28 minutes of play, Safin was ahead by 5-4 in the fifth-set
tiebreaker when another cloudburst stopped play for 1:40.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, five minutes after play began again inside Arthur Ashe
Stadium, a match that began at 11 a.m. ended at around 5:30 p.m.
when Safin watched a forehand by Grosjean bound wide. A relieved
Safin had escaped his third-round scare, 6-4, 7-6 (3), 1-6, 3-6,
7-6 (5).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like this on the floor,'' said Safin, smiling as he
folded his hands in prayer. `` `Please, please, please, go out,
out, out.' I didn't want to even think what going to be if that
ball goes in.''
</P>
<P>
   One point this way or that, and another blow could have been
delivered to an already star-depleted men's draw. The plan by the
ATP was to use this tournament as a springboard to introduce the
tour's up-and-coming players to a U.S. audience under a ``New
Balls, Please,'' slogan. But the Open has been the site of a series
of uninspiring matches where some top young players have bowed out
with barely a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Complete unknowns, like the qualifier Hyung-Taik Lee, are being
discovered while some big names have vanished. Although top-seeded
Andre Agassi's loss was understandable considering the illness of
his mother and sister, second-seeded Gustavo Kuerten went out in
four sets in the first round and fifth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov
exited in three sets in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday Safin survived for another round, playing on legs still
wobbly from his five-set victory two days earlier. Once again, he
was in a desperate situation. The breeziness of his match against
Grosjean came to a jarring end in the third set. Suddenly,
everything changed. The powerful serve that usually springs out of
Safin's 6-foot-4 frame started to go awry. He stopped attacking and
became planted well behind the baseline. He started yelling at
himself instead of calmly approaching each point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went crazy,'' Safin said. ``How is it possible?''
</P>
<P>
   But just as he began to regroup, about the time he was roaring
back from a 2-0 deficit to tie the fifth set at 4-4, the ominous
clouds that had been hovering all day broke open. Quickly, both
players headed to the locker room only to emerge for just a
28-minute stretch before the next rain delay during a nerve-racking
tie breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the situation when you stay in the locker room
and start to think, `Oh, my God, I'm down in the fifth set,'''
Safin said. ``Then the tiebreaker is 5-4; and I don't know what to
do with the ball. It's a lot of headache because you don't know.
You start to think all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go from the locker room, you're completely _ you are
scared. I don't know, you think too much. I think you can become
crazy like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like normal human beings, I was afraid. My eyes were bigger
than my head.''
</P>
<P>
   He put his fears aside, though, and converted his nervous energy
into a fresh attack. Once he returned to the court, in borrowed
clothes, Safin aggressively finished off the match. And he did it
without making a scene. For once, the temperamental Russian didn't
even break a racket along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are too new,'' said Safin, who has broken at least 50
rackets this year. ``I string them yesterday. I didn't want to ...
I promise to myself that I will not do it today. Actually, I was
quite nice on the court, no?''

SHOWTIME FOR QUOKKA &HT;    By VERNE KOPYTOFF
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   A photograph of Michael Johnson, the world-record holder in the
200 and 400 meter sprints, hangs prominently in a hallway at Quokka
Sports, the San Francisco online sports publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The image is an appropriate choice for the company that, like
Johnson, plans to strain and sweat during the 2000 Summer Olympics
in Sydney later this month.
</P>
<P>
   In its biggest undertaking ever, Quokka has joined with NBC
television to create the NBCOlympics.com Web site. Long focused on
low-profile sports like sailing and mountaineering, Quokka is now
expanding rapidly to chronicle mainstream athletics in an effort to
attract a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   But Quokka faces serious hurdles in attempting to become one of
the leaders in its field. The company has intense competition from
more-established Web sites and is still looking forward to the day
that it will earn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quokka has a strong belief in storytelling that has proved
popular in action sports,'' said Alan Ramadan, Quokka's chief
executive. ``We are demonstrating that sports enthusiasts for all
sports appreciate good storytelling too.''
</P>
<P>
   For Quokka, that means incorporating its signature in-depth
coverage and innovative imagery into not only the Olympics, but an
array of other sports like golf, car racing, baseball, basketball
and football. The company's philosophy is to please the
most-devoted sports fans, at times to the point of what may seem
like obsession.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the joint Quokka-NBC Olympic Web site will include
20,000 pages of text and 27,000 images. Visitors will get diagrams
of athlete injuries, reports from competitors and simulations of
the triathlon course along the Sydney waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson's heart rate, speed and stride rate during an
Olympic Trials sprint is also posted on the Web site. Quokka hopes
to include more of such laboratory-style information for other
sports in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Quokka's involvement in the Olympics began last year, when the
company agreed to create a Web site for the games with NBC to
complement the network's exclusive television coverage. The
partnership gives Quokka 51 percent of the Web site's revenues and
oversight of virtually all the content.
</P>
<P>
   While the opportunity to work on such a high-profile project is
considered a victory for Quokka, it is costly. Quokka will spend
between $20 million and $30 million on the Web site, with the only
major investment from NBC coming as television promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Quokka hopes to make money from the Web site by selling
advertising _ Visa and General Motors have already signed up _ and
by offering online shopping. But Quokka expects to recoup only
about half of its expenses, which include hiring 150 temporary
employees for the Olympics to supplement its staff of 400.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, Quokka's workers were laboring at their
computers to prepare the NBCOlympics.com Web site for what promises
to be both an ordeal for the firm and its moment of glory. Workers
will be positioned in Sydney and San Francisco around-the-clock to
update the Web site from now until the beginning of October.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBCOlympics.com is going to be feast-or-famine for Quokka,''
said Andrew Sturner, president of corporate and business
development for Sportsline.com, a Quokka competitor. ``It's a
make-or-break event.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Quokka executives see this year's Olympics as only the
beginning. They expect the firm's financial sacrifice to pay off
later, if not from its agreement with NBC to produce a Web site for
the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, then from the Web site
it will create for the 2004 Summer Games in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Quokka executives predict that the company will be profitable by
mid-2002. If so, it will be the first time since the firm was
founded in 1996 by an American and two Australians.
</P>
<P>
   In its infancy, Quokka, named after a relative of the kangaroo,
built a reputation for covering extreme sports by following the
Whitbread race (an around-the-world yacht competition),
mountaineering in Pakistan and a 150-mile footrace across the
Moroccan desert. The company began branching out to more-popular
sports in mid-1999 when it introduced Web sites for motor racing.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Quokka has accelerated its growth by acquiring
several companies, including Mountainzone.com, which focuses on
sports like hiking and climbing, and Golf.com. A deal to buy Total
Sports, devoted to baseball, football and basketball, is expected
to be finalized in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not going to get 200 million people to watch
sailing,'' said Alvaro Saralegui, Quokka's chief operating officer.
``We could have grown without expanding to other sports, but not
into as big a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Quokka's push to a broader audience sets the stage for it to do
an increasing amount of work for NBC, which announced last month
that it may invest $141 million in the company. The firms
collaborated on a Web site for the U.S. Open golf tournament in
June and may join again when the Quokka's Total Sports deal is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Quokka could close the big gap in traffic between it and
competing Web sites like ESPN.com and Sportsline.com. Both of those
companies had at least 4 million unique users in July, according to
Media Metrix, the online ratings firm, while Quokka had only
399,000. ESPN is partly owned by the Hearst Corp., which also owns
The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Web sites are particularly valuable as promotional tools
for television and magazines. They are typically geared to lure
sports enthusiasts who revel in exceedingly detailed coverage that
cannot be easily duplicated on air or in print.
</P>
<P>
   Quokka estimates that 10 million unique users will visit the
NBCOlympics.com Web site during the Sydney games. Most users will
be logging on to the site hours after events have finished because
of the time difference.
</P>
<P>
   One thing most visitors to the Web site will be unable to find
are video clips of the games in Sydney because of objections by the
International Olympic Committee. Only subscribers to certain
broadband providers will get to see video clips of the Olympics _
and then only up to 20 minutes of highlights a day. Similar to
NBC's broadcast of the games, the clips will be on tape delay.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Quokka is staking its future on offering video
designed for viewers with broadband Internet access. The company is
banking that the number of people with high-speed Internet
connections will proliferate to justify the investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have all this great technology,'' said Christopher Todd,
an Internet industry analyst for Jupiter Communications, a market
research company. ``The problem is that it doesn't have a large
reach so they're not getting a mass audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan O'Brien, a media analyst with Forrester Research, a market
research company in Cambridge, Mass., predicted that Quokka will
prosper if it survives the fickleness of the stock market and
venture capitalists. He said that compared with other online sports
companies, Quokka's presentation is far more complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you turn the clock forward five or six years, when Quokka
has libraries of material and a knowledgeable staff, they could be
looking well,'' O'Brien said. ``What comes with being a pioneer is
arrows in the back if you underdeliver.''

NORTHRIDGE READY TO BOUNCE BACK FROM BIG LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. _ Defensive back Karalus Doyle stood
near the tunnel entrance at Falcon Stadium, patted his teammates
and told them everything was OK.
</P>
<P>
   Everything really wasn't OK. CSUN had just walked off the field
after being pummeled by Air Force 55-6 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If the Matadors can bounce back mentally, there's no reason to
believe they won't be fine. After all, it was a game against a
Division I-A opponent and it doesn't count toward the Big Sky
Conference title. Most important, CSUN didn't have any major
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like a preseason game,'' punter Ethan Beck said.
``Of course, we made tons of mistakes. But I think we're way better
than our last (season opener). I saw some good things defensively
and offensively that I didn't see last year against Kansas (in a
71-14 loss). I didn't see much at all there. I think we'll bounce
back.''
</P>
<P>
   And the loss doesn't appear to have taken a shot at CSUN's
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Air Force) receivers weren't as good as we thought,''
Doyle said. ``Our DBs can cover anybody in the nation. They're not
better. We just made a lot of mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Marcus Brady led a sluggish CSUN offense, which had
only two first downs in the first half. The offense _ which
averaged 450 yards last year _ mustered just 227 yards. Still,
Brady doesn't think the game hurt CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game is a positive,'' Brady said. ``You can always learn
from the mistakes you made.''
</P>
<P>
   And there will be plenty of mistakes to witness on film. Not
only did the offense struggle, the defense allowed 583 rushing
yards and couldn't figure out how to defend the option. The defense
allowed 698 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Joseph Roberson said the Matadors wouldn't have to
worry about defending against the option the rest of the season.
But Roberson, who had five tackles _ including a sack _ quickly
stopped to give credit to Air Force's solid execution. And he
continuously talked about re-dedication to the football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work harder, we don't complain about having to do
any extra running and we work harder in the weight room,'' Roberson
said. ``You have to allow this experience to humble you and not
place blame on any person. You have to put the responsibility on
your shoulders to get better. ... You have to accept that you were
playing a different caliber athlete and you have to work harder to
be at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN coach Jeff Kearin didn't hesitate when asked if he still
felt the game was beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question,'' Kearin said. ``Win, lose or draw it was
a great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors must put it behind them and prepare to play
Southwest Texas State at San Marcos. CSUN travels for the second
consecutive week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to Southwest Texas whether we want to or not,''
Kearin said. ``... Tomorrow is a new day and a new week.''
</P>
<P>
   And a chance to forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either win or lose,'' defensive back Travis Campbell said.
``One team's a winner and the other one loses. The score didn't
matter. We all played our (butts) off. It's done with. There's
nothing we can do about it.'' &QL;

MORE COLLEGES TRY WARNINGS INSTEAD OF NAPSTER CRACKDOWNS &HT;    By BENNY EVANGELISTA
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 3,000 incoming students at the University of Virginia
wishing to obtain an e-mail account this year had to answer 10
multiple-choice questions, including the following:
</P>
<P>
   ``With Napster or similar services ... you:
</P>
<P>
   A. Have found a great way to protest record company pricing
policies.
</P>
<P>
   B. Know you will be able to stay within your budget for the year
due to the funds you will save by not purchasing CDs.
</P>
<P>
   C. Have violated University policy; have violated federal law;
have violated the university's Honor Code; have put yourself at
real personal risk for a lawsuit for copyright infringement; have
opened your computer so that anyone on the Internet can obtain any
file from it; have contributed to network congestion (or complete
network stalls) in the residence halls from uploads and downloads
of MP3 files to and from the entire Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take an MBA to figure out the answer the university
wanted was not ``A'' or ``B.''
</P>
<P>
   But the university hasn't blocked students from using popular
file sharing programs like Napster, Scour or Gnutella.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the University of Virginia, like many colleges around
the country, hope they can keep the use of Napster-like programs
from getting out of hand by educating students about all the legal
and technical ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was part from a practical point of view and partly
philosophical,'' said university spokeswoman Louise Dudley. ``This
university was founded by Thomas Jefferson and the idea of free
exchange of information. You make information available, but you
can't assume that all of the uses are illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster, a San Mateo, Calif., technology startup, caused a great
stir around the country last spring when hundreds of colleges and
universities blocked or restricted its use because students
swapping MP3 songs were clogging high-speed Internet connections at
those institutions.
</P>
<P>
   As the school year gets into full swing this week, university
officials are keeping an eye out for any Napster-related problems,
although there isn't a high level of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   A Gartner Group study released last week showed 34 percent of
the 50 most-wired colleges and universities in the country have
enacted a ban on Napster, including Arizona State, the University
of Southern California and Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   However, the study found a longer list of institutions that have
not banned the program, including Stanford University, the
University of California at Berkeley, the University of California
at Los Angeles, Princeton University and Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford, officials aren't expecting any problems, but say
they will watch for bandwidth congestion that could affect other
educational uses of the Internet. That's a problem that has also
cropped up in the past when students tried to launch Web-based
businesses using the university's systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some concern about the bandwidth being used, but
that shouldn't be a problem this year,'' said Stephen Hansen,
Stanford's computer security officer. ``I don't think issues here
are any worse than anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The colleges that have enacted bans gave bandwidth congestion as
the main reason, said Gartner senior analyst P.J. McNealy. But he
said that reason may also be an excuse to reduce liability for
copyright infringement issues that still have to be decided by the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Major record labels represented by the Recording Industry
Association of America are suing Napster claiming the program
allows users to swap illegally copied versions of their songs.
Napster contends the company and its members are doing nothing
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction
against Napster in July, but the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals issued a stay of that order until it can hear arguments
from both sides. Napster users can continue to trade songs until at
least Oct. 2, when the appellate court is scheduled to hear the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Most college administrators have been reluctant to declare
copyright infringement as the reason for banning Napster, to avoid
any legal entanglements, McNealy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legal liability is the monster lurking at the end of the
hallway here,'' McNealy said. ``The number of sites that have
Napster-like content are voluminous. You could start tripping down
that slippery slope (trying to determine) which ones do you start
banning.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Napster loses its case, ``will the RIAA and other music
bigwigs start going after colleges and universities and students to
make an example of them?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McNealy, though, said colleges may find they have to enact bans
or restrictions if students start to heavily download songs,
especially as the appeals court hearing date nears.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought Napster was big when school let out for the
summer, it's only grown bigger over the summer,'' he said.

WINNING STREAK SHOWS FEW SIGNS OF STOPPING; FROM GARDEN TO MUNICH;
LEE HITS THE TOWN; ALL WET AND LEFT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is now 23 matches and counting, but Venus Williams
did not know much about her winning streak until a reporter
mentioned it to her last week.
</P>
<P>
   After showing a trace of vulnerability in her third-round match
Friday against Meghan Shaughnessy, the third-seeded Williams
eliminated Magui Serna, 6-2, 6-2, in 53 minutes Sunday to advance
to the quarterfinals. Her victory came after she waited around the
National Tennis Center for more than five hours during two rain
delays and wound up playing yet another late-afternoon match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty disappointing,'' Williams said. She passed the
time by nibbling on food every hour. ``I'll never get away from
this place,'' she said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she wants to do so anytime soon. ``In the first couple
of rounds I was not playing well,'' Williams said. ``But I feel
more warmed up and in a groove, more ready to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   After struggling with her serve in the third round, Williams was
much more efficient Sunday, winning 74 percent of her first-serve
points. She also had 24 winners to Serna's five.
</P>
<P>
   The last match Williams lost was to Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, in
the quarterfinals at the French Open. But Williams will not get a
rematch because the eight-seeded Nathalie Tauziat defeated
Sanchez-Vicario, who was seeded ninth, in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has never been one of my goals to have a winning streak, so
this is nice,'' said Williams, whose streak includes her run to the
Wimbledon title.
</P>
<P>
   Williams did make it clear that one of her goals is avoiding a
battle of the sexes. After John McEnroe said that any male college
player or senior player could beat Venus or her sister, Serena, a
volley of words ensued, prompting Donald Trump to propose a $1
million match between either sister and McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that back in the '70s, Billie Jean King did it the
right way,'' Williams said, referring to King's match in the
Astrodome against Bobby Riggs. ``Right now I'm just really focusing
on trying to win this U.S. Open more than anything, just have a
good result here, just competing with the women.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some later date,'' Williams added, ``I'll be ready to think
about competing with men. At this point, I'm ready to just play the
Open.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Garden To Munich &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Women's Tennis Association Tour will sever its 29-year
affiliation with Madison Square Garden after this year and hold its
year-end championships in Munich.
</P>
<P>
   The Chase Championships, a weeklong event beginning Nov. 13 this
year, will move to Germany and begin three weeks earlier, in
October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden's contract with the WTA was up after this year, and
while the Garden made a bid to renew the deal, the WTA made an
agreement with Munich officials worth about $2 million more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing,'' said Joel Fisher, senior vice
president of MSG Sports. ``We would have loved them back. We made
what we felt was a very fair offer, but we couldn't go any further
and we had to make the correct business decision. They felt they
had a better offer.''
</P>
<P>
   This will not mean the end of women's tennis in the Garden.
Fisher said the Garden was negotiating to establish an annual
exhibition with six of the top women's players at about the same
time in November, but for fewer days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel that in the end it will work out well,'' Fisher
said. ``We're pretty far along in our discussions and agreement.
We're proceeding forward as if we were having an event. I think
we're going to start asking players now.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Garden are trying to negotiate with
International Management Group, which works with several top
players, including Venus and Serena Williams, Lindsay Davenport and
Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament will be an exhibition because the WTA season will
have already ended. Fisher said he hoped the top players would be
attracted by the prize money and the opportunity to play in the
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the draw will be,'' he said. ``We feel the
responsibility for the fans in New York, and we think that major
women's tennis is on a real upswing. It's bittersweet, but it's
also very exciting, and a new opportunity.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lee Hits The Town
</P>
<P>
   Hyung-Taik Lee, the surprise fourth-round opponent of Pete
Sampras Monday, went on an afternoon escapade through Flushing's
Korean section Sunday after he practiced at the National Tennis
Center. At two restaurants, owners and staff showed him respectful
attention.
</P>
<P>
   When Lee, 24, a qualifier from Seoul, South Korea, walked into
the Korean-owned sushi restaurant Nam Sam, the owner quickly called
up her friends, who soon arrived en masse to get Lee's autograph.
After hors d'oeuvres there, Lee and his coaches went down Northern
Boulevard to Kum Kang San to eat Korean barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who was ranked No. 182 in the world entering the Open, is
the first Korean man to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam. In
1981, a Korean woman, Duk Hee Lee, advanced to the fourth round of
the U.S. Open before losing to Hana Mandlikova. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All Wet And Left Out
</P>
<P>
   For some fans, Sunday's rain was more than an exercise in
annoyance. After enduring two rain delays and waiting until Marat
Safin finally finished off Sebastien Grosjean in the fifth-set
tiebreaker, fans waiting for Venus Williams heard announcements
that her match against Magui Serna would be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Officials moved her match to Louis Armstrong Stadium, giving
people little time to scurry next door. Within minutes, Armstrong
was close to capacity, and some fans were angry about being shut
out of the match.
</P>
<P>
   Officials moved the match to clear Arthur Ashe Stadium for the
featured night match, Jennifer Capriati against Monica Seles,
ensuring that if there was another rain delay during Williams'
match, she could finish it without upsetting the night schedule.
Seles went on to defeat Capriati, 6-3, 6-4. &QL;

ONLINE INVESTING: POTENTIAL INVESTORS ADVISED TO CHECK INDUSTRIES
ON WEB &HT;    By HARRY DOMASH
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   A faithful reader asked me for a list of sites for information
on specific industry sectors. That was a great question, because
it's important to know what's going on in the industry before
investing in a company. Here are my favorite sites to find out.
</P>
<P>
   --  &UR; Upside's E-Biz 150 &LR;  ( &LR; www.upside.com &LR; ). Upside Today's E-Biz
150 should be required reading for tech investors. It's a list of
the 150 largest technology companies, rated for their chances of
future success.
</P>
<P>
   The companies on the list are divided into five groups:
wireless, next-generation networks, services, applications and
commerce, and platforms and tools. Taken together, the five groups
comprise a who's who of technology.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings are done by principals of the Yankee Group of
Boston, a leading business and technology consultant to technology
companies. The information for the ratings comes primarily from
more than 1,500 meetings the Yankee Group holds with industry
participants each year.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are given a score ranging from one to five (five
is best) in each of the five categories deemed by the Yankee Group
to be critical to future success:
</P>
<P>
   Innovation: awards best scores to companies showing the most
innovation when developing new products.
</P>
<P>
   Market share: highest scores go to companies with growing, but
already large, market shares in their primary line of business.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas strength: gives most points to companies doing at least
half of their business overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Alliances: evaluates company's alliances with major industry
players.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Growth: highest grades go to companies growing sales faster
than 30 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   The companies comprising each group are listed according to
their total score (highest first). The listings include a breakdown
of the company's score in each category and a short paragraph
describing the company's strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings are published every February, but being six months
old isn't a detriment. The factors they rate change slowly. Select
E-BIZ from the top menu, and then click on E-Biz 150 below the
previous menu to find the ratings. I've been following Upside's
Yankee Group ratings since 1996. Naturally, they've made some bad
calls during that time, but they're giving away information here
that you can't buy anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   --  &UR; TechNewsWorld.com &LR;  ( &LR; www.technewsworld.com &LR; ). TechNewsWorld
is the best source for technology industry news. They compile
reports from a variety of sources, far more than any other site
I've seen. The site carries only the first few sentences of each
story. You have to click on a link taking you to the originating
site to read the complete story. TechNewsWorld is continuously
updated, 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   --  &UR; The Register &LR;  ( &LR; www.theregister.co.uk &LR; ). This British site's
logo, ``Biting the hand that feeds it,'' describes its
intentionally provocative approach. The Register covers technology
with mostly original stories. Categories include hardware,
semiconductors, software, networks, Internet and business. The
Register is always interesting, but sometimes they get it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   --  &UR; ChangeWave &LR;  ( &LR; www.changewave.com &LR; ). The ChangeWave site ties
in with a new book titled ``ChangeWave Investing'' by Tobin Smith.
In the book, Smith outlines a method of selecting tech stocks by
identifying significant technology-driven changes in society and
then finding companies likely to prosper from these changes. Much
of the site requires a subscription, but you can sign up for
Smith's free weekly newsletter. In each issue, Smith describes a
tech sector meeting his criteria for a Change Wave. His reports are
an easy read, very informative, and include his favorite stocks in
the sector. It's good information if you're interested in
technology investing.
</P>
<P>
   --  &UR; Biotech &AMP; Pharmaceuticals &LR;  ( &LR; www.biospace.com &LR; ).
BioSpace.com is known as the place to go for biotech industry news.
Especially interesting in that regard is Clinical Trial News listed
under For Investors. I pay most attention to Phase III section. The
approval cycle for new drugs can drag on for years. News coming out
of Phase III trials (the final phase) can signal big stock moves in
either direction.
</P>
<P>
   BioSpace recently added a research section also listed under For
Investors. Click on BioSpace Investor Analysis to access
informative write-ups on a number of subjects. The Cancer Update,
for instance, includes detailed information on the progress of a
variety of drugs in different stages of the approval process. Also
check out the Company Snapshots listed on the research page. The
so-called snapshots are detailed descriptions of a company's
products in development. The snapshots section is new, and only
nine companies were listed when I checked last week. However,
they're adding about two new snapshots each week, so they should
have an extensive library within a few months.
</P>
<P>
   --  &UR; DrugTopics.com &LR;  ( &LR; www.drugtopics.com &LR; ) The online version of
Drug Topics Magazine, although targeted to pharmacists, is a good,
easy-to-understand source of news about the pharmaceutical
industry.
</P>
<P>
   --  &UR; American Banker.com &LR;  ( &LR; www.americanbanker.com &LR; ). An
excellent resource for news and in-depth reports about banking and
related industries. Click on Research Cntr for a list of industry
links if you can't find what you need on American Banker's site.
Check out the links under Technology &AMP; E-Commerce if you're
interested in investing in companies serving the banking industry.

<P>
   --  &UR; WorldOil.com &LR;  ( &LR; www.worldoil.com &LR; ). News, in-depth reports,
current prices, forecasts _ it's hard to imagine what you'd want to
know about the oil industry that you couldn't find here.

NEW YORK SENATE CANDIDATES BOTH COPING WITH VOTER FATIGUE AND

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In most political contests, Labor Day is a point of
embarkation: The start of the two-month journey during which the
candidates campaign in earnest, when the themes and issues that
will shape the election fall into place, and when voters start to
judge who the candidates are and what they are saying.
</P>
<P>
   But for Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick Lazio, the starting gun
is firing on a Senate race that has, in one form or another, been
running for nearly 20 months now. The result is what both sides
described this weekend as a distorted playing field that is
complicating nearly every strategic decision they face between now
and Election Day, and that is working to the decided disadvantage
of the Democratic first lady and the Republican congressman from
Suffolk County.
</P>
<P>
   For the electorate, the extended run-up to the general election
has resulted in a form of voter fatigue, the result of an unusual
familiarity with the candidates that comes from the near-saturation
coverage of this race. That is particularly the case for Clinton,
who has been at this almost full time since last summer, but also
for Lazio, who bounded onto the field in May.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to both candidates say that this has raised the bar on
what they need to do to capture the attention of New Yorkers, and
it accounts for the early barrage of high-octane attacks from both
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   As important, advisers to both candidates say, this long
preamble has brought a magnifying glass to the political skills of
Lazio and Clinton, neither of whom has ever run for statewide
office before. As a result, the discussion among political leaders
on this Labor Day is more apt to be about the candidates'
weaknesses, which are considerable, than their strengths. And there
is a realization that with nine weeks left, these two candidates
are unlikely to get much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them are in a bad dynamic,'' said Rick Wilson, a
Republican consultant who was an adviser to Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's Senate campaign. Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant
who is not affiliated with either candidate, said that the long
run-up to the general election has made things ``much, much
harder'' for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Clinton. The first lady is, by any measure, a much more
skilled candidate than she was when she began her ``listening
tour'' in upstate New York in July 1999. She has told friends in
Washington that she has come to appreciate, if not quite share, her
husband's passion for the campaign trail, after a long period in
which she viewed it as an unhappy chore.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton continues to come across as scripted, measured and,
at times, uncomfortable in public settings. To the continued
frustration of many Democratic leaders, she remains stubbornly
cautious and averse to taking chances, a trait that is arguably not
ideal for someone seeking a public office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is said to be more apt to rely on lessons drawn from
past races and on contemporary polling, rather than on her
instincts or those of her advisers, in deciding how to proceed.
Thus, although Clinton is in the thick of a highly unconventional
contest, she is running a very conventional campaign. Her talk of
``children and families'' and attempts to tie Lazio to conservative
policies in Washington make her sound like dozens of other
Democrats who are running for Congress but who happen not to call
the White House their home.
</P>
<P>
   There are many New York Democrats who argue that approach is not
enough to defeat Lazio, given the unusually strong dislike for
Clinton among many voters. And many of them also note that a
comparison of polls today with those of a year ago suggests that
she is running in place.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's strategy is unlikely to change, said one of her
longtime advisers, who described her as confident and comfortable
with the careful course she has charted.
</P>
<P>
   As for Lazio, when he first entered the race, several Democrats
warned that he posed a more serious threat to Clinton than Giuliani
did. He did not carry the weight of Giuliani's unpopularity in some
parts of New York, and, perhaps most important, seemed to bring a
hunger for victory and an appetite for campaigning that Giuliani
seemed to lack.
</P>
<P>
   But this weekend, it was as easy to find Republicans officials
expressing concern about Lazio's campaigning skills as it was to
find Democrats fretting about Clinton. (These are the kind of
observations that tend to be offered anonymously _ to guard against
charges of disloyalty, but enthusiastically _ in the hope that a
public airing of the views might prod the candidates into
reconsidering their ways.)
</P>
<P>
   The most serious and abiding concern about Lazio is how he comes
across as a candidate. Although he is 42 and was elected to
Congress in 1992, his own advisers acknowledge that he sometimes
seems more like a junior member of a Suffolk County town board than
a potential successor to Daniel Moynihan, one of the nation's most
distinguished senators. Clinton's advisers view this as a definite
advantage, and are considering such things as having the first lady
deliver a foreign policy address in an academic setting to press
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   And to the concern of some senior New York Republican leaders,
Lazio has yet to do anything to address this perceived liability.
Instead, he has indulged in some campaign moments that seem to
stress the lighter side of his personality. For example, he was
photographed plunging down a slide at the Erie County Fair; a few
days later, he wiped his feet on a doormat with Hillary's name
affixed to it. At the same time, he has made only one major speech,
on tax cuts, and has resisted pressure from some advisers to do
more.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The other area of concern about Lazio among Republicans is the
lax pace of Lazio's campaign, which stands in contrast to Clinton's
more energetic efforts this year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, both candidates announced they were taking off a
few days before Labor Day, with Lazio heading out to the Hamptons
and Clinton going to the White House and to New York's Finger Lakes
region.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton seemed to do anything but vacation. In Washington,
she summoned her campaign staff to the White House, where she went
through several hours of debate practice, with Bob Barnett, a
Washington lawyer and book agent, playing the part of Lazio.
Barnett played the part of former President George Bush in mock
debates with President Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also went to two fund-raisers and spent three hours at
the state fair in Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Lazio appears to have been serious about his
vacation plans, venturing out only once _ to a beach club in
Rockaway Sunday, where he shook hands and pronounced himself ``very
comfortable with where we are in key parts of this state.'' He has
gone days without appearing at a single public campaign event. And
when he offered a tax-cut plan two weeks ago, one reason it was
notable was that it was the first major policy address he had given
since entering the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is working a lot harder,'' said a senior New York
Republican strategist who is one of Lazio's most public supporters.
``And she's beginning to hit her stride.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, said the candidate had
used this time to raise money and prepare himself for the fall
campaign. And there are clearly some strategic considerations:
Lazio has argued to his aides that the best way to win the race is
to keep the spotlight on Clinton. He has, one adviser said,
repeatedly resisted stepping up his campaign schedule or scheduling
any more major speeches for now.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Lazio's advisers have concluded that tactic will not
work against Clinton, and Dal Col said that Lazio would soon begin
to spell out a more detailed campaign agenda. The question then
will be whether he waited too long.

BARBER SHIFTS DIRECTION AND A STAR IS REBORN 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAFAEL HERMOSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Things were so different at Cave Spring
High School in Roanoke, Va. Tiki Barber knew he was the best player
on the football field then, which usually meant that every other
player chased him around.
</P>
<P>
   Barber again believes he can beat anybody. When Barber, the
Giants running back, took a toss from quarterback Kerry Collins in
the first quarter Sunday, he ran nearly as far as he could to the
right side of the field and stared at a mountain of Arizona
Cardinals. Barber stopped, turned and cut back across the field.
Collins provided one block and Barber squeezed into the end zone
for the game's opening score, a 10-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You believe that you're better,'' Barber said. ``I'm going to
beat this guy on this play, no matter what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber did and, because he scored two dramatic touchdowns
Sunday, helped the Giants to a 21-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Barber conceded that the boundless confidence he now displays
was sapped two years ago, when he was in a season-long slump after
a good rookie season. He lost his starting job and, worse, his
self-assurance. His talent alone could not get him by.
</P>
<P>
   Barber has regained his confidence and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised one bit,'' Barber said. ``I knew I was going
to have a big game, and I'm planning on having 15 more, hopefully
18 more.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber added a 78-yard touchdown run to finish with 144 yards on
13 carries, his second 100-yard game as a professional. He also had
three receptions for 25 yards and three punt returns for 18 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Barber was not humble, but he also was not boasting after
rushing for two distinct but impressive touchdowns. He was the
perfect complement for Ron Dayne, the Giants' first-round pick last
April and the other half of the running back platoon.
</P>
<P>
   As Barber was running across the field for that first touchdown,
he said, he could sense the Arizona players hoping someone else
would catch him. It was a hot and muggy day, and nobody was
prepared for Barber's improvisation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to a decision it was going to be me getting negative-3
yards or doing some things I used to do in high school and trying
to go back the other way,'' Barber said.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Lomas Brown said: ``Tiki's not afraid to do
that. He's fearless.''
</P>
<P>
   The first score made his second touchdown run seem almost
routine. With the Giants at their 22-yard line, the defense shifted
left and Barber knew what was next. Giants guard Ron Stone and
tackle Luke Petitgout opened a gaping hole on the right side, and
Barber sped through. He beat Arizona cornerbacks Tom Knight and
Aeneas Williams, with Knight failing to make a leaping tackle at
the Cardinals' 25.
</P>
<P>
   Barber recalled feeling everyone in the stadium looking at him
and not wanting to fall short of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   He left leaving the Giants' final touchdown for Dayne. The two
call themselves thunder and lightning and combined for 222 yards.
They could not be any more different. While Barber showed his
ability to slice through defenses, Dayne simply bashed his way
through. He gained 78 yards on 23 carries, a 3.4-yard-per-carry
average, modest but effective numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a little lineman coming at the guys,'' Brown said of
the 5-foot-10-inch, 253-pound Dayne. ``He's going to take a toll on
them. All we have to do is stay on our guys because we know we have
a bruiser behind us or we have this little sprinter.''
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-quarter drive epitomized Dayne's style. He carried six
times for 36 yards, including a 7-yard run through the right side
for a touchdown and a 21-3 Giants lead. Barber had four carries for
27 yards on that drive and waited to hug Dayne after the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun watching him because he's so different than me,''
Barber said. ``When he makes some guys miss or runs over a guy, I
wish I could do that. But at the same time, I bet he wishes he
could run 78 yards for a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne admitted he was nervous at the start of his first
regular-season professional game, but he eased into a comfort zone
by the second half. He agreed that he was more assertive than he
had been in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I played pretty good, too,'' Dayne said. &QL;

PARK &AMP; KREUTER QUITE A HIT TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If anyone doesn't mind being labeled ``specialty
catcher,'' it's Chad Kreuter.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter has been the Dodgers' personal catching caddie for Chan
Ho Park throughout 2000 and teamed with him for Sunday's game
against the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Park had a reputation for shaking off catchers, but in spring
training the Dodgers asked the newcomer Kreuter to help cure that
habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a challenge for me, to work with pitchers and get them
on the right wavelengths,'' Kreuter said. ``And I saw (Park) as a
great talent that needs a little guidance in the right direction.
And we hit it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux has thrived at sticking with one battery mate
throughout his run of success in Atlanta. Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said there are different circumstances for different
pitchers, using regular Braves catcher Javy Lopez as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe (Lopez) gives too high a target or maybe he likes to go
away all the time. It can be 1,001 things,'' Johnson said. ``That
guy on the middle of the field, you want him happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Park has reason to feel good of late. Entering his 29th start on
Sunday, he had compiled a 2.36 earned-run average over the last 10
outings.
</P>
<P>
   In his three previous starts, Park went 3-0, allowing just three
earned runs in 24 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter does his homework when preparing Park or any of his
pitchers for their starts. He studies the opposition, matching up a
pitcher's strength to expose the batter's weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Park's history of not trusting the pitches called by his
catchers he and Kreuter have worked well in that capacity _ is a
problem Kreuter understands from a scientific angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not robots. We're all programmed a different way,''
Kreuter said.

   Kreuter, 36, is used to the task of catching the same pitcher
for every start. And Kreuter's first taste of serving that role was
with one of the all-time greats.

   ``I was Nolan Ryan's personal catcher as a (1989 rookie in
Texas).'' Kreuter said. ``I wouldn't have played my year in the big
leagues in 1989 if it wasn't for Nolan Ryan wanting me to be his
personal catcher. I think it's an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter considered himself a ``sponge'' learning under the
tutelage of Ryan that season. Now he's the grizzled veteran and
tutoring the 26-year-old Park for as long he sticks around.

<P>
   ``I'm not going to be here all the time to catch him,'' Kreuter
said. ``It's impossible. I'm 36. ... If I last another 10 years,
it'd be a miracle.''

   NEW YORK _ Dear Diary: I was recently seated in the second row
at a preview performance of ``Imperfect Chemistry,'' a new musical
at the Minetta Lane Theater. As the couple seated beside me were
settling in, the woman apologized to those within earshot for any
potential inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   She explained that she had rescued an injured pigeon from the
street, got a paper bag from a nearby store and brought the poor
creature to the theater so she could take it to the veterinarian
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   There was some crinkling and crackling of the bag at first as
the bird rattled around, but as the first musical number began, it
settled down and was quiet for the rest of the show. One can only
suppose it approved of the music. &QL;

Ron and Di Oates, recent visitors from England. Their conclusion:
``In any given encounter (cash register, ticket desk, sidewalk
collision), New Yorkers will be indifferent, brusque, uncivil and
even hostile. If, however, you are willing to wait 10 seconds,
until their public carapaces have melted, they will become the most
gracious, accommodating people on earth.''

DEMOCRATS START 27-HOUR MARATHON 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Al Gore punched in for a 27-hour Labor Day
campaign shift Sunday, hoping that his round-the-clock, four-state
swing would show unity with laborers, differentiate his work habits
from George W. Bush, and maintain his momentum as the
general-election campaign begins in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with running mate Joseph I. Lieberman, the vice
president set out on a 2,900-mile, daylong sprint to four key
electoral states: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with construction workers in Philadelphia, the
pair planned to meet with late-shift hospital employees in Flint,
Mich., and early-shift bakery workers and firefighters in Tampa,
Fla. Gore was then scheduled for an afternoon parade and labor
speech in Pittsburgh, followed by a speech Monday at a motor
speedway in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was to attend Detroit's annual Labor Day festivities
before heading off to a Toledo Mud Hens baseball game Monday in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing it to honor your work and to focus on Labor Day
what we ought to be focusing on, and that is the families who are
paying the bills, making ends meet, and paying the home
mortgages,'' a khaki-clad Gore told about 125 workers who sat on
piles of plasterboard and joint compound at a hotel construction
site overlooking the Delaware River.
</P>
<P>
   He said the difference between him and Bush is that ``we're for
the people, and he's for the powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president closed by shouting a union slogan to a bevy
of cheers: ``Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell, and
organize.''
</P>
<P>
   Introducing Gore to the union laborers, Lieberman cracked about
their schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to think vice presidential candidates ought to
have collective-bargaining rights; this guy's working me too
hard,'' the Connecticut senator said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The workers appreciated the attention and novel campaign tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the fellas on this job, we're workers,'' said Ray Della
Vella, a union electrician from Philadelphia. ``We respect other
workers. By the vice president staying up all night, it shows he's
one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to igniting the fall campaign, Gore's campaign
marathon forced a response from Bush. The Republican presidential
contender, who recently has been campaigning three days a week,
scotched plans for a long weekend at his ranch and instead
campaigned in Arkansas and Louisiana on Friday. Last night, he flew
to Chicago to prepare for campaign appearances Monday in Illinois,
Michigan, and Pennsylvania, a schedule change made after the
campaign learned of Gore's trip.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, Bush plans to participate in a parade in
Naperville, Ill., before heading to a peach festival in Romeo,
Mich. He then plans to hold campaign events in Pennsylvania and
Indiana, for a total of four days of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Governor George E. Pataki of New York, a Bush supporter, issued
a statement ridiculing Gore's trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weekend, Vice President Gore will spend 24 hours trying
to make up for seven years of squandered opportunities,'' Pataki
said. ``In the last seven years, Al Gore has failed to take
advantage of bipartisan opportunities to help working families on
key issues like health care, prescription drugs, education, and tax
fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has gained in national and state polls since last month's
Democratic National Convention, but an Ohio poll suggests that Bush
still leads in a key Midwestern battleground. Bush had 49 percent
and Gore 43 percent in a Columbus Dispatch poll, which also showed
2 percent support for Green Party candidate Ralph Nader. The Ohio
mail poll had a margin of error of 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new Gannett poll in New Jersey showed Gore leading
Bush 39 percent to 32 percent. The New Jersey poll had a margin of
error of 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The marathon had a festive air as Gore arrived in Philadelphia.
Campaign aides gave reporters caps from the ``Survivor'' television
series, as well as a T-shirt showing their nonstop route, and a bag
of toiletries. They dubbed the swing ``Al and Joe's Hard Day's
Night Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Gore and Lieberman plan to return to a normal schedule
and promote a comprehensive economic plan. They were scheduled to
spend the bulk of the week in the Midwest, with Gore also visiting
Louisiana on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call with reporters Sunday, Lieberman
responded to criticism that he has invoked religion too much on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try not to talk too much about religion,'' the
senator said. He added that he believes in ``the separation of
church and state,'' but also that ``faith has played a very
important role'' in the nation's history.

JAPAN TURNS EARTHQUAKE DRILL INTO MILITARY EXERCISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS spelling to ``Shirahige'' thruout) 
By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ As smoke pots simulating fires spewed yellow fumes from
the buildings, military trucks rumbled into Shirahige Nishi, a
dilapidated quarter of Tokyo on Sunday, rushing in olive-uniformed
reinforcements for civilian rescue squads overwhelmed by the
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   With clattering helicopters dancing green against the blue skies
above, just when the action seemed to reach its peak, this show's
director swooped in. With clockwork precision, he stuck to an
elaborate schedule of visits to Tokyo neighborhoods to view staged
earthquake devastation.
</P>
<P>
   The choreographer of all of this action was Shintaro Ishihara,
the very pleased-looking governor of Tokyo prefecture who has long
been known as a populist conservative showman. It was clearly a
moment of glory for this politician, who had turned a hitherto
boring annual earthquake-readiness drill _ traditionally held in
early September in recognition of the Great Tokyo Earthquake on
Sept. 1, 1923 _ into one of the largest military exercises that
most Japanese have seen since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister had to content himself with a low-profile
visit to a basement command room of Japan's Self Defense Forces to
monitor the drill's progress before rushing off to greet the
visiting Russian president.
</P>
<P>
   But Ishihara, who flitted from one neighborhood to another all
day aboard a red rescue helicopter, was fulfilling a nationalist's
dream: returning the military to the national stage, and being
hugged by female admirers at every step.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the rope lines of eager supporters who waved to the
governor all along his passage on Sunday, the appearance of more
than 7,000 uniformed soldiers in the streets of central Tokyo also
revived discussions of a militarist past that is fast fading from
living memory.
</P>
<P>
   Political activism may be feeble in Japan, but pacifism here
still runs deep. Many Japanese who questioned the need for a
military drill on this scale said that they see the exercise, Tokyo
Big Rescue, as being as much a public relations operation for the
military as a disaster-preparedness drill.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese politics have been inching rightward in recent years,
these critics say, and one of the cherished goals of many in the
governing Liberal Democratic Party is a revision of the
Constitution to allow Japan to field a full-fledged army for the
first time since its defeat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two purposes behind this exercise,'' said Atsuo
Nakamura, an opposition member of Parliament. ``Ishihara wants to
change the Constitution, and turn Japan into a big military country
again. The other purpose is that Japan is in very bad economic
condition, and politicians like this are trying to blame people of
other nationalities for our troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a very classic way of dealing with problems, just like
Hitler did. The Japanese people are very nationalistic, and he
wants to awaken this feeling to become more popular.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The earthquake drill's link to questions of constitutional
reform, nationalism and xenophobia is the doing of Ishihara, who
has made a career of right-wing causes, from planting Japanese
flags on tiny islands disputed between Japan and China to
worshipping at shrines associated with war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Ishihara set a divisive tone for the exercise while
addressing members of the Self Defense Force. ``Third-country
nationals and foreigners who have entered Japan illegally have
perpetrated heinous crimes,'' he said. ``In the event of a major
earthquake, riots could break out, and there is a limit to the
police's ability to cope with such a situation alone. I want you to
carry out your mission, not only to deal with natural disasters,
but also to maintain law and order.''
</P>
<P>
   Ishihara has since apologized to Tokyo's foreign residents for
his remarks, after being reminded that as many as 7,000 Koreans
were killed in mob attacks by Japanese troops and civilians during
the turmoil of the 1923 earthquake, after rumors spread that they
were committing sabotage or even had caused the natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   His aides have since tried to focus the debate on the need to
use the rarely activated army to assist in disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   But his office continues to make xenophobic statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking the Koreans have made a good adjustment to
this country, but we still have many illegal Chinese who are
penetrating this country illegally and are carrying out terrible
crimes,'' said Atsuyuki Sassa, a security adviser to Ishihara.
``There are Iranians, and others. We have many new problems as a
result of this. And what Mr. Ishihara was saying is that we must
maintain peace and order in the case of a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Saturday, Ishihara himself dismissed critics of the drill
as ``left-wing idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   Several associations of foreign residents in Japan have
responded warily to the drill, counting it as the latest sign of
mounting hostility toward other Asians in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right wing in Japan has always been very hostile to
Koreans and Chinese,'' said So Chungo-On, director of Chosensoren,
an association of residents of Korean descent. ``These kinds of
people feel that the past history of the military in Japan is
glorious. All we can do is hope that this drill is not aimed at us.
More than 55 years has passed since the war ended, and the old ways
of thinking should have changed by now as we enter the century of
internationalization. The governor himself should be a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In Shirahige Nishi, an area of grassy plots and collapsing
hovels chosen for the drills, Kudo Chisato, a lifelong resident,
peered out from her shingled home, one of the few sturdy buildings
remaining in the area. She declared the drills great entertainment,
as the first helicopters appeared and firemen began extinguishing
imaginary blazes with their hoses.
</P>
<P>
   But asked if such a show of force was needed to rein in lawless
foreigners, she scoffed. ``I'm not worried at all,'' she said,
before referring to the 1923 quake, with its mob killings. ``What
happened before was 80 years ago. The Japanese are gentle now, and
it is unlikely that foreigners would pose a threat either.''
