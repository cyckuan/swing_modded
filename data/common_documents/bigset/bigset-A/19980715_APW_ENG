Group may ask Australians to boycott Dow Corning over breast

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A consumer group may call on
Australians to boycott U.S. chemicals giant Dow Corning to protest
a settlement offered to local women whose breast implants went
badly wrong, a member of the group said Wednesday.
	   Dow Corning, a leading manufacturer of silicone breast implants
which women claimed caused fatigue, pain and auto-immune disease,
last week agreed to pay U.S. dlrs 3.2 billion (Australian dollars
5.2 billion) to settle claims by at least 170,000 women.
	   Lawyer Peter Cashman, who is representing the Australian
claimants, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio Wednesday from
Washington that his clients had only been offered 60 cents for each
dollar offered to American women.
	   ``That's certainly not fair. They deserve equality of
representation in the courts and also equality in compensation for
pain and trauma,'' said Sally Nathan, senior health policy adviser
for the Australian Consumers Association.
	   Nathan said the association will decide by the end of the week
whether it will take the unusual step of calling for a boycott of
Dow Corning products, which range from building adhesives to
cookware.
	   ``We see a boycott as a viable option for Australian consumers
to show their support for the women and also to vent their anger,''
Nathan said.
	   Cheryl Peters of Melbourne, who had silicon breast implants in
1985, told The Associated Press the lower offer to Australian women
was ``totally unfair.''
	   ``Australian women are just as damaged, just as sick and the
outlook for them is just as bleak as that of the American women,''
Peters said.
	   Consumer organizations are also urging the Australian government
to demand equality for the 6,000 Australian women whose health has
been damaged by the implants.
	   Federal Health Minister Michael Wooldridge has so far not
commented on the offer.

Computer card maker Adaptec lays off 350 from Singapore plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S. electronics firm Adaptec Inc. has laid off
a third of the work force at its Singapore operations, the company
said Wednesday.
	   As part of the company's ongoing global restructuring, the
Milpitas, California-based company is cutting back in Singapore
where it produces cards for personal computers by laying off 350
people.
	   The cuts amount to approximately 10 percent of the company's
worldwide staff.
	   ``Significant changes in the PC industry continue to impact
almost every leading computer-related manufacturer, including
Adaptec,'' chairman Grant Saviers said in a company statement
issued from the United States.
	   ``This difficult but necessary step is one of many that will
assist us in aligning expenses with revenue.''
	   According to the Singapore branch's human resources director,
the company had introduced a number of cost cutting measures in the
last few months, including shorter work weeks and temporary shut
downs.
	   But worsening economic conditions and the general slowdown in
global demand for its products finally compelled the company to
reduce its work force. No further retrenchments are planned,
however.
	   Adaptec has been operating in Singapore since 1987, and is
currently constructing a new manufacturing facility due for
completion and operation later this year.

Foreign firms big buyers of Japan's bad loans: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Foreign investors have bought some 4 trillion yen
(dlrs 26 billion) worth of bad loans from Japanese financial
institutions since last fall, Japan's leading financial newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs and Co. and other foreign
firms have been active buying bad loans from Japanese banks,
insurers and other financial companies at 10 percent to 50 percent
of their original value, the paper said.
	   Most of the loans were backed by real estate properties, the
report said.
	   Japan's financial system is burdened with some 77 trillion yen
(dlrs 550 billion) in bad loans, many left from the collapse of
Japan's real estate and stock markets at the beginning of the
1990s.
	   The purchases by foreign companies come even as cleaning up the
bad loan mess has become a top priority of the Japanese government,
which sees this as a necessary step for reviving an anemic economy.
	   Japan wants to shed hundreds of billions of dollars in bad debt
as part of an effort to rekindle its stagnant economy.
	   In December, Goldman Sachs announced it would buy up to dlrs 3.8
billion worth of property-backed bad loans from Japanese banks by
the end of 1998.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Tribesmen angered by government fuel price
hikes ambushed troops in an oil-rich region of Yemen, killing eight
soldiers, a tribal leader said.
	   The army retaliated after the attack Monday, sending helicopter
gunships to fire missiles at suspected tribal hideouts, the
opposition al-Wihadawy newspaper said Tuesday. There were no
casualties, it said.
	   The ambush occurred in the hills of al-Jawaf and Marib, an
oil-rich region 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the
capital, San'a, said the tribal leader, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Tribesmen have blown up seven pipelines in the area since June
19, when the government raised the prices of gasoline, kerosene and
cooking gas by 40 percent to meet International Monetary Fund
demands to remove oil subsidies.
	   In its drive for financial reform, the government has already
cut other subsidies and stepped up privatization of
state-controlled companies.
	   The government has sent reinforcements to Marib and al-Jawaf to
quell the unrest, Al-Wihadawy said. It said more than 50 tanks,
dozens of armored personnel carriers and heavy artillery were seen
moving toward Marib.
	   The government has not released a death toll from the clashes,
but the Yemen Times newspaper said earlier this month that 52
people were killed and 214 injured.
	   In a separate incident, five people were killed and two were
seriously injured Monday night after grenades, rockets and guns
stored in their house exploded, security officials said Tuesday.
	   The explosion occurred in Lahj, 35 kilometers (21 miles) north
of the southern port city of Aden. The arms cache was apparently a
remnant of the 1994 civil war and exploded accidentally, the
officials said.

Japan ruling party elders scramble to name new prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Planned
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Meeting behind closed doors and sliding screens,
Japanese ruling party members on Wednesday began sketching out
strategies for how to replace outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and win back their plunging public support.
	   Hashimoto's sudden decision Monday to resign over his Liberal
Democratic Party's disastrous performance in weekend elections has
left party elders with no obvious successor to fill the void,
though several possible contenders have emerged.
	   On Wednesday, the party asked for candidates to formally step
forward, a move which increases the pressure to settle on a party
standard bearer and which is hoped will cool the wave of
speculation that has dominated Japan's media.
	   The party was expected to schedule a vote of its lawmakers in
both houses of Parliament to formally select a new party head next
Tuesday. A vote in Parliament, likely before the end of the month,
would be then held to choose the prime minister.
	   While the conservative ruling party suffered a setback in upper
house of Parliament elections held Sunday, it still enjoys control
over the Cabinet because it has a comfortable majority in the more
powerful lower house. Thus its party president is assured of
becoming prime minister.
	   But the party appears torn between calls for a fresh face in the
wake of its defeat at the polls, a desire to nominate a veteran pol
with a proven track record and a tradition for reaching a broad
consensus on its leadership.
	   Moving to fill the power vacuum, the Liberal Democrat's biggest
faction has begun to close ranks around Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi, a soft-spoken insider not known for bold policy
initiatives.
	   The Yomiuri newspaper, Japan's largest daily, reported Wednesday
that Obuchi will publicly throw his hat into the ring on Thursday.
	   While he has few enemies within the party, Obuchi is viewed by
some as a puppet for party elders who could prove an unpopular and
ineffective leader.
	   Another likely contender is Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi, a
maverick favored by younger party members. But Koizumi's chances
may be hurt by his status as a lone wolf and his efforts in the
past to privatize the postal ministry _ a traditional bastion of
support for the LDP.
	   Other possibilities include former Chief Cabinet Secretary
Seiroku Kajiyama, a senior LDP politician with a reputation for
bluntness and business sense, and Yohei Kono _ the only former
party head who has yet to serve as prime minister.
	   The absence of a consensus so far has been reflected on Tokyo's
financial markets, where stocks and the yen have traded little
changed as investors await the decision of ruling party bosses.
	   Optimism that the choice of a Hashimoto successor will be
accompanied by new steps to stimulate Japan's recessionary economy
have been offset by nagging concerns economic policy will be held
hostage to the same type of political haggling which dogged the
outgoing administration.
	   Critics have urged the party to be open in its selection of a
new premier.
	   ``A debate (on succession) which evokes the people's sympathy
will restore confidence in the Liberal Democratic Party, but such
trust is not born in smoky back rooms,'' the Mainichi newspaper
said in an editorial published Wednesday.

White woman loses refugee claim based on racism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: The name `Cherryl' is correct.

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ A South African woman who claimed
refugee status based on her race as a Caucasian has lost her case
to stay in Australia, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic
Affairs said Wednesday.
	   Cherryl Kennedy, 39, formerly of Johannesburg, has vowed never
to return to the homeland she fled with her two daughters a year
ago, complaining of alleged reverse discrimination and violence
because of her race.
	   Her application for refugee status was seen as a test case that
could have opened a floodgate into Australia for the white
population of post-apartheid South Africa.
	   The Kennedy family, which is now living in a camper-van in
Broome, Western Australia, has been given until the end of the
month to leave the country.
	   The spokesman said she could stay in Australia pending a ruling
if she chose to appeal the Australia Refugee Review Tribunal's
decision in Australian Federal Court.
	   Kennedy and her daughters, Cami-lee, 10, and Giselle, 8, arrived
in Perth in July last year on tourist visas but with the intention
of applying for refugee status.
	   Kennedy could not be contacted Wednesday for comment.

Thai Buddhist clergy will rule next week on controversial statue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Supreme Council of Buddhist
monks will rule next week whether to demolish a statue of the
Buddha some worshippers find offensive, the government's Department
of Religious Affairs said Wednesday.
	   The statue at a temple in Chachoengsao, 30 kilometers (19 miles)
east of Bangkok, depicts the Buddha standing with an arm raised and
a globe of the world under his foot.
	   Some Buddhists in Thailand, including officials of the
government's Education Ministry and Department of Religious
Affairs, feel the pose is aggressive and therefore violates the
Buddha's teachings.
	   The monk who runs the temple where the statue resides, has
threatened to put a curse on anyone who attempts to demolish it.
	   An official with the Department of Religious Affairs was quoted
by The Nation newspaper Wednesday as saying that after having
conversations with the monk, he found him ``rather insane.''

Amid manhunt, Seoul demands North Korea apologize for provocations
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea demanded an apology from
North Korea Wednesday as a massive hunt for two possible communist
spies intensified with the report of a sighting.
	   While strongly condemning what he called North Korean military
provocations, President Kim Dae-jung said he will not alter his
engagement policy toward the Stalinist regime.
	   ``North Korea must immediately stop all hostile activities
against South Korea that threaten peace,'' Kim's National Security
Council said in a statement following a 1 1/2-hour meeting.
	   ``North Korea must admit involvement in the recent series of
provocations, apologize and punish those responsible for them,''
the statement said.
	   The statement said South Korea will coordinate with the United
States, Japan and other allies to put pressure on North Korea to
halt further provocations.
	   The statement also reconfirmed the president's hope to engage
the reclusive North through expanded cultural, business and
personal exchanges.
	   The security council meeting came on the fourth day of the hunt
for what South Korean officials believe are two North Korean
commandos who came ashore from a submarine Sunday.
	   They are thought to be companions of a man whose body, clad in a
black diving suit, washed ashore on an east coast beach. Found with
the body were a submachine gun, hand grenade and a torpedo-shaped
underwater propulsion device capable of carrying up to five scuba
divers.
	   North Korea already has denied involvement, accusing South
Korean ultra-rightists of staging the affair in an attempt to
derail the president's policy of accommodation toward the North.
Kim's conservative opposition has sharply attacked his policy,
calling it naive.
	   South Korean officials said the question of the body will be
raised at a meeting to be held at the border village of Panmunjom
Thursday between generals of the U.N. Command and North Korea.
	   The Seoul government also will report to the U.N. Security
Council about what it says were a recent series of North Korean
military incursions, they said.
	   Meanwhile, soldiers ringed a rugged mountain on the east coast
where a villager reported spotting two men clad in discolored
camouflage uniforms and carrying knapsacks.
	   ``The villager's report seems fairly credible,'' said Col. Hwang
Dong-kyu, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
	   Hwang said more troops were being thrown into the manhunt being
conducted along a rocky mountain ridge leading to the border with
North Korea.
	   It was the second North Korean infiltration reported along the
east coast this year, coming less than three weeks after a northern
submarine was found tangled in a fishing net on June 22.
	   Nine bodies were found in the small sub, all shot to death in
what military investigators described as a murder-suicide committed
by senior officers to avoid capture.
	   On Sept. 18, 1996, a larger North Korean submarine was found
stranded in the same general area, touching off a 53-day manhunt
for the craft's 26 occupants.
	   A North Korean infiltrator from that submarine was captured and
another was believed to have returned to the North across the land
border. The others were killed in the manhunt.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ With no concessions from a
hard-line government, Puerto Rico's biggest telephone union caved
in after a 26-day strike against privatization and agreed to go
back to work.
	   ``The majority of delegates was not willing to accept that there
would be no reprisals (from the government), so we are going back
to work without any conditions,'' Jose Juan Hernandez, president of
the Independent Union of Telephone Employees, said late Tuesday.
	   His organization represents 4,200 of the 6,400 telephone workers
who have been on strike since June 18. The smaller union has not
announced a decision.
	   The general strike was called to force the government to call an
island-wide referendum on the dlrs 1.9 billion sale of the Puerto
Rico Telephone Co. to the U.S. communications giant GTE Corp. and
other investors.
	   But Gov. Pedro Rossello has remained steadfast in arguing that
state enterprises cannot compete in the new global marketplace.
	   Earlier Tuesday, there appeared to be a deadlock in this week's
talks to try to resolve the telephone workers' complaints. Details
about the union's decision were not available.
	   The telephone workers' demonstrations provoked the biggest labor
protest in Puerto Rico, when about 60 unions joined a two-day
general strike in support of the telephone workers that snarled
traffic and slowed commerce until it ended on July 8.
	   The telephone company says it has lost dlrs 10 million because
of damage caused by saboteurs who slashed telephone cables. The
unions deny their members are responsible for sabotage that left
more than 350,000 customers without phone service at one point,
because of slashed lines.
	   The sale of the telephone company is the most ambitious deal in
the privatization project of Rossello, who already has sold
government hospitals and ports and plans to move on to the
electricity and water utilities.

Japan's first electric car rental business starts in Kobe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's first car rental agency to feature electric
cars opened its doors Wednesday in hopes of tapping into a
fledgling market for environmentally-friendly transportation.
	   The Kobe Eco Car Co., located in the western city of Kobe,
offers 24 electric cars and 4 gas-electric hybrid automobiles. It
plans to increase its green fleet to a total of 80 vehicles by next
spring.
	   ``We expect the new service will be seen as good for both the
local environment and Kobe tourist industry,'' said company
spokesman Hiroko Kishi.
	   But customers will have to watch the fuel gauge carefully since
there are only 24 designated locations throughout Kobe for
recharging electric cars.
	   Toyota Motor Corp. and Osaka Gas Co. are among the 35 corporate
backers of Kobe Eco Car, which is capitalized at 200 million yen
(dlrs 1.43 million).
	   Kobe is located 435 kilometers (270 miles) west of Tokyo.

East Timor bishop urges U.N. to stay away from tense territory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) - With tensions mounting in East Timor, a
Nobel peace laureate has urged the U.N. envoy for the troubled
territory to postpone his visit to Indonesia this week.
	   Bishop Carlos Belo, one of East Timor's most vocal critics of
Indonesian policy, said the security situation in the former
Portuguese colony had deteriorated because of the planned visit.
	   U.N. envoy Jamsheed Marker was scheduled to arrive in Indonesia
on Thursday, and a spokesman for the United Nations in New York
said he is expected to visit Indonesian-controlled East Timor.
	   During Marker's last visit in March 1997, Indonesian soldiers
killed two pro-independence protesters during a rally timed to
coincide with his trip.
	   Last month, security forces killed another two activists in East
Timor during protests held to impress three visiting European
ambassadors.
	   ``I call on Jamsheed Marker to postpone his planned visit this
time to East Timor. That is my opinion,'' the Suara Timor Timur
newspaper on Wednesday quoted Belo as saying.
	   He suggested that Marker come instead in September or October.
	   Belo, who won the Nobel peace prize in 1996 for his efforts to
solve the long conflict in his homeland, also called on the
Indonesian government to consider his suggestion.
	   ``Don't worsen the situation any more,'' he said.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the United Nations to
Belo's appeal.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has said a visit by
Marker to East Timor would not be wise because it would likely
increase tensions.
	   On Wednesday, about 400 students staged a peaceful,
anti-Indonesian demonstration on the grounds of the University of
East Timor in Dili, the capital.
	   Half a dozen trucks carrying police and soldiers drove slowly
past the campus as banner-waving protesters shouted slogans calling
for a vote on independence. They also demanded the release of
Xanana Gusmao, a jailed separatist rebel leader from East Timor.
	   Tensions have been high in East Timor this week not only because
of Marker's scheduled visit but also because the 22nd anniversary
of Indonesia's annexation of the territory falls on Friday.
	   Scared by the possibility of escalating protests and reprisals
from indigenous residents, tens of thousands of non-Timorese
Indonesian settlers have fled since late last month. Many shops are
closed in Dili as their owners have left town.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troops
intervened in a civil war that broke out as Portugal abandoned the
half-island territory.
	   The United Nations, Portugal and many other governments refuse
to recognize Indonesian sovereignty there.

NEW YORK: 25th save.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Reds 7, Cardinals 4 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In St. Louis, Eddie Taubensee's three-run homer snapped a tie in
the seventh inning as Cincinnati won its ninth straight game.
	   The streak, which follows an 11-game losing streak, is the Reds'
longest since they also won nine straight from May 22-31, 1995.
	   Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire, who leads the majors with 40
home runs, did not start for the first time since June 4 _ when he
was out with back spasms. McGwire pinch hit for Tom Pagnozzi with
one on and two out in the ninth, and grounded out to third to end
the game.
	   Ron Gant and Gary Gaetti homered for St. Louis. Gant has homered
in all four games since coming off the disabled list.
	   St. Louis starter Todd Stottlemyre (9-8) was hammered for 12
hits and seven runs _ six earned _ in seven innings.
	   Scott Sullivan (2-4) pitched three scoreless innings for the win
and Danny Graves finished for his first career save.
 &UR; Phillies 4, Brewers 2 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Scott Rolen's two-run double off Jeff Juden in the
eighth broke up a scoreless game and lifted Philadelphia.
	   Juden (7-8) surrendered back-to-back singles to Doug Glanville
and Gregg Jefferies to start the eighth before Rolen sent a 1-2
slider into the gap in left-center.
	   Wayne Gomes (8-3) pitched two innings for the win in relief of
Matt Beech, who gave up five hits in six innings. Mark Leiter
allowed Jeromy Burnitz's 20th homer in the ninth before picking up
his 19th save.
 &UR; Expos 2, Marlins 1 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Dustin Hermanson allowed five hits in eight innings
and overcame some shaky Montreal defense as the Expos snapped
Florida's season-high winning streak at four games.
	   Hermanson (7-7), traded by the Marlins before last season,
defeated his former teammates for the second time in five starts
since being dealt. Ugueth Urbina pitched a perfect ninth for his
23rd save.
	   Florida's Livan Hernandez (7-6) pitched eight innings, allowing
two runs and six hits, including an RBI double to Shane Andrews
that made it 2-1 in the fourth.
 &UR; Padres 8, Rockies 7 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Wally Joyner homered and drove in four runs as San
Diego ended Colorado's season-high four-game winning streak.
	   Ken Caminiti and Jim Leyritz also homered for the Padres, who
built a five-run lead before holding off Colorado in a typically
high-scoring game between the two teams.
	   In 21 games at Coors Field, San Diego and Colorado have never
combined for fewer than 10 runs.
	   San Diego's Tony Gwynn ended a career-worst 0-for-19 slump with
a second-inning single and finished 1-for-5.
	   Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his 28th save this season
and 36th straight dating to last year. He retired Vinny Castilla on
a fly to the wall in center for the second out, and has now
converted 55 of his last 56 save chances.
 &UR; Astros 4, Diamondbacks 2 &QC; 
	   In Phoenix, Shane Reynolds became the NL's fourth 12-game
winner, picking up his fifth victory in a row as Houston snapped a
four-game losing streak.
	   Reynolds (12-5) gave up a run in the first and another on Danny
Klassen's solo homer in the seventh. In between, he shut out the
Diamondbacks on one hit and gave up five hits in 7 2-3 innings.
	   Reynolds is 9-2 since losing in Kerry Wood's 20-strikeout
performance in Chicago May 6. Billy Wagner got the final four outs
for his 22nd save.
	   Derek Bell and Moises Alou homered in Houston's four-run third
inning off Omar Daal (3-5).
 &UR; Dodgers 2, Giants 1 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, Robb Nen's wild pitch scored Raul Mondesi with
two outs in the ninth inning.
	   Nen's 1-0 pitch to rookie Adrian Beltre with the bases loaded
was in the dirt and got by catcher Brian Johnson, allowing Mondesi
to score standing up.
	   Mondesi started the winning rally off John Johnstone (2-5) by
hitting a one-out double off third baseman Bill Mueller's glove _
his third hit of the game.
	   Scott Radinsky (4-4) got the win by striking out five in two
innings.

Bangkok Post violated order not to run false advertisement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Consumer Protection Board
has ruled that the Bangkok Post violated a board order not to run
an advertisement containing inflated readership figures, the
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The Post, an English-language daily, ran an ad claiming it had
three times as many Thai readers as any other English-language
daily.
	   That prompted its archrival, The Nation, to file a complaint
with the Consumer Protection Board which ordered the Post not to
run the ad.
	   Because the Post subsequently ran the ad, the board's
advertising committee will recommend the paper be fined, the Post
reported.
	   The Post issued a statement Wednesday saying it respects the
ruling of the committee and would like to stress it had no
intention of violating its order.
	   Both the Post and The Nation once claimed circulations of about
50,000 each. But both _ and particularly The Nation _ have lost
readership and suffered financial difficulties because of the high
cost of newsprint and economic problems associated with Asia's
financial crisis.

Indonesian capital sinking as residents pump underground water
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's economy has been spiraling
downwards for the past year. Now a worried geologist says its
capital city is sinking as well, and that high rise buildings might
soon start to lean and crack.
	   Hasanuddin Abidan of the Bandung Technology Institute said some
areas in Jakarta had sunk more than 50 centimeters (19 inches) in
recent years because its residents are tapping excessive amounts of
underground water.
	   Many of the coastal city's 10 million people use pumps and wells
to supplement their daily water needs.
	   Abidan was quoted by the Indonesian Observer newspaper Wednesday
as saying the capital's land mass is crumbling as the problem
accelerates.
	   He said tall office and apartment buildings were at risk. Many
were built during boom times in the early 1990s, but are now
largely empty because of a year-long economic crisis.
	   The phenomenon could cause river currents to shift and allow
corrosive sea water to leach inland where it can damage the
foundations of buildings.
	   He said his research was based on satellite global positioning
technology. It showed that some beaches in northern Jakarta had
sunk between 40 and 59 centimeters (15 and 23 inches) since 1994.
	   Some inland areas had dropped by up to 30 centimeters (11
inches) during the same period.
	   Jakarta sits on what had been swampland on the northern coast of
the main island, Java.
	   Dutch colonizers drained the area hundreds of years ago by
building canals that soon became a source of disease.
	   Nowadays the metropolis is facing new health problems. It has no
common sewage system and sometimes underground water is
contaminated by cesspits and garbage dumps.

Released worker says Saudis caned proselytizing Filipinos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Saudi Arabian authorities caned some
Filipino workers who were detained for attempting to spread
Christianity in the Islamic country, one of the workers said
Wednesday.
	   Hilario Somera, an engineer who returned home Wednesday, said
Saudi authorities used a wooden stick to hit some of the detained
Filipinos on the palms and buttocks to force them to admit their
offense.
	   Preaching Christianity is forbidden in Saudi Arabia.
	   Somera was one of about 30 Filipinos detained in recent weeks in
Saudi Arabia for preaching Christianity. He was among at least
eight who were released after the intercession of Philippine
diplomats.
	   The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines sought the
Philippine government's help in securing the Filipinos' release
after learning of their detention. The Vatican also expressed
concern over the arrests.
	   Somera said about six groups of Filipinos were arrested last
month while going around a neighborhood in Riyadh and leaving
Arabic-language Bibles concealed in plastic bags on the doors of
Arab residents.
	   While some of the Filipinos were caned, most were treated well
in detention, said Somera, who returned home Wednesday with three
other released Filipinos. Four others returned on Tuesday.
	   Somera said all the detained Filipinos were banned for life from
entering Saudi Arabia.

IMF to issue next installment for Indonesian bailout package soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund will issue the
next installment of its bailout package for Indonesia as early as
Thursday, the organization's senior representative in the country
said.
	   The IMF will release the next tranche, worth dlrs 1 billion,
``hopefully in a day or two,'' Kadhim Al-Eyd told reporters in
Singapore on Wednesday after a conference on Indonesian debt
restructuring.
	   Al-Eyd said the IMF's executive board is expected to complete
its second and final review on the installment when it meets later
in the day in Washington, D.C.
	   ``Once that is done, then the next payment will be available
immediately to Indonesia, so it could be released even tomorrow
(Thursday),'' he said.
	   Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, has been
promised dlrs 43 billion from the IMF that is being paid in
portions, though previous installments were delayed due to the
political and social unrest there two months ago.
	   The beleaguered country is requesting an additional dlrs four
billion to dlrs six billion rescue package from the fund to help it
through its most severe economics crisis in decades.
	   Al-Eyd added that ``at least the minimum level has been secured,
or 4 billion, and substantial progress is being also achieved
towards securing the additional two billion, which is a safety
margin to assure that whatever financing we have will be met under
the program.''
	   He said the IMF is pleased so far with Indonesia's
implementation of the reform program and ``the government is very
committed, the economic team is working very hard to put these
policies in place.''
	   Indonesia's new government ``deserves the support not only of
the IMF but of the rest of the international community,'' he added.

 &UR; Hanson: Aboriginal voting rights may have been a mistake
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with prime minister's comment. Edits to trim.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Right-wing populist leader Pauline
Hanson's remark that Australians should have thought twice about
allowing Aborigines to vote was a ``sinister'' hint about
restricting voting rights, Prime Minister John Howard said
Wednesday.
	   In a speech to about 500 people at a One Nation party
fund-raising dinner Tuesday night, Hanson said that while
Aborigines had a tough time in the past, the tables had now turned
``too far the other way.''
	   ``Aboriginals have had it very tough in the past and I admit
that _ they were mistreated,'' said Hanson, who is an independent
member of federal Parliament from Queensland.
	   ``They didn't have the right to vote until the Australian
people, in the referendum of 1967 when they cast that vote _ when
they believed that Aboriginals should have the right to vote and
should be treated equally, the same as everyone else.
	   ``But if Australians knew today what was foreshadowed for them,
they would have thought twice about casting that vote because they
were looking at giving the Aboriginal race equality.
	   ``But over the years the pendulum has gone too far the other way
and now there is so much discrimination, so much inequality in our
society that it is causing resentment amongst all people,'' she
said.
	   Howard told Parliament on Wednesday that there are two major
areas of concern about Hanson's statements.
	   ``By far the most sinister of those is that (Hanson) has
actually entertained the notion that one section of the Australian
community should not have the right to vote,'' he said.
	   He said the 1967 referendum had not been about giving Aborigines
the right to vote, as Hanson said.
	   It had been about including Aborigines in national census counts
and giving the Australian Parliament the right to make laws for
Aboriginal people.
	   Hanson and her One Nation party believe Aborigines are now too
privileged, and want the abolition of any welfare or other special
programs designed to help them.
	   Australia has a wide variety of welfare and aid programs for
various special interest groups, ranging from refugees to
unemployed young people to drought-stricken farmers.
	   Federal Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron also accused
Hanson of being misinformed after she said indigenous people were
only given the right to vote in the 1967 referendum.
	   Herron said indigenous people were not subjected to any specific
restrictions against their right to vote in South Australia, New
South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.
	   ``Restrictions were lifted in Western Australia in 1962 and in
Queensland in 1965,'' he said.
	   ``The Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1962 gave indigenous
Australians the unqualified right to enroll and vote in federal
elections,'' he said.
	   Aborigines make up about 386,000 of Australia's 18 million
people.
	   They consistently have the highest poverty and disease rates,
highest infant mortality rates and shortest life spans of any
Australian group.

Residents near Indonesian volcano wear masks against dust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Some villagers living on the slopes of
Indonesia's most active volcano are wearing masks as protection
against volcanic dust, the Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
	   Mount Merapi spewed out tons of ash and gas in a short but
dramatic eruption on Saturday. No injuries or damage were reported.
	   However, residents have complained that lingering dust has
caused havoc to daily life around the 2,968-meter (9,737-foot) peak
in the center of the island of Java, one of the world's most
densely populated regions.
	   ``The area has been covered by the dusty haze. Rooftops and
trees have been shrouded with dust and ash,'' the paper quoted one
resident, identified by the single name of Agus, as saying.
	   He said some villagers had been affected by the dust and had
taken to wearing homemade masks.
	   Lava and gases began to pour from the top of the volcano last
week and an alert was raised. However, no evacuations have been
ordered and volcanic activity has since subsided.
	   Merapi, near Yogyakarta, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) east
of Jakarta, is the most active of Indonesia's 500 volcanoes.
	   A sudden eruption in 1994 sent a steam cloud that flattened a
village on its slopes, killing 60 inhabitants and severely burning
others.
	   Its most destructive eruption this century killed 1,300 people
in 1930.

Hong Kong gets pledge of mainland help to clear cargo problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In a sign of the mainland's growing importance
to Hong Kong, a top official worked out an agreement with Chinese
officials Wednesday to help clear a cargo backlog from Hong Kong's
new airport.
	   China on Tuesday offered to open up Huangtian airport in
Shenzhen, just across the boundary from Hong Kong to cargo flights
and streamline customs procedures.
	   It was an indication of the ties between Hong Kong and the
adjacent mainland region that both sides say they want to foster
since Hong Kong was handed back to China last year. And it was a
rare case of the prosperous territory seeking help from the
mainland to solve its problems.
	   Stephen Ip, Hong Kong's secretary for economic services,
traveled to Shenzhen to meet with civil aviation and customs
officials from Beijing as well as Chen Zuo'er, China's deputy
director of Hong Kong and Macau affairs.
	   ``The central government will cooperate fully with the Hong Kong
government until the problems are solved,'' Chen told Hong Kong's
commercial radio.
	   Ip told official Hong Kong radio after the meeting that the two
sides agreed on a contingency plan under which it would take only
about four to five hours for air cargo arriving at Huangtian to
reach Hong Kong.
	   The first priority still was for Hong Kong's main cargo handler
to straighten out its problems locally, Ip said.
	   The Hong Kong Standard newspaper quoted Xie Feng, spokesman for
Huangtian airport, as saying it could handle 20 to 30 cargo flights
per day for Hong Kong, or about 2,000-3,000 tons of cargo.
	   Some cargo also has been shipped to Macau, the Portuguese
territory about 70 kilometers (45 miles) from Hong Kong along the
Chinese coast.
	   Airport officials said Wednesday that passenger services were
continuing to improve at the new Chek Lap Kok airport, built by
flattening small outlying islands about 30 kilometers (22 miles)
from central Hong Kong. Cargo services also were reported to be
picking up after a disastrous start that almost totally paralyzed
one of the world's biggest air cargo operations.
	   And Hong Kong's public transportation corporation said that 12
people arrested for allegedly using substandard construction
practices and materials were not working on stations for the
airport railroad, but sites adjacent to them.
	   In announcing the arrests on Tuesday, the Independent Commission
Against Corruption had said they were arrested for substandard
foundation work connected to the railroad.
	   Public transportation officials said Tuesday that the new route
to and from the airport was entirely safe.
	   Members of Hong Kong's legislature said they planned to quiz the
government on Wednesday about whether they would be able to meet a
pledge to have cargo operations back to normal by the weekend.
	   The Airport Authority said that on Tuesday, the new Chek Lap Kok
airport handled 1,400 tons of cargo, about a third of normal.

More workers join nationwide strike in South Korea

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ With police poised to arrest their
leaders, some 45,000 employees of state-run firms and five banks
joined a nationwide strike Wednesday to protest layoffs.
	   Organizers said the new walkouts brought to about 100,000 the
number of workers participating in the strike begun Tuesday by
metal workers in auto, shipbuilding and other heavy industries.
	   But the Labor Ministry said fewer than 60,000 workers
participated in the strike. It said many union members disobeyed
their leaders and did not take part.
	   About 50,000 unionized workers at Korea Telecom, the national
telephone company, refused to join the strike, saying negotiations
with management on wages and other issues were making progress.
	   The government said the strike would not hurt manufacturing
industries, most of which already have large inventories of unsold
goods.
	   Armed with court-issued warrants, police sought to arrest a
dozen union leaders on charges of organizing illegal strikes. They
included Dan Byong-ho, head of the Metal Industry Union.
	   Police said many of the striking unions failed to take legally
obliged steps such as seeking government mediation of their
disputes with management.
	   Most of the labor leaders sought by police took refuge at
Myongdong Church, a traditional safe haven for dissidents and
striking workers.
	   ``If the government tries to suppress our strikes with police
force, we will respond with an expanded strike,'' said Kim
Hyong-man, a spokesman for the militant Confederation of Korea
Trade Unions.
	   Some 5,000 striking workers held a rally at the church, shouting
anti-government slogans and singing labor songs. No riot police
were deployed around the church.
	   The government said the strikes would scare off badly needed
foreign investment, essential to revive the nation's ailing
economy.
	   ``Without restructuring of the public sector, there will no
reform,'' said Park Ji-won, a spokesman for President Kim Dae-jung.
	   ``The government repeatedly promised to do its best to minimize
job losses. The labor unions should come and talk to a tripartite
committee, not go for strikes,'' Park said.
	   The nation's two major union umbrella groups walked out of
negotiations with industry and government officials last week,
saying they would not return unless the government takes steps to
stop increasing layoffs.
	   ``We cannot help expressing our anger that the government is
poised to arrest workers who are fighting for their just rights. We
will go on with our schedule for the strike,'' the groups said in a
statement.
	   Restructuring South Korea's inefficient industries is a key
condition set by the International Monetary Fund, which bailed out
the country's economy late last year.
	   Since then, the number of jobless people has doubled to nearly
1.5 million and will likely top 2 million by the end of the year.
	   All of the strikers except 26,000 workers from the nation's
leading auto company, Hyundai Motors Co., were scheduled to return
to work Friday. The Hyundai strike was indefinite.

Thai central bank seeks help from J.P. Morgan on failed banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank said Wednesday
it is meeting with advisers from J.P. Morgan, the U.S.-based
international investment bank, on possible options for the disposal
of four failed commercial banks taken over by the government.
	   Bank of Thailand Deputy Director for Financial Institutions
Regulations Salinee Wangtal said a decision on the banks' future
will be announced by the end of the month.
	   Early this year, the central bank took over first Bangkok
Metropolitan Bank, then First Bangkok City Bank, Siam City Bank and
Bangkok Bank of Commerce. Write-downs wiped out virtually all
existing shareholder equity, and the central bank's rescue fund
swapped the banks' debt for new shares.
	   J.P. Morgan was appointed to advise on ways to privatize the
banks again. Officials from the group arrived this week to discuss
the options developed with central bank and finance ministry
officials, Salinee said.
	   ``The discussions will take into consideration the practicality
of the options and the benefits and damage to the (rescue fund) and
the economy of the country as a whole,'' Salinee said in a
statement.
	   Whatever the outcome, creditors and depositors are protected by
government guarantees, she said.
	   A central bank official said last month that only one or
possibly two business licenses should be sold, indicating a prior
merger was likely. But another official was cited in the local
press as saying that a merger of the banks separately with other
local institutions was in the cards.
	   A Thai research house said mergers with local institutions would
not address a dire need for new capital.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ With police poised to arrest their
leaders, some 45,000 employees of state-run firms and five banks
joined a nationwide strike Wednesday to protest layoffs.
	   Organizers said the new walkouts brought to about 100,000 the
number of workers participating in the strike begun Tuesday by
metal workers in auto, shipbuilding and other heavy industries.
	   But the Labor Ministry said fewer than 60,000 workers
participated in the strike. It said many union members disobeyed
their leaders and did not take part.
	   About 50,000 unionized workers at Korea Telecom, the national
telephone company, refused to join the strike, saying negotiations
with management on wages and other issues were making progress.
	   The government said the strike would not hurt manufacturing
industries, most of which already have large inventories of unsold
goods.
	   Armed with court-issued warrants, police sought to arrest a
dozen union leaders on charges of organizing illegal strikes. They
included Dan Byong-ho, head of the Metal Industry Union.
	   Police said many of the striking unions failed to take legally
obliged steps such as seeking government mediation of their
disputes with management.
	   Most of the labor leaders sought by police took refuge at
Myongdong Church, a traditional safe haven for dissidents and
striking workers.
	   ``If the government tries to suppress our strikes with police
force, we will respond with an expanded strike,'' said Kim
Hyong-man, a spokesman for the militant Confederation of Korea
Trade Unions.

Orangemen settle in for long siege at Drumcree
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with violence overnight &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The parades are over,
violence has ebbed, crowds near the Drumcree Anglican church have
thinned and the men of the Orange Order settled in for what may be
a long siege to demand their right to march through a Catholic
neighborhood.
	   ``Anybody who thinks that we are beaten and it's over is totally
misreading the situation. We are still going to be here,'' said
David Jones, spokesman for the Portadown Orange Lodges. ``We are
reviewing all the time where the protest action should go.''
	   Barbed wire, trenches, police and soldiers on Wednesday for the
11th day blocked the men of Northern Ireland's largest Protestant
fraternal order from marching through a hostile Catholic
neighborhood in Portadown. They are enforcing a decision by the
Parades Commission, created after trouble at Drumcree the past two
summers, to forbid the march.
	   Two years ago, police and soldiers stopped the march for four
days, but gave up in the face of violence across Northern Ireland
by Protestant hard-liners. Last year, police simply forced the
march through Catholic protesters.
	   But this year, authorities held firm against widespread
violence, which reached its depth Sunday with a firebombing that
killed three young sons of a Catholic woman.
	   Voilence was renewed early Wednesday when police fired plastic
bullets at protesters after being targeted with gasoline and blast
bombs and ball bearings. Gas cylinders also were set on fire.
	   Trucks and cars were torched at a garage in County Armagh and an
Orange Hall in north Antrim was attacked with gasoline bombs.

Singapore: will not change currency peg with Brunei dollar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore financial officials said Wednesday
their country has no intention of changing the official exchange
rate between its currency and the Brunei dollar.
	   The Monetary Authority of Singapore, the island nation's de
facto central bank, said it will maintain the government-set rate
of one Singapore dollar per Brunei dollar, the authority told Dow
Jones Newswires.
	   The currency peg was a source of debate among economists and
traders last week, following the Singapore dollar's depreciation
against the U.S. dollar.
	   Market observers also feared that the collapse earlier this
month of Brunei's largest private company, owned by the brother of
the sultan who rules the small Southeast Asian nation, would drain
Brunei's currency reserves and hurt its currency.
	   Singapore and Brunei signed an agreement in 1967 pegging their
currencies at an officially set exchange rate. The Singapore
government has reiterated that it has no intention of changing the
arrangement.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A commuter jetliner safely made an
emergency landing at Jakarta's main airport Wednesday after it
reported problems with its landing gear, witnesses said.
	   The twin-engined Fokker-100, with more than 20 passengers and
crew aboard, took off from Sukarno-Hatta International Airport at
6.20 a.m. (2320 GMT Tuesday).
	   It returned 30 minutes later with technical problems, Merpati
Nusantara Airlines said.
	   The airline declined to give further details. However,
passengers said they were told there had been a problem with one of
the plane's wheels.
	   Many of those on board were reporters, photographers and news
crews on their way to the disputed territory of East Timor, 2,000
kilometers (1,300 miles) to the east.
	   They had planned to cover a scheduled visit there by U.N.
special envoy Jamsheed Marker later this week.
	   Marker is trying to broker a peace deal for the half-island
territory, which has endured a separatist guerrilla war as well as
protests and human rights abuses since Indonesia annexed it in
1976.

Group may ask Australians to boycott Dow Corning over breast

 &UR; EDS: Updates with comment from government spokesman. &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A consumer group may call on
Australians to boycott U.S. chemicals giant Dow Corning to protest
a settlement offered to local women whose breast implants went
badly wrong, a member of the group said Wednesday.
	   Dow Corning, a leading manufacturer of silicone breast implants
which women claimed caused fatigue, pain and auto-immune disease,
last week agreed to pay U.S. dlrs 3.2 billion (Australian dollars
5.2 billion) to settle claims by at least 170,000 women.
	   Lawyer Peter Cashman, who is representing the Australian
claimants, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio Wednesday from
Washington that his clients had only been offered 60 cents for each
dollar offered to American women.
	   ``That's certainly not fair. They deserve equality of
representation in the courts and also equality in compensation for
pain and trauma,'' said Sally Nathan, senior health policy adviser
for the Australian Consumers Association.
	   Nathan said the association will decide by the end of the week
whether it will take the unusual step of calling for a boycott of
Dow Corning products, which range from building adhesives to
cookware.
	   ``We see a boycott as a viable option for Australian consumers
to show their support for the women and also to vent their anger,''
Nathan said.
	   Cheryl Peters of Melbourne, who had silicon breast implants in
1985, told The Associated Press the lower offer to Australian women
was ``totally unfair.''
	   ``Australian women are just as damaged, just as sick and the
outlook for them is just as bleak as that of the American women,''
Peters said.
	   Consumer organizations are also urging the Australian government
to demand equality for the 6,000 Australian women whose health has
been damaged by the implants.
	   Bill Royce, a spokesman for Health Minister Michael Wooldridge,
said it was outrageous that Australian women, who had suffered as
much as American women from the implants, should be offered less
compensation.
	   He said the Australian government did not have legal standing in
the U.S. court proceedings, but may be able to offer the Australian
women a statement of support.
	   ``It is quite outrageous _ and dare I say inhumane _ that
Australian women who have suffered in exactly the same way as
American women should only be offered 60 percent of the
compensation offered to them,'' Royce said.

 &UR; Australia: Indonesia will need international help for a long time
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Indonesia will continue to need
international financial aid ``over the coming year and beyond,''
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Wednesday.
	   Downer, who visited Indonesia last week, said in a speech that
President B.J. Habibie and his government are facing very difficult
times.
	   ``Undertaking a once-in-a-generation political transition and a
political reform process in the midst of a severe regional and
economic downturn is a daunting task,'' Downer said.
	   ``Indonesia will continue to need international financial
support over the coming year and beyond to allow the government to
see through its promise of fresh parliamentary and presidential
elections,'' he added.
	   But Downer also said the steps the international community is
already taking to help Indonesia provide solid grounds for
optimism.
	   ``Ideally these will, through the creation of a broadly based
leadership, establish the basis for a renewal of investor
confidence and economic revival in the long term,'' he said.
	   Downer, who was addressing Australian exporters in Melbourne,
said the East Asian region as a whole still faces very real
challenges.
	   But he urged business not to lose faith in the region.
	   ``It is important to ensure that the previously excessive
rhetoric regarding the East Asian economic miracle does not swing
too far the other way and become overly pessimistic,'' he said.
	   Australia has pledged U.S. dlrs 1 billion (1.6 billion
Australian dollars) to an International Monetary Fund rescue
package for Indonesia.
	   It has also stepped up bilateral aid to its northern neighbor
since the regional crisis began last August.
	   Indonesia wants the United States to contribute directly to an
additional U.S. dlrs 4 billion-6 billion rescue package the IMF is
putting together to help the Asian nation face a severe economic
crisis.
	   Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, already has
obtained a U.S. dlrs 43 billion IMF bailout that is being paid in
installments.
	   The United States, Japan and Australia agreed to participate in
the major bailout package with so-called second line of defense
funds.
	   Indonesia expects its economy to contract by 13 percent to 15
percent this year, the first time the economy has shrunk since
1963.
	   The country's currency, the rupiah, has lost 80 percent of its
value against the dollar.

Bangkok Post violated order not to run false advertisement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES wording in 1st graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Consumer Protection Board
has ruled that the Bangkok Post violated a board order not to run
an advertisement containing false claims about its readership, the
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The Post, an English-language daily, ran an ad claiming it had
three times as many Thai readers as any other English-language
daily.
	   That prompted its archrival, The Nation, to file a complaint
with the Consumer Protection Board which ordered the Post not to
run the ad.
	   Because the Post subsequently ran the ad, the board's
advertising committee will recommend the paper be fined, the Post
reported.
	   The Post issued a statement Wednesday saying it respects the
ruling of the committee and would like to stress it had no
intention of violating its order.
	   Both the Post and The Nation once claimed circulations of about
50,000 each. But both _ and particularly The Nation _ have lost
readership and suffered financial difficulties because of the high
cost of newsprint and economic problems associated with Asia's
financial crisis.

Heat wave-struck Chinese city needs air conditioners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese city hit by a heat wave has urgently
appealed nationwide for air conditioners, as desperate city
residents lined up outside shops day and night to buy up quickly
dwindling stocks.
	   Nanjing has sweltered in temperatures as high as 38 degrees
Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) since last week, leading to a
surge in demand for air conditioners in the eastern city of 5.6
million, the Yangcheng Evening News reported Tuesday.
	   After several years of more moderate temperatures, the heat wave
caught air-conditioner factories and stores ill-prepared, the
newspaper said.
	   ``City residents clutching cash in their hands lined up at
stores day and night,'' the newspaper said. ``Unfortunately
Nanjing's nearly 100 air-conditioner shops were unable to satisfy
demand.''
	   The city issued the appeal Monday to air conditioner
manufacturers and stores nationwide to help out ``in this pressing
matter,'' the newspaper added.

Budget deficit balloons to dlrs 585 million in first six months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government suffered a
budget deficit of 24 billion pesos (dlrs 585 million) in the first
half of 1998, a sharp reversal from the 4.5 billion peso (dlrs 110
million) surplus it enjoyed a year earlier, according to official
figures released Wednesday.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu blamed a drop in revenues for
the government's dismal fiscal performance.
	   He said a slowdown in business activities spawned by the
region's financial crisis reduced tax payments. The slowdown also
triggered a decline in imports, which in turn reduced duties
collected by the Bureau of Customs.
	   The administration of newly inaugurated President Joseph Estrada
hopes to improve the government's finances by offering an amnesty
for tax cheaters who agree to pay back taxes, cutting a deal with
the family of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos to split the half
billion dollars in Swiss bank accounts and withholding funds for
pork barrel public works projects sought by Congress members.
	   On Tuesday, Espiritu warned that the budget deficit could swell
to 70 billion pesos (dlrs 1.7 billion) this year if no steps are
taken to cut expenditures and raise tax revenues. However, if the
political will is there, the deficit can be reduced to around 20
billion pesos (dlrs 488 million), he said.
	   Total revenues collected by government in the first half stood
at 219.1 billion pesos (dlrs 5.3 billion), 12 percent less than the
projected level of 249.32 billion pesos (dlrs 6.1 billion). That
was slightly higher, however, than the year-earlier level of 215.55
billion pesos (dlrs 5.2 billion).
	   The Bureau of Internal Revenue contributed 166.05 billion pesos
(dlrs 4.0 billion) to the government coffer in the first half,
15.95 billion pesos (dlrs 400 million) less than the expected 182
billion pesos (dlrs 4.4 billion).
	   Government expenditures totaled 243.1 billion pesos (dlrs 5.9
billion) in the first half, 2.5 percent lower than the expected
level of 249.3 billion pesos (dlrs 6.1 billion). The expenditures,
however, rose 15 percent from the same period a year earlier.

Editor of powerful Malaysian daily quits under pressure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Ed: UPDATES with details, comment; CLARIFIES that paper is
English-language &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The chief editor of one of
Malaysia's leading newspapers has resigned, apparently over
differences with the governing party of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Johan Jaafar, of the Utusan Melayu publishing house, handed in
his resignation to Mahathir on Tuesday, the domestic news agency
Bernama reported.
	   Johan, 44, had headed the group that publishes Utusan Malaysia,
the country's most influential Malay newspaper since 1992, the news
agency said.
	   The resignation followed Mahathir's recent jabs at the local
press about its ``negative'' reporting of Kuala Lumpur's new
international airport, still suffering from teething troubles.
	   Normally staid newspapers have published accounts of computer
failures and woeful tales of delays and lost baggage since the
airport opened last month.
	   Most papers follow a ``speak no evil'' policy in reporting on
the government and the ruling party and local reporters say they
have to tread carefully in reporting sensitive stories like the
differences between Mahathir and his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, over
economic policy.
	   Newspapers must get annual permits from the Home Ministry to
publish. The ministry is headed by Mahathir.
	   A journalist from Utusan quoted Johan as saying his resignation
was ``to prevent his presence from impeding the progress of the
group's newspapers and publications,'' Bernama reported. Johan
announced his resignation at an editorial meeting Tuesday.
	   Rustam Sani, a noted social critic and a former professor at
National University, said Johan had been perceived by some as
demonstrating a pro-Anwar bias by highlighting the allegations of
nepotism and cronyism that had gripped last month's annual
convention of the ruling United Malays National Organization.
	   ``Their line of reporting has always been favorable to Anwar,''
he said.
	   ``It is not the first time,'' said Lim Kit Siang, the opposition
leader in Parliament.
	   The chief editor of a powerful English daily was similarly
removed in the mid-1980s, said Lim, leader of the Democratic Action
Party.
	   ``This does not bode well for the development of an articulate,
responsible and vibrant press,'' he said.
	   The daily has a circulation of about 250,000. On Sundays it
sells about half a million copies. The group is largely owned by
Mahathir's UMNO party and the chief editor is often a political
appointee of the prime minister's.
	   The Utusan group was founded in 1939 and was a component of
Malaysia's national movement against British colonists.

Police officers suspected of engineering journalist murder case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Military police are investigating
claims that police officers might have been involved in a coverup
following the murder of an investigative journalist nearly two
years ago, the official Antara news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Fuad Muhammad Syarifuddin, 33, a reporter for the Berita
Nasional newspaper, died after being attacked Aug. 13, 1996 in
front of his home in Bantul, near Yogyakarta.
	   Late last year, a judge acquitted a civilian suspect charged
with the murder. Police had accused the man of killing the reporter
for having an affair with his wife.
	   Antara quoted Lt. Col. Unggul K. Yudoyono, Yogyakarta's military
police chief, as saying information from several parties indicated
that there was a conspiracy among police to frame the innocent man.
	   Human right activists maintain that Syarifuddin was killed
because he wrote articles on alleged land scams and other cases of
corruption involving local officials and businessmen.
	   The newspaper Kompas, which owns Berita Nasional, quoted
Yudoyono as saying police Sgt. Edy Wuryanto had been summoned for
questioning over his part in the murder investigation.
	   Kompas said military police would question him about the alleged
destruction of several pieces of evidence, including a diary
belonging to the slain journalist.
	   The new investigation into the case comes amid big political
changes in Indonesia, following the May 21 resignation of President
Suharto, who quit after 32 years in power.
	   Human right activists have called for new investigations to be
launched into several other cases of alleged wrongdoing by
government officials and security forces during the Suharto era.

Hostage escapes kidnappers who dozed off during World Cup final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ As his gun-toting kidnapper dozed off
during the World Cup final, Chi Chong I stole away to freedom.
	   Emaciated after 135 days of captivity, the Taiwanese businessman
recounted how he easily slipped his now bony hand out of the chain
binding him to a table and escaped through a window.
	   It was just before dawn on Monday morning in Bangkok, as France
and Brazil battled for the Cup in Paris. Millions of soccer-crazed
Thais were wide awake and watching the match on television, but the
action lulled the gang member guarding him to sleep, Chi told
reporters Tuesday.
	   After slipping out of the squalid house in the in the Bang Sue
district of Bangkok, Chi sought refuge with the police.
	   Bangkok Metropolitan Police officials said Wednesday they knew
the identities, and had strong leads on the whereabouts, of the
five Chinese and Thai gang members who kidnapped the 57-year-old
businessman on March 1.
	   They had demanded dlrs 1 million in ransom from Chi's relatives.
	   Chi, who owns the Uchine Perfumery Chemical Company in Bangkok,
was just the latest victim of Chinese gangs who have kidnapped for
ransom scores of Chinese businessmen throughout Southeast Asia
during the past several years.
	   Aside from Thailand, the problem is particularly common in the
Philippines and Cambodia.
	   At the Bang Sue station where police are keeping him in
protective custody, Chi, thin, gaunt and gray from his ordeal, told
reporters how the gang abducted him after breaking into his factory
demanding money and jewelry.
	   He was kept chained to the table and given only one meal a day,
he said. He was not allowed to use the toilet, but had to defecate
in plastic bags.
	   The kidnappers forced him to write 15 letters to his relatives
in Bangkok and Taiwan demanding the dlrs 1 million, he said.
Eventually, they agreed to a quarter of that, but did not show up
at a park entrance where relatives were waiting to hand over the
cash.
	   They may have sensed the presence of the undercover cops
stationed there, after Chi's relatives reported his kidnapping and
began working with police to find him.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with afternoon stock and bond prices, dollar rate

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen Wednesday
on hopes economic reform will continue in Japan despite political
turmoil. Japanese stocks rose moderately.
	   The dollar bought 140.92 yen in afternoon trading, down 0.44 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
140.02 yen overnight.
	   The yen strengthened overnight on optimism that Japan remains
committed to reforms to buoy its economy, despite the ruling
party's crushing defeat in Sunday's elections for the upper house
of Parliament.
	   But the dollar crept higher most of the day in Tokyo amid
uncertainties about who will be chosen to succeed outgoing Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. Hashimoto announced his resignation on
Monday after the electoral defeat.
	   On the stock market, share prices continued to advance as
investors were encouraged by a record high close on Wall Street.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 125.23 points, or 0.76
percent, to close at 16,614.14. On Tuesday, the Nikkei index closed
up 128.52 points, or 0.79 percent.
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at
9,245.54, up 149.33 from Monday's close.
	   Also supporting Tokyo stocks were expectations that the
government will work out proposed permanent tax cuts aimed at
helping pull Japan out of recession, dealers said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 8.66 points, or 0.68 percent, to 1,275.31. The
TOPIX closed up 10.21 points, or 0.81 percent, the day before.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 473
million shares, up from 402 million shares Tuesday.
	   Advances beat declines 635 to 497 while 142 issues were
unchanged.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.405 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.445 percent, driving its price up to 110.38 yen from 110.11 yen.

Employer denies firing Chinese dissident following clampdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese dissident was fired from his job as a
hotel security guard after being detained in a crackdown on an
opposition political party, human rights groups said Wednesday. His
employer immediately denied the reports.
	   Wang Qiang was one of nine organizers of the China Democracy
Party caught in a police roundup Friday. Released the next day,
Wang lost his job at the Wanxiang Hotel in eastern Hangzhou city on
Tuesday, said the New York-based Human Rights in China.
	   A Hong Kong-based group, the Information Center of Human Rights
and Democracy Movement in China, also said Wang was let go. It said
the hotel told him it was acting under orders from Hangzhou police.
	   But Shen Lixiang, office director at the three-star hotel,
denied the reports. He admitted that hotel officials ``had a few
words'' with Wang and asked him to explain in writing why he missed
work for two days. But he insisted Wang was not fired.
	   ``Everything was resolved,'' Shen said by telephone. ``He is
still working here.''
	   Four of those detained with Wang remain in custody. The wives of
two of them called on Hangzhou police Wednesday to try to find out
about their husbands' cases, the Information Center said.
	   Police said the two, Wang Donghai and Zhu Zhengming, were under
``residential supervision'' but refused to say where. They also
turned down the wives' requests to pass on fresh clothes to the
men, the group said.
	   Last month, on the day U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in
China, Wang Donghai and other dissidents announced the formation of
the China Democracy Party, challenging the ruling Communist Party's
political monopoly.
	   Authorities refused to allow them to register the group, as
required by law, and began detaining the organizers for brief
periods of time. Friday's roundup came a week after Clinton ended
his China visit.
	   Human Rights in China said it had been hard for Wang Qiang, who
served 2 1/2 years in prison for taking part in democracy protests
in 1989, to get his one-year contract at the hotel.
	   Companies and state-run offices frequently shun dissidents,
especially those with prison records, often making it hard for them
to find steady jobs.

Arafat gets Chinese financial, moral support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat left Beijing
Tuesday armed with promises of financial backing and moral support
for the Middle East peace process.
	   Arafat said he held ``very important'' talks with Chinese
leaders and signed agreements for Chinese financial support for his
Palestinian government. He gave no details.
	   China had an important role to play in ``pushing forward the
peace process and to protect the peace process'' in the Middle
East, Arafat said in a pre-departure news conference.
	   In a meeting with Arafat Tuesday, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
reaffirmed China's long-standing support for the Palestinians'
``just cause'' and said Chinese businesses would support a
Palestinian state with investments.
	   Zhu told Arafat Israel's delay in withdrawing from the West Bank
was ``wrong'' and said China supported negotiations on the basis of
land for peace.
	   Despite supporting the Palestinians, Beijing would never be a
moderator in the Middle East peace talks, Zhu said.
	   Arafat also met top officials including President Jiang Zemin,
who told him China supported the establishment of a Palestinian
state and would use its seat on the United Nations Security Council
to push the peace process forward.
	   Arafat accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
blocking the peace process and of not carrying out commitments made
in accords signed in 1993 and 1995 in Oslo.
	   ``The aim of this Israeli government is to abrogate the
agreements, annex Jerusalem'' and turn it into a Jewish city,
Arafat said, condemning recent Israeli moves to make Jewish suburbs
part of Jerusalem and thereby ensure a Jewish majority.
	   He said he raised plans with China for a summit of Arab nations
to discuss the peace process and support for the Palestinian
authority.
	   Arafat is seeking international support for his effort to
establish a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and East
Jerusalem.
	   Netanyahu's government has stalled on withdrawing troops. Israel
has refused a U.S. compromise that would link a pullback from 13
percent of the West Bank with corresponding security gestures from
the Palestinians. Arafat supports that initiative.
	   China has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause
but over the past decade has developed good diplomatic and strong
economic ties with Israel.

Hong Kong gets pledge of mainland help to clear cargo problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 10-11 with Taiwan planes also able to make
direct flights to China &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In a sign of the mainland's growing importance
to Hong Kong, a top official worked out an agreement with Chinese
officials Wednesday to help clear a cargo backlog from Hong Kong's
new airport.
	   China on Tuesday offered to open up Huangtian airport in
Shenzhen, just across the boundary from Hong Kong to cargo flights
and streamline customs procedures.
	   It was an indication of the ties between Hong Kong and the
adjacent mainland region that both sides say they want to foster
since Hong Kong was handed back to China last year. And it was a
rare case of the prosperous territory seeking help from the
mainland to solve its problems.
	   Stephen Ip, Hong Kong's secretary for economic services,
traveled to Shenzhen to meet with civil aviation and customs
officials from Beijing as well as Chen Zuo'er, China's deputy
director of Hong Kong and Macau affairs.
	   ``The central government will cooperate fully with the Hong Kong
government until the problems are solved,'' Chen told Hong Kong's
commercial radio.
	   Ip told official Hong Kong radio after the meeting that the two
side agreed on a contingency plan under which it would take only
about four to five hours for air cargo arriving at Huangtian to
reach Hong Kong.
	   The first priority still was for Hong Kong's main cargo handler
to straighten out its problems locally, Ip said.
	   The Hong Kong Standard newspaper quoted Xie Feng, spokesman for
Huangtian airport, as saying it could handle 20-30 cargo flights
per day for Hong Kong, or about 2,000-3,000 tons of cargo.
	   Some cargo also has been shipped to Macau, the Portuguese
territory about 70 kilometers (45 miles) from Hong Kong along the
Chinese coast.
	   Chinese officials said they also were willing to accept planes
from Taiwan at Huangtian airport. Taiwan and China have no direct
transportation links because of their long-standing political
dispute, but Taiwan has billions of dollars worth of investments in
the mainland. Much trade goes through Hong Kong.
	   Officials of Taiwan's China Airlines said the offer could be a
trial balloon or a propaganda ploy, and carriers couldn't take
advantage of it unless the Taiwan government lifted its ban on
direct flights to the mainland.
	   Airport officials said Wednesday that passenger services were
continuing to improve at the new Chek Lap Kok airport, built by
flattening small outlying islands about 30 kilometers (22 miles)
from central Hong Kong. Cargo services also were reported to be
picking up after a disastrous start that almost totally paralyzed
one of the world's biggest air cargo operations.
	   And Hong Kong's public transportation corporation said that 12
people arrested for allegedly using substandard construction
practices and materials were not working on stations for the
airport railroad, but sites adjacent to them.
	   In announcing the arrests on Tuesday, the Independent Commission
Against Corruption had said they were arrested for substandard
foundation work connected to the railroad.
	   Public transportation officials said Tuesday that the new route
to and from the airport was entirely safe.
	   Members of Hong Kong's legislature said they planned to quiz the
government on Wednesday about whether they would be able to meet a
pledge to have cargo operations back to normal by the weekend.
	   The Airport Authority said that on Tuesday, the new Chek Lap Kok
airport handled 1,400 tons of cargo, about a third of normal.

Roster at 15 as USA Team heads to Monte Carlo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The USA Basketball men's team had its roster
reduced on its final day of training at Moody Bible Institute
because of an injury.
	   Warren Kidd, formerly of Middle Tennessee State who played last
year with Stefanel Milano in Italy, on Tuesday withdrew from
consideration for the final roster because of a pelvis injury. He
is a 6-10 forward-center.
	   A final 12-member team will be announced after the team's
training sessions in Monte Carlo from July 15-23.
	   With a lockout and threat of a boycott, USA Basketball removed
the 12 NBA players initially selected for the world championships
and replaced them with a host of players with a variety of
experience.
	   Of the 15 players still on the roster, five played in a
professional foreign league last year, five played in the CBA,
another played in both the CBA and Europe, two are current college
underclassmen and two completed their college eligibility last
year.
	   The USA team will begin preliminary play in the World
championships July 29 against Brazil in Greece.
	   ``I've been in pro camps where it's taken longer to pick up the
basic concepts of what we're trying to do and we're going to get
better and we'll keep working at it, but it's been a good start,''
USA coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
	   ``I like our mix, we have guys from all walks of basketball. ...
We've got guys who are honored to be here, and we'll go out and do
the best we can.''
	   The remaining 15 members of the roster are Wendell Alexis,
Ashraf Amaya, Earl Boykins, Tim Breauz, Mateen Cleaves, Bill
Edwards, Kiwane Garris, Michael Hawkins, Gerard King, Jimmy King,
Trajan Langdon, Brad Miller, Jimmy Oliver, Jason Sasser and David
Wood.

Prudential, Mitsui Trust to establish joint venture
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of the joint venture from news
conference &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prudential Insurance Co. has become the latest U.S.
company to jump into Japan's fast-changing financial market,
announcing plans Wednesday to establish a joint fund management
company with Mitsui Trust and Banking Co.
	   Foreign companies have been rushing to get a foothold in Japan
ahead of a deregulation program that is expected to give more
competitors a crack at the world's largest pool of personal savings
_ an estimated dlrs 9 trillion.
	   The joint venture, to be named Prudential Mitsui Trust
Investments Co., aims to take advantage of deregulation that will
allow banks to sell investment trusts _ Japan's version of mutual
funds _ and opens the way for retirement savings plans similar to
the 401K common in the United States.
	   Within five years, the joint venture aims to manage 2 trillion
yen (dlrs 14.3 billion) of assets, Mitsui Trust President Keiu
Nishida said at a joint news conference in Tokyo.
	   The joint venture will give Prudential, a U.S. insurance and
brokerage giant, instant access to Mitsui Trust's nationwide
network of well-heeled clients.
	   Mitsui Trust is Japan's third largest ``trust bank,'' a category
that specializes in managing funds for corporations and big
investors.
	   Mitsui will gain Prudential's expertise both in fund management
and in the more advanced financial products offered in the United
States.
	   The new company will employ between 30 and 40 people and have
capital of about dlrs 50 million. Mitsui Trust and Prudential will
each have a 50 percent stake.
	   Several of the biggest names in U.S. finance have already moved
into Japan.
	   Merrill Lynch and Co. recently opened the first branch in a
planned national network of 33 retail outlets.
	   Travelers Group Inc. announced last month it would buy a quarter
of Nikko Securities Co., the third-largest Japanese brokerage
house.

Kia Motors put up for international bidding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Creditor banks of Kia Motors Corp. put
the bankrupt automaker up for sale Wednesday, luring bidders with
an offer to increase its value by dlrs 810 million through a stock
recapitalization.
	   Potential buyers can submit their bids between July 27 and Aug.
21, and the successful bidder will be announced on Sept. 1, said
Korea Development Bank, Kia's main creditor bank.
	   The state bank, which has nearly dlrs 1 billion in outstanding
loans to Kia, said it and other creditors were also considering
writing off some of Kia's dlrs 6.7 billion debt as well.
	   The successful bidder must buy at least 51 percent of Kia's
equity through the auction, the state bank and Kia's
government-appointed head, Yoo Chong-yuel, told a news conference.
	   The move to sell South Korea's third largest car maker is part
of the government's effort to restructure the nation's economy
under the terms of a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International
Monetary Fund.
	   Kia remains under court receivership after going bankrupt
exactly a year ago. The company said that as of Wednesday, it had
dlrs 6.7 billion in debt and dlrs 5.9 billion in assets.
	   Creditors said they would reduce the value of Kia's total of
dlrs 290 million in outstanding shares by 90 percent, then issue
new shares to bring total capitalization to dlrs 1.1 billion.
	   Kia planned to ask 23 automakers, including 20 foreign car
makers, to submit bids.
	   Daewoo Motors Co., South Korea's second-largest auto company,
said it will form a consortium with industry leader Hyundai Motors
Co. to bid for Kia.
	   Samsung Motors Co., South Korea's smallest and latest entrant
into the car industry, also has expressed interest in acquiring
Kia.
	   Another possible bidder is Ford Motor Co. of the United States,
which already owns l6.9 percent of Kia.
	   Kia produced 780,000 cars in 1997. Asia Motors can turn out
250,000 vehicles, mostly trucks and buses. The two companies employ
more than 18,000 workers.

U.N. military observer shot dead in Georgia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A Polish woman working as a United
Nations military observer in Georgia was shot dead by unidentified
attackers at the entrance to her apartment, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Maria Magdalena Kawioska, 31, was shot at point-blank range on
Tuesday evening, said Maya Musidze, a spokeswoman of Georgia's
Interior Ministry.
	   The motive for the attack was not immediately known.
	   The U.N. observers are in Georgia to monitor the truce between
government forces and separatists in the northwestern Black Sea
province of Abkhazia. The separatists took control of the province
in a 1992-93 war.

Fire destroys 63 homes in Ho Chi Minh City
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A fire that started in an oven destroyed
63 thatched huts in southern Ho Chi Minh City, leaving 300 people
homeless, police said Wednesday.
	   A traffic jam and the small size of the alley leading to the
area in the city's District 8 prevented 13 fire trucks from
reaching the scene. Firefighters worked with pumps and buckets for
an hour to extinguish the blaze, which started at 5 p.m. Monday.
	   No casualties were reported.
	   Local authorities have built some temporary shelters for those
left homeless and provided each of the 63 families with 400,000
dong (dlrs 30) and 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of rice.

Orangemen settle in for long siege at Drumcree
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police saying 300 at Drumcree protest overnight,
Orange chaplain says protest should be reassessed
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The parades are over,
violence has ebbed, crowds near the Drumcree Anglican church have
thinned and the men of the Orange Order settled in for what may be
a long siege to demand their right to march through a Catholic
neighborhood.
	   ``Anybody who thinks that we are beaten and it's over is totally
misreading the situation. We are still going to be here,'' said
David Jones, spokesman for the Portadown Orange Lodges. ``We are
reviewing all the time where the protest action should go.''
	   Barbed wire, trenches, police and soldiers on Wednesday for the
11th day blocked the men of Northern Ireland's largest Protestant
fraternal order from marching through a hostile Catholic
neighborhood in Portadown. They are enforcing a decision by the
Parades Commission, created after trouble at Drumcree the past two
summers, to forbid the march.
	   Two years ago, police and soldiers stopped the march for four
days, but gave up in the face of violence across Northern Ireland
by Protestant hard-liners. Last year, police simply forced the
march through Catholic protesters.
	   But this year, authorities held firm against widespread
violence, which reached its depth Sunday with a firebombing that
killed three young sons of a Catholic woman.
	   Police said about 300 people kept up the protests at Drumcree
overnight, and some threw bombs or fired ball bearings at police
and soldiers. Police responded by firing plastic bullets, and said
there had been several arrests.
	   Other Protestant hard-liners exploded gas cylinders at a
crowd-control barrier at the entrance to the Catholic neighborhood.
	   Elsewhere in Northern Ireland, the Orange Hall in Ballycastle,
on the northeast coast, was damaged by firebombs. Trucks and cars
were torched at a garage in Craigavon, 5 miles (8 kms) east of
Portadown.
	   ``If the violence the violence continues, as it has done and
indeed has been violent again last night with the throwing of nail
bombs, the protest has to be reassessed,'' the Rev. Morris
Lafferty, a senior Orange chaplain, said Thursday.
	   While it is a decision for Portadown Orangemen, he said,
``Perhaps the time is right now to draw it to a close.''

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ In a mystery akin to Britain's crop
circles, police are investigating a massive drawing of an
Aboriginal hunter that suddenly appeared on a remote patch of
Australia's desert outback.
	   No one has so far claimed responsibility for the 2.5 mile- (4
kilometer-) long outline carved into the dust near Finniss Springs
in northern South Australia state.
	   Locals from the nearby township of Maree believe the figure was
carved using a plow, possibly pulled by a tractor, although there
are no wheel marks at the site.
	   From the air, the outline shows what appears to be an Aboriginal
man holding a spear.
	   Police have found clues including what is believed to be a
satellite photograph of the figure, a small U.S. flag and a note
that is believed to refer to the Branch Davidian cult in the United
States, The Australian newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Local resident Ray Goss told the newspaper he and a group of
friends found the etching after anonymous directions were faxed to
the Marree hotel last week.
	   The fax claimed the drawing is ``the world's largest work of
art.'' It is five times the size of the largest human figure at the
famous Nazca site in Peru, The Australian said.
	   Local policeman Paul Liersch said the etching may be an attempt
to create a tourist attraction.
	   And while extraterrestrial visitors be a favorite explanation in
Britain for similarly mysterious circles that have appeared in crop
fields there, Liersch said he had evidence that the creators were
probably from closer to home.
	   ``I found toilet paper out there so, if it has been done from
space, they're fairly much like us,'' he told The Australian.
	   The state Aboriginal Affairs Department said Wednesday it had
also sent officials to investigate the figure.

Road-building soldiers killed in remote region of India

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A truck carrying an Indian military
road-building unit across rough terrain toppled 1,000 feet (300
meters) into a gorge, killing 45 men, officials said Wednesday.
	   The accident occurred Sunday along India's border with China,
but it was in such a remote area that word trickled out only
Wednesday, officials of the Border Roads Task Force said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The military engineering unit builds roads near India's
international borders.
	   The driver appeared to have lost control as the truck traveled
off-road from a base camp to a construction site near Tato Mechuka,
some 2,700 kilometers (1,670 miles) east of New Delhi.

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finland's annual inflation rate in June
was 1.5 percent, unchanged from the previous month, but up from 1.2
percent in June 1997, the government statistics agency said
Wednesday.
	   During a 12-month period, a 3.2-percent price increase in food
and non-alcoholic drinks pushed up the inflation rate the most,
Statistics Finland said. Housing costs also were up, by 2.3
percent.
	   Inflation was curbed mainly by the abolition of stamp duty on
loans, lower mobile phone charges and a drop in interest rates on
loans, the agency said.

On eve of U.N. official's visit, unease builds again in East Timor

 &UR; With Indonesia-East Timor &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian soldiers kill two
demonstrators during pro-independence protests in East Timor.
Fearing a surge in violence, thousands of people flee aboard buses,
boats and planes.
	   East Timor is grappling with another bout of the turmoil that
has tormented it since Indonesia sent in soldiers in 1975 and
declared it a 27th province.
	   Tension is escalating ahead of a scheduled visit to Indonesia
this week by the United Nations' special envoy for the former
Portuguese colony, Jamsheed Marker.
	   Hundreds of students shouted pro-independence slogans Wednesday
at a peaceful campus rally in Dili, the seaside capital of East
Timor. Trucks of police and soldiers patrolled nearby.
	   Marker has been urged to stay away from East Timor to avoid
triggering bigger anti-Indonesian protests that could turn violent,
but a U.N. spokesman in New York said Marker is expected to go
there.
	   He was scheduled to arrive in Jakarta Thursday, one day before
another sensitive date: the 22nd anniversary of Indonesia's
annexation of East Timor. Anticipating trouble in the streets, many
shop owners have left Dili.
	   Ironically, the visit comes as momentum accelerates for a
solution, albeit temporary, to the bitter conflict in East Timor.
Marker likely sees a unique opportunity to push for dialogue.
	   Authoritarian President Suharto took a hard line on the
territory of 800,000 people. In the late 1970s, tens of thousands
of East Timorese died in fighting and from famine as his troops
crushed most resistance.
	   However, a small band of separatist rebels still roams the hills
and anti-Indonesian sentiment is widespread. An average of 20
Indonesian soldiers are killed every year.
	   Since the embattled Suharto quit in May, his successor,
President B.J. Habibie, has eased up in keeping with a push for a
democratic overhaul of the nation of 200 million.
	   Habibie has pledged to withdraw troops from East Timor and allow
more freedom of movement for its citizens, and has offered a degree
of autonomy. Yet he rules out a vote on independence, the fervent
hope of many East Timorese.
	   During his weeklong trip, Marker is expected to debate the
autonomy proposal, which would likely grant cultural and
educational freedom to East Timorese. Indonesia would keep control
over foreign, economic and security affairs.
	   East Timor's Nobel peace laureate, Bishop Carlos Belo, has urged
Marker to postpone his trip because of the tension. Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has said a visit by Marker to East
Timor would not be wise.
	   The last time that Marker visited East Timor, in March 1997,
Indonesian soldiers shot and killed two pro-independence protesters
at a rally held to impress the U.N. official.
	   Last month, security forces killed another two activists in East
Timor as protesters lobbied three visiting European ambassadors.
	   Scared by the possibility of escalating protests and reprisals
from indigenous residents, tens of thousands of non-Timorese
Indonesian settlers have fled since late last month. There is often
ethnic and economic tension between the two groups.
	   Despite the unease, observers agree that the Indonesian military
brass is more eager than ever for a peaceful end to a grinding
conflict in which many soldiers have died.
	   ``They are very realistic,'' said Salim Said, an expert on the
military. ``They know for sure that we cannot go on like this. We
have to find a solution.''

Death toll of 120 is five times higher than last year's

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A worsening outbreak of dengue fever has
killed 120 people in Vietnam so far this year, five times the death
toll for the same period in 1997, the Ministry of Health said
Wednesday.
	   It said 46,373 people have contracted the disease this year,
triple the figure for this time in 1997. Two-thirds of the
provinces have reported cases.
	   The 12 Mekong Delta provinces have been hit particularly hard.
The ministry has asked the Pasteur Institute and the Cho Ray
Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City to send experts to the worst-affected
provinces.
	   Last year, 108,000 people contracted dengue fever in Vietnam,
with more than 200 deaths. Most of the cases occur during or after
the rainy season, which began in early June.
	   In late May, the ministry said the incidence of dengue in
Vietnam had doubled from the previous year, with the death toll
more than tripling.
	   Last month, at least 17 children died from dengue in the
southern province of Dong Nai.
	   Dengue infects an estimated 50 million people each year in a
geographic band around the equator. There is no vaccine for the
mosquito-borne virus, which causes fever, joint pains, chills and,
in serious cases, hemorrhaging. Patients can take several weeks to
recover.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese city where a heat wave is blamed for
six deaths is appealing nationwide for air conditioners as
desperate residents line up outside shops day and night to buy up
quickly dwindling stocks.
	   Nanjing has sweltered in temperatures as high as 38 degrees
Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) since last week, leading to a
surge in demand for air conditioners in the eastern city of 5.6
million, the Yangcheng Evening News reported Tuesday.
	   Six people had died of heat stroke by Tuesday, and 120 people
were hospitalized, the Yangtze Evening News said.
	   After several years of more moderate temperatures, the heat wave
caught air-conditioner factories and stores ill-prepared, the
Yangcheng Evening News said.

stores day and night,'' the newspaper said. ``Unfortunately,
Nanjing's nearly 100 air-conditioner shops were unable to satisfy
demand.''
	   The city issued the appeal Monday to air conditioner
manufacturers and stores nationwide to help out ``in this pressing
matter,'' the newspaper added.

right field off John Burkett to give the Mariners a 2-0 lead.
	   His second was a two-run homer in the seventh off Scott Bailes,
a 358-foot (109-meter) line drive to right, to put Seattle ahead
6-3.
	   Griffey has 333 career homers, moving past Bobby Bonds for 60th

Homosexuality a key issue at upcoming world Anglican gathering
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A decade after a sharp debate on the ordination of
women, the Anglican church is heading for a global conference that
could see a fight over the rights of homosexuals.
	   Though some bishops have ordained openly homosexual priests _
and two gay men had their union blessed last month at an Episcopal
church in New Jersey _ other Anglicans regard homosexuality as an
abomination and condemn the ordination of gays.
	   The Lambeth Conference, which begins Saturday in London and is
held every 10 years, is the main forum for debate for leaders of
the world's 70 million Anglicans.
	   Each national church is free to go its own way _ as they have
done in ordaining women. Some do, some don't _ and churches in
Canada, New Zealand and the United States have elevated 11 women to
bishops. Some bishops, however, have threatened to boycott any
conference events involving the women bishops.
	   The Archbishop of Canterbury, leader of the worldwide communion
affiliated with the Church of England, hopes to avoid similar
bitterness about the ordination of gays by calling for more study
and reflection on the issue.
	   ``I am all too conscious that some will come wanting a showdown
on the issue of homosexuality and seek categorical assurances from
the assembled gathering for a final, definitive opinion,''
Archbishop George Carey said earlier this year.
	   ``I am sure this would be a serious error. Such a move would
dominate the entire agenda and confirm the world's suspicions that
we are obsessed with issues of gender and sexuality,'' he said.
``Homosexuality will be considered calmly, theologically and in a
Christian way, but we must not allow it to sideline such crucial
concerns as the mission of the church in the new millennium,
relationships with Islam, our ministry to young people and the
urgent matter of international debt.''
	   Bishop Duncan Buchanan of Johannesburg, South Africa, will
preside over the debate on homosexuality _ an issue he predicts
``will throw its shadow pretty much over the present conference.''
	   ``There are some people who would want to say that the question
of homosexuality is not fundamental to the faith. Other people
would say it is. One of my jobs at Canterbury is to try to balance
the whole lot of it,'' Buchanan said.
	   The conservative position was stated by 80 bishops and other
church leaders from the Southern Hemisphere who met in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, in 1997.
	   They demanded that the church establish ``a clear and
unambiguous'' stand that prohibits sex outside marriage and rules
out the ordination of non-celibate homosexuals and the blessing of
same-sex unions.
	   U.S. bishops affiliated with the traditionalist Episcopal Synod
of America have backed the Kuala Lumpur statement, and Bishop Jack
Iker of Fort Worth, Texas, is among those who would like to see the
Lambeth Conference adopt the same position.
	   Diametrically opposed but equally strong views are exemplified
by Bishop John Spong of Newark, New Jersey.
	   Spong wrote to fellow bishops in November saying he feared the
Lambeth Conference would adopt a position reflecting ``our
long-standing ignorance and fear, instead of out of the gospel
imperative.''
	   That drew a public rebuke from Carey.
	   ``You attack personally those of us who disagree with your
opinion and in so doing you distort the theologies and reasons why
we are led to conclude that there is no justification for sexual
expression outside marriage,'' Carey said.
	   ``If bishops come to Lambeth wanting a showdown on this issue, I
am quite clear that there will follow a very negative and
destructive conflict which will put even further back the cause of
the people you represent,'' he said.
	   Such thinking exasperates Desmond Tutu, the retired archbishop
of Cape Town, South Africa.
	   ``That is crazy,'' Tutu said in March. ``We say the expression
of love in a monogamous, heterosexual relationship is more than
just the physical but includes touching, embracing, kissing, maybe
the genital act. The totality of this makes each of us grow to
become giving, increasingly God-like and compassionate.
	   ``If it is so for the heterosexual,'' he said, ``what earthly
reason have we to say that it is not the case with the homosexual,
provided the relationship is exclusive, not promiscuous?''

Prudential, Mitsui Trust to establish joint venture
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Prudential president in graf 4,
details of the alliance &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prudential Insurance Co. has become the latest U.S.
company to jump into Japan's fast-changing financial market,
announcing plans Wednesday to establish a joint fund management
company with Mitsui Trust and Banking Co.
	   Foreign companies have been rushing to get a foothold in Japan
ahead of a deregulation program that is expected to give more
competitors a crack at the world's largest pool of personal savings
_ an estimated dlrs 9 trillion.
	   ``During this period of change and financial deregulation, we
believe it is an ideal time to get involved in the Japanese
market,'' Arthur F. Ryan, chairman and chief executive officer of
Prudential, said at a news conference in Tokyo.
	   The new venture, to be named Prudential Mitsui Trust Investments
Co., aims to take advantage of deregulation that will allow banks
to sell investment trusts _ Japan's version of mutual funds _ and
opens the way for retirement savings plans similar to the 401K
common in the United States.
	   The alliance will give Prudential, a U.S. insurance and
brokerage giant, instant access to Mitsui Trust's nationwide
network of well-heeled clients.
	   Mitsui Trust is Japan's third largest ``trust bank,'' a category
that specializes in managing funds for corporations and big
investors.
	   Mitsui will gain Prudential's expertise both in fund management
and in the more advanced financial products offered in the United
States.
	   Within five years, the new company hopes to manage 2 trillion
yen (dlrs 14.3 billion) of assets, Mitsui Trust President Keiu
Nishida said.
	   The new company will employ between 30 and 40 people and have
capital of about dlrs 50 million. Mitsui Trust and Prudential will
each have a 50 percent stake.
	   Mitsui's Nishida said the deal did not include plans for either
company to buy a stake in the other.
	   Several of the biggest names in U.S. finance have already moved
into Japan.
	   Merrill Lynch and Co. recently opened the first branch in a
planned national network of 33 retail outlets.
	   Travelers Group Inc. announced last month it would buy a quarter
of Nikko Securities Co., the third-largest Japanese brokerage
house.
	   Shares of Mitsui Trust rose 9.2 percent to 333 yen (dlrs 2.38)
Wednesday on news of the alliance.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A Polish woman working as a United
Nations military observer in Georgia was shot dead by unidentified
attackers at the entrance to her apartment in the capital Tbilisi,
officials said Wednesday.
	   Also, six civilians were killed when their horse-drawn cart hit
a landmine in the breakaway province of Abkhazia, news reports said
Wednesday.
	   Abkhazian officials blamed pro-government militants who are
active in the separatist region, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The U.N. observer, Maria Magdalena Kawioska, 31, was shot at
point-blank range on Tuesday evening, said Maya Musidze, a
spokeswoman of Georgia's Interior Ministry.
	   The motive for the attack was not immediately known.
	   The U.N. observers are in Georgia to monitor the truce between
government forces and separatists in the northwestern Black Sea
province of Abkhazia. The separatists took control of the province
in a 1992-93 war.

Indonesia opposes calls to abandon ASEAN non-interference policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia is opposing calls for the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations to abandon the group's
founding principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of
member states.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has warned against any
change, saying ASEAN's non-interference policy was a fundamental
principle, the official Antara news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Domingo Siazon has said
that ASEAN foreign ministers, at a meeting this month in Manila,
will probably begin ``a major change in ASEAN's policy from
non-intervention to a more pro-active policy of flexible
engagement.''
	   Siazon, Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan and Malaysian
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim have all called publicly for
ASEAN to shift to a more flexible engagement policy.
	   However, Antara quoted Alatas as saying Tuesday that it would
not be proper to tinker with a basic principle.
	   While cautioning against change, Alatas called on ASEAN members
to speak up if something happens in their countries as the result
of problems in other ASEAN countries.
	   As an example, he cited Indonesia's cooperation and talks with
neighboring Singapore and Malaysia over the effects of
health-threatening haze from forest fires across Indonesia last
year.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Orangemen settle in for long siege at Drumcree
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS day to Wednesday in graf 9 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The parades are over,
violence has ebbed, crowds near the Drumcree Anglican church have
thinned and the men of the Orange Order settled in for what may be
a long siege to demand their right to march through a Catholic
neighborhood.
	   ``Anybody who thinks that we are beaten and it's over is totally
misreading the situation. We are still going to be here,'' said
David Jones, spokesman for the Portadown Orange Lodges. ``We are
reviewing all the time where the protest action should go.''
	   Barbed wire, trenches, police and soldiers on Wednesday for the
11th day blocked the men of Northern Ireland's largest Protestant
fraternal order from marching through a hostile Catholic
neighborhood in Portadown. They are enforcing a decision by the
Parades Commission, created after trouble at Drumcree the past two
summers, to forbid the march.
	   Two years ago, police and soldiers stopped the march for four
days, but gave up in the face of violence across Northern Ireland
by Protestant hard-liners. Last year, police simply forced the
march through Catholic protesters.
	   But this year, authorities held firm against widespread
violence, which reached its depth Sunday with a firebombing that
killed three young sons of a Catholic woman.
	   Police said about 300 people kept up the protests at Drumcree
overnight, and some threw bombs or fired ball bearings at police
and soldiers. Police responded by firing plastic bullets, and said
there had been several arrests.
	   Other Protestant hard-liners exploded gas cylinders at a
crowd-control barrier at the entrance to the Catholic neighborhood.
	   Elsewhere in Northern Ireland, the Orange Hall in Ballycastle,
on the northeast coast, was damaged by firebombs. Trucks and cars
were torched at a garage in Craigavon, 5 miles (8 kms) east of
Portadown.
	   ``If the violence the violence continues, as it has done and
indeed has been violent again last night with the throwing of nail
bombs, the protest has to be reassessed,'' the Rev. Morris
Lafferty, a senior Orange chaplain, said Wednesday.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late-afternoon bond and dollar rates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks rose for the third consecutive day
Wednesday, buoyed by expectations that Japan's next government will
move more aggressively to revive the ailing economy.
	   The dollar declined against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 125.23 points, or 0.76
percent, closing at 16,614.14. On Tuesday, the Nikkei index had
climbed 128.52 points, or 0.79 percent.
	   The dollar bought 140.66 yen in late afternoon, down 0.70 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
140.02 yen overnight.
	   Financial markets have been eagerly awaiting word on who will be
chosen to lead Japan after Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
announced his resignation Monday.
	   Hashimoto said he would step down after voters handed his party
a crushing defeat in elections Sunday for the upper house of
Parliament.
	   One reason for Hashimoto's downfall was a decision to raise the
national sales tax by 2 percentage points last year, a move that
angered voters and triggered a slump in consumption.
	   Market participants expected the ruling party to learn from that
mistake and work to win back voters with bolder measures to boost
the economy, possibly including an income tax cut.
	   Stocks rose amid hopes for ``a less fiscally restrained
post-Hashimoto administration,'' said Dhia Amir, a senior
institutional sales trader at Nomura Securities.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which will retain control
of the government because of its majority in the more powerful
lower house, is to decide on a new prime minister July 21.
	   Investors were also encouraged by a record high close on Wall
Street.
	   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,245.54,
up 149.33.
	   On the Tokyo exchange, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of
all issues listed on the first section rose 8.66 points, or 0.68
percent, to 1,275.31. It had gained 10.21 points, or 0.81 percent,
the previous day.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 473
million shares, up from 402 million Tuesday.
	   Advances beat declines 635 to 497, while 142 issues were
unchanged.
	   The U.S. dollar fell against the yen overnight on hopes economic
reform would continue in Japan despite the political turmoil.
	   The U.S. currency fell as low as 140.00 yen in early Tokyo
trading, but later rose as high as 141.35 yen Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.405 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.445 percent, driving its price up to 110.38 yen from 110.11 yen.

	   The new venture, to be named Prudential Mitsui Trust Investments
Co., aims to take advantage of deregulation that will allow banks
to sell investment trusts _ Japan's version of mutual funds _ and
opens the way for retirement savings plans similar to the 401K
common in the United States.
	   The alliance will give Prudential, a U.S. insurance and
brokerage giant, instant access to Mitsui Trust's nationwide
network of well-heeled clients.
	   Mitsui Trust is Japan's third largest ``trust bank,'' a category
that specializes in managing funds for corporations and big
investors.
	   Mitsui will gain Prudential's expertise both in fund management
and in the more advanced financial products offered in the United
States.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Creditor banks of Kia Motors Corp. put
the bankrupt automaker up for sale Wednesday, luring bidders with
an offer to increase its value by dlrs 810 million through a stock
recapitalization.
	   Potential buyers can submit their bids between July 27 and Aug.
21, and the successful bidder will be announced on Sept. 1, said
Korea Development Bank, Kia's main creditor bank.
	   The state bank, which has nearly dlrs 1 billion in outstanding
loans to Kia, said it and other creditors were also considering
writing off some of Kia's dlrs 6.7 billion debt as well.
	   The successful bidder must buy at least 51 percent of Kia's
equity through the auction, the state bank and Kia's
government-appointed head, Yoo Chong-yuel, told a news conference.
	   The move to sell South Korea's third largest car maker is part
of the government's effort to restructure the nation's economy
under the terms of a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International
Monetary Fund.
	   Kia remains under court receivership after going bankrupt
exactly a year ago. The company said that as of Wednesday, it had
dlrs 6.7 billion in debt and dlrs 5.9 billion in assets.
	   Creditors said they would reduce the value of Kia's total of
dlrs 290 million in outstanding shares by 90 percent, then issue
new shares to bring total capitalization to dlrs 1.1 billion.
	   Kia planned to ask 23 automakers, including 20 foreign car
makers, to submit bids.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government suffered a
budget deficit of 24 billion pesos (dlrs 585 million) in the first
half of 1998, a sharp reversal from the 4.5 billion peso (dlrs 110
million) surplus it enjoyed a year earlier, according to official
figures released Wednesday.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu blamed a drop in revenues for
the government's dismal fiscal performance.
	   He said a slowdown in business activities spawned by the
region's financial crisis reduced tax payments. The slowdown also
triggered a decline in imports, which in turn reduced duties
collected by the Bureau of Customs.
	   The administration of newly inaugurated President Joseph Estrada
hopes to improve the government's finances by offering an amnesty
for tax cheaters who agree to pay back taxes, cutting a deal with
the family of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos to split the half
billion dollars in Swiss bank accounts and withholding funds for
pork barrel public works projects sought by Congress members.
	   On Tuesday, Espiritu warned that the budget deficit could swell
to 70 billion pesos (dlrs 1.7 billion) this year if no steps are
taken to cut expenditures and raise tax revenues. However, if the
political will is there, the deficit can be reduced to around 20
billion pesos (dlrs 488 million), he said.
	   Total revenues collected by government in the first half stood
at 219.1 billion pesos (dlrs 5.3 billion), 12 percent less than the
projected level of 249.32 billion pesos (dlrs 6.1 billion). That
was slightly higher, however, than the year-earlier level of 215.55
billion pesos (dlrs 5.2 billion).

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's first car rental agency to feature electric
cars opened its doors Wednesday in hopes of tapping into a
fledgling market for environmentally-friendly transportation.
	   The Kobe Eco Car Co., located in the western city of Kobe,
offers 24 electric cars and 4 gas-electric hybrid automobiles. It
plans to increase its green fleet to a total of 80 vehicles by next
spring.
	   ``We expect the new service will be seen as good for both the
local environment and Kobe tourist industry,'' said company
spokesman Hiroko Kishi.
	   But customers will have to watch the fuel gauge carefully since
there are only 24 designated locations throughout Kobe for
recharging electric cars.
	   Kishi said the average rental price for electric vehicles is
7,000 yen (dlrs 50) per car for the first six hours of use, or
about 20 percent cheaper than a gasoline-fueled model of the same
size in Japan.
	   Toyota Motor Corp. and Osaka Gas Co. are among the 35 corporate
backers of Kobe Eco Car, which is capitalized at 200 million yen
(dlrs 1.43 million).
	   Kobe is located 435 kilometers (270 miles) west of Tokyo.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S. electronics firm Adaptec Inc. has laid off
a third of the work force at its Singapore operations, the company
said Wednesday.
	   As part of the company's ongoing global restructuring, the
Milpitas, California-based company is cutting back in Singapore
where it produces cards for personal computers by laying off 350
people.
	   The cuts amount to approximately 10 percent of the company's
worldwide staff.
	   ``Significant changes in the PC industry continue to impact
almost every leading computer-related manufacturer, including
Adaptec,'' chairman Grant Saviers said in a company statement
issued from the United States.
	   ``This difficult but necessary step is one of many that will
assist us in aligning expenses with revenue.''
	   According to the Singapore branch's human resources director,
the company had introduced a number of cost cutting measures in the
last few months, including shorter work weeks and temporary shut
downs.
	   But worsening economic conditions and the general slowdown in
global demand for its products finally compelled the company to
reduce its work force. No further retrenchments are planned,
however.
	   Adaptec has been operating in Singapore since 1987, and is
currently constructing a new manufacturing facility due for
completion and operation later this year.

Indian nuclear scientists barred from Britain, United States
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAMOLA TALWAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Four Indian nuclear researchers were denied
visas to enter Britain and the United States in the wake of Indian
nuclear tests that met worldwide condemnation, the scientists said
Wednesday.
	   R. Chidambaram, chairman of India's Atomic Energy Commission and
a key figure behind the May tests, was not issued a visa to attend
the four-day annual executive committee meeting of an international
group of crystal specialists that begins Wednesday in Arlington,
Virginia.
	   Placid Rodrigues, director of the Indira Gandhi Center for
Atomic Research and Baldev Raj, a top scientist from the same
institute were denied entry into Britain to attend a meeting last
week of editors of a scientific encyclopedia at Oxford University.
	   Another scientist from the Indira Gandhi center, N. Ravi, was
not issued a visa for a June-end meeting in Britain. His trip would
have been funded by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   ``It is just one of those things. But I do hope these
restrictions will ease in time. Scientists in general have always
been open to international cooperation,'' Chidambaram said.
	   A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in New Delhi refused specific
comment on Chidambaram's case but said U.S. law provided for the
refusal of visas to people from any country believed to be trying
to access nuclear technology.
	   The scientists from the Indira Gandhi center said that in
response to their visa applications, they received a fax stating
that it was British policy to refer to London ``applications from
those involved in atomic research.'' The British High Commission in
New Delhi had no immediate comment.
	   India's tests and retaliatory tests from rival Pakistan
conducted raised fears of a nuclear conflict in South Asia. India
and Pakistan have fought three wars since each gained independence
in 1947 and their troops still periodically clash along their
shared border.
	   Immediately after India tested nuclear bombs in May, local
newspapers reported, permission was withdrawn for two Indian
scientists to visit nuclear installations in Germany. The
scientists had been in Vienna for a conference organized by the
International Atomic Energy Agency.

Khatami nominates moderate as new interior minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's President Mohammad Khatami nominated
a moderate cleric as Interior Minister on Wednesday, setting the
stage for a confrontation with hard-liners in parliament who
impeached the previous minister for his reformist views.
	   In a letter to the Parliament, Khatami nominated Abdolvahed
Mousavi-Lari, a vice president and a key ally, to head the
ministry, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Mousavi-Lari, 44, was deputy minister of culture and Islamic
guidance in 1982-1992 when Khatami was the minister.
	   He left when Khatami was forced to resign by hard-liners who
objected to his giving the press more freedom, relaxing the
restrictions on state-run television, and permitting film-makers to
pursue non-Islamic themes.
	   The speaker of parliament, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, a hard-liner,
said that Mousavi-Lari's nomination would be debated on July 22.
	   To be appointed, Mousavi-Lari will need a majority of votes in
the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament, most of whose members are
regarded as hard-liners.

Spanish police detain 11 linked to Basque separatist newspaper,

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Police on Tuesday arrested 11 people and
raided a newspaper and a radio station linked to the armed Basque
separatist group ETA, the Interior Ministry said.
	   The arrests were ordered by a magistrate investigating how ETA
finances its campaign to carve out an independent homeland with
bombings and other attacks.
	   The 11 suspects were detained before dawn at their homes in a
number of Basque towns, including Bilbao and Hernani, and in
Pamplona in the neighboring Navarra region, a ministry official in
Madrid said.
	   The 11 are current or former board members of the Orain S.A.
company which publishes the Basque newspaper Egin and Egin Irratia
radio station.
	   Egin regularly publishes statements by ETA, including its claims
of responsibility for attacks. Last December Spain's National Court
found two Egin reporters guilty of weapons possession and
membership of ETA and sentenced them to 39 years each.
	   None of the 11 detained Wednesday were journalists, the ministry
said.
	   After the detentions were carried out police searched the
offices of the daily and the radio station in Hernani and Bilbao.
News reports said police prevented workers entering the offices in
Hernani early Wednesday.
	   The detainees include Pablo Gorostiaga, a senior member of Herri
Batasuna, a political party closely linked to ETA, Interior
Ministry officials said. Last year, 23 members of Herri Batasuna's
executive board were jailed on conviction of collaboration with a
terrorist group.
	   Officials said the latest raids were a follow-up to a May 28
police operation in which 11 people were arrested on suspicion of
aiding ETA's fundraising efforts. One was later released, officials
said.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since it began its
campaign in 1968.

Hong Kong stocks close sharply higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong stocks ended sharply higher
Wednesday, buoyed by futures-related buying, a stabilizing yen, and
a strong performance on key overseas stock and currency markets.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 277.29 points, or 3.4 percent, closing at 8,456.22. The index
had lost 5.2 percent in the past four sessions.
	   ``We've seen very strong buying in futures, which helps trigger
a rise in the cash market,'' said Lino Delgado, an associate
director at Amsteel Securities Ltd.
	   Trading volume rose to 4.64 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
594 million) from 2.70 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 346
million) in the previous session.
	   Analysts said optimism that new leadership will make more
aggressive moves to boost Japan's economy also pushed stock prices
up. A record run on Wall Street and lower local interest rates also
boosted sentiment.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 149.33 points Tuesday,
closing at 9,245.54.
	   The day's biggest gainers were HSBC Holdings, up 8.50 Hong Kong
dollars to 192.50, and Swire Pacific A, up 1.70 to 29.95.
	   Other gainers were Hang Seng Bank, up 1.40 to 42.60; Cheung Kong
Holdings, up 1.40 to 36.00, and Hutchison Whampoa, up 1.20 to
39.10.
	   The losers were Great Eagle Holdings, down 0.15 to 6.65, and
Hong Kong and China Gas, down 0.15 to 8.40.
	   Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific remained unchanged from
Tuesday's session at 6.70.

Japan ruling party elders scramble to name new prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reports of Obuchi gaining approval to present
himself as successor, other details &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Meeting behind closed doors and sliding screens,
Japanese ruling party members on Wednesday began sketching out
strategies for how to replace outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and win back their plunging public support.
	   Hashimoto's sudden decision Monday to resign over his Liberal
Democratic Party's disastrous performance in weekend elections has
left party elders with no obvious successor to fill the void,
though several possible contenders have emerged.
	   On Wednesday, the party asked for candidates to formally step
forward, a move that increases the pressure to settle on a party
standard bearer. It is hoping this will cool the wave of
speculation that has dominated Japan's media.
	   The party was expected to schedule a vote of its lawmakers in
both houses of Parliament to formally select a new party head next
Tuesday. A vote in Parliament, likely before the end of the month,
then would be held to choose the prime minister.
	   While the conservative ruling party suffered a setback in
Sunday's elections for the upper house of Parliament, it still
enjoys control over the Cabinet because it has a comfortable
majority in the more powerful lower house. Thus its party president
is assured of becoming prime minister.
	   But the party appears torn between calls for a fresh face in the
wake of its defeat at the polls, a desire to nominate a veteran
politician with a proven track record and a tradition for reaching
a broad consensus on its leadership.
	   Moving to fill the power vacuum, the Liberal Democrats' biggest
faction has begun to close ranks around Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi, a soft-spoken insider not known for bold policy
initiatives.
	   Japanese newspapers reported that party elders granted Obuchi
approval Wednesday to enter the race and that he will publicly
announce his candidacy Thursday.
	   While he has few enemies within the party, Obuchi is viewed by
some as a puppet for party elders who could prove an unpopular and
ineffective leader.
	   Another likely contender is Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi, a
maverick favored by younger party members. But Koizumi's chances
may be hurt by his status as a lone wolf and his efforts in the
past to privatize the postal ministry _ a traditional bastion of
support for the LDP.
	   Koizumi said Wednesday he would wait and see if he has a chance
of winning before deciding on whether to enter the race, the
mass-circulation Asahi Shimbun reported.
	   Other possibilities include former Chief Cabinet Secretary
Seiroku Kajiyama, a senior LDP politician with a reputation for
bluntness and business sense, and Yohei Kono _ the only former
party head who has yet to serve as prime minister.
	   The Asahi reported that Kajiyama did not oppose Obuchi's
candidacy at a meeting of ruling party officials Wednesday, a
possible sign that he may be putting himself out of contention.
	   The absence of a consensus so far has been reflected on Tokyo's
financial markets, where stocks and the yen have traded little
changed as investors await the decision of ruling party bosses.
	   Optimism that the choice of a Hashimoto successor will be
accompanied by new steps to stimulate Japan's recessionary economy
have been offset by nagging concerns that economic policy will be
held hostage to the same type of political haggling that dogged the
outgoing administration.
	   Critics have urged the party to be open in its selection of a
new premier.
	   ``A debate (on succession) which evokes the people's sympathy
will restore confidence in the Liberal Democratic Party, but such
trust is not born in smoky back rooms,'' the newspaper Mainichi
said in an editorial published Wednesday.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Fearing violence ahead of the July
26 elections, residents in Phnom Penh were stocking up on rice,
noodles, salt and other basic commodities Wednesday.
	   Though the election campaign so far has gone smoothly, many fear
that fighting will erupt in the capital on election day or after
the results of the polls are made public, with the unrest forcing
markets to shut down.
	   ``Not only me, my friends and neighbors are also buying
supplies,'' said Chheng Sor, 42, who bought 150 kilograms (330
pounds) of rice, three cases of dried noodles and 20 cans of
sardines Wednesday. ``We are afraid there will be fighting.''
	   Memories of last year's coup _ when contending forces used
tanks, artillery and rocket-propelled grenades in the streets of
the capital _ have put people on edge, she said.
	   Markets were closed for several days and people were shuttered
in their homes during the coup, in which Hun Sen ousted his
co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   Hun Sen has called for new elections this year to help win back
legitimacy in the eyes of the international community and foreign
aid lost after his violent takeover.
	   The prince, whose FUNCINPEC party won the 1993 election, went
into exile due to the coup but returned nine months later to
participate in the new polls.
	   Critics say the government has arranged the election process to
favor Hun Sen. But with thousands of people attending campaign
rallies held by Ranariddh and other opposition politicians, a
victory by Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party does not necessarily
seem assured.
	   In recent days, rumors have circulated in Phnom Penh that
violence could break out on or after election day, driving nervous
residents to begin to prepare for the worst.
	   ``People are buying one month's worth of rice,'' said Prum Sokha
Ly, a rice seller, adding that sales have tripled in the last few
days. ``They are afraid that they will be locked inside their
houses again or that markets will shut down.''
	   Bo Pha, a woman selling salt near the Mekong River, has also
seen a boom in her business. Handing a customer a 10-kilogram
(22-pound) bag of salt, she said, ``People worry that there might
be war.''
	   Others are preparing to leave Phnom Penh if tensions continue to
climb.
	   Forty-six-year-old Lieng Vuthy lost his niece in last year's
coup. His wife and son are still recovering from shrapnel wounds,
and all of his valuables were looted by Hun Sen's soldiers after
they succeeded in ousting Ranariddh.
	   ``If things look bad, we will visit my brother in Kompong
Chhnang province,'' he said. ``We can't live through that again.''

Soldiers acquitted of charge of killing and beating immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A court in southern Malaysia on
Wednesday acquitted four soldiers charged with killing an illegal
migrant by stepping on him and hitting him with rifle butts, the
national news agency reported.
	   Judge S.M. Komathy of Johor Baru sessions court said the
prosecution had failed to establish that the four had killed the
Indonesian immigrant in June 1997, Bernama news agency said.
	   The dead man was identified as Latisu Panibok, 27.
	   There were more soldiers present at the scene and witnesses'
versions were conflicting, the court said. Conviction would have
carried a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and a fine.
	   The judge also dropped a charge against the soldiers of injuring
two other Indonesians, Hamsor Roslan, 24, and Othman Abu Salim, 21,
by stepping on them, Bernama said.
	   Human rights groups long have accused authorities of abuse, rape
and torture in detention camps. The government has denied the
charges.
	   Under ``Operation Go Away,'' Malaysia has rounded up and
deported more than 30,000 Indonesians since the Asian economic
crisis worsened this year. It expects to deport 200,000 Indonesian
illegal immigrants by Aug. 15. At least eight illegal migrants have
been killed this year in clashes with security personnel.
	   At the height of Malaysia's economic prosperity and construction
boom, 700 Indonesian workers illegally sneaked in daily.

Russian counterintelligence head visits Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli leaders will discuss Russian technology
transfer to Iran with the head of Russia's principal secret
service, Israeli newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Lt. Gen. Nikolai Kovalyov, director of the Federal Security
Service, is in Israel for a one week, unofficial visit, the Yediot
Aharonot newspaper said. The service is the principal
counterintelligence and anti-terrorism agency and one of several
successors to the old Soviet KGB.
	   Israel is concerned about a nuclear power plant Russia is
building in Iran, saying it could help Iran advance its suspected
nuclear weapons program. Russia and Iran say the plant will be used
only for civilian purposes.
	   Israel and the United States also say Iran tried to develop a
long-range missile with the help of Russian companies and
scientists, which Russia has denied.
	   Israel's foreign ministry said it knew nothing of the visit, but
the Haaretz newspaper said meetings were planned between Kovalyov
and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, and Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky, as well
as with Kovalyov's counterparts in Israeli intelligence.
	   In addition to Russian technology transfer to Iran, Kovalyov was
expected to discuss cooperation between Israeli and Russian
intelligence agencies.
	   Sharansky, a former dissident who spent years in Soviet jails
before being allowed to move to Israel, has in the past expressed
his concerns about the alleged transfer of nuclear technology from
Russia to Iran.
	   Sharansky met with Kovalyov in the Soviet Union earlier this
year.

Takanohana keeps sole lead; Akebono, Musashimaru suffer defeats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Takanohana kept the sole lead at 11-0,
while Musashimaru suffered his second loss and Akebono his third
Wednesday, with four days left in the 15-day Nagoya Grand Sumo
Tournament.
	   No. 9 maegashira (senior wrestler) Kotonowaka was one victory
behind the leader at 10-1.
	   Takanonami was the wrestler who beat fellow ozeki (champion)
Musashimaru, leaving both tied at 9-2 with new yokozuna (grand
champion) Wakanohana. Takanonami dodged the initial charge by
Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani of Hawaii, and sent him out from
behind.
	   Yokozuna Akebono, or Chad Rowan from Hawaii, was at 8-3.
	   Yokozuna Takanohana, seeking his 19th tournament title, held off
No. 5 maegashira Ganyu's hand thrusts and sent him out, leaving
Ganyu at 3-8.
	   Kotonowaka slapped No. 15 maegashira Kinkaiyama's face in the
initial charge and bulldozed him out, leaving Kinkaiyama at 5-6.
	   Wakanohana, Takanohana's elder brother, downed No. 6 maegashira
Higonoumi (5-6) with a leg trick.
	   No. 5 maegashira Tochiazuma (6-5) dodged Akebono's initial
charge and sent him out when Akebono lost his balance.
	   No. 1 maegashira Oginishiki (2-9) withdrew from the tournament
because of injuries to his right arm suffered in a losing bout
Tuesday.
	   No. 11 maegashira Kyokushuzan (7-4), or Mongolian Batbayar
Davaa, sidestepped and threw down No. 11 maegashira Wakanosato
(6-5).
	   No. 15 maegashira Kyokutenho, or Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, also from
Mongolia, was tossed down by No. 10 maegashira Minatofuji (7-4) for
his eighth defeat against three victories.
	   Since he now cannot win a majority of his bouts in this
tournament, Kyokutenho may be demoted from his present rank before
the next tournament in September.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 50-ranked Ikemori
(2-4), or Brazilian Luis Go Ikemori, forced out No. 55-ranked
Komachikara.
	   No. 27-ranked Wakaazuma (3-3), or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil,
pushed out No. 31-ranked Tsujimoto.
	   No. 2-ranked Hoshitango (5-1), or Argentine Imach Marcelo
Salomon, slapped down No. 5-ranked Wakanoyama.
	   No. 56-ranked Kitaazuma (3-3), or Brazilian Tetsuya Takeda, was
sent out by No. 53-ranked Nakabuchi.
	   No. 10-ranked Hoshiandesu (4-2), or Argentine Jose Antonio
Juarez, was driven out by No. 12-ranked Wakakosho.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Editor of powerful Malaysian daily quits under pressure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Ed: SUBS 3rd graf to fix misplaced comma &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The chief editor of one of
Malaysia's leading newspapers has resigned, apparently over
differences with the governing party of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Johan Jaafar, of the Utusan Melayu publishing house, handed in
his resignation to Mahathir on Tuesday, the domestic news agency
Bernama reported.
	   Johan, 44, had headed the group that publishes Utusan Malaysia,
the country's most influential Malay newspaper, since 1992.
	   The resignation followed Mahathir's recent jabs at the local
press about its ``negative'' reporting of Kuala Lumpur's new
international airport, still suffering from teething troubles.
	   Normally staid newspapers have published accounts of computer
failures and woeful tales of delays and lost baggage since the
airport opened last month.
	   Most papers follow a ``speak no evil'' policy in reporting on
the government and the ruling party and local reporters say they
have to tread carefully in reporting sensitive stories like the
differences between Mahathir and his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, over
economic policy.
	   Newspapers must get annual permits from the Home Ministry to
publish. The ministry is headed by Mahathir.
	   A journalist from Utusan quoted Johan as saying his resignation
was ``to prevent his presence from impeding the progress of the
group's newspapers and publications,'' Bernama reported. Johan
announced his resignation at an editorial meeting Tuesday.
	   Rustam Sani, a noted social critic and a former professor at
National University, said Johan had been perceived by some as
demonstrating a pro-Anwar bias by highlighting the allegations of
nepotism and cronyism that had gripped last month's annual
convention of the ruling United Malays National Organization.
	   ``Their line of reporting has always been favorable to Anwar,''
he said.
	   ``It is not the first time,'' said Lim Kit Siang, the opposition
leader in Parliament.
	   The chief editor of a powerful English daily was similarly
removed in the mid-1980s, said Lim, leader of the Democratic Action
Party.
	   ``This does not bode well for the development of an articulate,
responsible and vibrant press,'' he said.
	   The daily has a circulation of about 250,000. On Sundays it
sells about half a million copies. The group is largely owned by
Mahathir's UMNO party and the chief editor is often a political
appointee of the prime minister.
	   The Utusan group was founded in 1939 and was a component of
Malaysia's national movement against British colonists.

Khatami nominates moderate as new interior minister

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's President Mohammad Khatami nominated
a moderate cleric as Interior Minister on Wednesday, setting the
stage for a confrontation with hard-liners in parliament who
impeached the previous minister for his reformist views.
	   In a letter to the Parliament, Khatami nominated Abdolvahed
Mousavi-Lari, a vice president and a key ally, to head the
ministry, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Mousavi-Lari, 44, was deputy minister of culture and Islamic
guidance in 1982-1992 when Khatami was the minister.
	   He left when Khatami was forced to resign by hard-liners who
objected to his giving the press more freedom, liberalizing
state-run television, and permitting film-makers to pursue
non-Islamic themes.
	   The speaker of parliament, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, a hard-liner,
said that Mousavi-Lari's nomination would be debated on July 22.
	   To be appointed, Mousavi-Lari will need a majority of votes in
the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament.
	   Although most of Majlis members are hard-liners, it is thought
they could still approve Mousavi-Lari's appointment in deference to
Khatami's conspicuous popularity.
	   The president, who beat Nateq-Nouri by a landslide in last
year's elections, has won wide support for his moves to ease social
restrictions, encourage political freedom, and end nearly 20 years
of hostility with the United States.
	   But such moves have also stirred the hard-liners to attack the
Khatami camp. They have brought to trial on graft charges the mayor
of Tehran, who ran Khatami's election campaign, and they impeached
Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri last month on grounds of his
allowing political demonstrations and relaxing the social dress
code in this Islamic state.
	   It is thought that by impeaching Nouri, the hard-line
legislators had hoped to pressure Khatami into appointing one of
their own to the Interior Ministry. The radicals already control
the armed forces, the Intelligence Ministry, and the state-run
radio and television.
	   Khatami's nomination of Mousavi-Lari underscores his
determination to keep the Interior Ministry on the reformist track.
	   ``Mr. Khatami needs an interior minister to push forward his
campaign slogans calling for political progress,'' said a
pro-Khatami legislator, Mohammad Reza Khabbazz.
	   ``His choice of Mr. Mousavi-Lari shows that he is not prepared
to withdraw from his campaign slogans,'' he said.

	   YEKATERINBURG, Russia (AP) _ Eighty years after Russia's last
czar and his family were executed, their much-disputed bones were
to be placed in small wooden coffins Wednesday and readied for a
state burial alongside their royal ancestors.
	   President Boris Yeltsin was the driving force behind the plans
for the burial, originally intended as a dignified way to close a
bloody chapter in the country's turbulent history.
	   But the event has been dogged by controversy, and most of the
country's leading religious and political figures _ including
Yeltsin _ will not attend the scaled-back services, which culminate
with the burial Friday in St. Petersburg.
	   Czar Nicholas II and his family were executed by the Bolsheviks
on July 17, 1918, in the central Russian city of Yekaterinburg, and
their bodies were dumped in an unmarked pit until they were
unearthed in 1991.
	   After seven years filled with political wrangling, the three-day
burial ceremony was to began Wednesday in Yekaterinburg.
	   On Tuesday, the coffins were brought into the room at the city
morgue where the bones have been kept in glass sarcophagi. The
bones were to be transferred to the coffins later Wednesday.
	   The coffins will hold the remains of Nicholas, his wife
Alexandra, three of their five children, and four servants. The
other two children _ including the heir to throne Alexei _ were
also executed in 1918. But their remains have not been found and
most investigators believe the bodies were burned to ashes.
	   Even as the ceremonies were poised to began, the dispute
surrounding the event carried on.
	   Yekaterinburg's Gov. Eduard Rossel, who fought hard to have the
remains interred in Yekaterinburg, said he too would snub the
actual ceremony in St. Petersburg.
	   ``There are petty political games going on around the remains
and I don't want to take part in this politicking,'' he told a news
conference.
	   The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexei II,
made a rare television appearance Tuesday evening to again question
the authenticity of the remains and criticize the burial service.
	   He claimed that ``important scientific objections remain.'' But
extensive DNA testing in the United States, Russia, and England has
convinced the scientists that the bones belong to Nicholas and his
family.
	   The coffins will be flown to St. Petersburg on Thursday and
buried Friday in the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral, where most of
the Romanov monarchs are interred.
	   Meanwhile, Alexander Avdonin, a geologist who found the remains
after years of searching, said he was upset that the ceremony had
been scaled back due to the controversies.
	   ``The funeral is an event of world-level importance, and the low
level does not befit it,'' he said.
	   The czar's surviving relatives have also been split over the
service, with some planning to attend and others boycotting.
	   Nicholas Romanov, head of the Romanov Family Association, said
in St. Petersburg, that he was satisfied with the way the burial
was being handled.
	   ``We Romanovs have always expressed the opinion that we didn't
want the burial to be a carnival,'' he said. ``We wanted it to be
quiet and solemn, so as far as we are concerned, the simpler the
better.''

Myanmar opposition alliance urges military to open dialogue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A loose confederation of Myanmar
opposition groups expressed concern Wednesday over escalating
political tensions in the country and urged the military government
to open a dialogue with its opponents before the nation erupts in
violence.
	   The military government ``has to decide whether to hold a
dialogue while there is still time,'' said a statement issued by
the Democratic Alliance of Burma, which consists of various ethnic
groups fighting the government and exiles who support democracy.
	   ``We wish to express our support for the (members of Parliament)
who are being persecuted and tortured by the government,'' the DAB
said, referring to members of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
political party.
	   Her party, the National League for Democracy, won 82 percent of
the seats in Parliament in an election held in 1990. The military
government refused to recognize the result and has jailed many of
the winners.
	   Recently, tensions have been increasing as Suu Kyi has called on
the military to allow Parliament to convene by Aug. 21.
	   In response, the military has stepped up repression against her
party members who were elected to parliament.
	   ``The people of Burma have chosen the NLD as their
representatives. The NLD therefore has the right to convene
Parliament and form a government,'' the DAB said.
	   ``It is the government who have illegally seized power against
the will of the people, and who are the source of the current
problems,'' the DAB said. ``They will have to take responsibility
if the people rise up and use whatever means they can to gain
democracy.''

China denies Lott's allegations about U.S. satellite exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Declaring that American rumor mongers were out to
wreck warming Chinese-U.S. ties, China on Wednesday denied a Senate
leader's allegations that it used U.S. satellite technology to
boost military power.
	   ``We have reiterated many times that the Chinese side would not
and could not acquire American military technology in the course of
supplying launching services for U.S. satellites,'' said Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang.
	   ``The American side is clear about this,'' Tang added in a
statement.
	   Tang was responding to renewed assertions Tuesday by U.S. Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott that China used sensitive technology
from U.S. satellite exports to enhance its military capability.
	   While not naming Lott, Tang said that ``a few people in America,
in disregarding the facts, make stories out of nothing, creating
rumors and trouble. The aim is to obstruct and damage the
improvement and development of China-U.S. relations.''
	   ``Their attempts are bound to fail,'' Tang added.
	   Controversy over whether China obtained sensitive technology by
launching U.S.-made satellites and whether U.S. President Bill
Clinton allowed the exports in return for campaign donations
persists despite Clinton's widely praised visit to Beijing last
month.
	   In a sign of the cooperation promoted by Clinton's nine-day
China tour, high-ranking Chinese and U.S. military officers ended
two days of talks Wednesday on avoiding conflicts at sea.
	   Tang characterized China-U.S. cooperation on satellite launches
as normal, commercial activity that ``accords with the interests of
both sides.''
	   Lott characterized his comments as ``an interim report'' from a
Senate inquiry into Clinton's decision to let two U.S. aerospace
companies, Loral Space and Communications and Hughes Electronics
Corp., export satellites for launch atop Chinese rockets.
	   ``Senate investigators have found that sensitive technology
related to satellite exports has been transferred to China ... in
violation of stated U.S. policy,'' Lott said. ``China has received
military benefit from U.S. satellite exports.''
	   Lott offered no specifics and his remarks drew criticism from
the opposition Democrats and polite skepticism from at least one
senior Republican colleague. Clinton spokesman Mike McCurry
dismissed Lott's charges as ``not a serious statement.''

Indonesian leader confident IMF will release bailout money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie said Wednesday
he is confident that the International Monetary Fund will restart
bailout payments to his crisis-ridden nation.
	   Habibie said he was hopeful that a meeting of IMF executives,
scheduled in Washington later Wednesday, would decide to disburse a
dlrs 1 billion aid installment as part of a dlrs 43 billion rescue
plan.
	   The president made his comments while visiting an Islamic school
east of Jakarta.
	   Indonesia's economy is suffering its worst crisis in 30 years.
	   The IMF and Indonesian officials agreed on a bailout program
last year. However, the plan stalled several times when the IMF
complained that then-President Suharto was not living up to
promises to reform the economy.
	   The dlrs 1 billion payment was postponed in May when political
turmoil, riots and protests forced Suharto to quit after 32 years
in power.
	   His successor, Habibie, restarted negotiations with the IMF and
is following through with tough reforms.
	   In Singapore, Kadhim Al-Eyd, the IMF representative in
Indonesia, told reporters that the IMF's executive board would
approve the disbursement of the dlrs 1 billion.
	   He said the funds would be ``available in a day or two'' after
that.
	   Indonesia had implemented the IMF program satisfactorily and
hopes the impending move will ease the country's financial woes, he
said.

Princess Stephanie of Monaco gives birth to baby girl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ Princess Stephanie of Monaco gave birth to a baby
girl on Wednesday, and named her Camille Marie Kelly, the palace
press office said.
	   Stephanie, 33, gave birth at 9.23 a.m. (0723 GMT) at the
Princess Grace Hospital. The identity of the father of Stephanie's
baby was not made public.
	   Mother and child were doing fine, the press office said, some
two hours after the birth. An official communique was not planned.
	   Stephanie already has two children, Louis, 5, and Pauline, 4,
from her marriage to Daniel Ducruet whom she divorced in October
1996, after 15 months of marriage. Both children were born before
the couple married.
	   Stephanie divorced Ducruet after Italian magazines printed a
batch of photos showing him in a poolside romp with the
then-reigning Miss Nude Belgium, Fili Houteman.
	   Stephanie is one of three children of Prince Rainier and former
American filmstar Grace Kelly who was killed in a car crash Sept.
14, 1982.

China gives judge 15 years in prison for bribery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A senior Chinese judge has been sentenced to 15
years in prison for accepting 250,000 yuan (dlrs 30,000) in bribes,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   The case against Pan Yile, vice president of the Higher People's
Court in the southern Guangxi region, comes amid a high-profile
campaign to purge China's graft-ridden judiciary.
	   Worried that corrupt judges are undermining public confidence in
China's nascent legal system, Chinese leaders have ordered most
trials open to media coverage. On Saturday, state-run television
made the first ever nationwide live broadcast of a trial.
	   Because of Pan's high rank and influence in Guangxi, his case
was turned over to courts in Beijing, 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) to the north, Xinhua said.
	   Investigators found that in 1995, Pan handled two lawsuits filed
by an auction house owner identified only as Gao, Xinhua said,
citing the Supreme People's Court.
	   According to the report, the following year Gao gave Pan a 10
percent stake in a gold mining company worth 250,000 yuan (dlrs
30,000) and named the judge vice chairman of the board of
directors. Pan forged documents to cover up the bribe.
	   Pan, 58, told state-run television that he had been trying to
save money for his retirement.
	   Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court found Pan guilty of
taking bribes, and, after the judge appealed, the verdict was
upheld by a higher court, Xinhua said.

Prince fears arrest if his party wins elections

<TEXT>
	   KAMPOT, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh predicted Wednesday that if his party wins upcoming
elections, Cambodian strongman Hun Sen would arrest him rather than
cede power.
	   The most dangerous period, Ranariddh told reporters after a
campaign appearance in this southern town, will come between the
vote July 26 and the announcement of preliminary results Aug. 4.
	   In the interval, Hun Sen will gauge what steps he needs to take
to remain in power, Ranariddh said.
	   ``I think the most dangerous period for Cambodia will be after
the elections,'' Ranariddh said. ``If Mr. Hun Sen comes to arrest
me under any circumstances, I think the international community and
Cambodians will react very strongly.''
	   The statement underscored fears that decades of turmoil for
Cambodia will not end with the parliamentary elections.
	   The United Nations and several foreign countries have sent
observers to Cambodia for the vote, coming just over a year after
Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a coup.
	   In 1993, the prince's royalist FUNCINPEC party won
U.N.-sponsored elections, but Hun Sen forced his way into a
coalition by threatening civil war.
	   Then as now, Hun Sen controls the armed forces. And this time,
there are no U.N. peacekeepers deployed, only observers. Hun Sen
has said he will step down peacefully if his Cambodian People's
Party loses, but many doubt his intentions.
	   The National Election Committee overseeing the election is
packed with Hun Sen supporters. His defense minister, Tea Banh, has
alleged without showing proof that FUNCINPEC is building an illegal
2,000-man armed militia and could be disqualified.
	   Ranariddh does have a small group of loyal government soldiers
who support him near the Thai border, but they have been observing
a cease-fire since March.
	   ``I think he is supplying a pretext to prevent FUNCINPEC from
standing in the elections,'' Ranariddh said.
	   Ranariddh said he believed that if the committee disqualified
FUNCINPEC, the biggest opposition grouping, there would be ``big,
big problems in this country.''
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to win back international
legitimacy and foreign aid lost because of the coup.
	   Hun Sen has run Cambodia for most of the years since 1985, when
he rose to the top of a Hanoi-backed government put in place after
Vietnam's troops overthrew the genocidal Khmer Rouge in 1979.
	   Ranariddh, son of constitutional King Norodom Sihanouk, and
dissident Sam Rainsy, a former finance minister and one-time
FUNCINPEC member, are Hun Sen's main challengers.
	   The prince said he believed that Sam Rainsy could set aside a
bitter enmity with Hun Sen to form an eventual coalition.
	   In a campaign speech under a sweltering tropical sun, the prince
thanked about 4,000 supporters for braving what he said was
persistent intimidation by Hun Sen's authorities.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy supporters have been the targets of
violence and frequently murder. Human rights investigators say that
many of the killings are political. Arrests are rare.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party filed a complaint with the election
commission that a gunman killed a party activist Tuesday in Siem
Reap, northern Cambodia.
	   ``We have yet to see even one serious investigation into the
many reported cases of violence during this campaign, all of which
appear to be the work of the ruling party or its supporters,'' the
party said in a statement.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ After knocking down a Singapore woman, a young
couple in a car did errands around town before taking the badly
injured woman to a hospital, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Writhing in pain in the back seat, Lim Bee Bee, 31, was too numb
to remember the couple's faces or the car's license plate, New
Paper reported.
	   After putting the injured photo studio worker in the car last
Friday, the couple drove to a parking lot, and the male driver left
the car for several minutes, it said.
	   During that time, Lim was able to borrow a hand phone from the
woman. She called a friend, who later told police that Lim sounded
incoherent and could not say where she was.
	   It was only then that the couple drove Lim to the hospital, the
paper said.
	   The hospital staff thought that the woman, who briefly escorted
Lim inside, was a relative.
	   Lim immediately underwent abdominal surgery to stop internal
bleeding. She was in stable condition earlier this week.

Parliament to debate whether to probe Turkish prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The Turkish Parliament has decided to
debate whether to investigate allegations that Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz illegally allocated state land to a private firm, the
legislative body said Wednesday.
	   Legislators voted 225 to 213 late Tuesday to discuss the motion
for an investigation, which was sponsored by pro-Islamic Virtue
Party, sometime in the next nine days, according to the
parliamentary press office.
	   The Virtue Party accuses Yilmaz of allocating the land near the
western city of Izmit to a leading Turkish holding, Koc.
	   Yilmaz already was being investigated on two corruption charges,
for allegedly trying to conceal some of his personal wealth and for
costing the state money by awarding consulting work to private
firms.
	   If the investigatory commissions find evidence of corruption,
Parliament would have to vote on whether to prosecute Yilmaz.
	   Yilmaz, leader of the center-right Motherland Party, denies any
irregularity.
	   The Virtue Party is the main opposition party, with 145 deputies
in the 550-member Parliament. It is the successor of the Islamic
Welfare Party, which was forced out of power by the secular
military last year because of its radical Islamic policies.
	   The two previous inquiries were pushed by the center-right True
Path Party led by Yilmaz's bitter rival, ex-premier Tansu Ciller.
	   Yilmaz came to power last year after the military forced the
Islamic Welfare Party out of power.

Economic crisis hits Brunei as Sultan spreads the wealth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ When you are rich, gifts can
flow the other way on birthdays.
	   One the world's wealthiest men celebrated his 52nd Wednesday by
giving most of his country's work force a fatter paycheck to
cushion an eroding economy.
	   Many tuned in to the sultan of Brunei's nationally televised
birthday speech hoping it would shed light on the country's
economic health. They were curious to see if he would mention the
news on everyone's mind: multibillion-dollar losses at the nation's
largest private company.
	   The sultan did not mention Amedeo Development Corp., the
government's flagship investment company, run by his younger
brother, Prince Jefri. But he did say his isolated, oil-rich
sultanate was not immune from the Asian economic crisis.
	   Speaking from his 1,788-room palace, his two wives seated on
either side, the sultan looked tense as he read from his prepared
text. His birthday speeches rarely go into politics or the economy.
	   ``During this period of economic turmoil in Southeast Asia, our
country is not spared from feeling the effects,'' said the sultan,
dressed in a traditional Brunei costume of blue and gold silk.
``This should teach us to be more prudent and take preventive
steps, including austerity measures in our expenditures.''
	   That said, the sultan gave all government workers a raise, or a
``special cost of living allowance,'' effective July 1. It would
increase salaries up to 14 percent, with lower-income employees
benefiting the most.
	   In Brunei, where 80 percent of the work force is employed by the
government, the average salary is dlrs 15,800, one of the highest
in the region.
	   The sultan said the government had ``taken the steps deemed
necessary'' to balance the effects of the economic downturn,
including an economic council manned by government and business
leaders. He said the government had met with several countries to
discuss tax exemptions and investments.
	   But details about the government coffers in the small kingdom of
300,000 people weren't really expected. Under a state of emergency
imposed in 1962, it is a crime punishable by prison to reveal the
country's currency reserves. The government budget is also kept
secret.
	   The sultan did say Brunei would be able to continue with
development projects despite the economic downturn.
	   The assurance came two weeks after Amedeo collapsed under losses
estimated as high as dlrs 16 billion. With interests worldwide,
Amedeo has millions of dollars of debt to building contractors and
suppliers. Prince Jefri and his top staff are believed to have fled
to Europe.
	   The sultan's only allusion to the financial fiasco may have been
in this one cryptic statement: ``Whatever has been experienced, or
is being experienced by the country, is all history.''
	   Amedeo's troubles triggered concern of financial turmoil in the
isolated kingdom on Borneo Island, already affected by a 40 percent
slump in worldwide oil prices. Brunei's economy is almost entirely
reliant on oil sales.
	   Government officials, diplomats and overseas guests attended the
sultan's speech. Indonesia's military leader, Gen. Wiranto, was
awarded a badge of courage.
	   In the past, the sultan's birthday gifts to his people have
included free concerts by Michael Jackson. The pay raise comes
during more frugal times, as Southeast Asian neighbors have frozen
government salaries and are fighting unemployment.
	   Bruneians said the sultan's move boosted confidence.
	   ``It shows the sultan is not going to let us get hurt,'' said
Jana Idris, 27, a hotel manager.
	   Earlier in the day, the sultan opened his birthday celebration
with an hour-long military parade in the center of town. Thousands
of national flags waved as bagpipes carried by Bruneians in kilts
sounded national songs.
	   The sultan, seated on gold-velvet cushions, drove through the
military parade in a Land Rover, while an attendant shaded him with
a parasol.
	   ``Life seems to be all right here,'' said Mohamad Sufri, a
businessman, as the sultan exited the parade in a black Rolls
Royce.

UN Security Council to take up Iraq nuclear issue last week in
</HEADLINE>
July &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council plans this
month to consider a report by the Vienna-based International Atomic
Energy Agency which could lead to a scaling back of nuclear
inspections in Iraq, U.N. sources said here Wednesday.
	   The head of the IAEA's Iraq inspection program, Garry Dillon,
will travel to New York for the council session, which is
tentatively set for July 29, the sources said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Scaling back on nuclear inspections in Iraq has been a goal of
the Russians, French and Chinese. Those three permanent council
members have been urging U.N. inspectors to wrap up the seven-year
program to determine whether Iraq has destroyed all long-range
missiles and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
	   Iraqi compliance with that demand is the main condition for the
council to lift crippling economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in
1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering the
Gulf War.
	   Last month, Russia, France and China urged the 15-member council
to certify that Iraq had dismantled its nuclear weapons research
program and to order the IAEA to shift from ``intrusive
inspections'' to an on-going monitoring program of Iraqi
facilities.
	   Their demand was based on a series of IAEA reports which said
that seven years of monitoring had produced no evidence that Iraq
was maintaining a clandestine nuclear weapons program. But the
agency stopped short of declaring Iraq in full compliance.
	   Despite acknowledging progress in the nuclear field, the United
States argued last month that Iraq had still failed to provide
answers to all IAEA questions on nuclear program, which Baghdad
claims was dismantled shortly after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Among other things, the Iraqis have refused to provide a full
list of all secret contacts with foreign nuclear experts before
1991.
	   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson,
argued that Iraq must also give more information on its
weapons-grade material and equipment used to make nuclear weapons.
	   U.S. and U.N. experts believe the Iraqis were within a year of
developing a nuclear bomb before the outbreak of the Gulf War.
	   Under a compromise last month, the Americans and Russians agreed
that the IAEA would submit a new report on the Iraqi nuclear
program by the end of this month ``for possible action at that
time.''
	   Otherwise, the issue will come up again after the next regular
IAEA report in October. The sources said the draft report to be
sent to the Security Council had been submitted to the agency's
director, Mohammed el-Baradei, for a final review.
	   But the sources said the draft was fundamentally no different
from the previous IAEA reports.
	   The IAEA is responsible only for inspections of Iraqi nuclear
facilities. The U.N. Special Commission, headquartered in New York,
inspects Iraqi missile, biological and chemical weapons programs.
	   Commission director Richard Butler has said much work needs to
be done before those weapons files can be closed.

Jazz singer Beryl Bryden dead at 78
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Jazz singer Beryl Bryden, dubbed ``Britain's queen
of the blues'' by Ella Fitzgerald, has died of cancer of the lymph
glands, a family friend said Wednesday. She was 78.
	   Miss Bryden died at St. Mary's Hospital in London, record
producer Hugh Palmer said.
	   In a career spanning 50 years, Miss Bryden performed with many
of the jazz greats, including Billie Holliday and Louis Armstrong.
	   Born in Norwich, eastern England, on May 11, 1920, she worked as
a shorthand typist before starting her music career with the
amateur Cambridge Jazz Club. She went on to record more than 100
songs.
	   They included ''Rock Island Line,'' with Lonnie Donegan, which
sold two million copies in 1954.
	   Despite her illness, she performed in Eindhoven, the
Netherlands, as recently as last month.
	   ``She was a woman of indomitable courage who would never let her
fans down or disappoint an audience that had paid to see her,''
Palmer said. ``When I visited her last at St. Mary's she was very
seriously ill but she refused to cancel forthcoming concert
appearances.''
	   ``Performing, and the sight and sound of an audience enjoying
her music, was breath and life to her,'' he said.
	   Funeral details were not immediately announced. There was no
immediate word on survivors.

 &UR; With China-US &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Senior Chinese and U.S. military officers ended
two days of discussions Wednesday on how to avoid accidental armed
conflict between the two navies.
	   The talks were the first of what are supposed to be annual
consultations on maritime safety. Chinese and U.S. Presidents Jiang
Zemin and Bill Clinton agreed to the discussions in October and
fixed the time for the first round during last month's Beijing
summit.
	   Rear Adm. Zhao Guojun, deputy chief of staff of the Chinese
navy, and Maj. Gen. Earl Hailstone, planning and policy officer for
the U.S. Pacific Command, headed the talks and outlined rules and
practices of naval operations, China's official Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   Zhao pledged to cooperate with the United States to bolster the
exchange, Xinhua said.
	   Washington proposed holding the consultations after China's
missile launches and war games around Taiwan in 1996. Washington
sent aircraft carriers near the island as a warning to Beijing, and
the two navies found themselves operating dangerously close to each
other.
	   Military-to-military ties have improved steadily through
high-level contacts and small-scale exchanges meant to build
confidence. The two sides have traded views on disaster relief
operations and China has agreed to send observers to U.S. naval and
air force exercises this year.

Ukraine's population decreases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's population has decreased from
52.2 million people to 50.5 million since 1992, a demographer said,
according to a report published Wednesday.
	   Ukraine, like Russia and some other former Soviet republics, has
seen life expectancies fall in recent years due to declining health
care and economic turmoil that has left millions impoverished.
	   People over 60 years of age constitute 20 percent of Ukraine's
population, said Valentyna Steshenko, head of the demography
department at the Academy of Sciences' Economics Institute.
	   The average life expectancy for men in the former Soviet
republic is 62.3 years and for women 73.2 years, she said,
according to the daily Fakty.
	   Ukraine is some 9 years behind Western nations in average life
expectancy and 12 years behind Japan, the report noted.

British favorites: Woods and Westwood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Is Tiger Woods, who hasn't been a
factor in a major since winning the Masters last year, in a slump?
	   No way, says buddy and mentor Mark O'Meara.
	   ``I think Tiger Woods is going to win a lot of major
championships before his career is over,'' O'Meara said. ``I think
he is only going to get stronger. He is going to learn over the
next three to four years when to use his strengths and when to back
off. It is just a matter of time before he wins again.''
	   Woods, who struggled with his putter at the U.S. Open, went to
Ireland with O'Meara last week to fish and play golf in conditions
like he will likely face at Royal Birkdale.
	   O'Meara said Woods can't be expected to win every tournament he
enters because the competition is so strong. But he pointed to the
fact Woods usually finishes high in tournaments as evidence of the
strength of his game.
	   ``It's difficult to win every single week,'' O'Meara said. ``If
you look at Tiger's record in a year and a half, he has finished in
the top 10, he told me the other day, 50 percent of the tournaments
he has played in.''
	   Woods himself believes his game is better than it was when he
won at Augusta.
	   ``I think overall my game is better and it is really neat to
see,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, you just don't get the breaks
sometimes and then win.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TIGER ODDS: &LR;  British oddsmakers continue to believe in Woods,
who is a co-favorite with England's Lee Westwood at local betting
shops.
	   But it's the first time since his victory at the 1997 Masters
that Woods has not been listed by the London bookmaker Ladbrokes as
the sole betting favorite for any tournament he's played.
	   Woods and Westwood are both 11-1 in the latest odds to win at
Royal Birkdale, followed by David Duval and Colin Montgomerie at
14-1. Defending champion Justin Leonard, Ernie Els, Fred Couples
and Jim Furyk are at 16-1, while Tom Lehman and Mark O'Meara are
25-1.
	   Westwood, the rising British star, earned his co-favorite status
by winning the Loch Lomond tournament last weekend. He has three
victories in his last four European tour starts and seven wins in
seven countries in the past nine months.
	   ``He is showing the two characteristics that the betting public
dreams of, consistency and coolness under pressure,'' Ladbrokes
spokesman Andy Clifton said.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; KUCHAR'S CASH: &LR;  Matt Kuchar's phone keeps ringing with offers
from agents and others who hope he will turn pro.
	   The star amateur began the year planning to finish his remaining
two years at Georgia Tech. But his strong showing in the Masters
and U.S. Open and his marketable smile have brought promises of big
money.
	   ``I don't really know what a million is going to do for me,''
Kuchar said before going out Tuesday for a practice round. ``I've
always played around with a couple of thousand to get by on tuition
and buying books and buying food for myself.''
	   Kuchar said he is not sure if he will turn pro or go back to
school.
	   ``Right now I am dead in the middle,'' he said. ``It seems to be
all I think about and it's hard to get focused on playing golf when
everybody wants to know what's going to happen in the future.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; JANZEN'S CADDIE: &LR;  Lee Janzen gave a lot of credit to caddie
Dave Musgrove when he won the U.S. Open. Now Musgrove is carrying
Janzen's bag in a tournament he is a lot more at home in.
	   Musgrove has been helping pick clubs for the winner in three
different majors. He there when Seve Ballesteros won the British
Open in 1979 and when Sandy Lyle took the title in 1985. He was
also on the bag for Lyle's win at the Masters in 1988.
	   ``He doesn't even know how many Opens he's been to, he has been
to so many,'' Janzen said. ``He has been here before and that will
be very helpful. He has the experience to know what to do when it
comes to handling the wind.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MILLION BUCKS: &LR;  The British Open title, national adulation and
the dlrs 498,000 first prize aren't the only things at stake for
Lee Westwood at Royal Birkdale.
	   By winning the Loch Lomond World Invitational in Scotland,
Westwood set himself up for a dlrs 1 million bonus if he could win
the British Open.
	   Loch Lomond sponsor, Standard Life, put up the bonus as an
incentive for any player who could win both tournaments.
	   ``If I was to win the Open, the million dollars extra would be
fantastic,'' Westwood said. ``But actually winning the Open means
more to me.''
	   ____ &QC; 
	    &UR; IAN'S BACK: &LR;  The last time the British Open was played at Royal
Birkdale, Ian Baker-Finch shot 64-66 on the weekend to win by two
strokes.
	   Seven years later, Baker-Finch is back. But this time he'll be
in the broadcast booth for ABC Sports, courtesy of a nosedive that
began in the years since winning his first and only major.
	   The Australian's only victory since Birkdale was the 1993
Australian PGA, and he has not made a cut in America since 1994.
	   At Royal Troon last year, Baker-Finch withdrew after a 92 in the
first round. At St. Andrews in 1995, he hooked his drive so badly
on the first tee that it cleared the adjacent 18th fairway and went
out of bounds.
	   He said earlier this year he was stepping away from the game and
will work as a golf broadcaster.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DIVOTS: &LR;  Bill Glasson, recovering from elbow surgery, withdrew
from the British Open on Tuesday. That opened a spot for Barry
Lane, the first alternate in qualifying. ... Nick Faldo, who
withdrew from the Loch Lomond tuneup after injuring his elbow in
practice, said he was feeling fine after a practice round on Royal
Birkdale. ... While Jack Nicklaus will miss his first British Open
since 1962, his son, Gary, also missed out on being in the field.
Gary Nicklaus bogeyed the last three holes and then lost in a
playoff for the final qualifying spot.

Asian stocks gain, buoyed by optimism over Japan's new leadership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ After initial uncertainty, most Asian stock
markets closed higher Wednesday, buoyed by optimism that Japan's
next government will put that nation's ailing economy back on
track.
	   Tokyo stocks extended their gains for the third consecutive day
on hopes that the successor to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,
who resigned Monday, will be more aggressive on such longstanding
issues as a permanent tax cut.
	   The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues rose 125.23 points, or
0.76 percent, closing at 16,614.14. It had gained 128.52 points
Tuesday.
	   The market hoped for ``a less fiscally restrained post-Hashimoto
administration,'' said Dhia Amir, a senior institutional sales
trader at Nomura Securities in Tokyo.
	   In the currency market, the dollar was trading at 140.66 yen in
late Tokyo trading, down 0.70 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo but
above its late New York rate of 140.02 yen overnight.
	   In Seoul, shares closed sharply higher, with the key index
rising 2.2 percent on hopes of a more stable yen.
	   The benchmark index closed at 313.42, up 6.69 points.
	   Hong Kong stocks closed sharply higher, buoyed by
futures-related buying, a stabilizing yen, and a strong performance
on key overseas stock and currency markets.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 277.29 points, or 3.4 percent, closing at 8,456.22. The index
had shed 5.2 percent in the past four sessions.
	   Analysts said optimism that new leadership will take more
aggressive steps to stabilize Japan's ailing economy also pushed
stock prices up, adding that a record run on Wall Street and lower
local interest rates also boosted sentiment.
	   Elsewhere:
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand stocks finished higher on a fall in
short-term interest rates and a record performance of the U.S.
share market overnight. The NZSE-40 capital index gained 27.72,
closing at 2,105.99.
	   SYDNEY: Shares closed higher with improved investor sentiment on
commodity prices and stronger trading in Asian markets. The All
Ordinaries Index gained 19.70 points, closing at 2,773.90.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed higher on a stronger rupiah,
rebounding regional markets, and optimism over the next IMF
disbursement. The JSX Composite Index climbed 3.465 points, closing
at 467.339.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed sharply higher on foreign
investor buying and on hopes that Japan's economy will improve. The
benchmark Composite Index of 100 key stocks was up 13.21 points, or
3.1 percent, closing at 433.54.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mostly higher as regional sentiment was
boosted by a strong South Korean won and optimism that Japan will
hasten economic reforms. The Straits Times Industrial Index was up
13.57 points, or 1.3 percent, closing at 1,056.01.
	   BANGKOK: Thai shares closed higher after a rally on Wall Street
and other Asian markets encouraged local buying. The SET index
gained 3 percent, or 8.04 points, finishing at 273.75.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares ended mixed as regional uncertainties
outweighed Wall Street's overnight gains and a stable performance
by the peso. The index of 30 selected issues gained 9.19 points, or
0.5 percent, closing at 1,794.06.
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan shares ended higher as overnight gains on U.S.

Princess Stephanie of Monaco gives birth to baby girl

 &UR; Eds: RAISES mention of princess' divorce; UPDATES with further
details of divorce, other background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ Princess Stephanie of Monaco gave birth to a baby
girl on Wednesday, and named her Camille Marie Kelly, the palace
press office said.
	   The 33-year-old princess has not remarried since her divorce
less than two years ago, and the identity of the infant's father
was not made public.
	   Stephanie gave birth at 9.23 a.m. (0723 GMT) at the Princess
Grace Hospital, the press office said. Mother and child were doing
fine, it added. An official communique was not planned.
	   Stephanie already has two children, Louis, 5, and Pauline, 4,
from her marriage to her former bodyguard, Daniel Ducruet, whom she
divorced in October 1996, after 15 months of marriage. Both
children were born before the couple married.
	   Stephanie divorced Ducruet after Italian magazines printed a
batch of photos showing him in a poolside romp with the
then-reigning Miss Nude Belgium, Fili Houteman.
	   While Stephanie had custody of their children, Ducruet was given
visiting rights every other weekend and half of each vacation
period, her Paris lawyer, Thierry Lacoste, said at the time.
	   The tryst at a villa near Monte Carlo prompted Ducruet to take
legal action to stop further publication of the photos.
	   It had been an uphill battle for Stephanie to get her father to
allow her to marry Ducruet and allow him to join her at official
functions.
	   The couple met when Ducruet was assigned to protect Stephanie in
1988 during her short-lived career as a rock singer.
	   Stephanie is one of three children of Prince Rainier III and
former American film star Grace Kelly who was killed in a car crash
Sept. 14, 1982.

On eve of U.N. official's visit, unease builds again in East Timor

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian soldiers kill two
demonstrators during pro-independence protests in East Timor.
Fearing a surge in violence, thousands of people flee aboard buses,
boats and planes.
	   East Timor is grappling with another bout of the turmoil that
has tormented it since Indonesia sent in soldiers in 1975 and
declared it a 27th province.
	   Tension is escalating ahead of a scheduled visit to Indonesia
this week by the United Nations' special envoy for the former
Portuguese colony, Jamsheed Marker.
	   Hundreds of students shouted pro-independence slogans Wednesday
at a peaceful campus rally in Dili, the seaside capital of East
Timor. Trucks of police and soldiers patrolled nearby.
	   Marker has been urged to stay away from East Timor to avoid
triggering bigger anti-Indonesian protests that could turn violent,
but a U.N. spokesman in New York said Marker is expected to go
there.
	   He was scheduled to arrive in Jakarta Thursday, one day before
another sensitive date: the 22nd anniversary of Indonesia's
annexation of East Timor. Anticipating trouble in the streets, many
shop owners have left Dili.
	   Ironically, the visit comes as momentum accelerates for a
solution, albeit temporary, to the bitter conflict in East Timor.
Marker likely sees a unique opportunity to push for dialogue.
	   Authoritarian President Suharto took a hard line on the
territory of 800,000 people. In the late 1970s, tens of thousands
of East Timorese died in fighting and from famine as his troops
crushed most resistance.
	   However, a small band of separatist rebels still roams the hills
and anti-Indonesian sentiment is widespread. An average of 20
Indonesian soldiers are killed every year.
	   Since the embattled Suharto quit in May, his successor,
President B.J. Habibie, has eased up in keeping with a push for a
democratic overhaul of the nation of 200 million.
	   Habibie has pledged to withdraw troops from East Timor and allow
more freedom of movement for its citizens, and has offered a degree
of autonomy. Yet he rules out a vote on independence, the fervent
hope of many East Timorese.
	   During his weeklong trip, Marker is expected to debate the
autonomy proposal, which would likely grant cultural and
educational freedom to East Timorese. Indonesia would keep control
over foreign, economic and security affairs.
	   East Timor's Nobel peace laureate, Bishop Carlos Belo, has urged
Marker to postpone his trip because of the tension. Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has said a visit by Marker to East
Timor would not be wise.
	   The last time that Marker visited East Timor, in March 1997,
Indonesian soldiers shot and killed two pro-independence protesters
at a rally held to impress the U.N. official.
	   Last month, security forces killed another two activists in East
Timor as protesters lobbied three visiting European ambassadors.
	   Police said Wednesday they have arrested 20 people allegedly
involved in violent protests in June, and three have been charged
with destroying property at the governor's office in Dili and other
acts of vandalism.
	   Scared by the possibility of escalating protests and reprisals
from indigenous residents, tens of thousands of non-Timorese
Indonesian settlers have fled since late last month. There is often
ethnic and economic tension between the two groups.
	   Despite the unease, observers agree that the Indonesian military
brass is more eager than ever for a peaceful end to a grinding
conflict in which many soldiers have died.
	   ``They are very realistic,'' said Salim Said, an expert on the
military. ``They know for sure that we cannot go on like this. We
have to find a solution.''

Japanese industrial production falls 2 percent in May
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's industrial production fell 2 percent in May
from the previous month as companies continued to reduce output
because of high inventories, the government said Wednesday.
	   It was the fourth consecutive monthly decline in industrial
output and an 11.2 percent drop from the previous year, the
Ministry of Trade and Industry said.
	   The fall in production of general machinery was particularly
sharp _ 8.2 percent from the previous month and 14 percent from the
same month last year, the ministry said.
	   Transportation machinery fell 1.4 percent from the previous
month and 20.5 percent from a year earlier, the ministry said.

<TEXT>
	   HAKKARI, Turkey (AP) _ Kurdish guerrillas ambushed a military
unit near this southeastern city during the night, killing 10
troops and seven pro-government village guards, the Anatolia news
agency said Wednesday.
	   The attack near the village of Kamisli, followed unconfirmed
reports of a major military crackdown in Hakkari, bordering Iran
and Iraq.
	   The guerrillas from the Kurdistan Workers Party have been
fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast since 1984.
	   About 90,000 village guards, armed and paid by the government,
are helping the troops in the war which has claimed some 37,000
lives.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Senior Chinese and U.S. military officers ended
two days of discussions Wednesday on how to avoid accidental armed
conflict between the two navies.
	   The talks were the first of what are supposed to be annual
consultations on maritime safety. Chinese and U.S. Presidents Jiang
Zemin and Bill Clinton agreed to the discussions in October and
fixed the time for the first round during last month's Beijing
summit.
	   Rear Adm. Zhao Guojun, deputy chief of staff of the Chinese
navy, and Maj. Gen. Earl Hailston, planning and policy officer for
the U.S. Pacific Command, headed the talks and outlined rules and
practices of naval operations.
	   Hailston described the meetings as ``frank and open, friendly
and productive,'' said a U.S. Embassy spokesman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Zhao pledged to cooperate with the United States to bolster the
exchange, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The officers decided to set up a working group on navigational
safety that is supposed to meet twice before next year's
consultations, the U.S. Embassy spokesman said.
	   Washington proposed holding the consultations after China's
missile launches and war games around Taiwan in 1996. Washington
sent aircraft carriers near the island as a warning to Beijing, and
the two navies found themselves operating dangerously close to each
other.
	   Military-to-military ties have improved steadily through
high-level contacts and small-scale exchanges meant to build
confidence. The two sides have traded views on disaster relief
operations and China has agreed to send observers to U.S. naval and
air force exercises this year.

German government seeks anti-hooligan drive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's interior minister urged tougher
measures Wednesday against soccer hooligans, such as detaining them
on game days, impounding their cars and ordering them to report to
police when the local team plays away games.
	   ``I'm not saying we can get rid of all hooligans in three years,
but it wouldn't take long to have a lot fewer,'' Manfred Kanther
said.
	   Cracking down on soccer thugs has become a priority since German
hooligans beat a French policeman into a coma last month during a
World Cup match.
	   Police have files on 2,300 soccer hooligans, Kanther said. He
urged courts and German states, who control most police matters in
Germany's federal system, to consider taking steps to prevent
hooligans from traveling to soccer games abroad and even to league
games within the country.
	   Police said Tuesday they arrested two more Germans in the June
21 beating of the French policeman that followed a World Cup game
between Germany and Yugoslavia.
	   The two men, ages 23 and 33, were arrested based on witness
testimony and media photos of the rioting at Lens, France,
according to Hanover police. Two Germans previously were arrested
in France and one in Hamburg.
	   Policeman Daniel Nivel has been in a coma since hooligans beat
him with an iron bar. Doctors say he has permanent brain damage.
	   Germany and France ``did everything within our powers'' to try
to prevent violence during the World Cup, Kanther said. Throughout
the games, June 10-July 12, border police stopped 55 known
hooligans from entering France.
	   But one lesson from the World Cup was that border checks on
highways were only of limited use because of the huge volume of
traffic during the tournament, Kanther said.
	   And many of the hooligans are middle-class men with steady jobs
who no longer fit the typical image of the rabble-rouser, he said.
	   ``What unites them is seeking violence for fun,'' Kanther said.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ After initial uncertainty, most Asian stock
markets closed higher Wednesday, buoyed by optimism that Japan's
next government will put that nation's ailing economy back on
track. Tokyo stocks extended their gains for the third consecutive
day on hopes that the successor to Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, who resigned Monday, will be more aggressive on such
longstanding issues as a permanent tax cut. The Nikkei average of
225 selected issues rose 125.23 points, or 0.76 percent, closing at
16,614.14. It had gained 128.52 points Tuesday. The market hoped
for ``a less fiscally restrained post-Hashimoto administration,''
said Dhia Amir, a senior institutional sales trader at Nomura
Securities in Tokyo. In the currency market, the dollar was trading
at 140.66 yen in late Tokyo trading, down 0.70 yen from late
Tuesday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of 140.02 yen
overnight. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie said Wednesday
he is confident that the International Monetary Fund will restart
bailout payments to his crisis-ridden nation. Habibie said he was
hopeful that a meeting of IMF executives, scheduled in Washington
later Wednesday, would decide to disburse a dlrs 1 billion aid
installment as part of a dlrs 43 billion rescue plan. The president
made his comments while visiting an Islamic school east of Jakarta.
Indonesia's economy is suffering its worst crisis in 30 years. The
IMF and Indonesian officials agreed on a bailout program last year.
However, the plan stalled several times when the IMF complained
that then-President Suharto was not living up to promises to reform
the economy. (INDONESIA-IMF)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The hard-line parliament debated President Boris
Yeltsin's economic austerity plan Wednesday, and their verdict
could determine whether international lenders proceed promptly with
a huge bailout package for Russia. Russia is in urgent need of
cash, and it reached tentative agreement Monday for dlrs 17.1
billion in new loans to help stabilize financial markets that have
been in a tailspin for months. But the International Monetary Fund
and others lenders will be reluctant to hand over the money if
Russia does not deal with chronic financial problems, such as a
bloated state budget and a porous tax collection system.
Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, held a special session
Wednesday to consider more than 20 proposals from Yeltsin's
administration. But Communist lawmakers and other opponents have
been resisting spending cuts and tax increases. They say the
government should be spending more money, not less, to help
struggling Russian citizens and industries. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ With police poised to arrest their
leaders, some 45,000 employees of state-run firms and five banks
joined a nationwide strike Wednesday to protest layoffs. Organizers
said the new walkouts brought to about 100,000 the number of
workers participating in the strike begun Tuesday by metal workers
in auto, shipbuilding and other heavy industries. But the Labor
Ministry said fewer than 60,000 workers participated in the strike.
It said many union members disobeyed their leaders and did not take
part. About 50,000 unionized workers at Korea Telecom, the national
telephone company, refused to join the strike, saying negotiations
with management on wages and other issues were making progress.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A quarter century after the war ended, Vietnam
still haunts the national consciousness. Even today, memories stir
controversies out of proportion to the size of the communist-ruled
nation, one of the smallest and weakest economies of Asia.
President Bill Clinton's efforts to win a modest concession from
Congress _ one that would allow some economic aid to U.S.
businesses that invest in Vietnam _ is running into some stiff
opposition in Congress. As a first step toward establishing trade
ties with Vietnam, Clinton would allow loans from the Export-Import
Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to U.S.
companies that do business in Vietnam. That's a far cry from the
most-favored-nation trade status that the administration recently
suggested renewing for China _ and which Congress is expected to
debate later this month. But the congressional mechanisms for both
are the same. (VIETNAM-TRADE)

Thousands loot coffee plantations, shrimp farm in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police fired warning shots to stop a
crowd from raiding a shrimp farm, a news report said Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, thousands of villagers have stripped valuable coffee
beans from hundreds of trees in poorly guarded plantations, police
said.
	   Police have warned that crime is rising as inflation and mass
unemployment soar. Millions of poor Indonesians are suffering as
the worst economic crisis in 30 years grinds on.
	   The newspaper Kompas said police fired warning shots to disperse
as many as 2,000 villagers who took thousands of dollars worth of
shrimp Monday from a large fish pond in Tangerang, just west of
Jakarta.
	   A guard at the shrimp farm, identified by the single name of
Misi, said many looters ignored the shots. Some even taunted police
by dancing and making jokes.
	   In Banyuwangi district in East Java, mobs have taken beans off
plantation coffee trees, police said.
	   In May, thousands of shops and homes were looted and burned by
angry mobs in Jakarta and elsewhere. About 1,200 people died in the
violence, which helped force President Suharto to quit after 32
years in office.

Four people in court over foiled London plot bomb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three men and a woman appeared in court Wednesday
charged with plotting to bomb London in a failed campaign that has
been blamed on IRA dissidents opposed to Northern Ireland's peace
process.
	   Anthony Hyland, 25, whose address was not given; Darren
Mulholland, 19, of Dundalk in the Irish Republic; Elaine Moore, 21,
of Hampstead, northwest London, and Liam Grogan, 21 of Naas in the
republic, were charged with conspiracy to cause explosions.
Mulholland, Grogan and Moore were also charged with possessing
explosives.
	   All four were remanded in custody until July 23.
	   The group did not speak during the 15-minute hearing at Belmarsh
magistrates' court in southeast London, which was conducted amid
tight security. Their lawyers made no application for bail.
	   The four were among 10 people arrested in Ireland and Britain on
Friday in a joint operation by police and security services, who
said they had thwarted an imminent terrorist attack in London.
Police refused to identify the intended targets, but the British
media, quoting unnamed police sources, reported that the firebombs
were destined for London department stores.
	   All four people arrested in the Irish Republic were released
without charge on Sunday. But a police spokesman said files on a
woman and a man detained in Dublin and a man detained in Dundalk
would be sent to the prosecutor's department, which could charge
them. A man arrested in Wexford was allowed to go without any
further action.
	   Two people arrested in London have also since been released.
	   Ronnie Flanagan, Northern Ireland's police chief, has said Irish
Republican Army splinter groups opposed to the Northern Ireland
peace agreement signed in April had joined forces and were likely
to have been behind the foiled London bombings.
	   Flanagan said the dissident alliance included Continuity IRA,
the Irish National Liberation Army _ both anti-British rivals of
the IRA _ and associates of the so-called 32 County Sovereignty
Committee.

UN Security Council to take up Iraq nuclear issue last week in
</HEADLINE>
July &QL;

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council plans this
month to consider a report by the Vienna-based International Atomic
Energy Agency which could lead to a scaling back of nuclear
inspections in Iraq, U.N. sources said here Wednesday.
	   The head of the IAEA's Iraq inspection program, Garry Dillon,
will travel to New York for the council session, which is
tentatively set for July 29, the sources said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Scaling back on nuclear inspections in Iraq has been a goal of
the Russians, French and Chinese. Those three permanent council
members have been urging U.N. inspectors to wrap up the seven-year
program to determine whether Iraq has destroyed all long-range
missiles and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
	   Iraqi compliance with that demand is the main condition for the
council to lift crippling economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in
1990 after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, triggering the
Gulf War.
	   Last month, Russia, France and China urged the 15-member council
to certify that Iraq had dismantled its nuclear weapons research
program and to order the IAEA to shift from ``intrusive
inspections'' to an ongoing monitoring program of Iraqi facilities.
	   Their demand was based on a series of IAEA reports that said
that seven years of monitoring had produced no evidence that Iraq
was maintaining a clandestine nuclear weapons program. But the
agency stopped short of declaring Iraq in full compliance.
	   Despite acknowledging progress in the nuclear field, the United
States argued last month that Iraq had still failed to provide
answers to all IAEA questions on its nuclear program, which Baghdad
claims was dismantled shortly after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Among other things, the Iraqis have refused to provide a full
list of all secret contacts with foreign nuclear experts before
1991.
	   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, said
Iraq must also give more information on its weapons-grade material
and equipment used to make nuclear weapons.
	   U.S. and U.N. experts believe the Iraqis were within a year of
developing a nuclear bomb before the outbreak of the Gulf War.
	   Under a compromise last month, the Americans and Russians agreed
that the IAEA would submit a new report on the Iraqi nuclear
program by the end of this month ``for possible action at that
time.''
	   Otherwise, the issue will come up again after the next regular
IAEA report in October. The sources said the draft report to be
sent to the Security Council had been submitted to the agency's
director, Mohammed el-Baradei, for a final review.
	   But the sources said the draft was fundamentally no different
from the previous IAEA reports.
	   The IAEA is responsible only for inspections of Iraqi nuclear
facilities. The U.N. Special Commission, which is based in New
York, inspects Iraqi missile, biological and chemical weapons
programs.
	   Commission director Richard Butler has said much work needs to
be done before those weapons files can be closed.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Meeting behind closed doors and sliding screens,
Japanese ruling party members on Wednesday began sketching out
strategies for how to replace outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and win back their plunging public support. Hashimoto's
sudden decision Monday to resign over his Liberal Democratic
Party's disastrous performance in weekend elections has left party
elders with no obvious successor to fill the void, though several
possible contenders have emerged. On Wednesday, the party asked for
candidates to formally step forward, a move that increases the
pressure to settle on a party standard bearer. It is hoping this
will cool the wave of speculation that has dominated Japan's media.
The party was expected to schedule a vote of its lawmakers in both
houses of Parliament to formally select a new party head next
Tuesday. A vote in Parliament, likely before the end of the month,
then would be held to choose the prime minister. (JAPAN-POLITICS)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Declaring that American rumor mongers were out to
wreck warming Chinese-U.S. ties, China on Wednesday denied a Senate
leader's allegations that it used U.S. satellite technology to
boost military power. ``We have reiterated many times that the
Chinese side would not and could not acquire American military
technology in the course of supplying launching services for U.S.
satellites,'' said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang
Guoqiang. ``The American side is clear about this,'' Tang added in
a statement. Tang was responding to renewed assertions Tuesday by
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott that China used sensitive
technology from U.S. satellite exports to enhance its military
capability. (CHINA-US)
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An international organization is
returning to Yugoslavia for the first time in six years as part of
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in separatist Kosovo
province, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence. A
delegation from the 54-nation Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, was to begin discussions Wednesday
in Belgrade with government and opposition representatives.
Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE and other international
organizations in 1992 for allegedly fomenting ethnic conflict in
Croatia and Bosnia. Belgrade had refused to allow an OSCE mission
into the country until its membership was restored.

	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The parades are over,
violence has ebbed, crowds near the Drumcree Anglican church have
thinned and the men of the Orange Order settled in for what may be
a long siege to demand their right to march through a Catholic
neighborhood. ``Anybody who thinks that we are beaten and it's over
is totally misreading the situation. We are still going to be
here,'' said David Jones, spokesman for the Portadown Orange
Lodges. ``We are reviewing all the time where the protest action
should go.'' Barbed wire, trenches, police and soldiers on
Wednesday for the 11th day blocked the men of Northern Ireland's
largest Protestant fraternal order from marching through a hostile
Catholic neighborhood in Portadown. They are enforcing a decision
by the Parades Commission, created after trouble at Drumcree the
past two summers, to forbid the march (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's President Mohammad Khatami nominated
a moderate cleric as Interior Minister on Wednesday, setting the
stage for a confrontation with hard-liners in parliament who
impeached the previous minister for his reformist views. In a
letter to the Parliament, Khatami nominated Abdolvahed
Mousavi-Lari, a vice president and a key ally, to head the
ministry, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Mousavi-Lari,
44, was deputy minister of culture and Islamic guidance in
1982-1992 when Khatami was the minister. He left when Khatami was
forced to resign by hard-liners who objected to his giving the
press more freedom, liberalizing state-run television, and
permitting film-makers to pursue non-Islamic themes. (IRAN-INTERIOR

Philippines considers tax compromise with tycoon Lucio Tan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government may be
willing to drop tax evasion charges against tobacco and airline
tycoon Lucio Tan, one of the country's wealthiest men, if he pays
at least 15 billion pesos (dlrs 365 million) in unpaid taxes, an
official said Wednesday.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said Tan, who is listed by
Forbes magazine as one of the world's wealthiest men, has already
made an offer to the government to settle his tax arrears.
	   The government, which alleges that Tan owes some 26.5 billion
pesos (dlrs 645 million) in unpaid taxes, needs the money to help
fill a yawning budget deficit.
	   Tan, his Fortune Tobacco Corp. and 11 affiliated companies, and
65 of his business executives are facing multiple tax-evasion
charges brought in 1993.
	   Tan is also the majority shareholder in financially troubled
Philippine Airlines.
	   Cuevas declined to say the amount Tan offered, but said the
Department of Finance will not accept a settlement of less than 15
billion pesos (dlrs 365 million).
	   ``But kindly make it clear that it was not the government who
asked Mr. Tan to settle. It was Mr. Tan who offered to settle his
tax delinquency,'' Cuevas said.
	   ``Provided Mr. Tan is sincere, I think there is great
probability for this settlement to prosper,'' he said.
	   The government of newly elected President Joseph Estrada is
considering an amnesty for corporate and individual tax evaders.
Estrada is eager to collect unpaid taxes rather than raise taxes
further to fund his administration.
	   This week, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu warned that the
budget deficit could stretch to 70 billion pesos (dlrs 1.7 billion)
this year unless revenue is raised and expenditures are cut. Last
year, the Philippines posted a small budget surplus.
	   The tax authorities claim they have evidence that Tan's Fortune
Tobacco evaded billions of pesos in excise taxes between 1990 and
1992 through dummy marketing companies.
	   Tan denies the charges and claims the tax case was filed to
punish him for not supporting former President Fidel Ramos'
candidacy in 1992.

Russian parliament to decide fate of bailout package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new grafs 7-9 comments from finance minister,
lawmaker, debate in parliament sluggish. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The hard-line parliament debated President Boris
Yeltsin's economic austerity plan Wednesday, and their verdict
could determine whether international lenders proceed promptly with
a huge bailout package for Russia.
	   Russia is in urgent need of cash, and it reached tentative
agreement Monday for dlrs 17.1 billion in new loans to help
stabilize financial markets that have been in a tailspin for
months.
	   But the International Monetary Fund and others lenders will be
reluctant to hand over the money if Russia does not deal with
chronic financial problems, such as a bloated state budget and a
porous tax collection system.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, held a special session
Wednesday to consider more than 20 proposals from Yeltsin's
administration. But Communist lawmakers and other opponents have
been resisting spending cuts and tax increases. They say the
government should be spending more money, not less, to help
struggling Russian citizens and industries.
	   Parliament turned down several of the proposals earlier this
month, and Communist leaders have not given any sign that their
position has changed.
	   If parliament rejects Yeltsin's economic plan, then the IMF and
other lenders might withhold the loans.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov told parliament the the loans
were granted on the best possible terms. ``Softer credits than
those issued by the international financial organizations do not
exist,'' he said.
	   But lawmaker Alexander Shokhin, a member of a faction that
usually supports the government, said conditions set by the IMF
were harsh, ``possibly the harshest since 1992.''
	   The debate moved slowly, and by the lunch break, lawmakers had
adopted only one of the proposed measures, a tax bill for small
businesses.
	   The foreign loans are designed to calm the stock and bond
markets, stave off a devaluation of the Russian currency and
restore confidence among investors who have been fleeing the
country.
	   The stock market, which has lost more than half its value this
year, soared by about 25 percent on Monday and Tuesday in response
to the loan agreement. But the markets remain volatile and could
again crash if parliament opposes the government's proposals,
analysts say.
	   Yeltsin's plan includes calls to shift the tax burden from
producers, such as oil, gas and electricity companies, to
consumers, who currently face relatively light taxes.
	   But millions of Russians are battling to make ends meet and such
measures could prove extremely unpopular among ordinary Russians.
	   The proposed loans are to come from three sources: the IMF, the
World Bank and the Japanese government. When combined with
already-negotiated loans, the package totals dlrs 22.6 billion
spread over this year and next.
	   The IMF board meets in Washington on Monday to review the loan
agreement, and it could send dlrs 5 billion or more to Russia as
soon as next week.

Swastikas found at Jewish cemetery in Germany

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Teen-agers believed responsible for
spraying anti-Semitic graffiti at a Jewish cemetery and harassing a
visitor may face charges, police said Wednesday.
	   Cemetery visitors discovered the swastikas and anti-Semitic
slogans on the cemetery wall June 28 and notified police. An
American cemetery visitor also told police that a group of youths
harassed and spit at him.
	   Police said they had questioned four youths, ages 13 to 16,
believed to have been involved. Two made partial confessions, the
others denied involvement, a police spokesman said.
	   Prosecutors were considering whether to take the youths to
juvenile court. The suspects could face charges in connection with
property damage and using Nazi-era symbols, which are banned in
Germany.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat left Beijing
Tuesday armed with promises of financial backing and moral support
for the Middle East peace process.
	   Arafat said he held ``very important'' talks with Chinese
leaders and signed agreements for Chinese financial support for his
Palestinian government. He gave no details.
	   China had an important role to play in ``pushing forward the
peace process and to protect the peace process'' in the Middle
East, Arafat said in a news conference before ending his three-day
stay in China.
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan reaffirmed Chinese support
Wednesday, quoting Arafat an ancient saying: ``A just cause gains
abundant support,'' the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   On Tuesday, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji told Arafat Chinese
businesses would invest in a Palestinian state. Zhu also described
Israel's delay in withdrawing from the West Bank as ``wrong'' and
said negotiations should be held on the basis of land for peace.
	   Despite supporting the Palestinians, Beijing would never be a
moderator in the Middle East peace talks, Zhu said.
	   Arafat also met top officials including President Jiang Zemin,
who told him China supported the establishment of a Palestinian
state and would use its seat on the United Nations Security Council
to push the peace process forward.
	   Arafat accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
blocking the peace process and of not carrying out commitments made
in accords signed in 1993 and 1995 in Oslo.
	   ``The aim of this Israeli government is to abrogate the
agreements, annex Jerusalem'' and turn it into a Jewish city,
Arafat said, condemning recent Israeli moves to make Jewish suburbs
part of Jerusalem and thereby ensure a Jewish majority.
	   He said he raised plans with China for a summit of Arab nations
to discuss the peace process and support for the Palestinian
authority.
	   Arafat is seeking international support for his effort to
establish a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and East
Jerusalem.
	   Netanyahu's government has stalled on withdrawing troops. Israel
has refused a U.S. compromise that would link a pull-back from 13
percent of the West Bank with corresponding security gestures from
the Palestinians. Arafat supports that initiative.
	   China has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause
but over the past decade has developed good diplomatic and strong
economic ties with Israel.

Eurobank wins tender for sale of Bank of Crete
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Consolidated Eurofinance Holdings,
representing Eurobank in Greece, has emerged as the winner of a
tender for the sale of the Bank of Crete following a meeting to
evaluate bids, officials said Wednesday.
	   Consolidated Eurofinance Holdings, which belongs to the Latsis
shipping group, had submitted a surprisingly high offer of 93
billion drachmas (about dlrs 305 million) for the bank, by far
exceeding other bids.
	   The bid was approved during a meeting late Tuesday.
	   Ergobank had offered 48.1 billion drachmas (dlrs 157 million),
while Piraeus Bank had offered 52.4 billion drachmas (dlrs 174.6
million) for the bank.
	   The Bank of Crete is the second bank to be privatized this year
after the purchase of Macedonia Thrace Bank by Piraeus Bank. The
privatization is part of the Socialist government's efforts to meet
criteria for participation in the European Union's single currency
by 2001.

Ukraine to privatize 73 plants producing alcoholic drinks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine plans to privatize all 73
state-owned plants producing alcoholic drinks and expects the move
to bring 300 million hryvna (dlrs 150 million) to government
coffers, officials said.
	   About 10 to 15 percent of shares would be sold to plant workers
and the rest would be traded at open auctions, according to
President Leonid Kuchma's decree, reported by his aide Pavlo
Haidutsky.
	   The state would not retain any shares, Ukrainian media quoted
Haidutsky as saying Wednesday.
	   ``After workers' collectives purchase part of the shares, the
rest would be sold openly. We don't exclude the participation of
foreign investors,'' he said.
	   The privatization process would take from six months to a year,
Haidutsky added, according to the daily Kievskiye Vedomosti. The
official did not say, however, when this process would start.
	   Ukraine has 186 plants and companies producing alcoholic drinks,
of which 73 remain in state hands.
	   Privatization in Ukraine has been moving more slowly than
expected in 1998 due to the recent illness of the privatization
chief and numerous bureaucratic obstacles.
	   Privatization revenues so far this year have amounted to only
270 million hryvna (dlrs 135 million), well short of the 1998
government target of 1.04 billion hryvna (dlrs 500 million).

British unemployment falls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The number of unemployed people in Britain fell to
6.3 percent from 6.4 percent, but more people are seeking jobless
benefits, the government said Wednesday.
	   The Office of National Statistics said the average number of
people unemployed from March to May was 1,807,000, compared with an
average of 1,835,000 in the February-April period.
	   But the number of people seeking unemployment benefits _
Britain's old method for calculating joblessness _ showed a slight
increase. The number of people filing jobless claims rose by 700 in
May, for a total of 1,367,600, the statisticians said.
	   Meanwhile, British wages are climbing, stirring more concerns
about inflation.
	   Workers saw their pay increase by an annual rate of 5.3 percent
in May, compared with 5.4 percent in April.
	   The numbers came out one day after Britain's Treasury chief,
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, announced he would spend
billions more on social programs, mainly education and health.
	   Opposition politicians were quick to use Wednesday's numbers to
take more shots at the Labor government of Prime Minister Tony
Blair.
	   ``The average earnings figures suggest interest rates may not
have reached their peak,'' said lawmaker Damian Green, who speaks
for the Conservatives on employment issues. ``And the fact that 700
more people have gone from work to welfare is a sign that the
government's economic mismanagement is damaging the jobs market.''

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Police probing ETA's fundraising activities
sealed off the offices of a newspaper linked to the armed Basque
separatist group and arrested 11 people in a series of pre-dawn
raids on Wednesday.
	   The 11 suspects were detained at their homes in several Basque
towns, including Bilbao and Hernani, and in Pamplona in the
neighboring Navarra region, an Interior Ministry official in Madrid
said.
	   They are current or former board members of Orain S.A., the
company which publishes the Basque daily newspaper Egin and manages
the radio station Egin Irratia.
	   Police searched Egin's main headquarters in Hernani, disabled
the printing press and sealed off the building, Orain's personnel
director Tomas Arrizabalaga told reporters in Hernani, the
state-run news agency EFE reported.
	   Egin's offices in three other towns were also sealed off, news
reports said. Employees gathered outside the offices to protest the
police action.
	   Waving a copy of Egin, Arrizabalaga said: ``This is a historic
Egin because it will probably be some time before the paper is
published again.'' He said police seized reams of documents and two
computers from the daily's executive offices in Hernani.
	   The Interior Ministry would not confirm reports that
investigating magristrate Baltasar Garzon, who ordered the raids,
planned to issue a formal order shutting down Egin.
	   Egin regularly publishes statements by ETA, including its claims
of responsibility for attacks. Last December Spain's National Court
found two Egin reporters guilty of weapons possession and
membership of ETA and sentenced them to 39 years each.
	   None of the 11 detained Wednesday were journalists, the ministry
said.
	   After the detentions were carried out police searched the
offices of the daily and the radio station in Hernani and Bilbao.
	   The detainees include Pablo Gorostiaga, a senior member of Herri
Batasuna, a political party closely linked to ETA, Interior
Ministry officials said. Last year, 23 members of Herri Batasuna's
executive board were jailed on conviction of collaboration with a
terrorist group.
	   Officials said the latest raids were a follow-up to a May 28
police operation in which 11 people were arrested on suspicion of
aiding ETA's fundraising efforts. One was later released, officials
said.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since it began its
campaign in 1968.

39 people seek mayor's post in Odessa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A total of 39 people are seeking the
mayor's job in Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odessa, where March
elections were canceled following a turbulent campaign.
	   The city's electoral commission has already registered 28
candidates, the Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Among those registered is former Odessa regional administration
chief Ruslan Bodelan, widely seen as the favorite after the
electoral commission refused to register his leading rival,
ex-mayor Eduard Hurvits.
	   The results of the March mayoral election were invalidated amid
accusations of irregularities. Bodelan, an ally of President Leonid
Kuchma, lost to Hurvits in that poll.
	   The election campaign was accompanied by several outbreaks of
violence, and the two rivals accused each other of having links to
organized crime.
	   After the Supreme Court invalidated the results, Kuchma
dismissed Hurvits and Bodelan, and sent a personal representative
to head the Odessa city government until the new election is held
Aug. 23.
	   Hurvits has appealed the electoral commission's refusal to
register him, but the city court has not ruled on his case so far.
	   Odessa is one of Ukraine's major business centers and the site
of a key oil export terminal now under construction.

Kenyan teachers goes on strike

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenyan teachers walked off the job
Wednesday, angered by the government's failure to pay them raises
they were promised last year when they struck just before general
elections.
	   President Daniel arap Moi's government agreed to 200 percent
increases over five years but says now it has no money and has
drawn up legislation that would permit them to renegotiate the
deal.
	   ``If peace is wanted in the institutions of learning we must
know what is going on,'' Kenya National Union of Teachers Secretary
General Ambrose Adongo told 1,000 teachers who sang and danced
outside parliament.
	   ``We are not going to work until the bill is withdrawn,'' said
another KNUT official, Kamau Mureu.
	   There are some 260,000 teachers for 1 million students in
primary and secondary schools in Kenya. After a month-long strike
late last year, they managed to obtain increases varying from 100
to 200 percent over five years. Moi's government was worried about
the chances of candidates of the ruling Kenya African National
Union in December general elections.
	   Moi won re-election, and KANU obtained a slim majority in
parliament.
	   Education Minister Kalonzo Musyoka said if the raises agreed on
last year were put into effect, 80 percent of his ministry's
1998-99 budget of 44 billion shillings (dlrs 733 million) would go
to pay salaries.
	   The government says it does not have money to pay for the raises
and is trying to convince the teachers to renegotiate.
	   On Tuesday, Moi announced that he has cut his own salary by 50
percent and those of his two dozen ministers by 30 percent because
of economic difficulties facing the country.
	   The independent Daily Nation said Wednesday Moi's base monthly
salary was 40,733 shillings (dlrs 679). Moi's office said the cut
would not affect allowances, and by law, all the President's
business activites _ as well as his salary _ are exempt from
taxation.
	   ``50 Percent, A Shallow Trick'' read a placard carried by one
teacher. ``Money _ Retrench Moi,'' read another one, meaning that
if the government needed funds, it could lay off the president.
	   The teachers said the government should also sell the a costly
presidential jet plane to pay them their ``peanuts.''
	   ``If the government does not have money, why did they agree to
increase our salaries'' said Rachel Nyachiera. ``We suffered when
the economy was good, and now they want us to suffer more when the
economy is bad,''
	   KNUT official Francis Ng'ang'a said the government's proposed
legislation would make it illegal for teachers to strike.
	   Opposition legislators and church and union leaders have also
criticized the bill.
	   The daily East African Standard, often linked to the ruling
party, suggested in an editorial that the government could also cut
costs by reducing the number of ministers and cars made available
to ministers and their wives.

Italian crack down on Italian-Albanian organized crime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police launched a crack down Wednesday on Italian
and Albanian mobsters accused of smuggling prostitutes and other
illegal immigrants into Italy.
	   Police in Venice said they issued 13 arrest warrants on charges
of criminal association and trafficking in immigrants.
	   It was not immediately known how many people were actually
picked up and the number of Albanians involved. One of the suspects
was an Italian lawyer.
	   Italian organized crime has long had links with the Balkan
countries across the Adriatic. Investigators say that Albanian
gangs took advantage of the chaos at home last year to expand their
operations in Italy.

More workers join nationwide strike in South Korea

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ With police poised to arrest their
leaders, some 55,000 employees of telephone and other state-run
companies and five banks joined a nationwide strike Wednesday to
protest layoffs, labor leaders said.
	   Organizers said the new walkouts brought to about 110,000 the
number of workers participating in the strike begun Tuesday by
metal workers in auto, shipbuilding and other heavy industries.
	   But the Labor Ministry said fewer than 60,000 workers had joined
the strike. It said many union members disobeyed their leaders and
did not take part.
	   ``We oppose layoffs! We demand job security!'' 10,000 striking
workers and sympathizing college students chanted in a rally in
front of downtown Seoul's Myongdong Roman Catholic Church, a
traditional haven for dissidents, where key labor leaders were
taking refugee.
	   Earlier Wednesday, armed with court-issued warrants, police said
they were seeking to arrest about four dozen union leaders on
charges of organizing illegal strikes. They included Dan Byong-ho,
head of the Korean Federation of Metal Workers' Unions.
	   Thousands of police in riot gear stood guard but did not
intervene as the protesters marched along the sidewalks to the
church.
	   The government said the strike would not hurt manufacturing
industries, most of which already have large inventories of unsold
goods.
	   About one-fifth of 50,000 unionized workers at Korea Telecom
walked off their jobs. Union leaders had said earlier there would
be no strike because negotiations on wages and other issues were
making progress.
	   The partial strike did not disrupt operation of the national
carrier, which handles more than 90 percent of all domestic
telephone traffic.
	   Other state-run companies also reported normal operations.
	   President Kim Dae-jung's government promised stern punishment
for illegal strikes, saying many of the striking unions failed to
take legally required steps such as seeking government mediation of
their disputes with management.
	   ``If the government tries to suppress our strikes with police
force, we will respond with an expanded strike,'' said Kim
Hyong-man, a spokesman for the militant Confederation of Korea
Trade Unions.
	   The government said the strikes would scare off foreign
investment, essential to revive the nation's ailing economy.
	   ``Without restructuring of the public sector, there will no
reform,'' said Park Ji-won, a spokesman for President Kim.
	   ``The government repeatedly promised to do its best to minimize
job losses. The labor unions should come and talk to a tripartite
committee, not go for strikes,'' Park said.
	   The nation's two major union umbrella groups walked out of
negotiations with industry and government officials last week,
saying they would not return unless the government took steps to
stop increasing layoffs.
	   Restructuring South Korea's inefficient industries is a key
condition set by the International Monetary Fund, which bailed out
the country's economy late last year.
	   Since then, the number of jobless people has doubled to nearly
1.5 million and will likely top 2 million by the end of the year.
	   All of the strikers except 26,000 workers from the nation's
leading auto company, Hyundai Motors Co., were scheduled to return
to work Friday. The Hyundai strike was indefinite.

Indian consumer products giant absolved of insider trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A consumer products giant owned in part by
Unilever knew only what everyone else knew when it bought stock in
a deal Indian securities watchdogs had said constituted insider
trading, an appellate body said.
	   Shares of Hindustan Lever Ltd. were trading at 1,630 rupees
(dlrs 40) Wednesday, up 1.7 percent, from Tuesday's close following
the announcement late Tuesday by the finance ministry's Appellate
Authority. Indian stocks in general opened higher Wednesday as
traders welcomed the Hindustan decision.
	   The ruling means Hindustan Lever won't have to pay the 30.4
million rupees (dlrs 7 million) in compensation the Securities and
Exchange Board had ordered in March. It was the first time the
watchdog had found a company guilty of insider trading.
	   The securities board took action after Hindustan Lever bought
800,000 shares in tea and coffee company Brooke Bond Lipton India
on March 25, 1996. On April 19, Hindustan Lever announced it would
merge Brooke Bond into the parent company, and the price of Brooke
Bond shares shot up.
	   While Hindustan Lever had ``specific knowledge of the impending
merger'' when it bought the shares from mutual fund manager Unit
Trust of India, UTI didn't and was at a disadvantage, the
securities board contended. Hindustan Lever was ordered to pay
compensation to UTI.
	   Hindustan Lever appealed. The Appellate Authority said in its
ruling that the possibility of the merger had been widely reported
in the national media.
	   Hindustan Lever is one of India's biggest companies. It makes a
variety of soaps, shampoos and detergents, and is a
51-percent-owned unit of Anglo-Dutch consumer products company
Unilever.

Report: Nigerian junta to annul legislative elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's military government plans to
annul legislative elections held during the flawed transition
program of the country's late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, a
newspaper report said Wednesday.
	   Legislators have been told to prepare for a new round of
elections, the Lagos Press reported.
	   Only a tiny fraction of registered voters turned out in April
for legislative elections that had been billed as the first step
toward ending the country's military rule. Opposition leaders had
denounced the vote as rigged and called for a boycott, and fears of
violence kept others away.
	   But the winners of the those elections are rallying their
forces.
	   The legislators have formed a pressure group to fight to keep
their seats. They held a meeting Tuesday in Abuja, Nigeria's
capital, to discuss their options.
	   ``We all may have to forget our election,'' said the group's
leader, retired general and former foreign minister Joe Garba. He
has been hired to lobby the country's new military leader, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar, to hold to the election results.
	   Forgetting the elections, though, is what the legislators are
afraid of.
	   ``The annulment and cancellation of the elections will plunge
the nation into another political upheaval,'' they said in a
statement after the Abuja meeting. ``Any consultation on the
political future of the country without the contributions of the
legitimately elected representatives of the people will remain an
incomplete and unfair exercise.''
	   Opponents of Abacha's repressive military regime had urged
voters to stay away for polling stations to show disapproval of his
presidential nomination by all five political parties. They accused
Abacha of manipulating both the presidential nomination process and
the legislative elections in the military's favor.
	   Candidates for the 109 senatorial and 360 house seats came from
the five political parties sanctioned by the Abacha regime.
	   Abacha, who died suddenly in early June, was replaced by
Abubakar. He has vowed to continue with the transition plan, but
has vowed to bring true civilian rule to Nigeria.
	   Abubakar is expected to announce his plans on the transition
plan sometime this week.

Rights group hails Indonesian military's arrest of alleged
</HEADLINE>
kidnappers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A prominent human rights group on
Wednesday welcomed the arrest of troops accused of kidnapping
pro-democracy activists, but it also urged the military to
investigate whether any senior officers were involved.
	   The Indonesian Armed Forces, known as ABRI, announced Tuesday
that they had detained seven soldiers of Indonesia's special
forces, Kopassus, in connection with the abductions committed
before longtime President Suharto resigned in May.
	   Five are to face charges and possible courts-martial. Another
two remain suspects and have been detained for interrogation, said
Maj. Gen. Syamsu Djalal, chief of Indonesia's military police.
	   ``The disclosure constitutes a step forward by ABRI,'' said
Hendardi, chairman of the Indonesian Legal Aid Association.
	   According to the military, the seven had been ordered to
investigate the activities of several anti-government protesters,
but went beyond this and allegedly took the activists captive.
	   At the time, Kopassus was under the command of Lt. Gen. Prabowo
Subianto, a son-in-law of Suharto. Prabowo has since been
transferred to head a military college.
	   Hendardi said a thorough investigation should be carried out of
any role played by high-ranking military officers.
	   Some activists, who are now free, have testified to Indonesia's
National Human Rights Commission that they were abducted by masked
men, tortured and questioned about their political activities.
	   Other human rights groups say as many as 24 activists were
abducted and that at least nine remain missing.
	   Djalal described the case as ``a bitter pill for ABRI. Even so,
it has to be swallowed.''
	   Meanwhile, the daily Suara Pembaruan reported Wednesday that
Andi Arief, one of the abducted activists, was released Tuesday
night by police.

Swastikas found at Jewish cemetery in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Four teen-agers suspected of writing
anti-Semitic graffiti on the walls of a Jewish cemetery and
harassing a visitor may be charged, police said Wednesday.
	   Cemetery visitors discovered the swastikas and anti-Semitic
slogans on the cemetery wall on June 28 and notified police. An
American visitor to the cemetery also told police that a group of
youths harassed and spat at him.
	   Police said they had questioned four youths, aged 13 to 16,
believed to have been involved. Two made partial confessions, the
others denied involvement, a police spokesman said.
	   Prosecutors were considering whether to take the youths to
juvenile court. The suspects could face charges in connection with
property damage and using Nazi-era symbols, which are banned in
Germany.

New parliament starts first session
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The new Czech parliament was to
elect its leaders and accept the resignation of the previous
government during its first session, which started Wednesday.
	   Legislators of the 200-seat lower house were elected in voting
last month, held two years early following the collapse of the
previous government, led by Vaclav Klaus. A caretaker government,
appointed by President Vaclav Havel ran the country in the interim.
	   The June ballot was a victory for opposition leader Milos Zeman
and his Social Democrats, who garnered a total of 74 seats. Klaus
and his Civic Democratic Party finished second with 63 seats.
	   Zeman's attempts to form a majority coalition with two small
parties, the centrist Christian Democrats and the center-right
Freedom Union failed and he opted for a one-party minority
government with tacit support from Klaus.
	   Although bitter rivals during the campaign the two men now share
power, with Zeman expected to be Premier and Klaus parliament
speaker.
	   Klaus' election as well as the resignation of Josef Tosovsky's
caretaker government are expected Friday, CTK news agency said.
	   Zeman's new Cabinet should be appointed by Havel before July 23,
when the president is scheduled to undergo abdominal surgery.
	   The operation is to restore Havel's digestive tract after a
ruptured colon in February forced the president out of political
action for several months.

Khatami nominates moderate as new interior minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's President Mohammad Khatami nominated
a moderate cleric as Interior Minister on Wednesday, setting the
stage for a confrontation with hard-liners in parliament who
impeached the previous minister for his reformist views.
	   In a letter to the Parliament, Khatami nominated Abdolvahed
Mousavi-Lari, a vice president and a key ally, to head the
ministry, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Mousavi-Lari, 44, was deputy minister of culture and Islamic
guidance in 1982-1992 when Khatami was the minister.
	   He left when Khatami was forced to resign by hard-liners who
objected to his giving the press more freedom, liberalizing
state-run television, and permitting film-makers to pursue
non-Islamic themes.
	   The speaker of parliament, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, a hard-liner,
said that Mousavi-Lari's nomination would be debated on July 22.
	   To be appointed, Mousavi-Lari will need a majority of votes in
the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament.
	   Although most of Majlis members are hard-liners, it is thought
they could still approve Mousavi-Lari's appointment in deference to
Khatami's conspicuous popularity.
	   The president, who beat Nateq-Nouri by a landslide in last
year's elections, has won wide support for his moves to ease social
restrictions, encourage political freedom, and end nearly 20 years
of hostility with the United States.
	   But such moves have also stirred the hard-liners to attack the
Khatami camp. They have brought to trial on graft charges the mayor
of Tehran, who ran Khatami's election campaign, and they impeached
Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri last month on grounds of his
allowing political demonstrations and relaxing the social dress
code in this Islamic state.
	   It is thought that by impeaching Nouri, the hard-line
legislators had hoped to pressure Khatami into appointing one of
their own to the Interior Ministry. The radicals already control
the armed forces, the Intelligence Ministry, and the state-run
radio and television.
	   Khatami's nomination of Mousavi-Lari underscores his
determination to keep the Interior Ministry on the reformist track.
	   ``Mr. Khatami needs an interior minister to push forward his
campaign slogans calling for political progress,'' said a
pro-Khatami legislator, Mohammad Reza Khabbazz.
	   ``His choice of Mr. Mousavi-Lari shows that he is not prepared
to withdraw from his campaign slogans,'' he said.

Five Thai industries exempted from foreign worker ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Responding to employers' complaints
about a shortage of low-price labor, Thailand's government agreed
Wednesday to exempt 95,000 foreign workers for one year from a ban
on employing illegal immigrants.
	   Five sectors _ rice milling, sugar cane plantations, rubber
plantations, pig farms and maritime transportation _ will be
covered by the exemption, which was approved by a special
government subcommittee working on the issue. The fishing industry
had already won an exemption from the ban.
	   The government decided to crack down on foreign workers last
year as an economic crisis made it evident there would be layoffs
in almost every business sector. Unemployment is forecast to double
to 2 million this year, about 6 percent of the work force.
	   Thai rice mill owners were especially insistent that the
government exempt them, contending that neither raising salaries
nor easing job conditions would attract enough Thais to replace
thousands of foreigners working at the grueling job of hauling rice
sacks.
	   Earlier this month, some 400 rice mills suspended operations to
protest the ban.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, chairman of the
subcommittee, said its decision would be submitted for Cabinet
approval next Tuesday.
	   According to data complied by the Department of Employment,
there are 11,062 foreign laborers in the rice milling industry,
22,725 in sugar plantations, 38,210 in rubber plantations, 3,160 in
pig farming and 20,000 in maritime transport.
	   The exemptions are limited to certain provinces of the country,
Bhichai said.
	   According to Labor Ministry figures, 44 business sectors claim
to need foreign workers. The exemption was enacted for only five
that were found to have an immediate need.
	   Som Supanakorn, director-general of the Department of
Employment, said all foreign workers must pass a medical check and
be registered as temporary legal workers with the government.
	   Labor Minister Trairong Suwankiri said that during the year's
exemption period, he will promote improvements in the working
conditions that made Thais reluctant to take on the onerous jobs.
	   Bhichai said the government would otherwise continue its policy
of trying to expel 300,000 foreign workers by the end of the year.
From May 1, when the policy was implemented, to July 10, around
240,000 illegal foreign workers were sent back to their countries.

Government announces tax incentives for computer industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's finance minister announced tax
relief for the computer industry Wednesday, fine tuning a budget
expected to be voted on in two days.
	   The first budget by the Hindu nationalists-led government is
likely to be approved by parliament in the vote scheduled Friday.
	   On Wednesday, Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha announced
abolition of the gift tax on computers and exempted all software
being imported by the information technology industry from customs
duty.
	   ``I hope the technology will reach the masses in rural areas and
small towns and will give the country a significant place in the
emerging knowledge-driven global economy,'' the minister said.
	   Sinha presented the 1998-99 budget in parliament last month,
proposing more spending on infrastructure, defense and nuclear
energy.
	   He also offered reassurance to foreign businesses who are
worried about the right-wing government's commitment to
``swadeshi,'' which the Bharatiya Janata Party, the main party in
the governing coalition, defined as ``economic nationalism.''
	   Sinha promised a ``hassle-free procedure'' for foreign investors
who have complained that bureaucratic red tape presents a huge
obstacle to doing business in India.
	   The budget, Sinha said, is designed to revive India's economic
growth. Growth faltered to 5 percent in the fiscal year 1997-98,
the lowest rate in the last five years.

Kelly Family singing group buys German castle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUEHL, Germany (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II, Richard Nixon and
Leonid Brezhnev have all spent the night at the Gymnich castle. Now
add the Kelly Family to the list.
	   A court approved the singing family's 13.1 million mark (dlrs
7.3 million) offer for the castle and grounds, now a hotel but once
used as an official guest house for the federal government.
	   Family patriarch Daniel Kelly, who appeared in court with his
oldest daughter Kathy, said he was ``very happy'' about the
purchase, but didn't know exactly when they'd move in.
	   The family lived for years on a houseboat in Cologne's harbor
and already has a 30-room castle in their home country of Ireland.
	   The Gymnich castle, finished in the mid-17th century, is
surrounded by a 200,000 square meter (50 acre) English-style park
and includes a chapel and a smaller castle built in the 18th
century.
	   The Kelly Family has released 17 albums and is one of Germany's
biggest live acts, having performed their mixture of bubblegum pop
and folk before more than 10 million mostly teen-aged fans in the
past four years.

New Kuala Lumpur airport's latest problem: rat sightings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ After earlier problems with
computer failures, delays and lost luggage, Kuala Lumpur's new
airport now is receiving complaints about rats in its shops, a
newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The Malay Mail reported two sightings.
	   Businesswoman M.K. Lai told the paper she was having tea at the
hotel's coffee house Monday with a friend from Britain when ``a
brownish gray rat the size of a hamster scurried across the
floor.''
	   ``This gives visitors a very bad impression of Malaysia,'' said
Lai.
	   A Pakistani, Ahmad Khalid, who had been working in Malaysia for
the last five months, said he and a friend were in a candy shop at
the airport when a rat ran over his foot.
	   ``We were both horrified and lost our appetite. We decided not
to buy the sweets,'' the paper quoted him as saying.
	   He said rats probably were attracted to the airport from nearby
plantations because a lack of bins meant rubbish was being thrown
outside the compound, the paper added.
	   An airport spokeswoman said this was the first time visitors had
mentioned rats at the airport, which opened last month, the paper
reported.
	   ``We will bring this problem to the attention of the management
and try to get rid of the rodents,'' she added.

Former NFL receiver Wes Chandler gets Berlin coaching job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Wes Chandler, one of the NFL's all-time leading
receivers, was appointed Wednesday as head coach of NFL Europe's
new Berlin franchise.
	   Chandler, who played for the New Orleans Saints and San Diego
Chargers, retired in 1988 with career totals of 599 receptions for
8,966 yards and 56 touchdowns.
	   He worked as an assistant coach with the Orlando Thunder and
Rhein Fire and was offensive coordinator last year of the Frankfurt
Galaxy.
	   ``It would be terrific to win the World Bowl for Berlin,'' the
41-year-old Chandler said. ``It can't come quickly enough for me.''
	   The Berlin team, which has not yet been given a name, was added
to the league for the 1998 season after the England Monarchs
folded.
	   Berlin joins two other German teams, the Fire and Galaxy, plus
franchises in Amsterdam, Barcelona and Scotland.

Hong Kong gets pledge of mainland help to clear cargo problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 8-10 with legislative meeting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In a sign of the mainland's growing importance
to Hong Kong, a top official worked out an agreement with Chinese
officials Wednesday to help clear a cargo backlog from Hong Kong's
new airport.
	   China offered Tuesday to open up Huangtian airport in Shenzhen,
just across the boundary from Hong Kong, to cargo flights and to
streamline customs procedures.
	   It was an indication of the ties between Hong Kong and the
adjacent mainland region that both sides say they want to foster
since Hong Kong was handed back to China last year. And it was a
rare case of the prosperous territory seeking help from the
mainland to solve its problems.
	   Stephen Ip, Hong Kong's secretary for economic services,
traveled to Shenzhen to meet with civil aviation and customs
officials from Beijing as well as Chen Zuo'er, China's deputy
director of Hong Kong and Macau affairs.
	   ``The central government will cooperate fully with the Hong Kong
government until the problems are solved,'' Chen told Hong Kong's
commercial radio.
	   Ip told official Hong Kong radio after the meeting that the two
sides agreed on a contingency plan under which it would take only
about four-five hours for air cargo arriving at Huangtian to reach
Hong Kong.
	   The first priority still was for Hong Kong's main cargo handler
to straighten out its problems locally, Ip said.
	   Ip later told Hong Kong's legislature that cargo handler Hong
Kong Air Cargo Terminals would decide later in the day whether the
ban on cargo shipments could be lifted Sunday as announced earlier.
	   Legislators were skeptical. ``The public has lost all confidence
in these announcements,'' said Selina Chow of the business-oriented
Liberal Party.
	   Ip said the new airport had been handling about 1,700 tons of
cargo a day, about a third of normal. Because of safety issues, the
government would not consider reopening the old Kai Tak airport, he
said.
	   The newspaper Hong Kong Standard quoted Xie Feng, spokesman for
Huangtian airport, as saying it could handle 20-30 cargo flights
per day for Hong Kong, or about 2,000-3,000 tons of cargo.
	   Some cargo also has been shipped to Macau, the Portuguese
territory about 70 kilometers (45 miles) from Hong Kong along the
Chinese coast.
	   Chinese officials said they also were willing to accept planes
from Taiwan at Huangtian airport. Taiwan and China have no direct
transportation links because of their longstanding political
dispute, but Taiwan has billions of dollars worth of investments in
the mainland. Much trade goes through Hong Kong.
	   Officials of Taiwan's China Airlines said the offer could be a
trial balloon or a propaganda ploy, and carriers couldn't take
advantage of it unless the Taiwan government lifted its ban on
direct flights to the mainland.
	   Airport officials said Wednesday that passenger services were
continuing to improve at the new Chek Lap Kok airport, built by
flattening small outlying islands about 30 kilometers (22 miles)
from central Hong Kong.
	   And Hong Kong's public transportation corporation said that 12
people arrested for allegedly using substandard construction
practices and materials were not working on stations for the
airport railroad, but sites adjacent to them.
	   In announcing the arrests Tuesday, the Independent Commission
Against Corruption had said they were arrested for substandard
foundation work connected to the railroad.
	   Public transportation officials said the airport route was
safe.

New Philippine president bans sirens, police escorts for officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ New Philippine President Joseph
Estrada ordered the cancellation Wednesday of police escorts for
wealthy businessmen and most government officials, saying they are
inappropriate symbols of power in a democratic country.
	   Estrada, who has devoted his presidency to reducing the gap
between the rich and the poor, also barred the use of sirens and
flashing lights, and ordered police to stop any vehicles misusing
them.
	   ``These practices are repugnant to a democratic society, whose
citizens are equal before the law,'' Estrada said in a memorandum
to government officials. ``They must be stopped.''
	   The only exceptions from the ban will be the president, vice
president, Senate president, House speaker and chief justice of the
Supreme Court, and emergency vehicles such as police cars,
ambulances and fire trucks, he said.
	   Many wealthy businessmen and government officials, including
members of Congress, travel through Manila's notorious traffic with
motorcycle escorts and flashing red lights.
	   The police escorts are also protection against kidnappings and
attacks. Two senior government officials have been killed by
unidentified gunmen while riding in their cars in the past 20 days.

Senate seems set to support ban on advertising beer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A bill that would relax rules on beer
advertising in Poland appears set for defeat in the Senate when it
comes up for a vote this week.
	   The lower chamber voted July 2 to lift the 5-year-old
prohibition on beer ads, which was intended to discourage drinking.
Poland has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption in
Europe.
	   But the ban proved hard to enforce.
	   Some breweries were using bottles of non-alcoholic beer in their
ads, although the labels were almost identical to the regular
brews. Many of the advertised non-alcoholic beers weren't even
available in stores and sales were minimal.
	   Instead of lifting the ban, though, a group of right-wing
senators has proposed extending it to cover all beer, including
alcohol-free.
	   Senate committees for health and family voted Tuesday in favor
of continuing the ban, and the full Senate is set to vote Thursday
or Friday.
	   Many senators argue that beer ads encourage young people to
drink more.
	   Studies show 60 percent of customers in pubs are below 19 years
of age.

Legislators split on whether to push for faster democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In a setback to their attempt to pressure the
government for faster democratic reforms, Hong Kong's Democrats ran
into opposition Wednesday from legislators of other major political
parties.
	   The Democrats, Hong Kong's largest party, and their allies said
the larger-than-expected voter turnout in May elections showed that
people were ready to elect the entire legislature and the chief
executive by direct, popular vote.
	   But they ran into opposition from lawmakers who said that
replacing the current go-slow approach with rapid change could slow
down the territory's recovery from recession.
	   Outside the legislature, a small group of protesters waved
placards saying, ``Direct Elections'' and ``To hell with money
politics.''
	   Legislators planned to vote later Wednesday on the Democrats'
motion calling for direct elections of the legislature in the year
2000 and the chief executive in 2002. The motion likely faced
defeat.
	   The issue is one of the most pressing and sensitive facing the
Hong Kong government after the return to Chinese rule last year.
Election methods before the year 2007 have been set in the
post-handover constitution. Any constitutional changes must be
approved by Beijing and therefore would be difficult.
	   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa was chosen by a 400-member
committee handpicked by Beijing. Only a third of the legislature
was elected by popular vote. Half of the legislators are
representatives of professions, and 10 were elected by an
800-member electoral college.
	   The call for more democracy has intensified as ratings for Tung
and other government officials dropped due to a series of problems,
including the troubled opening of Hong Kong's new airport and the
economic downturn.
	   Many critics blame a colonial government system in which
officials, including the senior civil servants and a group of elite
advisers, have ultimate policymaking power, but do not need to
answer to the public.
	   ``Only when there's democracy can the public effectively monitor
the government,'' said Democrat Andrew Cheng, who sponsored the
motion. ``Elected officials have a public mandate to monitor the
government, and the public has the right not to vote for them if
they failed their expectation.''
	   But James Tien, chairman of the powerful General Chamber of
Commerce and a member of the pro-business Liberal Party, said
political reforms would bring instability. He said that would erode
investor confidence at a time when the territory is struggling for
economic recovery.
	   ``It seems very odd and insensitive to (propose such political
changes) when the people of Hong Kong are most concerned about
their livelihood and that of their families,'' Tien said.
	   The pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong
Kong, one of the three biggest parties in the legislature, proposed
a review of the entire political structure before introducing any
reforms.

India woos foreigners to millennium celebrations of erotic temples
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A yearlong program of dance, drama and
music is planned to attract foreigners to a 1,000-year-old temple
complex known for erotic sculptures in northern India, the
government said Wednesday.
	   The Indian government's 27 overseas tourism offices are
promoting the programs that begin in April in the temple town of
Khajuraho, Tourism Minister Madanlal Khurana told a news
conference.
	   The state government of Madhya Pradesh, where Khajuraho's dozens
of sandstone temples are located, will set up a museum and develop
infrastructure in the area, 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of
New Delhi, said state Chief Minister Digvijay Singh.
	   Khajuraho was the capital of an ancient Hindu kingdom whose
rulers promoted art and sculpture. The monuments were covered with
vegetation when they were discovered early this century.

Singapore's prime minister says crisis will deepen before recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said
Wednesday that Asia's economic crisis will get worse before
recovery.
	   He said the Singapore government will do what it can to help
laid-off workers and the businesses in the island republic that
have been hardest hit by the regional turmoil.
	   ``This adverse shift in the fortunes of Asia is not something
which anyone has expected, but it's now a reality that we must
accept and face up to,'' Goh said at a local event.
	   Goh said that 70 percent of small and medium-size businesses
have projected a drop in sales over the next six months. Among
those, one-third are projecting a drop of 20 percent.
	   ``Let us turn adversity into opportunity. Let us enhance our
competitive capabilities to prepare for the future,'' said Goh.
	   He urged Singaporeans to ``think beyond the crisis'' and not be
discouraged by slower growth rates in upcoming years.

Russian parliament to decide fate of bailout package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The hard-line parliament debated President Boris
Yeltsin's economic austerity plan Wednesday, and its verdict could
determine whether international lenders proceed promptly with a
huge bailout package for Russia.
	   Russia is in urgent need of cash, and it reached tentative
agreement Monday for dlrs 17.1 billion in new loans to help
stabilize financial markets that have been in a tailspin for
months.
	   But the International Monetary Fund and other lenders will be
reluctant to hand over the money if Russia does not deal with
chronic financial problems, such as a bloated state budget and a
porous tax collection system.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, held a special session
Wednesday to consider more than 20 proposals from Yeltsin's
administration. But Communist lawmakers and other opponents have
been resisting spending cuts and tax increases. They say the
government should be spending more money, not less, to help
struggling Russian citizens and industries.
	   Parliament turned down several of the proposals earlier this
month, and Communist leaders have not given any sign that their
position has changed.
	   If parliament rejects Yeltsin's economic plan, then the IMF and
other lenders might withhold the loans.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov told parliament the the loans
were granted on the best possible terms. ``Softer credits than
those issued by the international financial organizations do not
exist,'' he said.
	   But lawmaker Alexander Shokhin, a member of a faction that
usually supports the government, said conditions set by the IMF
were harsh.
	   The debate moved slowly, and by Wednesday afternoon parliament
had only dealt with a few of the bills, including one designed to
protect the rights of foreign investors.
	   ``Foreign investors on Russian territory are guaranteed full and
unconditional protection of their rights,'' said the bill, which
won approval.
	   The foreign loans are designed to calm the stock and bond
markets, stave off a devaluation of the Russian currency and
restore confidence among investors who have been fleeing the
country.
	   The stock market, which has lost more than half its value this
year, soared by about 25 percent on Monday and Tuesday in response
to the loan agreement. But the markets remain volatile and could
again crash if parliament opposes the government's proposals,
analysts say.
	   Yeltsin's plan includes calls to shift the tax burden from
producers, such as oil, gas and electricity companies, to
consumers, who currently face relatively light taxes.
	   But millions of Russians are battling to make ends meet and such
measures could prove extremely unpopular among ordinary Russians.
	   The proposed loans are to come from three sources: the IMF, the
World Bank and the Japanese government. When combined with
already-negotiated loans, the package totals dlrs 22.6 billion
spread over this year and next.
	   The IMF board meets in Washington on Monday to review the loan
agreement, and it could send dlrs 5 billion or more to Russia as
soon as next week.

Philippine rich became richer over the past four years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The average income of Filipinos rose
from 1994 to 1997 but the distribution of income worsened, with the
wealthiest families receiving a larger share of the pie, the
government said Wednesday.
	   The richest 10 percent of the population accounted for 35.5
percent of the national income in 1994 and 39.7 percent in 1997. In
contrast, the share of the poorest 10 percent fell from 1.9 percent
in 1994 to 1.7 percent in 1997, the National Statistics Office
said.
	   Officials say the larger share of the wealth going to the
richest families is partly a result of the economic deregulation
under former President Fidel Ramos.
	   Under Ramos, whose term ended June 30, the government
liberalized many industries, opening the way for new investment and
stimulating the economy after years of stagnation.
	   Wealthy people were generally able to benefit first from the new
business opportunities. Officials in the government's economic
planning agency say the profits are now beginning to trickle down
to poorer people.
	   But that process has been slowed, particularly in rural areas,
by Asia's financial crisis and by a drought that hit the country in
1997, they say.
	   Adjusting for inflation of 23.1 percent in 1994-97, average
family income grew by 21.0 percent while expenditures rose by 20.3
percent during the period, the statistics office said.
	   But by region, family income rose 28.9 percent in urban areas
and only 11.5 percent in rural areas, it said.
	   Ramos' successor, President Joseph Estrada, says his
administration's main goal is to helping the poor receive a greater
share of the benefits from economic development.

Orangemen settle in for long siege at Drumcree
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police making search, arrests near church; one
man released after questioning about boys' deaths; trims and edits
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police moved into the fields
near Drumcree Anglican church Wednesday, arresting six people and
searching for explosives after another violent standoff with
frustrated Orange Order marchers.
	   About 300 people massed at a police barrier overnight, and some
threw bombs and fireworks at police and soldiers. Police said one
man appeared to have a handgun but no shots were fired. No injuries
were reported.
	   Police meanwhile released without charge one of the two men
arrested for questioning about the firebomb deaths of three boys in
Ballymoney on Sunday. The other man was still being questioned
Wednesday, police said.
	   Three young sons of a Catholic woman _ Richard Quinn, 10, Mark,
9, and Jason, 8 _ were buried Tuesday.
	   The crowds outside the Drumcree church have dwindled, violence
has ebbed and the men of the Orange Order say they have settled in
for a long siege to demand their right to march through a Catholic
neighborhood. Since the boys were killed Sunday, some prominent
Orangemen have called for the protest to end.
	   Elsewhere in Northern Ireland, the Orange Hall in Ballycastle,
on the northeast coast, was damaged by firebombs. Trucks and cars
were torched at a garage in Craigavon, 5 miles (8 kms) east of
Portadown.
	   ``If the violence continues, as it has done and indeed has been
violent again last night with the throwing of nail bombs, the
protest has to be reassessed,'' the Rev. Morris Lafferty, a senior
Orange chaplain, said Wednesday.
	   While it is a decision for Portadown Orangemen, he said,
``Perhaps the time is right now to draw it to a close.''
	   But the Portadown Orangemen remain unbowed.
	   ``Anybody who thinks that we are beaten and it's over is totally
misreading the situation. We are still going to be here,'' said
David Jones, spokesman for the Portadown Orange Lodges. ``We are
reviewing all the time where the protest action should go.''
	   For the 11th day, barbed wire, trenches, police and soldiers
blocked the men of Northern Ireland's largest Protestant fraternal
order from marching through a hostile Catholic neighborhood in
Portadown. They are enforcing a decision by the Parades Commission,
created after trouble at Drumcree the past two summers, to forbid
the march.
	   Two years ago, police and soldiers stopped the march for four
days, but gave up in the face of violence across Northern Ireland
by Protestant hard-liners. Last year, police simply forced the
march through Catholic protesters.
	   But this year, authorities held firm against widespread
violence, which reached its depth Sunday with Sunday's firebombing
in Ballymoney.
	   Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams visited the Catholic residents
along the Garvaghy Road Wednesday, and urged the Orangemen to
negotiate a way out of the impasse.
	   ``I acknowledge that there have been some voices of sanity
within Orangeism and I applaud that,'' Adams said.
	   ``The Orangemen should lift their siege and they should talk to
these people and they should start making sure that this is the
last year that we have these types of difficulties.''
	   More than 20,000 Orangemen and supporters massed in the pasture
near the Drumcree Anglican church on Thursday, when five police
officers were injured by bombs and ball bearings fired from the
crowd. Numbers have since dwindled to a few thousand each night.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe Wednesday started talks with
Yugoslav officials amid international efforts to resolve the crisis
in the separatist Serbian Kosovo province.
	   But an ethnic Albanian politician in Pristina, the Kosovo
capital, said the mission of the OSCE to Yugoslavia, the first in
six years, comes too late.
	   Hansjoerg Eiff, a German diplomat, said after meeting Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic that ``we came to talk about all
aspects of relations between OSCE and Yugoslavia.''
	   According to Yugoslav media, Eiff, who spoke in Serbian, said he
hoped OSCE will set up permanent missions in Kosovo, the Muslim
Serbian area of Sandzak and Vojvodina, a region with a large
Hungarian minority.
	   Eiff also said OSCE would like former Spanish Premier Felipe
Gonzales to start a mission to mediate in the Kosovo conflict as
soon as possible, but the Yugoslavs' reaction was not immediately
known.
	   Eiff said his group would also talk to other Serbian, Albanian
and Montenegrin officials in Belgrade, Pristina, and Podgorica, the
Montenegro capital.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE and other international
organizations in 1992 for allegedly fomenting ethnic conflict in
Croatia and Bosnia. Belgrade had refused to allow an OSCE mission
into the country until its membership was restored.
	   Under international pressure, the Yugoslavs agreed last Thursday
to let an initial fact-finding mission visit the country, including
the Kosovo province, where clashes between Serb and Albanian forces
have killed more than 300 people and forced thousands of others to
flee their homes.
	   There were no fresh reports of fighting in Kosovo Wednesday, but
the state-run Yugoslav Tanjug news agency reported that a Serbian
policeman, Branko Jelic, was wounded in the Decane region, but was
not in critical condition.
	   In Pristina, Bajram Kosumi, a top official in the ethnic
Albanian Parliamentary Party opposed to Ibrahim Rugova's main
Democratic League of Kosovo, said the OSCE delegation now can do
little to halt the conflict.
	   ``The return of the OSCE mission in Kosovo could be a symbolic
gesture, which would stress the concern and interest Europe and the
international community in general have for Kosovo, but effectively
it will have little influence in the field,'' he said.
	   ``I am afraid there is no space for the work of this mission in
Kosovo where conflicts have advanced,'' said Kosumi.
	   Another ethnic Albanian politician, Luleta Pula-Beqiri,
illustrated the divisions among the Kosovo Albanians.
	   She reiterated opposition calls for forming of an ethnic
Albanian National Council, criticizing Rugova's attempt to convene
next week the self-styled Kosovo parliament his party dominates as
a means to put the underground Kosovo Liberation Army under his
control.
	   ``The (Kosovo) parliament does not reflect the actual political
relations,'' Pula-Beqiri told Belgrade Blic daily. ``Rugova is the
one most responsible for the rift among Albanian politicians ...
but I hope we will be able to agree.''
	   She said that Rugova and all other politicians in Kosovo have
lost their credibility while the KLA have grown into ``the most
relevant factor and has most respect among the Kosovo Albanians.''
	   Also on Wednesday, the leadership of Rugova's party met in
Pristina and were expected to decide when exactly the unofficial
parliament is to meet.

Relatives of Ecuador's president-elect celebrate his win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Residents of a little mountain village in
north Lebanon celebrated the expected victory of Jamil Mahuad in
Ecuador's presidential polls long before the final results were
announced.
	   Bells tolled in the Maronite church, a band played and people
danced the traditional Dabke in Hadath el-Jebbe, the village of
Mahuad's ancestors, Lebanon's An-Nahar newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The party began late Tuesday when early results in Quito, the
capital of Ecuador, gave Mahuad a narrow lead in Ecuador's
presidential runoff. Final results were expected Wednesday.
	   Residents also lit candles around the ancestral house of Mahuad,
which is spelt Mouawad in Lebanon, the paper said.
	   Mahuad, 48, visited Hadath el-Jebbe on a trip to Lebanon in 1995
as mayor of Quito. The family tree shows that Mahuad's grandfather
Toufic emigrated to Ecuador in 1912. Thirteen years earlier,
Toufic's brother emigrated to the United States.
	   Showing the same enthusiasm as the villagers, Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi sent Mahuad a telegram of congratulations _ also before
the final results were out.
	   Lebanon, a tiny country with a population of 3.2 million, is the
ancestral home of an estimated 10 million people in the Americas,
Australia and other parts of the world. Among its most famous sons
are the American philosopher Khalil Gibran, whose family originated
from Bsharre near Hadath el-Jebbe, the entertainer Danny Thomas and
the singer Paul Anka.

Philippine Airlines ground personnel start series of protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines ground personnel
picketed in front of the company's offices Wednesday but said they
would not immediately go on strike to demand the reinstatement of
thousands of dismissed workers.
	   Conciliation talks between the financially beleaguered airline
and the ground personnel union arranged by the labor department
ended in failure Tuesday night.
	   Brandishing placards and yelling ``Job security,'' the airline
workers picketed outside PAL's operations center near Manila's
airport and vowed to carry out more protests.
	   Airline officials say a strike by the 5,000-member Philippine
Airlines Employees Union could force Asia's oldest airline to shut
down after 57 years of operation.
	   President Joseph Estrada said a closure of the flag carrier
would put the country to shame and urged the labor department to
try to settle the labor dispute in two weeks.
	   PAL's 625 pilots went on strike for 22 days last month,
aggravating financial losses caused by Asia's currency storm and
setting back an ambitious dlrs 4 billion modernization program. PAL
fired all the striking pilots after they ignored a government
return-to-work order.
	   PAL also served termination notices June 15 to 5,000 of its more
than 13,000 workers to minimize its losses, prompting the airline's
ground personnel and flight attendants to threaten to strike as
well. Employees who received the notices were given a mandatory
one-month paid leave to look for jobs.
	   Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma assumed jurisdiction over
the dispute involving the ground personnel on Friday and prohibited
the union from staging a strike and the airline from carrying out
more layoffs from that day.
	   PALEA president Alex Barrientos said the airline is violating
that order. He argued that the termination notices would take
effect on July 15 after the monthlong leave, and thus were covered
by Laguesma's prohibition.
	   He said hundreds of workers who received the notices tried to
report for work Saturday and Monday but were prevented by PAL
officials who said they already had been dismissed.
	   The airline says the workers were terminated June 15.
	   PAL senior vice president Avelino Zapanta said it barred the
dismissed workers from entering the airline premises to prevent
possible sabotage.
	   ``Part of our responsibility is to protect company staff and
properties,'' he said. ``We should remember that these are
disgruntled employees.''
	   Barrientos said they would resort to all forms of protests
``within the bounds of the law,'' adding there were other options
at the moment other than a strike. ``We're waiting for the right
period for a strike,'' he said.
	   PAL says it remains in precarious condition with assets totaling
90 billion pesos (dlrs 2.1 billion) and financial obligations
amounting to 85 billion pesos (dlrs 2 billion).
	   PAL officials said they have entered into negotiations with
foreign investors who would help form break-off companies to handle
some of the airline's major operations.
	   The move is part of a rehabilitation plan being prepared to save
the airline from closure.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ New Yugoslav signing Vladimir Jugovic will
be the kingpin in Arrigo Sacchi's new Atletico de Madrid, Spanish
sports papers predicted Wednesday.
	   Jugovic, 28, donned Atletico's red-and-white striped shirt for

	   The midfielder, who starred for Yugoslavia in the World Cup in
France, signed last week for four seasons with Atletico with a
contract waiver clause of 7 billion pesetas (dlrs 46 million).
	   ''A Jewel for Sacchi'' the Madrid sports daily AS wrote while
its competitor Marca described him as the new Italian coach's
``star-signing'' and the team's new leader.
	   Jugovic has previously played with Red Star Belgrade and Italian
sides Sampdoria, Juventus and most recently Lazio.
	   At Atletico, he will team up with Brazilian Juninho and Italian
world Cup star Christian Vieri.

Finance ministry accuses ex-premier of tax evasion, fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The Finance Ministry has accused former
Premier Tansu Ciller of tax evasion and fraud, the Anatolia news
agency said Wednesday.
	   Mrs. Ciller is accused of transferring dlrs 925,000 to the
United States in 1993 and accumulating dlrs 1.6 million through
unpaid taxes since she became a Cabinet Minister in 1991, the
semi-official news agency said.
	   A parliamentary commission also has been investigating Mrs.
Ciller's wealth in Turkey and the United States, and is expected to
conclude its probe in August. It could ask the legislative body to
lift the immunity she now enjoys as a lawmaker, to pave the way for
her prosecution.
	   Mrs. Ciller declined to comment on the reports Wednesday, saying
she would respond at some future time.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting in Belgrade in session, Albanian official
saying OSCE mission comes too late. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe on Wednesday started talks with
Yugoslav officials amid international efforts to resolve the crisis
in the separatist Serbian Kosovo province.
	   But an ethnic Albanian politician in Pristina, the Kosovo
capital, said the mission of the OSCE to Yugoslavia, the first in
six years, comes too late.
	   Hansjoerg Eiff, a German diplomat, said after meeting Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic that ``we came to talk about all
aspects of relations between OSCE and Yugoslavia.''
	   According to Yugoslav media, Eiff, who spoke in Serbian, said he
hoped OSCE will set up permanent missions in Kosovo, the Muslim
Serbian area of Sandzak and Vojvodina, a region with a large
Hungarian minority.
	   Eiff also said OSCE would like former Spanish Premier Felipe
Gonzales to start a mission to mediate in the Kosovo conflict as
soon as possible, but the Yugoslavs' reaction was not immediately
known.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo, are
seeking independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia. Hundreds of people have been killed since February when
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Albanian separatists who had been attacking Serb police and
military facilities.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE and other international
organizations in 1992 for allegedly fomenting ethnic conflict in
Croatia and Bosnia. Belgrade had refused to allow an OSCE mission
into the country until its membership was restored.
	   Under international pressure, the Yugoslavs agreed last Thursday
to let an initial fact-finding mission visit the country, including
the Kosovo province, where clashes between Serb and Albanian forces
have killed more than 300 people and forced thousands of others to
flee their homes.
	   There were no fresh reports of fighting in Kosovo on Wednesday.

Singapore's flagging electronics sector may not recover this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Suffering from shrinking global demand for
electronics products, Singapore's most important manufacturing
business may not recover this year as previously hoped.
	   Electronics account for about 40 percent of Singapore's
industrial output and for about a third of the country's gross
domestic product.
	   A worldwide industry slowdown, particularly in the disk drive
market, semiconductors and personal computers, is expected to push
Singapore's electronics business lower.
	   Fernando Casas, IBM's vice president for disk drives in the
Asia-Pacific region, told Dow Jones Newswires, ``The third quarter
is traditionally a strong quarter ... but the market is still
digesting (the oversupply) from the second quarter.''
	   Economists told Dow Jones that the failure of an expected
midyear recovery in the disk drive sector, the continued downward
spiral for semiconductor prices, and sharply lower demand for
electronics components are all hurting vulnerable Singapore.
	   In May, the United States reported a sharp fall in electronics
orders, which analysts say will be felt in Singapore in the next
three or four months.
	   With 70 percent of its exports linked to electronics, Singapore
is more dependent on the global electronics industry than any other
Asia-Pacific country.
	   The relative strength of the Singapore dollar against the
currencies of its major competitors also worked against the
country's electronics sector, analysts added.
	   ``The truth is that even if the (global) electronics sector is
strong, Singapore (electronics) exports are losing market share,''
said an economist with a major U.S. investment bank. ``If the
currencies stay the way they are now, exporters have to shift their
production to countries like Malaysia and China.''
	   The expected slowdown in the global electronics industry was a
key factor when the Singapore government cut its economic growth
outlook for 1998 to .5 to 1.5 percent.
	   Despite hope for an earlier recovery, Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong surprised observers recently by saying that the country would
probably slip into recession in 1999.
	   Economists have concluded that Singapore's depressed
manufacturing sector would be the likely culprit dragging the
country into a recession next year.

Investment expert: Hanson fears cost Australia deals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Hanson-Aborigines &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Asian investors have canceled
substantial deals in Australia because of right-wing populist
leader Pauline Hanson and her One Nation party, the head of a major
financial services company said Wednesday.
	   Salomon Smith Barney Asia Pacific chairman Trevor Rowe said he
knew of Asians who were intending to invest in Australia but had
abandoned the idea after Hanson's views, such as cutting off Asian
immigration, received extensive coverage in the Asian media.
	   ``The Hanson phenomenon is having a negative impact on
Australia,'' he told journalists after a business lunch.
	   ``It affects investment, it affects trade, and people's
perception is negative of Australia,'' he said.
	   Asked whether he knew of investment deals that had fallen
through because of Hanson, Rowe said he did.
	   The deals would have been ``investments in Australia that would
create jobs .... substantial investment,'' he said.
	   ``It won't happen here because of the result of concerns that
those investors have.''
	   The investors were Asian but Rowe would not specify their
nationality.
	   He said Australia needed to show leadership to overcome the
problems arising from Hanson and her party.

Court grants Time Engineering Bhd protection against creditors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Telecommunications company Time
Engineering Bhd and its subsidiaries have been given nine months'
court protection from their creditors, the New Straits Times
reported Wednesday.
	   Under the order by High Court Judge T.S. Nathan, the companies
must restructure their debts and sell off assets, the paper said.
	   Malaysian law allows a company to seek court protection from its
creditors while it devises a plan to regain its financial footing.
	   At the end of a specified period, the company can stay in
business if it receives approval from the majority of its
creditors, or those holding 75 percent of its debt.
	   Rumors that the Time companies would gain such protection have
led to a dumping of their shares since Friday, affecting the
broader market.
	   The subsidiaries of Time Engineering affected are Time Telekom
Holding Bhd., Time Wireless Sdn. Bhd., TimeSat Sdn. Bhd., Time
Automation and Managing Services Sdn. Bhd., Time Spectrum Sdn.
Bhd., Time System Integration Sdn. Bhd. and Time Quantum Technology
Sdn. Bhd.

Ukranians arrive to join probe into cargo plane crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A Ukrainian delegation
arrived here Wednesday to join an investigation into the crash of a
Ukrainian military cargo plane.
	   All eight crew members were killed when the Ilyushin-76 burst
into flames Monday and hit the sea minutes after taking off from
Ras Al-Khaimah Airport, United Arab Emirates.
	   The airport manager, Stu Carrie, said the eight-man delegation
would act as observers to the UAE investigation as ``it is the
responsibility of the country where the crash occurred to
investigate.''
	   The 15-year-old plane was owned by Ukraine's Defense Ministry
and was on lease to a private Kiev-based airline, A.T.I.
Aircompany.
	   The Ukrainian Embassy said the plane was carrying several cars
and audio equipment.
	   By Tuesday night, all eight bodies had been recovered. But
search teams were still looking for the cockpit, which was
apparently severed from the fuselage, and the second of the two
instruments that recorded in-flight conditions and data.
	   Ras Al-Khaimah Airport receives about 40 flights a week from
cities in the former Soviet Union, where air safety has declined
dramatically as cash-strapped airlines have lacked the resources to
provide adequate maintenance.

Meeting in violent South African town cancelled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RICHMOND, South Africa (AP) _ A meeting between rival political
parties on violence that has killed 23 people since last week was
cancelled Wednesday amid a dispute over who would chair the
gathering.
	   The government said Tuesday it was sending hundreds of
reinforcement to the town of Richmond in eastern KwaZulu Natal
province to try to quell the political violence.
	   Wednesday's meeting was to have included local leaders of the
African National Congress, the United Democratic Movement and the
Inkatha Freedom Party.
	   Richmond, 450 kilometers (280 miles) southeast of Johannesburg,
was hard-hit by political violence in the last years of apartheid
and the run-up to the first all-race elections in 1994. More than
10,000 people were killed in the last decade, many in fighting
between ANC and IFP supporters.
	   The new round of violence revolves around a local power struggle
between the ANC and the UDM, a new political party. There are fears
could escalate as the country moves closer to next year's
elections.

Boxing fans riot at welterweight fight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   READING, England (AP) _ The hooligan element has emerged in
British sport again, this time at a boxing match.
	   A riot involving rival fans of England's Geoff McCreesh and
Wales' Michael Smyth delayed Tuesday night's British welterweight
title fight between the sixth and seventh rounds for more than five
minutes.
	   McCreesh won the title by knockout 71 seconds into the seventh
round, when violence flared again and police moved into the
Rivermead Leisure Center and removed Welsh supporters.
	   Chairs were thrown across the arena and bare knuckle brawling
broke out among an estimated 50 to 60 people.
	   Police made four arrests Tuesday and were expecting to make
further arrests Wednesday after viewing television footage of the
riot.
	   British Boxing Board of Control spokesman Robert Smith said the
sport's governing body would launch an investigation into the
incident.
	   ``I am sick for British sport,'' he said, making a comparison
between the Reading riot and hooligan acts by English fans at
Marseille during the World Cup.
	   The Reading riot was the worst crowd violence at a British
boxing bout since the WBC super-middleweight title fight between
Nigel Benn and Juan Carlos Gimenez at Birmingham's National
Exhibition Center in 1994.
	   Thames Valley police inspector Dave Paker said a member of the
security staff sustained a broken arm and a middle-aged woman had a
cut to her face and a swollen jaw.

U.S. drugs czar visits heroin distribution center
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The U.S. government's drugs czar,
looking for new ways to reduce American narcotics use, Wednesday
visited a government center for free distribution of heroin to
long-term addicts.
	   But Barry R. McCaffrey, a retired general, made no immediate
comment to reporters on whether he thought the approach might work
in the United States.
	   ``I wanted to come here and listen and find out about Swiss drug
policy,'' he told reporters at the gates of a cleaned-up area that
was an open drug scene before a crackdown on trafficking was
combined with the heroin-distribution program.
	   A three-year study last year said the distribution project,
which has strong support among Swiss voters, had slashed crime,
misery and death associated with the hard-core drug scene.
	   McCaffrey played down differences between the United States and
Switzerland on treatment of drug addicts.
	   ``I would assume that to a large extent we're taking the same
approach to a very human problem,'' McCaffrey said. ``I want to
hear more about Swiss experience.''
	   He cited the U.S. focus on preventing drug use by adolescents,
and then on treatment linked to the criminal justice system, as a
point in common after a meeting with Swiss Vice President Ruth
Dreifuss, the cabinet official responsible for combatting drugs.
	   ``I've heard some very interesting viewpoints by Swiss
authorities and I'll have a chance to learn more about it during
the day,'' McCaffrey said.
	   Calling the United States' experience of drugs ``disastrous,''
McCaffrey said he is confident drug abuse among the population can
be reduced from 6 percent to below 3 percent over the next 10
years.
	   McCaffrey's eight-day fact-finding tour of European countries
has been marked by controversy over his strong criticism of the
Dutch policy of allowing citizens to use marijuana and other drugs
for therapeutic and recreational purposes.
	   He travels Thursday to the Netherlands.
	   The Lindesmith Center, a research project of philanthropist
George Soros, who supports legalized marijuana for medical use,
said in a statement that McCaffrey's Swiss visit is a ``positive
sign only if it's a good faith to learn about alternatives
abroad.''
	   Switzerland's experiment with drug distribution began in 1994
with the first government-authorized distribution of heroin,
morphine and methadone.
	   In a referendum last September, voters overwhelmingly endorsed
the government's liberal drug policies, including the distribution
program.
	   Nearly 71 percent threw out a proposal which would have clamped
down on drugs use.
	   Switzerland has an estimated 30,000 hard drug addicts, one of
Europe's highest rates. But unlike many countries, the death toll
is falling.
	   Police closed the former ``needle park'' next to Zurich's main
train station in 1992.
	   Addicts regrouped in another area around an abandoned rail yard
before police cracked down in 1995. At one point that scene was
estimated to attract up to 4,000 drug users a day.

	   The joke became reality. Aliya Nazarbayev and Aidar Akayev will
wed on Saturday. The presidents of the two neighboring Central
Asian countries are expected to attend.
	   ``Aidar saw her when she was 14 and said jokingly he will marry
her,'' said Kazakh presidential spokesman Kairat Sarybayev. ``Four
and a half years have passed and now the wedding is taking place.''
	   Around 200 relatives and friends, including President Akayev and
his wife, gathered Wednesday for an unofficial wedding ceremony
presided over by a mullah according to Moslem tradition.
	   Aliya, 18, and Aidar, 23, will officially tie the knot on
Saturday in Cholpon-Ata, a small resort at Lake Issyk-Kul in
Kyrgyzstan, where they first met and Akayev has a residence.
	   ``I think the brotherly relations of mutual understanding that
Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan have had before the wedding will
continue,'' Sarybayev said. ``The relationship between these two
people will strengthen the relationship between the two
countries.''

	   KAMPOT, Cambodia (AP) _ New calls were made Wednesday to capture
and try leaders of the Khmer Rouge for killing Cambodians, but the
country's top opposition leader said only history should judge
Henry Kissinger.
	   The differing demands for accountability highlighted Cambodia's
tragedy over the past 30 years and the instability and violence
that continue to plague the country today.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, a candidate in parliamentary elections
July 26, told 4,000 people in a campaign speech that the U.S.
bombing in the Vietnam War had changed the course of Cambodian
history.
	   Kissinger was President Richard Nixon's foreign policy guru and
advocated the bombing of eastern Cambodia to root out sanctuaries
of North Vietnamese troops fighting the U.S. Army in South Vietnam.
	   The bombing and the fighting unleashed by the U.S. intervention
killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians and caused economic
devastation. Coupled with a coup against the prince's father,
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the U.S. actions drove ordinary Cambodians
to support the Khmer Rouge, a group that until then had been
largely unknown.
	   The Maoist-inspired revolutionaries won a civil war in 1975
against a U.S.-backed government and began a reign of terror that
caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people.
	   They were toppled in 1979 by an invasion from Vietnam but
continued to wage guerrilla war against successive governments.
Longtime leader Pol Pot was deposed in a power struggle last year
and died under house arrest, but a handful of his top comrades are
still on the run.
	   Ranariddh told reporters that the fugitive leaders _ Ta Mok,
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan _ and some who have received pardons in
exchange for making peace in recent years should be put on trial.
	   Asked whether Kissinger, who won the Nobel Peace Prize, should
also be put on trial or go free, the prince was more diplomatic.
	   ``Free or not free, history has judged,'' Ranariddh said.
	   The prince blamed his archrival, strongman Hun Sen, for not
working to bring the Khmer Rouge leaders to justice.
	   ``I feel sorry for my country that these killers are with Hun
Sen and they'll go free,'' the prince said. ``If they were not with
him, they would go before a tribunal.''
	   In Phnom Penh, the capital, the United Nations' envoy for human
rights in Cambodia arrived to investigate the political climate
ahead of the elections. Hun Sen, who deposed Ranariddh as
co-premier in a bloody coup last year, has been accused of using
violence to ensure he wins.
	   Envoy Thomas Hammarberg also repeated his appeals for the Khmer
Rouge leaders to be tried for crimes against humanity, calling it a
``principle of justice.''
	   Cambodia's defense minister said earlier this week that the
government will no longer put great effort into hunting down the
fugitive leaders, preferring instead to just ``let them die.''
	   The government had previously insisted that the capture of three
historic Khmer Rouge chieftains was a high priority and that they
should be arrested and forced to stand trial.
	   ``Whatever happens with the three, even if they die or
disappear, it is important to continue this process,'' Hammarberg
said. ``One important issue is how (wide) the net should be cast.''
	   Since 1996, the government has granted pardons to nearly all top
Khmer Rouge figures known to have tried to defect and stop
fighting.
	   Ranariddh, then in office, endorsed amnesty for Ieng Sary, a
former Khmer Rouge deputy prime minister, the first senior leader
to defect. The prince now says he should be tried.

Relatives of Ecuador's president-elect celebrate his win

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS misspelling of Kahlil Gibran's first name, last graf

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Residents of a little mountain village in
north Lebanon celebrated the expected victory of Jamil Mahuad in
Ecuador's presidential polls long before the final results were
announced.
	   Bells tolled in the Maronite church, a band played and people
danced the traditional Dabke in Hadath el-Jebbe, the village of
Mahuad's ancestors, Lebanon's An-Nahar newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The party began late Tuesday when early results in Quito, the
capital of Ecuador, gave Mahuad a narrow lead in Ecuador's
presidential runoff. Final results were expected Wednesday.
	   Residents also lit candles around the ancestral house of Mahuad,
which is spelt Mouawad in Lebanon, the paper said.
	   Mahuad, 48, visited Hadath el-Jebbe on a trip to Lebanon in 1995
as mayor of Quito. The family tree shows that Mahuad's grandfather
Toufic emigrated to Ecuador in 1912. Thirteen years earlier,
Toufic's brother emigrated to the United States.
	   Showing the same enthusiasm as the villagers, Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi sent Mahuad a telegram of congratulations _ also before
the final results were out.
	   Lebanon, a tiny country with a population of 3.2 million, is the
ancestral home of an estimated 10 million people in the Americas,
Australia and other parts of the world. Among its most famous sons
are the American philosopher Kahlil Gibran, whose family originated
from Bsharre near Hadath el-Jebbe, the entertainer Danny Thomas and
the singer Paul Anka.

Foreign Minister suggests possible relaxing of sactions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenya favors a partial lifting or
relaxation of sanctions imposed by regional states two years ago
against Burundi, Foreign Minister Boyana Godana said Wednesday.
	   He spoke five days before a new round of all-party peace talks
is scheduled to begin in neighboring Tanzania.
	   ``Frankly, we think that given that Bujumbura has responded
concretely to the conditions imposed by the regional summit ... it
is important that the regional states begin to give some
encouragement to them by lifting or at least relaxing the sanctions
further,'' Godana told reporters.
	   The sanctions were imposed July 31, 1996, six days after Maj.
Pierre Buyoya overthrew a coalition government and suspended
parliament and political activity, saying only he was capable of
staunching the bloodshed that had engulfed the country since
October 1993.
	   Regional states wanted the sanctions to force Buyoya and his
Tutsi-led administration to restore the political process and sit
down to talks with Hutu rebels.
	   But although he said the sanctions against commercial air
travel, international trade and arms shipments had been effective
in pushing Burundi into talks outside the country, Godana said the
sanctions are highly unpopular in Kenya _ the region's major
economic power.
	   ``They have only helped to distort trade flows, and countries
outside the region have been able to take advantage of this to get
inside the market,'' he said.
	   ``We may have different opinions about the timing for lifting or
relaxing the sanctions, but there are no major disagreements
between the regional states.''
	   He said he believed an agreement on sanctions could be reached
at a review summit once it was evident that the peace process was
seriously underway.
	   At the first all-party talks last month in Arusha, Tanzania, the
main opposition-rebel group, the National Council on the Defense of
Democracy (CNDD), agreed with other participants that Burundi's
problems should be settled peacefully.
	   But a Brussels-based spokesman for the group said Leonard
Nyangoma _ who had signed in the name of the CNDD _ no longer
headed the organization.
	   The signatories agreed that a cease-fire should take effect
before the next round of talks July 20, but there have been reports
of attacks by Hutu rebels and clashes between the army and rebels
in various parts of the country.
	   An estimated 200,000 people have died in the violence in the
past five years.

Italian defender signs with Everton

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Italian defender Marco Materazzi
joined Premier League side Everton on Wednesday in a four-year
transfer deal from Perugia valued at 2.8 million pounds (dlrs 4.4
million).
	   Materazzi, 24, is the first player signed by Walter Smith since
he left Glasgow Rangers to take over as Everton manager.
	   ``We are very pleased to have got hold of him,'' Smith said.
``He is an honest player who I hope will do very well for us. He is
tall, quite aggressive, can pass the ball, has a good shot from
free kicks and is in good the air at set pieces. He should be
beneficial to us overall.''
	   Smith confirmed more signings will follow soon.
	   ``This won't be the end,'' he said. ``We need midfield players.
We have signed a good defender and now we also hope we can improve
our midfield position in the next seven to 10 days. It looks like
being an active period for us.''

Philippine shares end mixed; peso edges higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks ended mixed
Wednesday as regional uncertainties outweighed Wall Street's
overnight gains and the peso's stability against the dollar,
traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 9.19 points,
or 0.5 percent, to 1,794.06, adding to Tuesday's 9.02-point uptick.
	   Declines, however, outnumbered advances 42 to 33, while 46
issues were unchanged.
	   The index gained as much as 20 points early in the session
before profit-taking set in toward the close.
	   The early gains were supported by the Dow Jones Industrial
Average's 1.6 percent surge and the peso's rise against the dollar,
traders said.
	   Traders said all eyes remain on Japan to see what direction it
will take to boost its economy and who will succeed Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, who resigned Monday.
	   While renewed hopes of a Japanese economic recovery and the
stable performance of regional currencies eased jitters somewhat
over the fate of Asian economies Wednesday, investors are likely to
remain cautious, said Astro del Castillo, analyst for A and A
Securities Inc.
	   ``The market will likely remain in a listless mode in
anticipation of more concrete economic reforms in Japan and the
election of a new prime minister next week,'' he said.
	   Erwin Tan, vice president of Securities 2000 Inc., said
range-bound trading will likely persist and trading volume will
remain thin in coming sessions as regional fundamentals remain
weak.
	   ``Assuming the Japanese economy calms down and the U.S. economy
remains buoyant, the local market could get a boost. But I don't
see any positive news coming out of Japan at this point,'' said
Tan.
	   In currency trading, the peso closed higher against the U.S.
dollar in thin trading, with overnight gains in the Japanese yen
setting the stronger trend in early transactions.
	   However, as the Asian day progressed, the faltering yen was
largely ignored by the peso market, dealers said.
	   At the close, the dollar averaged 41.702 pesos, down from 41.862
pesos on Tuesday. The dollar was last traded at 41.680 pesos, close
to its day-low.

Prosecution in bridge disaster tries to show lapse in safety

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The prosecution tried to show Wednesday
that contractors for last year's Maccabiah Games opening ceremonies
took safety precautions in every area except the construction of a
footbridge that collapsed, killing four Australian athletes.
	   An engineer and a set designer testified in Tel Aviv Magistrates
Court about their work on installations inside the stadium where
the opening ceremonies were held last July 14.
	   The Australian team was on its way to the stadium when the
bridge collapsed, throwing the athletes into the polluted Yarkon
River below. Four team members died and dozens were injured.
	   Two contractors, the engineer who designed the bridge, the
director of the games and the chairman of the Maccabiah organizing
committee are on trial on charges of negligent homicide and
building without proper permits.
	   On Wednesday, engineer Sasson Assif testified that he oversaw
construction and checked the safety of installations such as a
lighting tower inside the stadium and the entrance gates to the
stadium.
	   Assif said he was not informed about the construction of the
footbridge. ``I was not even aware of it,'' he said.
	   Prosecutor Hadass Forer-Gafni noted that while the contractor
hired Assif to oversee construction inside the stadium, no one was
hired to check out the safety of the bridge.
	   Judge Edna Beckenstein asked Assif whether he would have ordered
someone to oversee construction of the bridge if he had been in
charge of it, and Assif said, ``Yes.''
	   Another witness, Dov Ben-David, testified about his design for
the stage set for the opening ceremonies
	   Forer-Gafni said she called Ben-David ``to show that the
Maccabiah invested serious effort in the way it presented itself
and in the way it dealt with other issues _ except for the
bridge.''
	   Also testifying briefly Wednesday was a policeman who drove an
ATV across the bridge the day before the collapse.

Britain distributes 1 million pounds to victims of Nazis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain has begun distributing 1 million pounds
(dlrs 1.64 million) of an international relief fund to elderly
victims of the Nazis in Britain and Eastern Europe, the government
announced Wednesday.
	   The money, equivalent to Britain's contribution to the fund
established last year, will benefit about 500 needy people in
Britain, who are to get a third of the sum. The remainder will
provide medical care for Holocaust survivors in Ukraine, Belarus,
Russia and Moldova.
	   The aid of the fund, set up in December during the London
Conference on Nazi gold, was to help elderly World War II Holocaust
survivors whose needs are immediate.
	   Many countries contributed and the fund had reached a total of
nearly 57 million dollars, the Foreign Office said. It is up to the
donor countries, who are in charge of the fund, to determine when
and how to disburse the money they have contributed. Britain, the
first to donate money, is the first to distribute it.
	   The Foreign Office said the Board of Deputies of British Jews
will oversee the allocation of the money in this country, working
with other organizations, and the rest will be distributed through
the World Jewish Restitution Organization for projects providing
medical care to needy survivors in Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and
Moldova.
	   ``We all have a responsibility to ensure that people who
survived the greatest crime of our times do not lack the material
support they need during their remaining years,'' Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said in a statement issued Wednesday.
	   ``We can never erase the scars borne by those who were
persecuted by the Nazis. But the fund can at least ensure that they
can grow old with dignity, freed from the misery of poverty,'' he
said.
	   Neville Nagler, director general of the Jewish board of
deputies, said, ``It appears that throughout the country perhaps
500 needy Jewish survivors are known to our organizations.
	   ``There are also likely to be some people who are not currently
known to us, whether Jewish or non-Jewish, and they may well come
forward in the light of today's announcement,'' he said.
	   Most Holocaust survivors in Britain are ``in the twilight of
their years. They have suffered unimaginable hardships and
horrors,'' he said, adding that the board intended, therefore, to
make cash payments right away to those known to be in need.
Wheelchairs and similar assistance will also be provided.
	   A portion will be set aside to make payments to victims of the
Nazis who are not yet known, but may come forward later, he said.
	   Anthony Layden, head of the Foreign Office Western European
Department, said he hoped the announcement would encourage more
countries to contribute to the fund.
	   Survivors in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union ``are
the people for whom least has been done so far, and they most need
our help,'' he said.

Airline hits 50 percent of passenger target
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Money-losing Vietnam Airlines met 50
percent of its annual target for passengers in the first six months
of 1997, the newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan (People's Army) reported
Wednesday.
	   The airline recently has imposed several measures to cut costs
after its chairman was quoted as saying the national carrier lost
about dlrs 4.5 million last year.
	   It cut some routes in May and took over maintenance of the
Airbus A-320 on July 1. Such work had been done by foreign
companies the last two years.
	   In the first half of the year, the airline carried 1.26 million
passengers, including 454,000 foreigners, and 22,000 tons of cargo.
	   Its forecast for all of 1998 had estimated 2.5 million
passengers and 41,000 tons of cargo.
	   Vietnam Airlines has a fleet of three Boeing 767s, 10 Airbus
A-320s, six ATR-72s and two Fokker-70s. It carried 2.2 million
passengers in 1997, down from a record 2.7 million the previous
year.
	   The airline has been hit hard by a drop in foreign arrivals _
the number of tourists in the first half was only 30 percent of the
year's target _ and a decline in Vietnam's currency, which has made
its dollar-denominated debt more expensive.
	   Airline officials have said two-thirds of its revenues come from
foreigners, who pay double the fares that Vietnamese are charged.
	   Negotiations have bogged down on a civil aviation agreement with
Washington that would allow direct flights between Vietnam and the
United States.

Spanish judge shuts down Basque newspaper and radio

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with judge ordering closure of newspaper and radio,
quotes from Interior Minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A judge probing fundraising activities for
the armed Basque separatist group ETA shut down a newspaper and a
radio station linked to outlawed organization Wednesday.
	   In a crackdown on the firm that owns the news outlets, police
arrested 11 people in a series of pre-dawn raids around the Basque
country and in the neighboring Navarra region.
	   The detainees are current or former board members of Orain S.A.,
the parent company of the Basque daily Egin and the radio station
Egin Irratia.
	   Police searched Egin's offices in the towns of Hernani, Bilbao,
Vitoria and Pamplona, as well as the detainees' homes and the
headquarters of Orain, officials said.
	   National Court Judge Baltasar Garzon later issued an order
closing down Egin and Egin Irratia, Interior Minister Jaime Mayor
Oreja told a press conference.
	   The minister said there were ``close links and stable contacts''
between Orain and ETA, which has been fighting to create an
independent Basque homeland since 1968. Its bombings and other
attacks have killed nearly 800 people.
	   In Hernani, where Egin has its main office, Orain's personnel
director Tomas Arrizabalaga said police had disabled the paper's
printing press there.
	   Waving a copy of Egin, Arrizabalaga said: ``This is a historic
Egin because it will probably be some time before the paper is
published again.''
	   Egin regularly publishes statements by ETA, including its claims
of responsibility for attacks. Last December, Spain's National
Court found two Egin reporters guilty of weapons possession and
membership of ETA and sentenced them to 39 years each.
	   The detainees include Pablo Gorostiaga, a senior member of Herri
Batasuna, a political party closely linked to ETA. Last year, 23
members of Herri Batasuna's executive board were jailed on
conviction of collaboration with a terrorist group.
	   Mayor Oreja said the raids were a follow-up to a May 28 police
operation in which 11 people were arrested on suspicion of aiding
ETA's fundraising efforts. One was later released.

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A Polish woman working as a United
Nations military observer in Georgia was shot dead by unidentified
attackers at the entrance to her apartment in the capital Tbilisi,
officials said Wednesday.
	   Also, eight civilians were killed when their horse-drawn cart
hit a landmine in the breakaway province of Abkhazia, news reports
said Wednesday.
	   Abkhazian officials blamed pro-government militants who are
active in the separatist region, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The U.N. observer, Maria Magdalena Kawioska, 31, was shot at
point-blank range on Tuesday evening, said Maya Musidze, a
spokeswoman of Georgia's Interior Ministry.
	   The motive for the attack was not immediately known.
	   The U.N. observers are in Georgia to monitor the truce between
government forces and separatists in the northwestern Black Sea
province of Abkhazia. The separatists took control of the province
in a 1992-93 war.

Biota aims for flu drug in U.S. by end of 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Biotechnology company Biota Holdings
hopes to have its influenza treatment drug Relenza approved in the
key U.S. market in time for the flu season starting there in
October 1999.
	   Biota chief executive Dr. Hugh Niall said Wednesday that the
submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration should be made
in the final quarter of 1998, with FDA approval usually taking
12-18 months.
	   ``If we are lucky, we will get approval before the northern
hemisphere flu season,'' Niall told a Securities Institute of
Australia briefing.
	   The drug would also be filed for approval in the European
markets in the fourth quarter.
	   It had already been filed in Australia and is being assessed by
the Therapeutic Drug Association.
	   ``We are hopeful and optimistic that the flu drug Relenza will
be approved in Australia by next year,'' Niall said.
	   The Biota chief said competitors working on flu treatments were
one to three years behind.
	   The final timing of the approvals around the world would
determine how soon Biota could start receiving revenue and earning
profits.
	   Niall said he expected profit to start in 2000-01.
	   Relenza will be marketed by global drug giant Glaxo Wellcome,
with Biota to receive 7 percent of gross sales, rising to 10
percent in the local but relatively minor markets of Australia, New
Zealand and South Africa.
	   Over half of all global revenue in the short term was expected
to come from the United States, where Glaxo was preparing a major
advertising campaign.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe Wednesday started talks with
Yugoslav officials amid international efforts to resolve the crisis
in the separatist Serbian Kosovo province.
	   But an ethnic Albanian politician in Pristina, the Kosovo
capital, said the mission of the OSCE to Yugoslavia, the first in
six years, comes too late.
	   Hansjoerg Eiff, a German diplomat, said after meeting Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic that ``we came to talk about all
aspects of relations between OSCE and Yugoslavia.''
	   According to Yugoslav media, Eiff, who spoke in Serbian, said he
hoped OSCE will set up permanent missions in Kosovo, the Muslim
Serbian area of Sandzak and Vojvodina, a region with a large
Hungarian minority.
	   Eiff also said OSCE would like former Spanish Premier Felipe
Gonzales to start a mission to mediate in the Kosovo conflict as
soon as possible, but the Yugoslavs' reaction was not immediately
known.
	   Eiff said his group would also talk to other Serbian, Albanian
and Montenegrin officials in Belgrade, Pristina, and Podgorica, the
Montenegro capital.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE and other international
organizations in 1992 for allegedly fomenting ethnic conflict in
Croatia and Bosnia. Belgrade had refused to allow an OSCE mission
into the country until its membership was restored.
	   Under international pressure, the Yugoslavs agreed last Thursday
to let an initial fact-finding mission visit the country, including
the Kosovo province, where clashes between Serb and Albanian forces
have killed more than 300 people and forced thousands of others to
flee their homes.
	   On the ground, a group of armed ethnic Albanians attacked a
police checkpoint near the southwestern Kosovo town of Decane
Wednesday, wounding one policeman, said the pro-government Serb
Media Center. The center said police repelled the attack.

EIB lends dlrs 250 million to Banque Nationale de Paris
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Investment Bank said
Wednesday it had made two loans totaling 1.5 billion francs (dlrs
250 million) to France's Banque Nationale de Paris to support
private enterprise.
	   The funds will help support small-and-medium-sized companies
working in industry, services, energy or the environment, in France
or in any of the other 14 European Union countries, the EU's
lending arm said in a statement.
	   BNP's French network will draw 1 billion francs (dlrs 160
million) to provide medium-term loans for investment by SMEs, the
statement said.
	   The second loan will be deployed by BNP Lease and its
subsidiaries. This group arranges leasing facilities, medium-term
loans and leasing finance in support of ventures by SMEs and local
authorities.
	   The second loan may also be used to help fund health-related
projects, the EIB said.
	   The EIB was set up in 1958 to raise funds on capital markets and
finance investments in areas such as development of poorer regions,
trans-European transport, telecoms and energy networks, and
environmental protection.

France considers bid for 2008 Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Flushed with sporting pride after its World Cup
success, France is considering a bid to host the 2008 summer
Olympic Games.
	   Paris Mayor Jean Tiberi said Tuesday that the city is weighing
up a bid. But he said more discussions were needed at regional and
national level before a formal proposal can be made.
	   The race for the 2008 games won't officially begin until next
year, when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) formally opens
the bidding process.
	   The IOC will select the venue for the 2008 games in 2001.
	   Candidates so far include Toronto, Osaka, Japan, Istanbul,
Seville, Spain, and Buenos Aires.
	   Lille, in northern France, failed in a bid to land the 2004
games.

Havel at loggerheads with country's political leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ONDREJ HEJMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech republic (AP) _ With an election that did not go
his way behind him and with major surgery ahead, President Vaclav
Havel now has a third problem _ major disputes with the country's
two most powerful politicians.
	   Havel made local headlines earlier this week when he accused the
Civic Democratic Party of ex-Pemier Vaclav Klaus of planning his
ouster on charges of high treason.
	   Havel spoke in an interview with TV Prima Sunday, referring to
``second-hand information'' that he allegedly verified, but gave no
source.
	   Klaus denied the charges and his deputy Miroslav Macek called
the statement ``paranoid''. The press turned against Havel,
criticizing him of feeding a scandal.
	   Havel and the ex-premier were rivals ever since Klaus assumed
power in 1992. Havel publicly backed Klaus' downfall last year,
after Klaus became embroiled in accusation of illegal party
financing.
	   Havel was then instrumental in forming an anti-Klaus caretaker
government that steered the country until elections last month.
	   After the Social Democrats got the most votes, with Klaus' party
a close second, a deal was struck under which Social Democrat
leader Milos Zeman becomes premier and Klaus gets key parliamentary
posts.
	   Havel said he would seek outside counsel to see if the deal does
not violate the constitution, a position seen as hostile by both
Zeman and Klaus.
	   While Havel's dislike of Klaus is notorious, the tension between
the president and Zeman is relatively new.
	   In an unprecedented move last week, Havel said he would
personally screen candidates for Zeman's government before he
appoints them officially.
	   Havel's opposition to the Zeman-Klaus deal is seen as sour
grapes for the president whose political influence is dwarfed by
the agreement of two major leaders.
	   The two men now control a total of 137 seats in the 200-seat
legislature, enough to make constitutional changes.
	   Havel is scheduled to undergo abdominal surgery July 23 to
repair his digestive tract after a ruptured colon in February
forced him out of political action for several months.

Report: More foreign criminals committing crimes in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The number of foreign criminals in Vietnam
is rising, the newspaper People's Army reported Wednesday while
urging the government to strengthen anti-crime cooperation with
other countries.
	   It said courts put 74 foreign offenders on trial in the 54 most
serious cases last year. Most were charged with conducting swindles
or trafficking in drugs or women.
	   Overall, hundreds of foreigners were involved in criminal
activity last year, with the majority expelled from the country.
	   The paper said criminal gangs in Hong Kong and Taiwan have
expanded their operations to Southeast Asian countries, including
Vietnam.
	   In addition, some foreign criminals and spies have come to
Vietnam under different covers and in disguise, causing
difficulties for the country's security and order situation, it
said.

Judges refuses to withdraw despite charges of improprieties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In a scandal mesmerizing Israelis, a
judge on Wednesday rejected a defense motion that he withdraw from
a high-profile treason trial because he allegedly had a ``close,
intensive'' relationship with a young lawyer in the case.
	   Judge Amnon Straschnov said he would go ahead with passing
sentence later Wednesday on Nachum Manbar, an Israeli businessman
convicted last month of selling dlrs 16 million worth of chemical
weapons materials to Iran. Manbar faces life in prison.
	   The saga broke Tuesday when the Supreme Court lifted a news
blackout, and quickly snowballed with allegations that Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the case with the judge in a
violation of proper conduct rules. Netanyahu vehemently denied
having been in touch with Straschnov. The judge said he last spoke
to the prime minister 18 months ago in a public forum _ before
Manbar's arrest _ and had not been in touch with the Netanyahu or
his advisers since then.
	   Israeli media were consumed by the tale. Two mass circulation
dailies, Yedioth Ahronot and Maariv, each dedicated their first 13
pages to the affair. A story about the U.S. peace initiative,
normally frontpage material, was pushed to page 15 of Yediot.
	   At the center of the intrigue is Pninat Yanai, 26, who worked as
an apprentice lawyer for Straschnov before being hired by Manbar's
lead defense attorney, Amnon Zichroni.
	   On Tuesday, Zichroni alleged that Yanai had secretly maintained
a ``close, intensive and personal'' relationship with Straschnov
during the trial and passed confidential material to him. Yanai was
later fired from the defense team.
	   Zichroni said Yanai also had close, personal relationships with
a Netanyahu spokesman, Shai Bazak, and with an agent of the Shin
Bet security services who led the investigation of Manbar.
	   Yanai countered that Zichroni hired her for the Manbar trial
because he wanted to exploit her previous professional relationship
with the judge. She also said the was the victim of a personal
vendetta by her former boyfriend, Ziv Chen, who was the key source
of the allegations against her.
	   At the start of Wednesday's sentencing session in the Manbar
trial, Zichroni demanded that Straschnov withdraw from the case.
	   The judge responded that the allegations of improper conduct are
``interesting and imaginative, but have no basis in truth.''
	   ``The attempt to disgrace the judge has failed,'' Straschnov
said. He denied having had any contact with Yanai outside the
courtroom or having discussed the case with her.
	   Zichroni said he would appeal Straschnov's decision. The judge,
in turn, turned down a defense request to suspend sentencing
pending the outcome of the appeal.
	   Devora Chen, the state prosecutor in the Manbar trial, accused
Zichroni of trying to intimidate the court. ``I call on the court
not to capitulate to such pressure. Today, the legal system is
being tested,'' said Chen.

Rangers-Shelbourne game called off due to security fears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Next week's UEFA Cup game between
Scottish giants Glasgow Rangers and Irish side Shelbourne was
called off Wednesday due to fears of sectarian violence.
	   The first-round, first-leg match was scheduled to have gone
ahead at Dublin's Tolka Park stadium next Wednesday.
	   But it was postponed following talks between the two clubs and
officials from the British embassy in Dublin and the Football
Association of Ireland.
	   The Dublin club was reportedly worried about the possibility of
violence if Rangers' fans from Northern Ireland's Protestant
community traveled south for the game.
	   Fourteen years ago, when Rangers last played a European cup
match in Dublin, against the Bohemians Club, there were clashes
between local fans, Protestants and Irish police.
	   ``The tie will not now take place in Dublin,'' the Shelbourne
Football Club said in a statement. ``The directors of Shelbourne FC
have reluctantly taken this decision in the light of adverse
publicity surrounding this tie in recent days.
	   ``The safety of patrons at Tolka Park, the local residents and
the general Dublin public was paramount in arriving at this
decision. Ticket sales have now been suspended.''
	   The game is expected to be switched to another date at a venue
away from Dublin, possibly outside of Ireland.
	   Controversy arose this week when Rangers were told their
allocation of tickets would be cut from 5,000 to 500, with the
kick-off switched to mid-day and an alcohol sales ban imposed to
avoid the possibility of trouble.
	   That move followed ``grave disquiet'' expressed by the FAI at
the original allocation of tickets to the Glasgow club, which has a
huge following among Protestants in Northern Ireland.

Jazz singer Beryl Bryden dead at 78
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDs details of Bryden's career &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Jazz singer Beryl Bryden, dubbed ``Britain's queen
of the blues'' by Ella Fitzgerald, has died of cancer of the lymph
glands, a family friend said Wednesday. She was 78.
	   Miss Bryden died on Tuesday at St. Mary's Hospital in London,
record producer Hugh Palmer said.
	   In a career spanning 50 years, Miss Bryden performed with many
of the jazz greats, including Billie Holliday and Louis Armstrong.
	   Born in Norwich, eastern England, on May 11, 1920, she worked as
a shorthand typist before starting her music career with the
amateur Cambridge Jazz Club, performing extensively at local
venues. By the late 1940s she was singing and playing washboard
with many of the important traditional British jazz bands including
those of George Webb, Freddy Randall and Alex Welsh.
	   But it was not until the 1950s that she became a full-time
performer and she waited until the 1970s before visiting the United
States, where she toured extensively, sometimes as a solo artist,
sometimes in company with jazz musicians like Pete Allen.
	   A strong performer of songs from the classic period of the blues
and vaudeville, she recorded more than 100 songs, including ``Rock
Island Line,'' with Lonnie Donegan, which sold two million copies
in 1954.
	   Despite her illness, she performed in Eindhoven, the
Netherlands, as recently as last month.
	   ``She was a woman of indomitable courage who would never let her
fans down or disappoint an audience that had paid to see her,''
Palmer said. ``When I visited her last at St. Mary's she was very
seriously ill but she refused to cancel forthcoming concert
appearances.''
	   ``Performing, and the sight and sound of an audience enjoying
her music, was breath and life to her,'' he said.
	   Funeral details were not immediately announced. There was no
immediate word on survivors.

 &UR; SPLA announces unilateral cease-fire for three months &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Sudan People's Liberation Army
Wednesday declared a three-month cease-fire in southwestern Bahr
el-Ghazal province in order to allow deliveries of relief food to
hundreds of thousands of people.
	   ``For humanitarian reasons, the SPLA today at 1500 hours
(1200gmt) on the 15th of July 1998 declares a unilateral cease-fire
for a period of three months,'' SLPA official Bagan Amum told a
news conference.
	   ``This is a humanitarian truce limited to areas afflicted by
famine and has nothing to do with issues of war and peace in
southern Sudan.''
	   The U. N. World Food Program estimates at least 2.6 million
people in the region need food, and of those, 1.2 million are in
danger of starvation.
	   ``Any initiative that's going to improve security conditions on
the ground for aid workers trying to get relief food to hundreds of
thousands of people at risk now can only be seen as a positive
first step,'' WFP spokeswoman Michele Quintaglie said.

	   YEKATERINBURG, Russia (AP) _ Eighty years after Russia's last
czar and his family were executed, their much-disputed bones were
placed in small wooden coffins Wednesday and readied for a state
burial alongside their royal ancestors.
	   President Boris Yeltsin was the driving force behind the plans
for the burial, originally intended as a dignified way to close a
bloody chapter in the country's turbulent history.
	   But the event has been dogged by controversy, and most of the
country's leading religious and political figures _ including
Yeltsin _ will not attend the services, which culminate with the
burial Friday in St. Petersburg.
	   Originally planned with full regalia and elaborate ceremony, the
burial will cost the federal government only 5 million rubles (dlrs
800,000), according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Czar Nicholas II and his family were executed by the Bolsheviks
on July 17, 1918, in the central Russian city of Yekaterinburg, and
their bodies were dumped in an unmarked pit until they were
unearthed in 1991.
	   After seven years filled with political wrangling, the three-day
burial ceremony was to began Wednesday in Yekaterinburg.
	   On Tuesday, the bones were transferred from glass sarcophagi
into small wooden coffins, and local officials signed documents
turning over responsibility for the remains to the federal
government.
	   The coffins, each decorated with an ornately etched name plate,
hold the remains of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, three of their
five children, and four servants. The coffins of the czar and
czarina are draped with the yellow flag of the Romanov family, and
the servants' coffins are lined with silver, rather than the royal
gold.
	   The other two children, Alexei and the one scientists believe is
Maria, were also executed in 1918, but their remains have not been
found and most investigators believe the bodies were burned to
ashes.
	   Legend has long held that Anastasia survived the shooting and
escaped, but scientific tests indicate that it is her sister Maria
whose bones are missing.
	   In Wednesday's ceremony, Anastasia's name, not Maria's, adorned
the name plate of one of the coffins handed over to the federal
government. Her name, along with those of the rest of her family
and the servants, was read during the document signing ceremony.
	   Yekaterinburg's Gov. Eduard Rossel said during a press
conference that an investigation would start after the burial to
find the missing remains.
	   Even as the ceremonies began, the dispute surrounding the event
carried on.
	   Rossel, who fought hard to have the remains interred in
Yekaterinburg, said he too would snub the actual ceremony in St.
Petersburg.
	   ``There are petty political games going on around the remains
and I don't want to take part in this politicking,'' he said.
	   The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexei II,
made a rare television appearance Tuesday evening to again question
the authenticity of the remains and criticize the burial service.
	   He claimed that ``important scientific objections remain.'' But
extensive DNA testing in the United States, Russia, and England has
convinced the scientists that the bones belong to Nicholas and his
family.
	   The coffins will be flown to St. Petersburg on Thursday and
buried Friday in the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral, where most of
the Romanov monarchs are interred.
	   Meanwhile, Alexander Avdonin, a geologist who found the remains
after years of searching, said he was upset that the ceremony had
been scaled back due to the controversies.
	   ``The funeral is an event of world-level importance, and the low
level does not befit it,'' he said.
	   The czar's surviving relatives have also been split over the
service, with some planning to attend and others boycotting.
	   Nicholas Romanov, head of the Romanov Family Association, said
in St. Petersburg, that he was satisfied with the way the burial
was being handled.
	   ``We Romanovs have always expressed the opinion that we didn't
want the burial to be a carnival,'' he said. ``We wanted it to be
quiet and solemn, so as far as we are concerned, the simpler the
better.''

Spanish court urges judge to proceed with probe against Pinochet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish court has ruled that an
investigating magistrate should reopen a probe into human rights
abuses committed under former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, saying he has full jurisdiction in the case.
	   A statement Wednesday from lawyers for the prosecution said the
National Court made the decision last week and urged Judge Manuel
Garcia Castellon to consider requesting an indictment of the former
Chilean dictator.
	   Garcia Castellon began investigating rights abuses during the
1973-90 Pinochet dictatorship in 1996 at the request of victims'
families and Spain's Union of Progressive Public Prosecutors. He
halted the investigation in March after state prosecutors said the
court should rule on whether Spain had jurisdiction in the matter.
	   ``This ruling provides full backing for the court's
investigation into the terrorism and genocide committed by
Pinochet's military dictatorship,'' Juan Garces, head of the
plaintiffs' legal team, said in Wednesday's statement.
	   Garcia Castellon's probe and another by a colleague, Baltasar
Garzon, into the disappearance of some 600 Spaniards during
Argentina's dirty war against dissidents between 1976-83 have been
opposed by authorities in the two Latin American countries as well
as in Spain.

Israeli troops clash with Bedouin over goat confiscations

<TEXT>
	   RASHIDEH, West Bank (AP) _ Clashes broke out Wednesday between
Israeli soldiers and Bedouin Arabs when the Israelis confiscated
the Bedouin's goat herd, which was grazing in an army firing zone.
More than 30 Bedouin were injured.
	   A crowd of 150 Bedouin from the Rashideh tribe threw rocks and
blocked the narrow road leading to their desert encampment with
burning tires after Israeli troops loaded the tribe's 140 goats
onto trucks. The soldiers responded by firing rubber-coated steel
pellets and tear gas.
	   After more than an hour, the army brought in dozens more
soldiers and quelled the protest. Six Bedouin were arrested, and
the goats were taken away.
	   Thirteen Bedouin were treated at Bethlehem's Hussein Hospital
for injuries from the rubber bullets, and 20 for tear gas
inhalation. None of the injuries were serious, hospital officials
said.
	   Peter Lerner, spokesman for Israel's military government in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, said the goats were confiscated ``for
their own protection, so they won't get shot.''
	   Lerner said the goats would be released after police question
the suspects and pay a ``holding fine'' for the goats.
	   Ironically, Wednesday marked the army's official 50th
anniversary salute to Israel's Bedouin community. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu was to attend a ceremony honoring the Bedouin
later Wednesday night.
	   Earlier in the day, shots were fired at a Palestinian police car
traveling on a Bethlehem road. Palestinian police said the shots
were fired by Jewish settlers who fled with their car to Jerusalem.
	   No one was hurt in the shooting.

Vote of confidence in government set for next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ With rifts in the coalition papered over for now,
Premier Romano Prodi goes before parliament for a vote of
confidence next week that his government appears certain to win.
	   Prodi will address the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies
separately Friday, with the actual vote scheduled Tuesday.
	   Prodi has drawn up a new plan of action for his center-left
government after the alliance was shaken last month by a vote over
NATO's eastward expansion.
	   Parliament ratified the agreement, but only after the opposition
bailed Prodi out. His Communist allies, against the NATO alliance
in principle, voted against the addition of Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic.
	   After talks with the Communists last week, Prodi said he would
go before Parliament with a program of ``strong reforms, which can
give the government a long-term strategy.''
	   Newspapers said Wednesday that the Communists were back on
board, at least for the moment. ``The risks of a crisis have
vanished,'' said Rome's La Repubblica.
	   In office since mid-1996, the government already has lasted
longer than a large part of the other 54 Italian governments since
World War II. Its mandate expires in 2001.

German says Iran supports contact group efforts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Iran says it backs the efforts of major
powers to bring peace to Serbia's Kosovo province, German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel said Wednesday.
	   In a statement issued in Bonn, Kinkel said his Iranian
counterpart, Kamal Kharrazi, told him that Tehran wants autonomy
but not independence for the mainly ethnic Albanian province
because it fears further instability in the Balkans.
	   This matches the stand of the Contact Group seeking peace in the
Balkans, which includes the United States, Russia, Britain, France,
Germany and Italy.
	   Kharrazi also told Kinkel that ``despite reports to the
contrary, no Iranian mujahedeen are involved in the fighting in
Kosovo.'' The foreign ministry statement did not elaborate.
	   Kinkel talked by telephone with Kharrazi during a visit
Wednesday to Lithuania.
	   Iran currently chairs the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, a 55-member group of Muslim countries. Most Kosovo
Albanians are Muslims.

Iraq, Syria to build new oil pipeline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has signed an agreement with Syria to
build a second oil pipeline between the two countries, the official
Iraqi News Agency said Wednesday.
	   The agreement was signed Tuesday in Damascus during the
three-day visit of Iraq's oil minister, Amer Mohammed Rashid, INA
said.
	   It quoted Rashid, who returned to Baghdad Wednesday, as saying
that the new pipeline will have more capacity that the first one,
which can carry 1.4 million barrels a day.
	   INA said work on the pipeline will start soon, but gave no
details or say how much it will cost. The route that the pipeline
will take also was not disclosed.
	   INA said Syria and Iraq also agreed during Rashid's visit to
reopen the first line, which has remained closed since 1982 when
Syria decided to side with Iran during the Iran-Iraq war of
1980-88.
	   The pipeline joins Iraq's oil fields of Kirkuk in northern Iraq
to Banias port in Syria. INA quoted Rashid as saying that it will
reopen after repairs.
	   Rashid said ``it will be ready within a short time'' but gave no
specific date for the reopening.

EU opens inquiry into state aid to Italian postal sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission said Wednesday it will open an investigation into aid
the Italian government may have granted to the national postal
operator over the past 30 years.
	   ``Aid appears to have been granted in various forms over the
past years,'' the Commission said in a statement.
	   It said the Italian government may have given Ente Poste more
than 40 trillion lire (around dlrs 22 billion) over the past 30
years.
	   ``Ente Poste has no analytical accounting system which would
allow to separate the costs and revenues of reserved and
competitive activities respectively, the Commission said.
	   It said that part of the aid may be compatible with the EU's
rules on state aid. The Commission can veto state aid plans it
judges hinder fair competition rules in the EU.

Poor demand halts production of European Ladas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Production of the western European
version of Russia's Lada automobile has been halted due to poor
sales.
	   ``It simply wasn't selling in Europe,'' Juhani Riutta, chief
executive officer of Valmet Automotive, the car's assembler, said
Wednesday.
	   Production of the cars _ trade-named Euro-Samaras _ began in
1996 at Valmet's assembly plant in Uusikaupunki. The main
components were made by the Lada's Russian manufacturer Avtovaz,
with other parts supplied by western European companies.
	   The goal was to make 60,000 Euro-Samaras in three years, but
poor demand ended the production after only 15,000 cars.
	   The Lada is a mainstay of Russia's automobile industry, regarded
as reliable though spartan and boxy. The Euro-Samara had a more
modern body style.

	   YEKATERINBURG, Russia (AP) _ Eighty years after Russia's last
czar and his family were executed, their much-disputed bones were
placed in small wooden coffins Wednesday and readied for a state
burial alongside their royal ancestors.
	   President Boris Yeltsin was the driving force behind the plans
for the burial, originally intended as a dignified way to close a
bloody chapter in the country's turbulent history.
	   But the event has been dogged by controversy, and most of the
country's leading religious and political figures _ including
Yeltsin _ will not attend the services, which culminate with the
burial Friday in St. Petersburg.
	   Originally planned with full regalia and elaborate ceremony, the
burial will cost the federal government only 5 million rubles (dlrs
800,000), according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Czar Nicholas II and his family were executed by the Bolsheviks
on July 17, 1918, in the central Russian city of Yekaterinburg, and
their bodies were dumped in an unmarked pit until they were
unearthed in 1991.
	   After seven years filled with political wrangling, the three-day
burial ceremony began Wednesday in Yekaterinburg.
	   The bones were transferred from glass sarcophagi into small
wooden coffins, and local officials signed documents turning over
responsibility for the remains to the federal government.
	   The coffins, each decorated with an ornately etched name plate,
hold the remains of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, three of their
five children, and four servants. The coffins of the czar and
czarina are draped with the yellow flag of the Romanov family, and
the servants' coffins are lined with silver, rather than the royal
gold.
	   The other two children, Alexei and the one scientists believe is
Maria, were also executed in 1918, but their remains have not been
found and most investigators believe the bodies were burned to
ashes.
	   Legend has long held that Anastasia survived the shooting and
escaped, but scientific tests indicate that it is her sister Maria
whose bones are missing.
	   In Wednesday's ceremony, Anastasia's name, not Maria's, adorned
the name plate of one of the coffins handed over to the federal
government. Her name, along with those of the rest of her family
and the servants, was read during the document signing ceremony.
	   Yekaterinburg's Gov. Eduard Rossel said during a press
conference that an investigation would start after the burial to
find the missing remains.
	   Even as the ceremonies began, the dispute surrounding the event
carried on.
	   Rossel, who fought hard to have the remains interred in
Yekaterinburg, said he too would snub the actual ceremony in St.
Petersburg.
	   ``There are petty political games going on around the remains
and I don't want to take part in this politicking,'' he said.
	   The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexei II,
made a rare television appearance Tuesday evening to again question
the authenticity of the remains and criticize the burial service.
	   He claimed that ``important scientific objections remain.'' But
extensive DNA testing in the United States, Russia, and England has
convinced the scientists that the bones belong to Nicholas and his
family.
	   The coffins will be flown to St. Petersburg on Thursday and
buried Friday in the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral, where most of
the Romanov monarchs are interred.
	   Meanwhile, Alexander Avdonin, a geologist who found the remains
after years of searching, said he was upset that the ceremony had
been scaled back due to the controversies.
	   ``The funeral is an event of world-level importance, and the low
level does not befit it,'' he said.
	   The czar's surviving relatives have also been split over the
service, with some planning to attend and others boycotting.
	   Nicholas Romanov, head of the Romanov Family Association, said
in St. Petersburg, that he was satisfied with the way the burial
was being handled.
	   ``We Romanovs have always expressed the opinion that we didn't
want the burial to be a carnival,'' he said. ``We wanted it to be
quiet and solemn, so as far as we are concerned, the simpler the
better.''

Israeli troops clash with Bedouin over goat confiscations

	   RASHIDEH, West Bank (AP) _ Clashes broke out Wednesday between
Israeli soldiers and Bedouin Arabs when the Israelis confiscated
the Bedouin's goat herd, which was grazing in an army firing zone.
More than 30 Bedouin were injured.
	   A crowd of 150 Bedouin from the Rashideh tribe threw rocks and
blocked the narrow road leading to their desert encampment with
burning tires after Israeli troops loaded the tribe's 140 goats
onto trucks. The soldiers responded by firing rubber-coated steel
pellets and tear gas.
	   After more than an hour, the army brought in dozens more
soldiers and quelled the protest. Six Bedouin were arrested, and
the goats were taken away.
	   Thirteen Bedouin were treated at Bethlehem's Hussein Hospital
for injuries from the rubber bullets, and 20 for tear gas
inhalation. None of the injuries were serious, hospital officials
said.
	   Peter Lerner, spokesman for Israel's military government in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, said the goats were confiscated ``for
their own protection, so they won't get shot.''
	   Lerner said the goats would be released after police question
the suspects and pay a ``holding fine'' for the goats.
	   Ironically, Wednesday marked the army's official 50th
anniversary salute to Israel's Bedouin community. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu was to attend a ceremony honoring the Bedouin
later Wednesday night.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's state church doesn't have nuns, but
a group of tourists didn't think it unusual when they saw a woman
in a nun's habit in the Oslo Cathedral. They changed their minds
when she started a striptease.
	   The incident came to light this month when the sex-oriented
magazine Aktuell Report published photos of the stripping _ which
was done by a model in an organized photo session.
	   ``This has to be seen as a gross abuse of the church. We have to
see the pictures before were can decide what to do,'' Andreas
Aarflot, Oslo bishop of the state Evangelical Lutheran Church, was
quoted as saying in Wednesday's Dagbladet newspaper.
	   The photo session took place last year, when the model and a
photo team entered the cathedral soon after it opened one morning.
A group of early-rising Japanese tourists visited the church while
the session was underway, many of them taking their own pictures
and applauded when the show was over, Dagbladet said.
	   The nude pictures, taken a year ago, were published this month
in the Aktuell Report magazine.
	   ``I don't see why people should react to the pictures,''
magazine publisher Jan Petter Askevold was quoted as saying. ``She
was just showing her body as God created it.''

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Kuwait, Jordan and Bahrain &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The government has proposed an amendment to a law
that would give debtors who owe the government hundreds of millions
of dinars an extra six months to pay their dues.
	   Al-Anba daily reported Wednesday the Cabinet has referred the
amendment to the 1993 bad debts law to the National Assembly, or
Parliament, and asked it to treat it as urgent.
	   The debts date back to the 1982 stock market crash, and were
aggravated by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The Central Bank took over the debts worth some 6.7 billion
dinars (dlrs 21.89 billion) from nine private banks in 1991 after
Kuwait's liberation in the Gulf War.
	   A 1995 amendment gave debtors the choice of paying 45 percent of
their debts in five installments, or scheduling the full amount
over 12 years. The majority of the 10,400 debtors chose the
installment method. The fourth payment, estimated at around 255
million dinars (dlrs 833.33 million), is due Sept. 6, and the fifth
on Sept. 6, 1999.
	   If the amendment is approved as expected, the fourth installment
will be due on March 5, 1999 and the fifth one on March 6, 2000. It
is not known how much money the Central Bank has recovered.
	   The government believes the extension will increase chances of
payment and have a positive effect on the stock exchange. It was
feared that debtors would liquidate their stocks in order to pay
their dues, plunging prices even lower than they have been for
weeks.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The Gulf's largest state-of-the-art
cinema complex has opened for business in Bahrain, newspapers
reported Wednesday.
	   The 1.5 million dinar (dlrs 4 million) six-screen complex, was
inaugurated Tuesday at the island's largest shopping center, the
Seef Mall, local Arabic and English-language newspapers reported.
	   The cinemas, with a collective seating capacity for 1,347, have
special seating and restroom facilities for the handicapped, plus
the availability of hearing aids for people with hearing problems,
the newspapers said.
	   The Bahrain Cinema Co., which runs almost all the cinemas in
this tiny Gulf island, also operates the new complex.
	   The company, which is listed on the Bahrain Stock Exchange,
plans to open five more cinemas in different locations on the
island, the English-language Gulf Daily News newspaper reported.
	   The previous largest cinema complex in the Gulf is located in
Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, with a
four-screen theater.
 &UR; ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The U.N. Sanctions Committee has granted
Jordan five contracts to supply Iraq with food, medicine and
medical equipment worth more than dlrs 7 million, a Jordanian
official said Wednesday.
	   The committee's approval brings the total value of contracts
awarded to Jordan under the oil-for-food program to dlrs 92
million, an official of the ministry of industry and trade said.
	   The official said under the five contracts Iraq would receive
medical equipment worth dlrs 6.153 million, medicine worth dlrs
621,000 and vegetable oil worth dlrs 420,000.

Lawmaker brandishes pistol in protest after bulgary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ First, parliament member Gerasimos
Giakoumatos shot off his mouth. Then he took out the real thing.
	   Waving a pistol in the parliament building Wednesday,
Giakoumatos added a shocking exclamation point to his protests
after burglars took jewelry and cash from his home.
	   Giakoumatos said we would kill the minister of public order,
Georgios Romeos, if he ever again became the victim of crime. But
words apparently did not satisfy Giakoumatos' anger.
	   He brandished a pistol in the parliament press room to the
disbelief of reporters and others. No charges were filed against
Giakoumatos, whose house was burglarized on Tuesday.
	   Vangelis Markoulis, spokesperson for the ministry of public
order, said Romeos would not respond to Giakoumatos' threats.
	   The government spokesman, Dimitris Reppas, urged Giakoumatos to
tone down his outrage.

Israeli judge refuses to withdraw despite charges of improprieties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In a scandal mesmerizing Israelis, a
judge on Wednesday rejected a defense motion that he withdraw from
a high-profile treason trial because he allegedly had a ``close,
intensive'' relationship with a young lawyer in the case.
	   Judge Amnon Straschnov said he would go ahead with passing
sentence later Wednesday on Nachum Manbar, an Israeli businessman
convicted last month of selling dlrs 16 million worth of chemical
weapons materials to Iran. Manbar faces life in prison.
	   The saga broke Tuesday when the Supreme Court lifted a news
blackout, and quickly snowballed with allegations that Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the case with the judge in a
violation of proper conduct rules.
	   Netanyahu vehemently denied having been in touch with
Straschnov. The judge said he last spoke to the prime minister 18
months ago in a public forum.
	   Israeli media were consumed by the tale. Two mass circulation
dailies, Yedioth Ahronot and Maariv, each dedicated their first 13
pages to the affair. A story about the U.S. peace initiative,
normally frontpage material, was pushed to page 15 of Yediot.
	   At the center of the intrigue is Pninat Yanai, 26, who worked as
an apprentice lawyer for Straschnov before being hired by Manbar's
lead defense attorney, Amnon Zichroni.
	   On Tuesday, Zichroni alleged that Yanai had secretly maintained
a ``close, intensive and personal'' relationship with Straschnov
during the trial and passed confidential material to him. Yanai was
later fired from the defense team.
	   Zichroni said Yanai also had close, personal relationships with
a Netanyahu spokesman, Shai Bazak, and with an agent of the Shin
Bet security services who led the investigation of Manbar.
	   Yanai countered that Zichroni hired her for the Manbar trial
because he wanted to exploit her previous professional relationship
with the judge. She also said the was the victim of a personal
vendetta by her former boyfriend, Ziv Chen, who was the key source
of the allegations against her.
	   At the start of Wednesday's sentencing session in the Manbar
trial, Zichroni demanded that Straschnov withdraw from the case.
	   The judge responded that the allegations of improper conduct are
``interesting and imaginative, but have no basis in truth.''
	   ``The attempt to disgrace the judge has failed,'' Straschnov
said. He denied having had any contact with Yanai outside the
courtroom or having discussed the case with her.
	   Zichroni said he would appeal Straschnov's decision. The judge,
in turn, turned down a defense request to suspend sentencing
pending the outcome of the appeal.
	   Devora Chen, the state prosecutor in the Manbar trial, accused
Zichroni of trying to intimidate the court. ``I call on the court
not to capitulate to such pressure. Today, the legal system is
being tested,'' said Chen.

Demirel pledges supports international peace efforts in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - Turkish President Suleyman Demirel on
Wednesday urged world powers to speed up moves to resolve the
Kosovo crisis, pledging his country will support whatever peace
initiative is undertaken in the separatist Serbian province.
	   ``We are loosing time. I urge the world that Bosnia should not
be repeated,'' he told reporters, referring to 3 1/2 years of
bloodshed in Bosnia in which up to 200,000 people were killed.
	   Demirel termed the flight and expulsions of ethnic Albanians
from Kosovo ``ethnic cleansing,'' saying this was a terrible
tragency for the region.
	   In his speech to the Albanian parliament earlier Wednesday, he
said key to a solution in Kosovo was a halt to bloodshed, granting
Kosovo Albanians fundamental rights, an immediate dialogue between
the warring parties and a return of the tens of thousands of
refugees to their homes.
	   ``I exclude the use of the force. It's true, many times in the
Balkans force was exercised to reach a goal, but we are living in
peace time,'' Demirel said.
	   Albanian President Rexhep Meidani said ``Kosovo requires the
intervention of the world with all political, economic and military
mechanisms if necessary.
	   ``The people in Kosovo are suffering a war. It's not a classic
one, but ... the consequences so far have been dramatic,'' he said.
	   Demirel donated dlrs 100,000 in cash for the upkeep of refugees
crowding northern Albania.

Moderate quake rattles Athens

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with magnitude, epicenter of earthquake &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A moderate earthquake shook the Athens
area on Wednesday, but there were no immediate reports of injuries
or serious damage.
	   The temblor, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.3, occurred at
4:25 p.m. (1325 GMT) in Avlona, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
northeast of Athens, media reports said. It was felt throughout the
greater Athens area.
	   A quake of moment magnitude 2.5 to 3 is the smallest generally
felt by people. A quake of magnitude 4 often causes slight damage.
	   Magnitude 5 can produce moderate damage. Magnitude 6 causes
severe damage under a populate area, while a magnitude seven
indicates a major earthquake capable of widespread, heavy damage.

Opposition sets more demands for presidential elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Five opposition leaders have given Azerbaijan's
government new demands they say must be met to keep them from
boycotting October elections, a news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The leaders are all opposed to the rule of President Geidar
Aliev, who was Azerbaijan's Soviet-era Communist Party boss and
came to power in a bloodless military coup in June 1993. He is
running for re-election.
	   They said the government must drop criminal proceedings against
two of them and put an end to human rights violations, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   Some political parties must also be allowed to register,
political censorship in the country must be abolished, and all
presidential candidates must be given equal rights, they said.
	   The ultimatums come after the Azerbaijani parliament conceded to
two of three of the opposition leaders' previous demands to lower a
required voter limit and allow voters to sign more than one
candidate's nominating position.
	   Though the government did not concede a demand that the central
election agency be independent, opposition leaders said at the time
they were heartened by the partial victory.
	   The five leaders are: Alfubaz Elchibin, chairman of the National
Front and former president of Azerbaijan; Isa Gambar, chairman of
the Musabad Party and a former speaker of parliament; Rasul Guriev,
ex-speaker of the parliament in the first three years of Aliev's
presidency;, Lala-Shorket Gadzhieva, leader of the Liberal Party
and Aliev's former chief of staff; and Ilyas Ismailov, leader of
the Democratic Party.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and his
Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Pil, called for quick growth in trade
and investment Wednesday.
	   ``The excellent condition of the Polish economy encourages
Korean firms to invest here,'' Buzek said after the talks.
	   The two leaders also discussed political issues such as North
Korea, agreeing that the communist country should not be isolated,
Buzek said.
	   Poland imported more than dlrs 1 billion worth of South Korean
goods last year, while South Korean automaking giant Daewoo Motors
is second largest investor in Poland, with dlrs 1 billion invested
in Warsaw and Lublin, slightly behind Fiat of Italy.
	   In the afternoon, the Korean leader was received by President
Aleksander Kwasniewski.

<TEXT>
	   RICHMOND, South Africa (AP) _ An opposition party on Wednesday
accused police of being involved in an attack on the property of
one of its leaders, fueling tensions in an area where 23 people
have been killed since last week.
	   Meanwhile, a meeting between rival political parties on the
violence was cancelled Wednesday amid a dispute over who would
chair the gathering.
	   Police said they were investigating a break-in that occurred
early Wednesday at Sifiso Nkabinde's shop, which is connected to
his house. Nkabinde, a controversial figure, is national secretary
of the United Democratic Movement. He was ousted from the ruling
African National Congress for allegedly being a police informant
and was recently acquitted of charges that he killed 16 people.
	   Shots were fired at Nkabinde's house but no one was hurt,
according to UDM deputy national secretary Annelize van Wyk.
Nkabinde found a police pager apparently dropped by the assailants
and spent cartridges that are police-issue, Van Wyk said.
	   Witnesses saw the attackers arrive in a police armored vehicle,
said van Wyk, who decried the ``obvious involvement'' of police in
the attack.
	   The government said Tuesday it was sending hundreds of
reinforcement to Richmond, in eastern KwaZulu Natal province, to
try to quell the political violence.
	   Wednesday's cancelled meeting was to have included local leaders
of the ANC, the UDM and the Inkatha Freedom Party. The ANC walked
out amid a dispute over whether an IFP or ANC official would chair
the meeting.
	   Richmond, 450 kilometers (280 miles) southeast of Johannesburg,
was hard-hit by political violence in the last years of apartheid
and the run-up to the first all-race elections in 1994. More than
10,000 people were killed in the last decade, many in fighting
between ANC and IFP supporters.
	   The new round of violence revolves around a local power struggle
between the ANC and the UDM, a new political party. There are fears
it could escalate as the country moves closer to next year's
elections.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ First, parliament member Gerasimos
Giakoumatos shot off his mouth. Then he took out the real thing.
	   Waving a pistol in the parliament building Wednesday,
Giakoumatos added a shocking exclamation point to his protests
after burglars took jewelry and cash from his home.
	   Giakoumatos said we would kill the minister of public order,
Georgios Romeos, if he ever again became the victim of crime. But
words apparently did not satisfy Giakoumatos' anger.
	   He brandished a pistol in the parliament press room to the
disbelief of reporters and others. No charges were filed against
Giakoumatos, whose house was burglarized on Tuesday.
	   Vangelis Markoulis, spokesperson for the ministry of public
order, said Romeos would not respond to Giakoumatos' threats.
	   The government spokesman, Dimitris Reppas, urged Giakoumatos to
tone down his outrage.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's interior minister urged tougher
measures Wednesday against soccer hooligans, such as detaining them
on game days, impounding their cars and ordering them to report to
police when the local team plays out of town.
	   ``I'm not saying we can get rid of all hooligans in three years,
but it wouldn't take long to have a lot fewer,'' Manfred Kanther
said.
	   Cracking down on soccer thugs has become a priority since German
hooligans beat a French policeman into a coma last month during a
World Cup match.
	   German police have files on 2,300 soccer hooligans, Kanther
said. He urged courts and German states, who control most police
matters in Germany's federal system, to consider taking steps to
prevent hooligans from traveling to soccer games abroad and to
league games within the country.
	   A 27-year-old suspect in the June 21 beating of the French
policeman after a Germany-Yugoslavia World Cup game turned himself
in to police Wednesday in his home town of Gelsenkirchen. He is the
sixth German in custody in the case.
	   Police had issued an arrest warrant for the man Tuesday based on
a media photograph, prosecutors said. The man's full name was not
released.
	   German police on Monday arrested two other suspects, ages 23 and
33, based on witness testimony and photos of the rioting at Lens,
France. Two Germans had been previously arrested in France, and one
in Hamburg.

Manchester facilities under question as Malaysia team is announced
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ As England prepares to send its biggest ever team
to the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia, preparations for the 2002
games in Manchester are coming under increasing scrutiny.
	   Norman Sarsfield, chairman of England's Commonwealth Games
Council, admits the facilities at Manchester are still only in the
planning stages.
	   Sarsfield, speaking at the announcment of England's swimming
team for the games in September, said the stadia in Kuala Lumpur
were the best he had ever seen.
	   But he said he was ``ashamed'' because the facilities at
Manchester did ``not measure up at all.''
	   ``The swimming pool at Kuala Lumpur is better than the pool used
for the Atlanta Olympics and the (track) stadium _ it's the best
I've seen. Better than the Stade de France (venue of the World Cup
soccer final),'' he said.
	   Sarsfield, who visited Malaysia last month to inspect the
facilities, said the Malaysian government had supported the
Commonwealth Games and used it as an way to improve infrastructure.
	   ``Everything will be perfect. And the smog won't be a problem _
the Malaysian's have ensured the air quality will be at suitable
levels for the athletes,'' he said.
	   Kuala Lumpur is the first Asian city to host the Commonwealth
Games, which started as the Empire Games in New Zealand in 1930.
	   British Sports Minister Tony Banks responded to questions about
Manchester's lack of visible facilities by saying he was confident
England would host a successful competition.
	   ``There was an agreement between the Sports Council and the
Manchester authorities about the 2002 Commonwealth Games _ there's
time enough for us to get it right,'' he said.
	   England will send a 452-strong team to Malaysia in a bid to
restore some confidence in England's sporting ability for the
nation's public.
	   Sarsfield predicted England would challenge Australia, which he
rated among the top three swimming countries in the world, for
Commonwealth Games supremacy.

Ukraine hoping credit agency reverses tentative credit lowering
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The bond rating agency Moody's announced
tentative plans to lower its credit rating for Ukraine. The
government said Wednesday that it hoped the agency would change its
mind.
	   Moody's Investors Service announced Monday that its outlook for
credit ratings assigned for Ukraine shifted from ``stable'' to
``negative.''
	   The primary cause was the ``gradual depletion of foreign
currency reserves over the past few months,'' which ``implies the
risk of default on its foreign debt obligations,'' Moody's said.
	   Valery Lytvytsky, a senior aide to President Leonid Kuchma,
voiced hope the agency would change its pessimistic forecast, given
the government's recent successful negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund that are expected to result in the
approval of a dlrs 2.5 billion loan for Ukraine.
	   ``As soon as the loan is approved, we hope (Moody's) will change
its forecast to a more positive,'' he told reporters.
	   Lytvytsky said Ukraine has met practically all the requirements
set by the IMF for disbursement of the three-year loan, and an IMF
mission, scheduled to arrive in Kiev next week, may recommend to
the IMF board of directors that it approve the loan.
	   Moody's assigned Ukraine a B2 bond rating earlier this year. The
rating was the worst among some 110 countries graded by the
international agency to date, except for Indonesia and Pakistan.
	   Ratings assigned by international bond rating agencies to a
country characterize its financial credibility and largely
determine the interest rate at which this country can borrow from
foreign lenders.
	   The low rating forced Ukraine to borrow earlier this year over
dlrs 1 billion in foreign loans at annual interest rates of up to
17 percent.
	   Ukraine's central bank reported its reserves at dlrs 1.77
billion as of July 1, or about dlrs 300 million lower than in May.
The bank's chief, Viktor Yushchenko, said Tuesday the reserves were
sufficient to meet Ukraine's current foreign debt obligations.
	   However, Moody's said it feared that Ukraine ``will run out of
reserves by the end of the year'' if the IMF program is not
approved.
	   The agency said it will be closely following Ukraine's financial
market, but added that its rating outlook might be negatively
influenced by 1999 presidential elections, since they ``may imply
further political paralysis.''

Army troops raid hashish field in eastern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ In a crackdown on hashish cultivation,
Lebanese troops Wednesday raided a remote area in eastern Lebanon
and destroyed hemp crops hidden among potato and wheat fields,
officials said.
	   Some 250 troops were deployed near the village of Yammouni, some
30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of the ancient town of Baalbek,
on the foothills of Lebanon's central mountains during the
operation, said the officials.
	   More than 15 plow tractors were brought in to destroy the hemp
plants, said the officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. They did not specify the quantity of hemp destroyed.
	   The operation, mounted by the Drug Enforcement Office, was the
third this year in the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.
	   Leaves and flowers of hemp are used to make hashish or
marijuana.
	   Lebanon's drug trade thrived during the lawless days of the
1975-90 civil war, especially in the impoverished Bekaa.
	   Since the end of the conflict, however, the Lebanese army backed
by Syrian security forces deployed in the region has destroyed most
of the hashish fields.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A judge probing fundraising activities for
the armed Basque separatist group ETA shut down a newspaper and a
radio station linked to the outlawed organization Wednesday.
	   In a crackdown on the firm that owns the news outlets, police
arrested 11 people in a series of pre-dawn raids around the Basque
country and in the neighboring Navarra region.
	   The detainees are current or former board members of Orain S.A.,
the parent company of the Basque daily Egin and the radio station
Egin Irratia.
	   Police searched Egin's offices in the towns of Hernani, Bilbao,
Vitoria and Pamplona, as well as the detainees' homes and the
headquarters of Orain, officials said.
	   National Court Judge Baltasar Garzon later issued an order
closing down Egin and Egin Irratia, Interior Minister Jaime Mayor
Oreja told a press conference.
	   The minister said there were ``close links and stable contacts''
between Orain and ETA, which has been fighting to create an
independent Basque homeland since 1968. Its bombings and other
attacks have killed nearly 800 people.

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Russian winger Andrei Kanchelskis
returned to British soccer Wednesday when he signed with Glasgow
Rangers for a record Scottish transfer fee of 5.5 million pounds
(dlrs 8.8 million).
	   The 29-year-old Kanchelskis, who spent two seasons in Italy with
Fiorentina after playing for Manchester United and Everton in the
English Premier League, signed a four-year contract with the
Scottish giants.
	   He is the fifth player signed by new Rangers manager Dick
Advocaat. Other recent arrivals include Dutch internationals Arthur
Numan and Giovanni van Bronckhorst.
	   The club is also expected to sign French goalkeeper Lionel
Charbonnier in a 1.2 million pound (dlrs 1.9 million) move from
Auxerre.
	   Kanchelskis will fill the void left by the departures of Paul
Gascoigne and Brian Laudrup. He will play on the right flank as
part of a four-man midfield.
	   ``It was vital that we got him here because we were missing a
player who can play on the right side,'' Advocaat said. ``Like the
other new players, he is of the highest quality. He is fast,
skilful and he is very experienced Hopefully he will live up to our
expectations.''
	   The Ukrainian-born Kanchelskis was part of the Manchester United
side which won the league title in 1993 and the league-FA Cup
double in 1994. He played for Everton in 1995 and 1996 before
joining Fiorentina.

South Africa prepares to celebrate Mandela's 80th birthday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela's 80th
birthday celebrations begin Thursday _ two days ahead of his
birthday _ with a party at a game reserve for children in foster
care.
	   In Kruger Park, South Africa's largest game reserve, Mandela
will host more than 1,000 children who will see its teeming game,
including lions and elephants.
	   A party will be held at which Mandela will blow out 80 candles
on a birthday cake, aided by nine children _ one from each of South
Africa's provinces.
	   Mandela's birthday is on Saturday, when he will host a small
private party for family and friends at his house in suburban
Johannesburg.
	   A banquet will be held Sunday night at an estate near
Johannesburg, attended by an estimated 2,000 people. It is ``the
most coveted invitation this year and the one already circled in
every socialite's diary,'' the Star, a Johannesburg daily, said
Wednesday.
	   Some of the invitations were sold to raise money for charities
which Mandela sponsors.
	   Mandela, who steps down next year after four years in power, has
won widespread support for advocating reconciliation in the wake of
1994's elections that ended apartheid.
	   In an interview with a local newspaper, Mandela was asked what
he would be wishing for when he blows out the candles.
	   ``I wish i could retire, even before the end of the year, and
let young people take over,'' he joked.

Myanmar government launches campaign against monosodium glutamate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's government has launched an
unusually heavy media campaign telling citizens they might face
health hazards from using too much of the food seasoning monosodium
glutamate, or MSG.
	   State radio and television have broadcast a special program of
interviews with doctors and researchers.
	   One of the doctors' interviews has been rebroadcast on
television almost every day for the past week. Newspapers have been
running public service notices daily, similar to the exhortations
they usually run defending the country's military regime and
decrying its critics.
	   There is little consensus in mainstream medical opinion outside
of Myanmar about the dangers of MSG, and few if any tests have
provided evidence it can cause serious harm to humans. It has,
however, been linked to migraine headaches.
	   In the Myanmar campaign, the doctors said excessive use of MSG
could give rise to ``Chinese restaurant syndrome'' _ with such
symptoms as tightness in the face or upper body, tingling and
pressure _ headaches and even brain damage and growth retardation.
	   The campaign has puzzled many people, since imports of seasoning
powder, including MSG, have been banned since March in line with
the government's drive for austerity and ``encourage local
products'' campaign.
	   At the same time, it is still apparently being produced locally
by state-owned factories. The industry ministry could not be
contacted Wednesday to comment on the situation.
	   An article in state-owned newspapers titled ``The hazards of
monosodium glutamate'' stated that the use of MSG is very low in
countries where it is produced and large quantities of the MSG used
in Myanmar are produced near the country's borders.
	   The assertion about consumption is apparently untrue, and it was
unclear what was meant by the statement about production near the
border.
	   The article said the use of MSG in Myanmar _ also called Burma _
has increased noticeably.
	   ``Awareness of the hazards of MSG by the public will reduce the
use of MSG and eventually stop using it,'' the article said.
	   Monosodium glutamate, a flavor enhancer, is often used in the
preparation of Chinese food and is found in some instant foods,
such as canned soup and frozen dinners.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Sudan People's Liberation Army
Wednesday declared a three-month cease-fire in its fight against
government troops to allow delivery of relief food to hundreds of
thousands of starving people in southwestern Bahr el-Ghazal
province.
	   ``For humanitarian reasons, the SPLA today at 1500 hours

Greece: Demilitarization only `antidote' for Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Any plan that does not move toward
demilitarization of Cyprus will fail to end the 24-year division of
the island, Greece insisted Wednesday.
	   ``Proposals which lead to simply covering up a reality, which is
the (Turkish) occupation of the island ... are proposals which
constitute a simple aspirin used as an antidote to a large
problem,'' said government spokesman Dimitris Reppas.
	   Cyprus has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion sparked by
an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by Turkey.
	   ``The problem needs daring, it needs strong will, it needs a
show of true and sincere interest from all sides which say they
desire a solution to the Cyprus problem,'' Reppas said.
	   He added that an interest must be shown in a proposition which
would ``lead to the withdrawal of military forces from the whole
island.''
	   Tensions have increased on the island since the Greek Cypriot
government's decision last year to purchase Russian-made S-300
anti-aircraft missiles, which could be delivered later this year.
	   Turkey, which maintains around 35,000 troops in the occupied
sector of Cyprus, has threatened to take action to prevent the
missiles' deployment.
	   Greece, in turn, has warned it would come to Cyprus' aid,
raising fears of a military clash between the two NATO countries. A
Greek-built military airport opened recently in Cyprus.
	   During a visit to the United States last week, Greek Defense
Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos said the non-deployment of the S-300
system could be envisioned following ``an all-out demilitarization
of the island.''
	   One option considered during Tsochadzopoulos' meeting with U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen was a no-fly-zone over the island.
	   ``The proposal for a no-flight-zone must be considered with care
from all sides,'' Reppas said. ``If accepted, it can be considered
a first step in the direction of demilitarization, which we support
and believe can be feasible.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ More than a century after the Dutch smuggled them
out of Izmir, Britain on Wednesday returned to Turkey seven figures
dating from Roman times that are known as the Castor Marbles.
	   Turkish ambassador Ozden Sanberk accepted the figures, which
include busts of Venus and Marcus Aurelius, from Veronica Robinson
of Britain's Maritime and Coastguard Agency at a brief ceremony at
the Turkish Embassy in London.
	   Dutch vice consul Alfred Van Lennep removed the marbles from
Izmir in 1894, but the Dutch ship Castor sank in the English
Channel as it carried them home to the Netherlands.
	   In 1995, the marbles were discovered by a group of British
divers, who handed them over to the British authorities. They
contacted the Turkish Ministry of Culture.
	   The Turkish government was able to prove ownership in the
British authorities, which agreed that the marbles must be returned
home.
	   Kenan Ipek, a press counselor at the Turkish Embassy, said the
marbles ``will be displayed in a museum in western Anatolia,
perhaps in Izmir or Bodrum. But this has not yet been decided.''

Legislators defeat push for faster democracy

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's legislature on Wednesday defeated a
push for faster democratic reforms, rejecting a call by Democrats
to elect the full assembly and the chief executive by direct,
popular vote when their current terms are up.
	   The motion, calling for fully democratic elections for the
legislature in two years and for the chief executive in 2002, would
have had no legal effect. However, it touched on one of the most
pressing and sensitive issues facing the Hong Kong government after
the return to Chinese rule last year.
	   Government officials can use the vote to justify their go-slow
approach to expanding democracy.
	   Election methods before the year 2007 have been set in the
post-handover constitution. Before 2007, the chief executive will
be elected by an 800-member electoral college and only half of the
legislature will be elected by popular vote. Any constitutional
changes must be approved by Beijing and therefore would be
difficult.
	   The Democrats, Hong Kong's largest party, and their allies said
the larger-than-expected voter turnout in May elections showed that
people were ready for direct elections.
	   But they ran into opposition from government officials and
lawmakers who said that rapid change could slow down the
territory's recovery from recession.
	   Michael Suen, secretary for constitutional affairs, told the
legislature that full elections before 2007 ``would create too many
problems, and (government officials) would need a long time to
solve these problems.''
	   ``The crux of the problem is whether the time is ripe, whether
the society is well-prepared, and whether the society has reached a
consensus,'' he said.
	   The motion won only 20 votes in the 60-seat legislature. That is
roughly the number of seats that the Democrats and their allies won
in the May 24 elections.
	   Outside the legislature earlier in the day, a small group of
protesters waved placards saying, ``Direct Elections'' and ``To
hell with money politics.''
	   The call for more democracy has intensified as ratings for Tung
and other government officials dropped due to a series of problems
including the troubled opening of Hong Kong's new airport and the
economic downturn.
	   Many critics blame a leftover colonial system in which
officials, including the senior civil servants and a group of elite
advisers, have policymaking power but no accountability to the
public.
	   ``Only when there's democracy can the public effectively monitor
the government,'' said Democrat Andrew Cheng, who sponsored the
motion. ``Elected officials have a public mandate to monitor the
government, and the public has the right not to vote for them if
they failed their expectation.''
	   But James Tien, chairman of the powerful General Chamber of
Commerce and a member of the pro-business Liberal Party, said
political reforms would bring instability. He said that would erode
investor confidence at a time when the territory is struggling for
economic recovery.
	   ``It seems very odd and insensitive to (propose such political
changes) when the people of Hong Kong are most concerned about
their livelihood and that of their families,'' Tien said.
	   The pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong
Kong, one of the three biggest parties in the legislature, proposed
a review of the entire political structure before introducing any
reforms. That proposal also was defeated.

Spanish judge shuts down Basque newspaper and radio
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS reaction from Basque party, newspaper's circulation
figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A judge probing fundraising activities for
the armed Basque separatist group ETA shut down a newspaper and a
radio station linked to the outlawed organization Wednesday.
	   Moving against the firm that owns the news outlets, police also
arrested 11 people in a series of pre-dawn raids around the
northern Basque country and in the neighboring Navarra region.
	   The detainees are current or former board members of Orain S.A.,
the parent company of the Basque daily Egin and the radio station
Egin Irratia.
	   Police searched Egin's offices in the towns of Hernani, Bilbao,
Vitoria and Pamplona, as well as the detainees' homes and the
headquarters of Orain, officials said.
	   National Court Judge Baltasar Garzon later issued an order
closing down Egin and Egin Irratia, Interior Minister Jaime Mayor
Oreja told a press conference.
	   The minister said there were ``close links and stable contacts''
between Orain and ETA, which has been fighting to create an
independent Basque homeland since 1968. Its bombings and other
attacks have killed nearly 800 people.
	   In Hernani, where Egin has its main office, Orain's personnel
director Tomas Arrizabalaga said police had disabled the paper's
printing press there.
	   Waving a copy of Egin, Arrizabalaga said: ``This is a historic
Egin because it will probably be some time before the paper is
published again.''
	   A private press monitoring group says Egin has a daily
circulation of about 52,000.
	   Egin regularly publishes statements by ETA, including its claims
of responsibility for attacks.
	   Last December, Spain's National Court found two Egin reporters
guilty of weapons possession and membership of ETA and sentenced
them to 39 years in jail each.
	   Wednesday's detainees include Pablo Gorostiaga, a senior member
of Herri Batasuna, a political party closely linked to ETA. Last
year, 23 members of Herri Batasuna's executive board were jailed on
conviction of collaboration with a terrorist group.
	   Mayor Oreja said the raids were a follow-up to a May 28 police
operation in which 11 people were arrested on suspicion of aiding
ETA's fundraising efforts. One was later released.
	   Herri Batasuna, the party seen as the political wing of ETA,
denounced the arrests and the judicial order as flagrant violations
of freedom of expression.''
	   ``The only requirement for an arrest or business closing to
occur is for it to be marketable among Spaniards,'' the party said
in a statement.

Lebanon pilots call one-day strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Pilots of Lebanon's national airline are
planning a a 24-hour strike on Thursday to press for higher
salaries among other things, a union statement said Wednesday.
	   The state-owned Middle East Airlines's 160 pilots would stop
work between midnight Wednesday (2100 GMT) and midnight Thursday
night, the Pilots' Union said.
	   MEA's 11 incoming and 11 departing flights are expected to be
canceled as a result.
	   But 15 flights by foreign airliners coming in and leaving the
Beirut International Airport will not be affected, airport
officials.
	   The pilots are demanding among other things compensation for
extra work in previous years and a salary increase. Details of
their demands will be revealed later.
	   An MEA pilot earns an average of about dlrs 3,000 a month.
	   MEA, which employs about 5,000 people, is Lebanon's second
biggest employer after the public sector. It has a fleet of 15
aircraft and their destinations include South America and
Singapore.
	   MEA incurred dlrs 100 million losses in the last few years. The
government bought a 99 percent stake in the company after debts
owed to the Central Bank were converted into shares.

Bulgaria arrests 56 trying to cross illegally into Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Border police on Wednesday arrested a
total of 56 Bulgarian nationals who tried to illegally cross into
neighboring Turkey.
	   Those detained in three separate incidents were all ethnic
Turks. The biggest group included 29 children, seven men and 10
women and was found on the back of a Turkish truck.
	   Those on the truck told police they had to pay the equivalent of
dlrs 722 per adult and dlrs 1,111 per child to organizers.
	   The driver was paid the equivalent of more than dlrs 3,000 in
advance and promised another dlrs 3,000, said the state-run BTA
news agency.
	   The arrests were made at the Kapitan Andreevo border crossing
314 kilometers (196 miles) southeast of Sofia.
	   People smuggling at the border has increased since 1990. That
was when Turkey tightened visa requirements for Bulgaria's 800,000
ethnic Turks, following improvements in rights violated during
communist rule in Bulgaria
	   Some Bulgarian Turks are looking for a better life in Turkey.
Others want to join relatives among the 300,000 allowed to leave in
the late 1980s amid attempts by the communist regime to force them
to take Slavic names.

Miners' leader says government misspent dlrs 150 million

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Defying a two-year ban from the
capital, miners' leader Miron Cozma said Wednesday the government
had misspent millions of dollars of redundancy pay it gave to
miners.
	   ``With 1,300 billion lei (dlrs 150 million) you could have done
something concrete,'' Cozma said about government money given to
50,000 coal miners who were laid off as part of industry reforms.
	   Cozma said he planned to meet Prime Minister Radu Vasile, but
the premier said the moment was not opportune.
	   Cozma commandeered trains and brought thousands of unruly coal
miners to Bucharest in 1990 and 1991 to bring down the government.
Nine people died in street violence, and Prime Minister Petre Roman
was forced to resign in Sept. 1991.
	   Cozma was charged with undermining state authority and
jeopardizing railway traffic when reformists came to power in
November 1996. He was ultimately acquitted of those charges but
convicted for some lesser offenses. He was released from prison in
June 1998 after serving 15 months and banned from Bucharest for two
years.
	   ``We were manipulated by the power (authorities),'' Cozma said.
Cozma, head of a mining union that claims 100,000 members, recently
has joined the ultranationalist Greater Romania party.

	   LONDON (AP) _ More than a century after the Dutch smuggled them
out of Izmir, Britain on Wednesday returned to Turkey seven figures
dating from Roman times that are known as the Castor Marbles.
	   Turkish ambassador Ozden Sanberk accepted the figures, which
include busts of Venus and Marcus Aurelius, from Veronica Robinson
of Britain's Maritime and Coastguard Agency at a brief ceremony at
the Turkish Embassy in London.
	   ``The scourge of ancient sites, whether on land or under water,
is illegal excavation and smuggling,'' Sanberk told guests, who
toasted the handover in champagne. ``Illegal excavations bleed away
our knowledge of the past. They not only mean that many wonderful
things are lost forever to their rightful owners, they also steal
from us our ability to know and understand the ancient past.''
	   ``That is why I am so pleased and impressed that these marbles,
which were making their journey to Europe in doubtful
circumstances, are finally returning home,'' he said. ``It is a
warning to the smugglers and illegal excavators that all over the
world responsible people are working against them.''
	   Dutch vice consul Alfred Van Lennep removed the marbles from
Izmir in 1894, but the Dutch ship Castor sank in the English
Channel as it carried them home to the Netherlands.

Alleged Gucci killer denies guilt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Benedetto Ceraulo, the man charged as the
hitman in the Maurizio Gucci slaying, denied in court Wednesday
that he shot the former fashion mogul.
	   ``I never had anything to do with the Gucci murder,'' said
Ceraulo. ``I never discussed it (with the other defendants). I have
always led a normal, correct life, I've always worked for a
living.''
	   Gucci's ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, is on trial along
with Ceraulo, her former confident Pina Auriemma, Ivano Savioni and
Orazio Cicala. Reggiani Martinelli is accused of planning the
murder to gain control over Gucci's multi-million-dollar estate.
	   Ceraulo admitted that he knew Savioni, a hotel doorman, and
Cicala, a pizzeria owner who is accused of finding the killer and
driving the getaway car.
	   Cicala confessed last week to driving the killer to the scene of
the crime and picking him up afterward, but he denied that Ceraulo
was the person in the car with him on March 27, 1995, the day Gucci
was murdered.
	   Cicala has declined to name the killer, saying the person is
still on the loose and he fears for his family.
	   However, Savioni testified last week that Ceraulo had admitted
to him he was the killer and wanted more money for his work. When
prosecutor Carlo Nocerino asked Ceraulo about the admission,
Ceraulo replied:
	   ``Savioni must have made it up. The name Gucci has never been a
part of my life, not even in terms of fashion -- I have other
things to buy.''
	   When Nocerino asked him why he hadn't declared his innocence
earlier, Ceraulo testified he had been beaten up by police when he
was arrested.
	   ``I was beaten ferociously,'' Ceraulo said. ``When you and the
preliminary hearings judge showed up to interrogate me, I was told
measures would be taken, but from that day I haven't heard
anything,'' he said.
	   Nocerino said after the hearing that he wasn't aware of
Ceraulo's complaint , while Filippo Ninni, who was head of the
police when Ceraulo was arrested, denied in a telephone interview
that Ceraulo had been beaten.
	   Reggiani Martinelli will take the stand again Thursday for the
continuation of her examination by prosecutor Nocerino, while the
cross-examination has been set for Friday.

Opponents of German language reform carry on fight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEL, Germany (AP) _ A day after losing before Germany's highest
court, opponents of the planned reform to the German language set
their hopes Wednesday on a state referendum.
	   Heinz-Werner Arens, president of the state parliament in
Schlewsig-Holstein, said Tuesday's high court decision upholding
the new rules did not require the state to cancel a planned
referendum on whether to implement the changes in their schools.
	   He officially set Sept. 27 _ the same day as federal
parliamentary elections _ as the date for the vote in the northern
state.
	   Meanwhile, reform opponents in Bonn said they hoped to persuade
parliament to stop the implementation of the new rules for the
bureaucracy.
	   ``The writing reform may be legally compatible with the
constitution, but politcally it's still completely unnecessary,''
said Guido Westerwelle, general secretary of the Free Democrats
party, on German radio.
	   Officials from Germany, Switzerland and Austria agreed on the
reform in 1996, saying it would simplify the language. The rules
are to take effect Aug. 1, although some schools have already
started teaching them.
	   Opponents, including leading authors and many ordinary Germans,
sought to block the reform in Germany, but the Federal
Constitutional Court ruled Tuesday that the changes were relatively
minor and the states were within their rights in imposing them.

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Patricio Aylwin, the centrist political
leader who restored civilian rule in Chile after the long military
dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, remained hospitalized
Wednesday and doctors diagnosed an acute gastritis.
	   Aylwin, who ruled from 1990 to 1994, was admitted the day before
at the private Las Condes Clinic, and was still undergoing tests
today.
	   The clinic said the 79-year-old former president ``had a very
good night sleep'' and was expected to be released later today or
Thursday morning.
	   Aylwin, a leading figure in the opposition to Pinochet's 1973-90
dictatorship, won a landslide victory in the open election Pinochet
was forced to call after he lost a referendum in which he sought to
extend his rule until 1998.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ An international ring smuggled 500 tons of
powdered milk from the Czech Republic into Greece and sold it at
higher European Union prices, anti-fraud authorities charged
Wednesday.
	   The smuggling ring allegedly brought truckloads of powdered milk
into Greece in 1993 and 1994. Without paying EU duties, the ring
then shipped the powdered milk to Belgium packaged as a Greek
product, which carried a higher price than if produced by a non-EU
nation such as the Czech Republic, investigators claimed.
	   Greek and EU economic crime officials accused Argoxym, a Greek
company, and two Belgian companies, African Trade and Verkooven, of
links to the alleged scam.
	   The smugglers have been charged with fraud and forging customs
documents.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's foreign minister, known more as a
consensus-builder than a leader, emerged Wednesday as the ruling
party's favorite to replace the prime minister brought down by
voter anger over failures to fix the economy.
	   A decision by the Liberal Democratic Party is not expected until
next Tuesday, but party leaders were busy meeting behind closed
doors to discuss a successor to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   Hashimoto's announcement Monday that he was resigning over the
party's crushing defeat in weekend elections left a power vacuum as
the Liberal Democrats struggled to restore trust in their ability
to lead Japan out of recession.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi became the clear front-runner
Wednesday after he gained the endorsement of his political faction
_ the largest in the LDP _ and a prominent rival appeared to step
aside in his favor.
	   Analysts say, however, that his wooden personality and prominent
role in Hashimoto's Cabinet could make him an unpopular choice with
the disgruntled Japanese public.
	   There are also concerns that Obuchi's lack of economic expertise
and his reputation as an old-guard politician would do little to
win confidence in financial markets.
	   In the last three days, Japanese stock prices have been rising
on the theory that the election results would jolt any successor
into taking more aggressive action to pull the economy out of its
slump. Tokyo's main stock index gained 0.76 percent Wednesday.
	   Gains have been limited, however, by nagging worries that
economic policy will be held hostage to the same type of political
haggling that dogged the outgoing administration.
	   Former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, tipped as a
leading contender, did not oppose Obuchi's candidacy at a meeting
of LDP politicians Wednesday and Japanese newspapers took that as a
sign that he was taking himself out of the running.
	   The national broadcaster NHK reported that another influential
LDP faction had also thrown its support behind Obuchi.
	   The party was expected to schedule a vote of its lawmakers in
both houses of Parliament to formally select a new party head next
Tuesday. A vote in Parliament, likely before the end of the month,
then would be held to choose the prime minister.
	   While the conservative ruling party suffered a setback in
Sunday's elections for the upper house of Parliament, it still
enjoys control over the Cabinet because it has a comfortable
majority in the more powerful lower house. That means its party
president is assured of becoming prime minister.
	   In recent days, the LDP has appeared torn between calls for a
fresh face in the wake of its defeat at the polls, a desire to
nominate a veteran politician with a proven track record and a
tradition for reaching a broad consensus on its leadership.
	   Younger generation LDP members reportedly favor Health Minister
Junichiro Koizumi, a party maverick who has called for radical
economic reform measures such as privatizing the postal ministry.
	   Koizumi said Wednesday he would wait and see if he has a chance
of winning before deciding on whether to enter the race, the
mass-circulation Asahi Shimbun reported.
	   Another possibility is Yohei Kono, the only former party head
who has yet to serve as prime minister, but analysts say that he
lacks the political clout to take on the post.
	   Critics have urged the party to be open in its selection of a
new premier.
	   ``A debate (on succession) which evokes the people's sympathy
will restore confidence in the Liberal Democratic Party, but such
trust is not born in smoky back rooms,'' the newspaper Mainichi
said in an editorial published Wednesday.

Thousands celebrate peace accord in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Beating drums and waving banners,
nearly 25,000 people flocked into a soccer stadium Wednesday in a
show of support for a controversial peace accord that ended two
decades of bush war in southeastern Bangladesh last year.
	   ``Peace has now returned to the southeastern hills,'' Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina, who signed the accord with tribal rebels in
December last year, told the cheering crowd at the rainsoaked Dhaka
stadium.
	   The belated celebration was seen as a show of strength amid
rising protests over the accord by the country's main opposition
parties, which accuse the government of conceding too much to the
rebels.
	   Last month, several thousand opposition activists held a protest
march in the hills and at least 100 people were injured in clashes
with Hasina's supporters who tried to block the march.
	   At Wednesday's rally, Hasina said tribal people _ two-thirds of
the region's population _ could not be left out of the mainstream
of national development.
	   The accord allows the mostly Buddhist tribespeople to govern the
country's Chittagong Hill Tracts, a resource-rich region 110 miles
(176 kilometers) southeast of Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital.
	   The insurgency began after thousands of Muslims migrated to the
region from overcrowded plains and grabbed land from the tribals,
who are mostly Buddhist Chakmas. The resulting bush war left 20,000
people dead.
	   Nearly 2,000 rebels have surrendered and are preparing to form a
council to control the region's administration and development.

EU opens inquiry into state aid to Italian postal sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission said Wednesday it will open an investigation into aid
the Italian government may have granted to the national postal
operator over the past 30 years.
	   ``Aid appears to have been granted in various forms over the
past years,'' the Commission said in a statement.
	   It said the Italian government may have given Ente Poste more
than 40 trillion lire (around dlrs 22 billion) over the past 30
years.
	   ``Ente Poste has no analytical accounting system which would
allow to separate the costs and revenues of reserved and
competitive activities respectively, the Commission said.
	   It said that part of the aid may be compatible with the EU's
rules on state aid. The Commission can veto state aid plans it
judges hinder fair competition rules in the EU.

	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ State prosecutors dropped treason charges
against a
	   businessman they had accused of bankrolling a coup attempt last
year.
	   Rajan Mahtani, a Zambian of Asian descent, was arrested last
month and pleaded innocent to involvement in the Oct. 28 revolt by
junior army officers.
	   Prosecutor Suzgo Munthali said the state had insufficient
evidence linking Mahtani in the plot to Princess Nakatindi Wina, a
ruling party official on trial for alleged involvement. The two
became friends and business associates after Mahtani made large
donations to ruling party election campaigns.
	   Wina, a tribal princess, is one of two politicians on trial. A
total of 77 soldiers are accused of carrying out the coup attempt.
	   Judge Japhet Banda heard Tuesday how mutineers entered the home
of army commander Gen. Nobby Simbeye during their revolt.
	   Simbeye fled over a garden wall, but the mutineers allegedly
poured beer over his wife Kina after looting food and liquor in the
house.

	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Heavy rains have triggered another
round of flooding in southern Somalia, displacing at least 400
people, a local humanitarian agency said Wednesday.
	   Mohammed Dahie Fidow of the Al-Hijra Welfare and Development
Organization said the rains have caused the Shabelle River to burst
its banks 30 kilometers south of Mogadishu.
	   He said flood waters between 1.5 and 1.8 meters deep cover 11
villages.
	   The rains began earlier in the week.
	   Late last year, heavy rains attributed to the El Nino weather
phenomenon caused flooding in southern Somalia in which an
estimated 2,000 people and 35,000 head of livestock perished and
crops were destroyed.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Instant marriages were made available at
the Harare magistrates' courts after complaints couples had to wait
more than five months to take their wedding vows.
	   Some couples on the waiting list even broke up before they could
get to a
	   civil wedding ceremony.
	   Provincial magistrate Pheineas Chipokoteke said the backlog of
weddings forced the justice ministry to appoint a magistrate as
full-time marriage officer at the courts.
	   Couples could now marry ``as soon as they walk in and as long as
they meet the necessary requirements,'' he said Tuesday.
	   In the past, civil weddings were conducted for only a few hours
a week and Fridays were usually overbooked.
	   ------
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Ten taxi drivers have been arrested for
violence, and police began escorting public buses across the
country as a taxi strike entered its third day Wednesday.
	   Taxi drivers have said they will not return to work unless the
bill to crack down on driving violations is rescinded.
	   The government hired buses, mini-buses and trucks to offer free
transport
	   for thousands stranded by the strike.
	   The strike began Monday to protest legislation proposed by
Transport Minister John Nasasira to levy hefty fines on drivers who
run over and kill pedestrians or pack too many passengers in their
vehicles.
	   The government-owned New Vision newspaper said 10 taxi drivers
were arrested Tuesday in the town of Mbale, 250 kilometers (155
miles) east of Kampala, after they attacked motorcycles that were
carrying passengers.
	   ------
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ Swaziland's King Mswati III has called
for traditional healing methods to play a greater part in medical
services.
	   Speaking at the opening of a ministerial conference on AIDS,
tuberculosis and malaria, Mswati advocated the use of traditional
African means for dealing with diseases to complement modern ones.
	   Mswati is known to consult traditional and modern doctors when
needed, Network Radio News reported on Wednesday.
	   He said it was tragic that traditional means of healing and
health care were no longer passed on from one generation to the
next.

Judges refuses to withdraw despite charges of improprieties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two final grafs, sentencing postponed to
Thursday, fresh quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In a scandal mesmerizing Israelis, a
judge on Wednesday rejected a defense motion that he withdraw from
a high-profile treason trial because he allegedly had a ``close,
intensive'' relationship with a young lawyer in the case.
	   Judge Amnon Straschnov said he would go ahead with passing
sentence on Nachum Manbar, an Israeli businessman convicted last
month of selling dlrs 16 million worth of chemical weapons
materials to Iran. Manbar faces life in prison.
	   The saga broke Tuesday when the Supreme Court lifted a news
blackout, and quickly snowballed with allegations that Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the case with the judge in a
violation of proper conduct rules. Netanyahu vehemently denied
having been in touch with Straschnov. The judge said he last spoke
to the prime minister 18 months ago in a public forum _ before
Manbar's arrest _ and had not been in touch with the Netanyahu or
his advisers since then.
	   Israeli media were consumed by the tale. Two mass circulation
dailies, Yedioth Ahronot and Maariv, each dedicated their first 13
pages to the affair. A story about the U.S. peace initiative,
normally frontpage material, was pushed to page 15 of Yediot.
	   At the center of the intrigue is Pninat Yanai, 26, who worked as
an apprentice lawyer for Straschnov before being hired by Manbar's
lead defense attorney, Amnon Zichroni.
	   On Tuesday, Zichroni alleged that Yanai had secretly maintained
a ``close, intensive and personal'' relationship with Straschnov
during the trial and passed confidential material to him. Yanai was
later fired from the defense team.
	   Zichroni said Yanai also had close, personal relationships with
a Netanyahu spokesman, Shai Bazak, and with an agent of the Shin
Bet security services who led the investigation of Manbar.
	   Yanai countered that Zichroni hired her for the Manbar trial
because he wanted to exploit her previous professional relationship
with the judge. She also said the was the victim of a personal
vendetta by her former boyfriend, Ziv Chen, who was the key source
of the allegations against her.
	   At the start of Wednesday's sentencing session in the Manbar
trial, Zichroni demanded that Straschnov withdraw from the case.
	   The judge responded that the allegations of improper conduct are
``interesting and imaginative, but have no basis in truth.''
	   ``The attempt to disgrace the judge has failed,'' Straschnov
said. He denied having had any contact with Yanai outside the
courtroom or having discussed the case with her.
	   Zichroni said he would appeal Straschnov's decision. The judge,
in turn, turned down a defense request to suspend sentencing
pending the outcome of the appeal.
	   Devora Chen, the state prosecutor in the Manbar trial, accused
Zichroni of trying to intimidate the court. ``I call on the court
not to capitulate to such pressure. Today, the legal system is
being tested,'' said Chen.
	   Sentencing was scheduled for Wednesday but was postponed until
Thursday after lengthy arguments by both sides. Part of the hearing
was held behind closed doors.
	   An emotional Manbar, choked with tears, pleaded for leniency in
sentencing. ``I made a mistake. Don't take away my chance to bring
up my children,'' he said in court. Chen asked the court to
consider a life sentence for Manbar's crimes.

Policeman took riot photos that angered Malaysian government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A police photographer supplied
riot photos that angered the Malaysian government when they found
their way into the foreign press, a police spokesman said
Wednesday.
	   The rioting March 26 at a camp for illegal immigrants left three
detainees and a policeman dead. The riots, touched off by
government plans for massive deportation of Indonesian illegal
immgrants, received wide international coverage.
	   Investigations into how the photos got out still are under way
and police will be firm in dealing with the matter, police
spokesman Ghazali Mohd Amin said in a statement.
	   ``This is an irresponsible and selfish act,'' he said.
	   He said police investigations reveal that the police
photographer supplied the photos to a local journalist who later
distributed them to the foreign press.
	   Ghazali, however, gave no further details and did not say what
action would be taken against the police photographer.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The Finance Ministry has accused former
Premier Tansu Ciller of tax evasion and fraud, the Anatolia news
agency said Wednesday.
	   Mrs. Ciller is accused of transferring dlrs 925,000 to the
United States in 1993 and accumulating dlrs 1.6 million through
unpaid taxes since she became a Cabinet Minister in 1991, the
semi-official news agency said.
	   A parliamentary commission also has been investigating Mrs.
Ciller's wealth in Turkey and the United States, and is expected to
conclude its probe in August. It could ask the legislative body to
lift the immunity she now enjoys as a lawmaker, to pave the way for
her prosecution.
	   Mrs. Ciller's husband Ozer Ciller, who himself faces court cases
for alleged irregularities in the accumulation of the family
wealth, denied the Finance Ministry's accusations.
	   ``We have declared everything we own, even down to the watch
around my wrist,'' Ozer Ciller said in a statement Wednesday.

Earnings at Japan's top brokerages hurt by weak stock market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Profits shrank at Japan's top two brokerages in
this fiscal year's first quarter, while the country's third largest
securities house posted losses for the third straight quarter, the
companies said Wednesday.
	   Nomura Securities Co., Japan's biggest brokerage, reported a 58
percent year-on-year fall in unconsolidated pretax profit to 14.79
billion yen (dlrs 105.15 million) in the quarter ended June 30.
	   Daiwa Securities Co. said its unconsolidated pretax profit for
the quarter tumbled 84 percent to 2.40 billion yen (dlrs 17.06
million).
	   Japan's No. 3 brokerage, Nikko Securities Co., said it suffered
7.39 billion yen (dlrs 52.53 million) in unconsolidated pretax
losses, compared to a 1.93 billion yen loss (dlrs 13.72 million) in
the same quarter a year earlier.
	   The companies blamed their poor results on weakness in the stock
market, which cut into brokerage commissions. Market liberalization
also caused commission fees to fall, hurting earnings.
	   Nomura said that when the benchmark Nikkei index fell as low as
14,715 points in the middle of June, daily turnover in value terms
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was off an average of 20 percent from a
year earlier.
	   The index closed Wednesday at 16,614.14.
	   Nikko said that it expects to start posting profits in the
July-September quarter. The brokerage's planned tie-up with U.S.
financial giant Travelers Group Inc. will help increase employee
morale and attract customers, the company said.

	   CHOLET, France (AP) - Jeroen Blijlevens of the Netherlands took
the fourth stage sprint finish but intermediate sprints allowed
Stuart O'Grady of Australia to gain the overall lead in the Tour de
France Wednesday.
	   O'Grady won a pair of intermediate sprints worth 12 bonus
seconds each during the day to gain the yellow jersey, emblematic
of first overall. He became the second Australian to lead the
cycling race.
	   Phil Anderson had the yellow jersey at various times in four
different Tours in 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1985.
	   It came down to another sprint finish in the fourth stage from
Plouay to Cholet, 252 kilometers (127 miles), the longest stage of
this year's Tour.
	   It took more than 5 hours and 45 minutes of riding on the day
and a fall in the middle of the pack around a tight left-hand
corner less that 3 kilometers (2 miles) from the finish cut the
pack in two, eliminating a few of the top sprinters.
	   Blijlevens won the sprint for his fourth individual stage
victory. Second was Italian Nicola Minali with Czech Jan Svorada
third.
	   Bo Hamburger had the yellow jersey entering the day, just two
seconds ahead of George Hincapie, the American cycling champion
from Charlotte, North Carolina.
	   Yet O'Grady, with the help of the bonus seconds, became the
fourth rider to hold the yellow jersey in the five days of racing.
	   O'Grady's lead was especially sweet for the GAN team after Chris
Boardman, who won the prologue and held the yellow jersey for a
day,y crashed out on Monday. He is recovering from a concussion and
cuts and bruises.
	   Thursday' fifth stage is from from Cholet to Chateauroux, 228
kilometers (142 miles), moving slightly eastward towards the center
of the France.
	   The Tour's drug controversy continued with Festina's main
sponsors, the watch company of Festina, threatening to break its
contract with the team if there is any evidence of drug use among
the riders.
	   Last week a Belgian member of Festina's team was arrested after
police found a large quantity of performance enhancing drugs in the
Festina car he was driving.
	   According to judicial sources, after first admitting the drugs
were for his personal use, the man charged said that he was under
orders.
	   Late Tuesday the Festina team issued a statement saying they
were astonished at recent press stories saying the man charged has
changed his version of things.
	   Festina officials denied those accusations and said that they
had hired two lawyers to protect their image and riders.

Russian parliament ducks debate on bailout package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with parliament voting on only a
fraction of the government' austerity plan. CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN IAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The hard-line parliament held a special session
Wednesday to debate President Boris Yeltsin's economic austerity
plan, but legislators managed to vote on only five measures and
spent the rest of the day on unrelated business.
	   The government's plan contained more than 20 proposals, and
parliament's verdict on it could determine whether international
lenders proceed promptly with a huge bailout package for Russia.
	   Sixteen economic measures were debated by lawmakers in the State
Duma, parliament's lower house, but only five came to a vote. They
were passed on a second reading and will become law only after a
third reading.
	   Russia is in urgent need of cash, and it reached tentative
agreement Monday for dlrs 17.1 billion in new loans to help
stabilize financial markets that have been in a tailspin for
months.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov attended Wednesday's session
to explain the bailout plan and told lawmakers that the loans were
granted on extremely good terms, with annual interest rates of 4.6
to 4.8 percent. Better terms ``do not exist,'' he said.
	   Zadornov said he hoped parliament would pass the entire economic
plan, but said the government had fallback plans if the package is
not approved.
	   ``If the State Duma passes the package of the government draft
laws not as a whole, there are presidential and governmental powers
to deal with the contingency,'' he said.
	   He did not elaborate, but presumably was suggesting the
government could act by decree.
	   Alexander Shokhin, leader of a pro-government faction of
parliament, said Duma committees and factions had compromised on
the wording of many of the government's measures in recent days.
	   ``This gives cause to believe that some of the most complex
laws, such as the sales tax and imputed income tax, will be voted
on,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``We shall
be working not only today and tomorrow, but also on Friday.''
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders will be
reluctant to hand over the money if Russia does not deal with
chronic financial problems, such as a bloated state budget and a
porous tax collection system.
	   But Communist lawmakers and other opponents have been resisting
spending cuts and tax increases.
	   The bailout loans are designed to calm financial markets, stave
off a devaluation of the Russian currency and restore confidence
among investors who have been fleeing the country.
	   The stock market, which has lost more than half its value this
year, soared by about 25 percent on Monday and Tuesday in response
to the loan agreement, but slowed Wednesday, showing only a modest
2 percent gain.
	   The proposed loans are to come from three sources: the IMF, the
World Bank and the Japanese government. When combined with
already-negotiated loans, the package totals dlrs 22.6 billion
spread over this year and next.
	   The IMF board meets in Washington on Monday to review the loan
agreement, and it could send dlrs 5 billion or more to Russia as
soon as next week.

Colombian rebels say they will seek peace talks with government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with results of talks &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ Colombia's second-largest rebel group said
Wednesday it would pursue peace talks with the government and
agreed to continue negotiations with civic leaders toward ending 34
years of civil war.
	   Rebels with the National Liberation Army, known by its initials
ELN, signed an agreement with Colombian business and labor leaders
after four days of secretive talks in a Roman Catholic cloister in
the southern state of Bavaria.
	   The civic leaders agreed to try to meet with Colombia's biggest
rebel group _ the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC _
and to arrange a ``convention'' that would include the government,
rebels and civic delegates by Oct. 12.
	   The negotiations came short of their goal of arranging direct
peace talks with President-elect Andres Pastrana on ending Latin
America's longest-running war.
	   ``The conflict is not over. We will continue to be the state
where the state does not reach,'' Pablo Beltran, the leader of the
leftist ELN said at a press conference in Mainz.
	   But in what seemed to be a gesture toward reconciliation,
Beltran appeared in public Wednesday for the first time without
wearing a mask.
	   He said at the news conference that his group would seek talks
with the government; that was not part of the written agreement,
which said only that the rebels would continue dialogue with the
civil delegates.
	   Colombian delegates were optimistic nonetheless: ``The winds of
peace are blowing through Colombia,'' said Sabas Pretelt, the head
of a leading Colombian industry group.
	   Talks with the 5,000-member ELN came after president-elect
Pastrana made overtures for talks toward the FARC rebels. The two
events combined have raised hopes of an end to the civil war.
	   The ELN also took small steps toward ending its campaign to end
what it calls foreign exploitation of Colombia's natural resources.
	   The rebels agreed to cease kidnapping minors, the elderly and
pregnant women for ransom. It agreed to stop kidnapping altogether
if it can find another source of income. Delegates and rebels did
not specify what that source might be.
	   ``There were considerable differences with the ELN commanders
during these meetings. But there was harmony,'' said Jaime Bernal
Cuellar, Colombia's attorney general.
	   The Colombian civic delegation met with ELN representatives at
the Himmelspforten cloister in the town of Wuerzburg, on the Main
River. The Catholic Bishops' Conference, which helped coordinate
the meetings, insisted the talks remain as closed.

Spanish judge shuts down Basque newspaper and radio
</HEADLINE>

and paper's circulation. No pick up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A judge probing fundraising activities for
the armed Basque separatist group ETA shut down a newspaper and a
radio station linked to the outlawed organization Wednesday.
	   In a crackdown on the firm that owns the news outlets, police
arrested 11 people in a series of pre-dawn raids around the Basque
country and in the neighboring Navarra region.
	   The detainees are current or former board members of Orain S.A.,
the parent company of the Basque daily Egin and the radio station
Egin Irratia.
	   Police searched Egin's offices in the towns of Hernani, Bilbao,
Vitoria and Pamplona, as well as the detainees' homes and the
headquarters of Orain, officials said.
	   National Court Judge Baltasar Garzon later issued an order
closing down Egin and Egin Irratia, Interior Minister Jaime Mayor
Oreja told a press conference.
	   The minister said there were ``close links and stable contacts''
between Orain and ETA, which has been fighting to create an
independent Basque homeland since 1968. Its bombings and other
attacks have killed nearly 800 people.
	   In Hernani, where Egin has its main office, Orain's personnel
director Tomas Arrizabalaga said police had disabled the paper's
printing press.
	   Waving a copy of Egin, Arrizabalaga said: ``This is a historic
Egin because it will probably be some time before the paper is
published again.''
	   A private press monitoring group says Egin has a daily
circulation of about 52,000.

Orangemen settle in for long siege at Drumcree

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more than 20 arrests, details on weapons seized
by police, comment from Blair
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police moved into the fields
near Drumcree Anglican church Wednesday, arresting more than 20
people and searching for explosives after another violent standoff
with frustrated Orange Order marchers.
	   About 300 people massed at a police barrier overnight, and some
threw bombs and fireworks at police and soldiers. Police said one
man appeared to have a handgun but no shots were fired. No injuries
were reported.
	   Three adults and a juvenile were charged with offenses including
criminal damage, obstruction and riotous behavior in connection
with the disturbances at Drumcree, police said. A spokeswoman at
regional police headquarters in Armagh City, speaking on condition
of anonymity, declined to say exactly how many people were
arrested.
	   Among the items seized by police were two crossbows, five
slingshots, fireworks, five gallons (about 20 liters) of fuel,
balaclavas, fireworks and two spent 9mm cartridges.
	   Officers made no move to eject members of the Orange Order who
have said they will stay at Drumcree until they are permitted to
march through a Catholic neighborhood.
	   In the House of Commons in London, Prime Minister Tony Blair
praised the police and called for negotiations to end the standoff.
	   ``With a bit of goodwill and dialogue we can find a way 'round
this, so that people can have their right to march, but at the same
time do it in a way that is peaceful, unprovocative and where local
residents' dignity is respected as well,'' Blair said.

BayStars beat Giants 13-12
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Toshio Haru singled home the winning run in the
bottom of the ninth as the Central League's front-running Yokohama
BayStars edged the Yomiuri Giants 13-12 at Yokohama Wednesday.
	   The BayStars and the Giants each rapped out 20 hits, including
three homers by the Giants and two by the BayStars. League leader
Hideki Matsui of the Giants hit his 20th homer of the season in the
seventh inning.
	   In the bottom of the ninth, Takashi Manei singled, advanced to
second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Haru's hit.
	   The BayStars are five games ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons, who lost 5-3 to the Hiroshima Toyo Carp at Hiroshima.
	   Itsuki Asahi of the Carp hit a two-run home run in the second
inning and teammate Terunobu Seto drove in a run in the three-run
third with an infield hit.
	   Asahi has four homers.
	   At Tokyo's Jingu Stadium, Tomohito Itoh (3-6) gave up only one
hit _ Tsuyoshi Shinjo's second homer of the season _ and the Yakult
Swallows beat the Hanshin Tigers 5-1.
	   In the Pacific League, the front-running Nippon Ham Fighters and
the Orix BlueWave tied 4-4 in 12 innings at Tokyo Dome. Twelve
innings is the Pacific League limit for regular-season games.
	   The Fighters led 4-1 on Katsuhiro Nishiura's solo home run and
Toshihiro Noguchi's two-run shot in the sixth inning.
	   But the BlueWave tied 4-4 on Troy Neel's home run in the seventh
and pinch hitter Yasutaka Hironaga's one-run single in the two-run
eighth.
	   Nishiura has 17 homers, Noguchi 7 homers and Neel, formerly with
the Oakland Athletics, 11.
	   The Fighters are 7 1/2 games ahead of the Seibu Lions, who moved
into second place by beating the Kintetsu Buffaloes 5-2 at Seibu
Dome.
	   Domingo Martinez smashed a two-run home run against Rob Mattson
in the five-run fifth inning.
	   Martinez, formerly with the Triple-A Rochester team, has 19
homers and shares the league lead with the Fighters' Jerry Brooks,
formerly with the Florida Marlins.
	   Mattson, formerly with a Mexican League team, gave up nine hits
over five innings and took the loss. He is 2-1.
	   At Fukuoka Dome, Kenji Jojima hit a three-run home run in the
eighth as the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks beat the Chiba Lotte Marines 5-2.
	   Jojima has 12 homers.

Iraq, Syria to build new oil pipeline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has signed an agreement with Syria to
build a second oil pipeline between the two countries, the official
Iraqi News Agency said Wednesday.
	   The agreement was signed Tuesday in Damascus during the
three-day visit of Iraq's oil minister, Amer Mohammed Rashid, INA
said.
	   It quoted Rashid, who returned to Baghdad Wednesday, as saying
that the new pipeline will have more capacity that the first one,
which can carry 1.4 million barrels a day.
	   INA said work on the pipeline will start soon, but gave no
details or say how much it will cost. The route that the pipeline
will take also was not disclosed.
	   INA said Syria and Iraq also agreed during Rashid's visit to
reopen the first line, which has remained closed since 1982 when
Syria decided to side with Iran during the Iran-Iraq war of
1980-88.
	   The pipeline joins Iraq's oil fields of Kirkuk in northern Iraq
to Banias port in Syria. INA quoted Rashid as saying that it will
reopen after repairs.
	   Rashid said ``it will be ready within a short time'' but gave no
specific date for the reopening.

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - Burial sites containing the remains of
some 700 French soldiers captured by the Nazis during World War II
have been found on the Lithuanian coast, the Baltic News Service
reported on Wednesday.
	   One of the sites is near the resort town of Nida and the other
close to the port city of Klaipeda, the report said, citing the
Lithuanian Culture Ministry.
	   The ministry said it would take measures to protect the sites
while they were being excavated.
	   The report did not specify when the discovery was made.
	   Lithuania was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1944.

EIB lends dlrs 250 million to Banque Nationale de Paris
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Investment Bank said
Wednesday it had made two loans totaling 1.5 billion francs (dlrs
250 million) to France's Banque Nationale de Paris to support
private enterprise.
	   The funds will help support small-and-medium-sized companies
working in industry, services, energy or the environment, in France
or in any of the other 14 European Union countries, the EU's
lending arm said in a statement.
	   BNP's French network will draw 1 billion francs (dlrs 160
million) to provide medium-term loans for investment by SMEs, the
statement said.
	   The second loan will be deployed by BNP Lease and its
subsidiaries. This group arranges leasing facilities, medium-term
loans and leasing finance in support of ventures by SMEs and local
authorities.
	   The second loan may also be used to help fund health-related
projects, the EIB said.
	   The EIB was set up in 1958 to raise funds on capital markets and
finance investments in areas such as development of poorer regions,
trans-European transport, telecoms and energy networks, and
environmental protection.

Chinese police capture sought-after dissident

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police on Wednesday captured a democracy
campaigner on the run for five days since nine fellow members of an
illegal political party were rounded up, a rights group reported.
	   Police were waiting for Lin Hui when he showed up Wednesday
morning for his temporary job at a chemical plant outside eastern
Wenzhou city, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement reported.
	   Lin was in Hangzhou city, 250 kilometers (150 miles) to the
north, when police rounded up eight colleagues of the China
Democracy Party on Friday, the group said. A ninth party organizer
was arrested the same day in another city.
	   With Lin's capture, five party members are in custody. Three of
them have been formally charged, a step usually taken before
prosecution or sentence without trial to a labor camp.
	   The crackdown on the party marks the most concerted police
action against a dissident group in several years. Authorities have
refused to register the party, and police have pressured the
employers of at least one released member, the Information Center
said.
	   In a challenge to the ruling Communist Party's political
monopoly, Lin and two of those now under arrest _ Wang Youcai and
Wang Donghai _ announced the China Democracy Party's formation on
June 25, the day U.S. President Bill Clinton began his nine-day
China visit.
	   The wives of Wang Donghai and one of the other detainees, Zhu
Zhengming, asked Hangzhou police Wednesday for information on their
cases. Police said the two were under ``residential supervision''
but refused to say where. They also turned down the wives' requests
to give their husbands fresh clothes, the Information Center said.
	   One of the five released party members, Wang Qiang, was fired
Tuesday from his job as a security guard at the Wanxiang Hotel in
Hangzhou, the Information Center and the New York-based Human
Rights in China said.
	   The Information Center said the hotel was acting under orders
from Hangzhou police.
	   But Shen Lixiang, office director at the three-star hotel,
denied the reports and insisted Wang had not been fired. He
admitted he asked Wang to explain in writing why he missed work for
two days.
	   ``Everything was resolved,'' Shen said by telephone. ``He is
still working here.''
	   Human Rights in China said it had been hard for Wang, who served
2 1/2 years in prison for taking part in democracy protests in
1989, to get his one-year contract at the hotel.
	   Companies and state-run offices frequently shun dissidents,
especially those with prison records, often making it hard for them
to find steady jobs.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat left Beijing
Wednesday armed with promises of financial backing and moral
support for the Middle East peace process.
	   Arafat said he held ``very important'' talks with Chinese
leaders and signed agreements for Chinese financial support for his
Palestinian government. He gave no details on the agreements and it
was unclear whether the Chinese committed fixed sums of aid or
investment.
	   China had an important role to play in ``pushing forward the
peace process and to protect the peace process'' in the Middle
East, Arafat said in a news conference before ending his three-day
stay in China.
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan reaffirmed Chinese support
Wednesday, quoting Arafat an ancient saying: ``A just cause gains
abundant support,'' the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   On Tuesday, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji told Arafat Chinese
businesses would invest in a Palestinian state. Zhu also described
Israel's delay in withdrawing from the West Bank as ``wrong'' and
said negotiations should be held on the basis of land for peace.
	   Despite supporting the Palestinians, Beijing would never be a
moderator in the Middle East peace talks, Zhu said.
	   Arafat also met top officials including President Jiang Zemin,
who told him China supported the establishment of a Palestinian
state and would use its seat on the United Nations Security Council
to push the peace process forward.
	   Arafat accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
blocking the peace process and of not carrying out commitments made
in accords signed in 1993 and 1995 in Oslo.
	   ``The aim of this Israeli government is to abrogate the
agreements, annex Jerusalem'' and turn it into a Jewish city,
Arafat said, condemning recent Israeli moves to make Jewish suburbs
part of Jerusalem and thereby ensure a Jewish majority.
	   He said he raised plans with China for a summit of Arab nations
to discuss the peace process and support for the Palestinian
authority.
	   Arafat is seeking international support for his effort to
establish a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and East
Jerusalem.
	   Netanyahu's government has stalled on withdrawing troops. Israel
has refused a U.S. compromise that would link a pull-back from 13
percent of the West Bank with corresponding security gestures from
the Palestinians. Arafat supports that initiative.
	   China has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause
but over the past decade has developed good diplomatic and strong
economic ties with Israel.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe Wednesday started talks with
Yugoslav officials, in the newest international effort to resolve
the Serb-Albanian crisis in Kosovo province.
	   But an ethnic Albanian politician in Pristina, the Kosovo
capital, said the mission of the OSCE to Yugoslavia comes too late.
	   Hansjoerg Eiff, a German diplomat, said after meeting Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic that ``we came to talk about all
aspects of relations between OSCE and Yugoslavia.''
	   According to Yugoslav media, Eiff, who spoke in Serbian, said he
hoped OSCE will set up permanent missions in Kosovo, the Muslim
Serbian area of Sandzak and Vojvodina, a region with a large
Hungarian minority.
	   Eiff also said OSCE would like former Spanish Premier Felipe
Gonzalez to start a mission to mediate in the Kosovo conflict as
soon as possible, but the Yugoslavs' reaction was not immediately
known.
	   Eiff said his group would also talk to other Serbian, Albanian
and Montenegrin officials in Belgrade, Pristina, and Podgorica, the
Montenegro capital.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE and other international
organizations in 1992 for allegedly fomenting ethnic conflict in
Croatia and Bosnia. It has resisted OSCE attempts since then to set
up permanent offices in the country.

Mexico's TMM in 10-year cargo service pact with Allied Domecq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican shipping and multimodal
transportation concern Transportacion Maritima Mexicana says it has
signed a 10-year service contract with Allied Domecq Group.
	   TMM, as the concern is also known, said in a news release
Tuesday the contract covers the shipment of wines, liquors and
other products through its cargo trucking unit Lacto Comercial
Organizado.
	   ``With this strategic alliance TMM expands its land
transportation services to include liquid cargo, a sector of
significant growth,'' said Gerardo Primo, TMM's general director of
land transportation.
	   The distribution alliance will improve operations for the
British-based Domecq, creating savings in administrative,
operational and maintenance expenses, the statement said.
	   Expected revenues for the first year of operations will be of
about dlrs 4 million, TMM said.
	   TMM is Latin America's largest multimodal transportation
concern. Its vessels link 44 countries through 93 ports.
	   The company also has a joint venture with U.S.-based Kansas City
Southern Industries, known as Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana,
which operates the recently privatized Northeast Railway and
handles over 40 percent of the country's rail cargo.

Albert to return as sportscaster with MSG Network
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARV SCHNEIDER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Marv Albert, out of work for nearly a year
because of a sex scandal, will return to sportscasting with the
Madison Square Garden Network, The Associated Press learned
Wednesday.
	   Albert will be the anchor of ``MSG Sports Desk'' and do limited
radio play-by-play of the New York Knicks games, according to an
industry source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   MSG Network, where Albert worked for a major part of his career,
called a news conference for Wednesday to make the announcement.
Albert would be at the news conference, the source said.
	   An official at Madison Square Garden refused to confirm that
Albert was returning to broadcasting.
	   Albert resigned from MSG and was fired by the NBC television
network after pleading guilty Sept. 25 to a misdemeanor assault
charge in a sex case that gained national notoriety. At the time,
Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, did not
rule out Albert's eventual return to the network.
	   Albert spent more than three decades broadcasting the New York
Knicks and Rangers, many of them in the employ of MSG. He also was
the lead basketball announcer for NBC and also did football games
for the network.

Mexico's Telmex flexes muscle, disconnects Avantel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ When Telefonos de Mexico partially
disconnected some major customers of rival Avantel last week, it
did more than illustrate the acrimonious state of affairs between
the two companies.
	   Competitors say the former state monopoly demonstrated how much
power it still wields.
	   Telmex, as the Mexican Stock Exchange benchmark is known, last
Wednesday pulled the plug for several hours on the internal
communication systems of some of Avantel's major commercial
customers. Telmex restored service after Avantel wrote a check for
some disputed charges.
	   Several Telmex competitors, most of whom spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the incident shows how they are at the mercy of
telecommunications giant more than 18 months after Mexico
introduced long-distance competition.
	   Telmex is relied upon to carry calls from competitors'
long-distance calling centers to homes and businesses, what is
known in the industry as ``the last mile.''
	   Many also use Telmex's extensive network to send long-distance
calls to remote areas they can't reach.
	   ``If Telmex can do this to Avantel, they can extinguish me like
a cigarette butt,'' said Gustavo de la Garza, chief executive
officer of Marcatel, a joint venture of IXC Communications Corp.
and Mexico's Radio Beep, with about 60,000 customers. ``They can
plaster me like a cockroach.''
	   Avantel, a joint venture of MCI Communications Corp. and
Mexico's Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, is one of Telmex's major
long-distance competitors, reporting about 800,000 customers.

Airport construction workers charged with corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Four airport workers were charged Wednesday
with bribery and corruption because of shoddy construction of
facilities connected to Hong Kong's new airport railroad, officials
said.
	   Two engineers, one construction foreman and one industrial diver
were charged with covering up the use of substandard materials
during the construction, the Independent Commission Against
Corruption said.
	   Engineers Kwok Chi-hung, 24, Wong Ka-wing, 26, and foreman Leung
Yee-tai, 36, were charged with falsifying measurements and
fabricating delivery statements for concrete to defraud Aoki Corp.
and Ove Arup and Partners Hong Kong Ltd. _ an engineering company
overseeing the project.
	   The commission also said that Lau Yee-lai, a 50-year-old
industrial diver, offered bribes totaling 200,000 Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 25,600) in October 1997 to a building inspector from Ove
Arup and Partners for the inspector not to pursue any inquiries
regarding the falsified statements.
	   The four were the only ones charged among the 17 arrested
Tuesday in connection with the case. They were being detained by
the commission pending court appearances Thursday.
	   The remaining 13 arrested were released on bail.
	   The commission did not disclose the extent of the damage to the
site, but the Mass Transit Railway Corp., which operates the
airport line, said earlier Wednesday that the allegations did not
concern the airport railroad, but adjacent sites.
	   At a legislative meeting Wednesday, the government's secretary
for planning, Bowen Leung, said that although the northwest
extension of the new passenger terminal is under investigation, it
did not mean that the foundation is ``problematic or unsafe.''
	   The corruption case followed a string of problems since the dlrs
20 billion airport opened July 6, and seemed certain to increase
the growing criticism of the airport management and government.
	   New Chek Lap Kok airport replaced Hong Kong's venerable,
downtown Kai Tak airport to great expectations. But it immediately
became ensnared in a series of problems with flight delays,
baggage-handling and airport services.
	   Passenger services since have improved, but the airport still
faces serious problems with its cargo operations.

Ukraine, EBRD seek new donors to fund repairs of Chernobyl
</HEADLINE>
sarcophagus &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development are looking for help to finance
repairs to a leaky sarcophagus covering a reactor at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant, an official said Wednesday.
	   First Deputy Energy Minister Mykhaylo Umanets said EBRD
officials would travel to the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and
Russia to ask for help, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The concrete sarcophagus, hastily built over Chernobyl's reactor
No. 4 after it exploded and caught fire in 1986, has deteriorated
recently.
	   Plant experts warned it might partially collapse if urgent
repairs are not made. They also said there was an increased danger
of fire in the reactor, which contains several thousand tons of
inflammable materials and an unknown amount of nuclear fuel.
	   Ukraine asked Western nations last year to help finance repairs
of the sarcophagus, estimated to cost dlrs 750 million.
	   So far, donors have pledged dlrs 360 million, of which only dlrs
186 million was sent to the EBRD's Chernobyl Shelter Fund,
according to the plant's deputy director Valentyn Kupny.
	   Slow funding forced Ukraine and the EBRD to ask other countries
for help, Umanets said.
	   He said the project was also delayed because of Ukraine's
failure to carry out its part of the work, in particular exempting
the shelter project from taxes.

Australian parliamentary report denounces Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Israel's approach to the Middle East
peace process was denounced Wednesday as short-sighted and a
tragedy in a strongly worded parliamentary report just four weeks
before a visit to Australia by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   The report was made by a parliamentary delegation to Syria,
Lebanon, Jordan and Israel, led by Speaker Ian Sinclair.
	   ``The delegation concluded that the current position adopted by
the Israeli government on the peace process is very
short-sighted,'' the report said.
	   ``The delegation is of the view that the peace process has
entered a critical period which demands timely action.
	   ``The response of the Netanyahu government, however, suggests it
has concluded that delay is to Israel's advantage.''
	   The report warned that Israel was placing its future at risk by
stalling the peace process.
	   It puts pressure on Prime Minister John Howard ahead of his
meeting with Netanyahu next month in Australia.
	   ``The delegation welcomes the prospect of a visit to Australia
by Prime Minister Netanyahu because it would give another
opportunity to express the strong view of the Parliament,
government and people of Australia that an early settlement is
essential and that the present stance of the Israeli government is
not contributing to the achievement of that goal,'' the report
said.
	   The report also attacked Israel's handling of the Maccabiah
Games bridge collapse, which killed four Australian athletes
exactly a year ago.
	   ``The delegation was disappointed with the (Knesset) Speaker's
response that an (parliamentary) inquiry would not be held unless
new evidence came to light,'' it said.
	   ``The delegation is disappointed by the position taken by both
the Knesset and the Israeli government on the issue.''

Iran seeks more investment from Malaysia despite financial crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Iran would like more Malaysian
investment in the construction of refineries and petrochemical
plants, despite Asia's financial crisis, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   Mohsen Aminzadeh, Iran's deputy foreign minister for
Asia-Pacific, said Iran was aware of the economic problems faced by
several Asian countries but believed that Malaysia still would be
able to participate in the development of Iran, the national news
agency Bernama reported.
	   ``The volume of trade is not very high but in view of the
capacity and potential of both sides, I believe that it can move to
a higher level,'' Bernama quoted him as saying.
	   Mohsen, who arrived Tuesday, has met Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad and Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.
	   Mohsen said that apart from oil and gas production, possible
areas for cooperation between the two countries were manufacturing,
power plant construction, telecommunications, electronics and
computers, as well as tourism.
	   ``Iran would like to have more investments in the construction
of refinery and petrochemical plants,'' he added.
	   He said Iran had embarked on a program to establish free trade
zones, which could be further developed with the participation of
Malaysian partners.

Opposition party claimes police involved in attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RICHMOND, South Africa (AP) _ Police illegally fired shots into
the home of an opposition leader in South Africa's troubled KwaZulu
Natal province, a member of the victim's party said Wednesday.
	   Police said they were investigating a break-in that occurred
early Wednesday at Sifiso Nkabinde's shop, which is connected to
his house. Nkabinde, a controversial figure, is national secretary
of the United Democratic Movement. He was ousted from the ruling
African National Congress for allegedly being a police informant
and was recently acquitted of charges that he killed 16 people.
	   Shots were fired at Nkabinde's house but no one was hurt,
according to UDM deputy national secretary Annelize van Wyk.
Nkabinde found a police pager apparently dropped by the assailants
and spent cartridges that are police-issue, Van Wyk said.
	   Witnesses saw the attackers arrive in a police armored vehicle,
said van Wyk, who decried the ``obvious involvement'' of police in
the attack.
	   The government said Tuesday it was sending hundreds of
reinforcements to Richmond, in eastern KwaZulu Natal province, to
try to quell the political violence which has left 23 people dead
since last week.
	   A meeting between rival political parties to end the violence
was canceled Wednesday amid a dispute over who would chair the
gathering.
	   The meeting was to have included local leaders of the ANC, the
UDM and the Inkatha Freedom Party. The ANC walked out amid a
dispute over whether an IFP or ANC official would chair the
meeting.
	   Richmond, 450 kilometers (280 miles) southeast of Johannesburg,
was hard-hit by political violence in the last years of apartheid
and the run-up to the first all-race elections in 1994. More than
10,000 people were killed in the last decade, many in fighting
between ANC and IFP supporters.
	   The new round of violence revolves around a local power struggle
between the ANC and the UDM, a new political party. There are fears
it could escalate as the country moves closer to next year's
elections.

West End theater deemed billion dollar industry

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ London's West End theater is a billion-pound
(dollar) industry, according to a new report released Wednesday by
the Society of London Theater.
	   The Wyndham Report was commissioned over 18 months ago and
tracked every financial aspect of London's extensive theater,
opera, and dance world throughout 1997.
	   The scale of the industry is surprisingly big, said Tony
Travers, the independent London School of Economics researcher who
wrote the report.
	   ``It's all too easy to regard the theater as some kind of bon
bon rather than to see it as a significant industrial sector in its
own right,'' added Travers. ``The truth is, the West End theater is
big business.''
	   Among his findings:
	   _ West End theatergoers spent around dlrs 400 million on tickets
during 1997, as well as another dlrs 700 million on restaurants,
hotels, transport, and merchandise.
	   - Some 41,000 jobs depend on the West End theater.
	   - With 11.5 million seats sold in 1997, the West End attracts
almost three times as many people as greater London's 13 football
teams.
	   - Globally, British shows do better than the most successful
films, the report said. ``The Phantom of the Opera'' has grossed
internationally almost dlrs 3 billion, a figure well beyond that of
``Titanic,'' the highest-grossing movie to date, it said.
	   ``We're the theater capital of the world, economically as well
as culturally,'' said Rupert Rhymes chief executive of the theater
society. If Broadway's revenues outpace those in London, that is
because New York ticket prices are generally one-third again as
expensive as those in London, where theater tickets generally don't
exceed dlrs 55.
	   The theater society, too, includes among its membership such
state-funded organizations as The Royal Opera House and The English
National Opera. Their New York equivalents are not part of
comparable data-gathering in the United States.
	   The last New York report of such scope was published in 1994 by
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
	   The Wyndham Report is named for Sir Charles Wyndham, who founded
the London theater's trade organization in 1908.

Bank security chief shot dead in Kiev
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A security chief for a Ukrainian bank was
fatally shot in the capital Kiev Wednesday in an apparent contract
killing, police said.
	   Volodymyr Kyrylin, of the Geosantris bank, was leaving his
apartment in central Kiev when a gunman fired six shots at him at
close range, Kiev's Interior Ministry department said.
	   No suspects were immediately detained.
	   Geosantris is a relatively small bank, rated 63rd among
Ukrainian banks, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Kyrylin's killing followed the slaying of a Chechen businessman
in Kiev earlier this month.
	   Ukraine's most notorious contract killing was carried out last
April when financier Vadim Hetman, a legislator and chairman of the
former Soviet republic's Interbank Currency Exchange, was killed by
unknown assailants.

Thai law may allow Kanchanalak to escape extradition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Pauline Kanchanalak, the Thai
businesswoman charged with making illegal campaign contributions to
the U.S. Democratic National Committee, could escape extradition
even if she is served with an arrest warrant, a Thai Foreign
Ministry official said Wednesday.
	   Kanchanalak, 47, is believed to be in Thailand, but has not made
a public appearance since her indictment Monday. Efforts by The
Associated Press to contact her have not been successful.
	   Kanchanalak and her sister-in-law and business associate,
Duangnet ``Georgie'' Kronenberg, 41, were charged by a U.S.
District Court in Washington with illegally funneling contributions
of at least dlrs 679,000 to the Democratic National Committee and
other political committees. Kronenberg resides in McLean, Virginia.
	   A bench warrant for her arrest was issued after the indictment.
	   It is not clear whether the crimes they were charged with are
covered by the extradition treaty between Thailand and the United
states, said the Foreign Ministry official, who asked not to be
named.
	   He noted that generally an extraditable offense must be
considered a crime in both countries, and further study was needed
to determine if this was true in the Kanchanalak case.
	   The U.S. Embassy had not yet officially contacted the Thai
government about the possibility of extradition, he said.
	   The 24-count indictment officially charged the pair with
conspiring to impede the Federal Election Commission and cause
false statements to be submitted to it.
	   Kanchanalak, as a Thai citizen, is barred from making financial
contributions for the nomination and election of candidates for
political office in the United States.

English official: South Africa's crime rate could stop World Cup
</HEADLINE>
bid success

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Campaigners for England's bid to host the 2006
soccer World Cup say South Africa's crime rate and need to develop
facilities could prevent it from being a serious rival to stage the
tournament.
	   Campaign director Alex McGiven told reporters in London
Wednesday that if South Africa could convince the world it had
absolutely everything needed to stage the World Cup, the country
would be a strong candidate.
	   ``But it is a question of if _ and I don't think they will be
able to prove their capacity in time to mount the World Cup,'' he
said.
	   McGiven said the negative publicity brought by the actions of
English soccer hooligans in Marseille at the start of the World Cup
in France had been only a minor setback for the bid.
	   He said other countries bidding to host the 2006 tournament had
``problems to overcome.''
	   ``(South Africa) might not have hooligans travelling abroad but
they do have crime statistics that will be looked at,'' he said.
	   ``We are not the only country to suffer from the problem of
hooliganism,'' McGiven added. ``But we will not allow (hooliganism)
to stand in the way of this bid and I think the world of football
will support us on that.''
	   British Sports Minister Tony Banks said England's main
competition was from South Africa despite a bid from Germany and
possible bids by Australia or other African and South American
nations.
	   ``I think you can be fairly certain now that in terms of England
versus Gemany, it's England _ the next thing of course is England
versus South Africa,'' he said.
	   ``I think there's a lot of sympathy for South Africa, as you
would expect, and we would like to see South Africa host a World
Cup, but we don't think 2006 will be the one.
	   ``I think England for 2006.''
	   McGivan said intensive lobbying and meetings with FIFA president
Sepp Blatter had strengthened England's chances of winning the
rights to host the World Cup.
	   England backed Blatter's campaign to become FIFA president,
although Blatter has spoken in favor of the Cup going to Africa.
	   FIFA will not make a decision on the host of the 2006 tournament
until June 2000.
	   England staged the World Cup in 1966, the only time it won the
tournament.

Main cargo handler says facilities fully operational in one month

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with announcement that cargo operation will
be up to full capacity in a month. TRIMS. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's main air cargo handler said
Wednesday it would be another month before operations at the
problem-plagued new airport were up to full capacity. The
government expressed disappointment that it would take so long.
	   Last week, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals had put an embargo on
much of its operations at the new Chek Lap Kok airport to work out
computer and mechanical bugs that overwhelmed its operations
immediately after the airport opened July 6.
	   The embargo was to last until this coming weekend, and many in
Hong Kong hoped that the company could get the system up to full
capacity in that time. Hong Kong is one of the world's busiest air
cargo centers, and officials worry that the territory's reputation
is taking a beating just as it heads into recession.
	   Meanwhile, passenger services have improved slowly but steadily
after a rocky start.
	   The cargo handler said in a statement issued late Wednesday that
it would only be able to reach 50 percent capacity by July 18, 75
percent by the end of July, and full capacity in mid-August.
	   Exempted from the embargo were in-bound perishables, newspapers
and magazines, and lifesaving materials.
	   The company's contract stated the facility must be operational
by Aug. 18, although the company has the responsibility to try its
best to match the opening date, according to Airport Authority
officials.
	   Hong Kong media have estimated that the ban was costing the
territory at least 23 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 2.97
billion).
	   ``HACTL never ever promised to operate at 100 percent capacity
during the opening phase,'' said Janet Middlemiss of Rowland Co.,
which handles the freight company's public relations.
	   Middlemiss said the freight company was currently handling 25
percent of normal capacity, or about 1,400 tons a day.
	   The government, which clearly had been hoping for a faster
improvement, issued a statement expressing its disappointment. It
seemed certain that the delays would mean more criticism for the
government, the Airport Authority, and the cargo handler.
	   The government promised to monitor the situation closely and
offer help to the cargo handler.
	   Earlier Wednesday, a top government official worked out an
agreement with Chinese officials to help clear the cargo backlog.
	   China offered to open up Huangtian airport in Shenzhen, just
across the boundary from Hong Kong, to cargo flights and to
streamline customs procedures.
	   Stephen Ip, Hong Kong's secretary for economic services,
traveled to Shenzhen Wednesday to meet with civil aviation and
customs officials from Beijing as well as Chen Zuo'er, China's
deputy director of Hong Kong and Macau affairs.
	   Legislators were skeptical. ``The public has lost all confidence
in these announcements,'' said Selina Chow of the business-oriented
Liberal Party.
	   The newspaper Hong Kong Standard quoted Xie Feng, spokesman for
Huangtian airport, as saying it could handle 20-30 cargo flights
per day for Hong Kong, or about 2,000-3,000 tons of cargo.
	   Some cargo also has been shipped to Macau, the Portuguese
territory about 70 kilometers (45 miles) from Hong Kong along the
Chinese coast.

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A Polish woman working for the United
Nations in Georgia was shot dead by unidentified attackers at the
entrance to her apartment in the capital Tbilisi, officials said
Wednesday.
	   The killing was not believed to be political, Deputy Interior
Minister Demuri Murguliya said.
	   Also, eight civilians were killed when their horse-drawn cart
hit a landmine in the breakaway province of Abkhazia, news reports
said Wednesday.
	   Abkhazian officials blamed pro-government militants who are
active in the separatist region, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The U.N. worker, Maria Magdalena Wewiorska, 31, was shot at
point-blank range on Tuesday evening, said Maya Musidze, a
spokeswoman for the Georgian Interior Ministry.
	   Murguliya said investigators believe that Wewiorska apparently
came home and startled burglars. U.N. officials said she had
recently moved to Tibilisi and was working as a secretary for the
head of the U.N. mission in Georgia.
	   The U.N. observers are in Georgia to monitor the truce between
government forces and separatists in the northwestern Black Sea
province of Abkhazia. The separatists took control of the province
in a 1992-93 war.

U.S. frustrated as tribunal talks enter final days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Despite weeks of arm-twisting and hardball
diplomacy, the United States still hasn't gotten what it wants from
the U.N. talks on creating a global criminal court.
	   ``We stand on the eve of the conference's conclusion without
having found a solution,'' the head of the U.S. delegation,
Ambassador David Scheffer, acknowledged Wednesday.
	   With Friday's deadline fast approaching, negotiations were hot
and heavy as delegates from 161 countries searched for an
acceptable deal.
	   Their goal is the world's first permanent criminal court, a body
to bring individuals to justice for the most heinous offenses:
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
	   Determined to craft a treaty that would protect its troops
abroad from politically motivated prosecutions, the United States
is insisting on provisions many say would cripple the court.
	   Chief among them is requiring the court to have the consent of
an accused's government. Critics say almost any dictator or war
criminal could use this loophole to escape the court's
jurisdiction.
	   American insistence on limiting the court's power has left it
estranged from scores of its closest allies, democracies like
Britain, Canada and Germany. Their views have so far prevailed on
many issues, to the dismay of U.S. negotiators.
	   Scheffer said Wednesday that he fears the emerging treaty will
be ``unacceptable'' and he warned that the court could be hamstrung
without American muscle and might.
	   ``It will need the cooperation of governments to operate
effectively, but it will not achieve its objectives by ignoring the
legitimate concerns of many governments,'' he said.
	   The United States has lobbied hard on many fronts. American
diplomats around the world have argued the U.S. case, as have top
officials such as Defense Secretary William Cohen.
	   Conference sources say Cohen even went so far as to try and
bully Germany, a proponent of sweeping jurisdiction, by suggesting
the U.S. might pull troops out of Europe if it didn't get its way
in Rome. The Pentagon denied the reports.
	   The United States is not the only country at the conference
intent on limiting the tribunal's scope. A number of countries
widely seen as human rights abusers are openly hostile to the
court.
	   Clearly uncomfortable in such company, members of the U.S.
delegation have repeatedly stressed America's pivotal role in the
ad hoc war crimes tribunals from Nuremberg to Rwanda that gave
birth to the idea of a permanent court.
	   Hostility to the court is especially evident among Arab and
Asian nations.
	   The head of the Egyptian delegation, Ambassador Sayed K. El
Masry, warned Wednesday against a too-powerful court.
	   ``We are hammering on the walls of the sovereignty of states in
a way that has never been done before,'' he told reporters.

China sentences three for corruption, sets up special police force
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE throughout with two other officials
sentenced for bribery, set up of anti-smuggling force, comments by
judge; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A senior judge, a local Communist Party organizer
and a big-city tax collector have all drawn heavy prison terms for
corruption, China's state-media trumpeted Wednesday, in a renewed
campaign against rampant official graft.
	   As part of the widening crackdown, Premier Zhu Rongji announced
the setting up of a special force to combat growing smuggling, a
crime often abetted by officials.
	   The new force and the high-profile prosecutions signal resurgent
efforts in a five-year crackdown against corruption so pervasive
party leaders fear it is undermining their credibility and ability
to govern.
	   Particular emphasis is being placed on purging the graft-ridden
judiciary of corruption to stop decaying confidence in China's
nascent legal system. Chinese leaders have opened most trials to
media coverage. On Saturday, state-run television broadcast a trial
nationwide for the first time.
	   Financed locally, courts are often subjected to interference,
making impartial proceedings difficult, the official Xinhua News
Agency paraphrased Supreme People's Court President Xiao Yang as
saying.
	   ``A few officials in some places do not properly use their power
or even abuse it,'' Xiao was quoted as saying. ``Open trials can
curb or eliminate the interference of such factors as favors, power
and money.''
	   State media gave prominent coverage Wednesday to the fall of one
of the most senior judges caught in the campaign. Pan Yike, vice
president of the Higher People's Court in Guangxi, was sentenced to
15 years in prison for accepting 250,000 yuan (dlrs 30,000) in
bribes.
	   Because of Pan's high rank and influence in Guangxi, his case
was turned over to courts in Beijing, 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) to the north, Xinhua said.
	   China Central Television showed Pan flanked by police standing
before judges in Beijing.
	   Pan accepted a 10 percent stake in a gold-mining company from an
auction house owner who had filed two lawsuits in the judge's
court, Xinhua said. Pan, 58, maintained he had been trying to save
money for his retirement.
	   Xinhua also reported Wednesday on two other convicted officials.
A deputy director in a Tianjin city tax office, Luo Shuangyin,
received a life prison term for embezzling 620,000 yuan (dlrs
75,000) in taxes and seeking 400,000 yuan (dlrs 48,000) in bribes.
	   Tong Genshun, in charge of appointments for the Communist Party
in Zhejiang province's Pingyang County, was sentenced to 13 years
in prison for taking bribes worth 150,000 yuan (dlrs 18,000) plus
another dlrs 800 in U.S. cash.
	   Losses of revenue to the cash-strapped Beijing government
through corruption inspired the crackdown on smuggling, the
People's Daily said in an editorial to be published Thursday and
carried by Xinhua Wednesday night.
	   The new anti-smuggling force will involve police and customs and
business inspectors, Xinhua said. It will have the authority to
arrest suspects and conduct preliminary hearings, and will report
to Premier Zhu's Cabinet, the State Council.

Israeli judge refuses to withdraw despite charges of improprieties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two final grafs, sentencing postponed to
Thursday, fresh quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In a scandal mesmerizing Israelis, a
judge on Wednesday rejected a defense motion that he withdraw from
a high-profile treason trial because he allegedly had a ``close,
intensive'' relationship with a young lawyer in the case.
	   Judge Amnon Straschnov said he would go ahead with passing
sentence later Wednesday on Nachum Manbar, an Israeli businessman
convicted last month of selling dlrs 16 million worth of chemical
weapons materials to Iran. Manbar faces life in prison.
	   The saga broke Tuesday when the Supreme Court lifted a news
blackout, and quickly snowballed with allegations that Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the case with the judge in a
violation of proper conduct rules.
	   Netanyahu vehemently denied having been in touch with
Straschnov. The judge said he last spoke to the prime minister 18
months ago in a public forum.
	   Israeli media were consumed by the tale. Two mass circulation
dailies, Yedioth Ahronot and Maariv, each dedicated their first 13
pages to the affair. A story about the U.S. peace initiative,
normally frontpage material, was pushed to page 15 of Yediot.
	   At the center of the intrigue is Pninat Yanai, 26, who worked as
an apprentice lawyer for Straschnov before being hired by Manbar's
lead defense attorney, Amnon Zichroni.
	   On Tuesday, Zichroni alleged that Yanai had secretly maintained
a ``close, intensive and personal'' relationship with Straschnov
during the trial and passed confidential material to him. Yanai was
later fired from the defense team.
	   Zichroni said Yanai also had close, personal relationships with
a Netanyahu spokesman, Shai Bazak, and with an agent of the Shin
Bet security services who led the investigation of Manbar.
	   Yanai countered that Zichroni hired her for the Manbar trial
because he wanted to exploit her previous professional relationship
with the judge. She also said the was the victim of a personal
vendetta by her former boyfriend, Ziv Chen, who was the key source
of the allegations against her.
	   At the start of Wednesday's sentencing session in the Manbar
trial, Zichroni demanded that Straschnov withdraw from the case.
	   The judge responded that the allegations of improper conduct are
``interesting and imaginative, but have no basis in truth.''
	   ``The attempt to disgrace the judge has failed,'' Straschnov
said. He denied having had any contact with Yanai outside the
courtroom or having discussed the case with her.
	   Zichroni said he would appeal Straschnov's decision. The judge,
in turn, turned down a defense request to suspend sentencing
pending the outcome of the appeal.
	   Devora Chen, the state prosecutor in the Manbar trial, accused
Zichroni of trying to intimidate the court. ``I call on the court
not to capitulate to such pressure. Today, the legal system is
being tested,'' said Chen.
	   Sentencing was scheduled for Wednesday but was postponed until
Thursday after lengthy arguments by both sides. Part of the hearing
was held behind closed doors.
	   An emotional Manbar, choked with tears, pleaded for leniency in
sentencing. ``I made a mistake. Don't take away my chance to bring
up my children,'' he said in court. Chen asked the court to
consider a life sentence for Manbar's crimes.

Colombian rebels say they will seek peace talks with government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with more details &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ Colombia's second-largest rebel group said
Wednesday it would pursue peace talks with the government while
continuing negotiations with civic leaders toward ending 34 years
of civil war.
	   But the leftist National Liberation Army, known by its initials
ELN, said it would not disarm or cede any territory it controls
during the talks.
	   ``The conflict is not over. We will continue to be the state
where the state does not reach,'' ELN leader Pablo Beltran said at
a news conference in Mainz.
	   But in what seemed to be a gesture toward reconciliation,
Beltran appeared in public for the first time without wearing a
mask.
	   The negotiations fell short of their goal of arranging direct
peace talks with Colombian President-elect Andres Pastrana on
ending Latin America's longest-running war.
	   Beltran said his group would seek talks with the government, but
that was not part of the written agreement signed with Colombian
business and labor leaders after four days of secretive talks in a
Catholic cloister in Bavaria.
	   The agreement said only that the rebels would continue dialogue
with the civil delegates.
	   The civic leaders were optimistic nonetheless: ``The winds of
peace are blowing through Colombia,'' said Sabas Pretelt, the head
of a leading Colombian industry group.
	   The civic leaders said they would try to meet with Colombia's
biggest rebel group _ the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
or FARC _ and to arrange a ``convention'' by Oct. 12 that would
include the government, rebels and civic delegates.
	   Talks with the 5,000-member ELN came after president-elect
Pastrana made overtures for talks toward the FARC rebels. The two
events combined have raised hopes of an end to the civil war.
	   The ELN also took small steps toward ending its campaign of
violence.
	   The group said it would stop bombing oil pipelines if a
substantial national dialogue is begun on how to protect the
country's resources from foreign exploitation.
	   The rebels agreed to cease kidnapping minors, the elderly and
pregnant women for ransom. It agreed to stop kidnapping altogether
if it can find ways to replace that income.
	   ``There were considerable differences with the ELN commanders
during these meetings. But there was harmony,'' said Jaime Bernal
Cuellar, Colombia's attorney general.
	   A key demand of rebels, should they enter peace talks with the
government, would be that the government work to disarm right-wing
paramilitary groups that target rebel supporters.
	   Beltran blamed a ``governing elite'' for financing the
paramilitary groups, and said their attacks on ELN supporters have
prompted him to enter the dialogue on ways to end the violence.
	   The Colombian civic delegation had met since Sunday with ELN
representatives at the Himmelspforten cloister in the town of
Wuerzburg. Germany's Catholic Bishops' Conference coordinated the
four-day meeting.
	   The German government had no official role in the meeting.
	   However, German church officials said that Werner Mauss, a
shadowy figure who once worked as a German agent to secure the
release of a German businessman's wife kidnapped by the ELN, and
his wife, Ida, helped set up the talks.
	   ``They have had excellent contacts with the ELN for many years,
and those contacts were necessary to make this agreement today,''
said the Rev. Hans Langendoerfer, the Bishops' conference
secretary.

Ecuador vote count nears end with Harvard graduate leading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSE VELAZQUEZ &QL; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ With results in from 19 of 21 provinces,
centrist Quito Mayor Jamil Mahuad on Wednesday appeared headed for
victory over a banana tycoon in Ecuador's presidential runoff.
	   A preliminary report from the Supreme Electoral Tribunal gave
Mahuad, who has a master's degree in public administration from
Harvard University, a 7.6 percentage point lead in Sunday's vote
over his populist rival Alvaro Noboa.
	   But with results still not in from Noboa's coastal stronghold of
Guayas, Ecuador's most populous province, the margin was expected
to shrink.
	   The final result from the electoral tribunal was expected later
Wednesday.
	   Mahuad has already claimed victory, meeting with officials to
discuss the makeup of his new Cabinet. But Noboa has refused to
concede defeat, saying that his private exit poll showed him
winning by 3 percentage points.
	   He charged the Mahuad camp with organizing a fraud.
	   About 100 Noboa supporters surrounded the elections office in
the port city of Guayaquil, Noboa's home town, after he called on
them to go to there protect his votes.
	   ``They have forced us to militarize vote-counting centers to
protect the people working there,'' said Patricio Vivanco,
president of the electoral tribunal.
	   Foreign observers who monitored the vote have rejected fraud
charges.
	   Mahuad, 48, and Noboa, 47, were the top vote-getters in the
first round of voting on May 31. Since neither won an outright
majority, a runoff was called.
	   An exit poll sponsored by seven television stations on Sunday
initially gave Mahuad a 7.2 percent lead in the runoff, but as late
results from the coast came in, the lead shrank to 2.6 percent. The
poll's margin of error was 1.6 percent.
	   The winner will take over an Andean nation of 12 million people
with its democracy and economy in tatters. The economy is expected
to grow by at most 1 percent in 1998, battered by El Nino-driven
floods and mudslides and falling prices for its main export, oil.
	   The new president must also repair Ecuador's 19-year-old
democracy, which almost collapsed in February 1997, when Congress
removed eccentric President Abdala Bucaram from power for ``mental
incapacity'' amid massive street protests and a paralyzing national
strike.
	   Congress named Fabian Alarcon as interim president, but for 48
chaotic hours following Bucaram's ouster, three people
simultaneously claimed to be president.
	   Mahuad had earned a reputation as a clean, effective politician
during his six-year stint as Quito's mayor. He had the support of
Ecuador's political elite and business community.
	   Noboa, Ecuador's richest man, had campaigned as the candidate of
the poor, despite his wealth, and had the support of disgraced
former President Bucaram's Roldosista party.
	   The winner will replace Alarcon on Aug. 10.

Vandals again target de Gaulle statue in Quebec
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QUEBEC (AP) _ Vandals have again targeted a statue of Charles de
Gaulle, painting four Xs in red paint on the tribute to the late
French president.
	   A message was also left asking that the statue be sent to France
at the expense of Quebec City Mayor Jean-Paul L'Allier.
	   It is not the first time red paint has been splashed on the
statue. Last August, workers had to remove paint that had been
thrown on de Gaulle's head. It also spilled down the front of the
bronze monument with some of it dripping onto de Gaulle's toes.
	   A message at the base of the statue said in French: ``Canadian
blood was spilled at Dieppe. You should blush, you old bastard.''
	   More than 900 Canadians died and some 1,900 were captured on
Aug. 19, 1942, during one of Canada's bloodiest days in the Second
World War.
	   Quebec's separatist government and Quebec City officials decided
to mark the 30th anniversary of de Gaulle's 1967 visit to the
province by erecting the statue. The ceremony last July led to a
confrontation between federalists, separatists and veterans.
	   The statue is on city land near the historic Plains of Abraham
battlefields where the British defeated the French in 1759.

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Following its 3-0 defeat to France in
the World Cup final, Brazil may cancel two exhibition matches
scheduled for August in Korea and Japan, the location of the next
tournament in 2002, a local daily reported Wednesday.
	   The Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper said Ricardo Teixeira,
president of the Brazilian Soccer Confederation mentioned the
possibility of canceling the games during the flight that brought
the national team back home.
	   The two games were scheduled for Aug. 16 in Japan and Aug.19 in
Korea.
	   The Confederation was not available for immediate comment.
	   Despite their worst World Cup defeat ever, Brazilian fans turned
out by the thousands on Tuesday to give their team a hero's welcome
in Brasilia, the capital.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso hailed ``our glorious team''
and bestowed the National Merit Order on each player at a ceremony
in the Presidential Palace.

Prosecutor blames elusive terrorist for Turkish activist shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A prosecutor on Tuesday blamed an elusive
terrorist, once employed by the state, for the shooting of a
leading human rights activist.
	   Akin Birdal, chairman of the independent Human Rights
Association, was seriously wounded in the May 12 assassination
attempt. Police have arrested 11 suspects, including two said to
have confessed to the shooting.
	   Prosecutor Unal Haney said in an indictment made public
Wednesday that the attack was ordered by a terrorist, Mahmut
Yildirim, who was once hired by the state to kill people seen as
security threats.
	   The 11 belonged to an ultra-nationalist group, the Turkish
Revenge Brigade, the indictment said.
	   The defendants face maximum terms of 24 years in prison on
charges of forming an armed gang and attempted murder.
	   No trial date has been set.
	   Birdal, 50, underwent two operations after being shot six times.
He is known for his opposition to torture and the forced evacuation
of Kurdish villages in southeastern Turkey by the military in its
war against Kurdish guerrillas.

Assad denies knowledge of Nazi war criminal's presence in Syria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ President Hafez Assad has denied that
Syria granted refuge to Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner.
	   The denial came during an interview with France's Channel One
television, which is scheduled to be broadcast Wednesday on the eve
of Assad's visit to France.
	   Syrian officials have often denied Brunner's presence in Syria
but this is the first time Assad has spoken on the subject.
	   Asked if he would allow a French investigating judge to visit
Syria to seek information on Brunner, Assad said: ``Nobody has told
me that he (Brunner) is in Syria. And why should Syria care about
this person?''
	   ``If you know where he is, go immediately to his address to find
out whether or not he is there,'' Assad told the interviewer.
	   Excerpts of the interview, conducted in Arabic, were given to
reporters by the presidential office.
	   Brunner is blamed for the deaths of 130,000 Jews from Germany,
Austria, France and Greece. Nazi trackers place Brunner in Syria
under the alias of Georg Fischer.
	   Brunner was placed under formal investigation by France in 1988
for crimes against humanity. France asked for his extradition and
said a French investigating judge be allowed to go to Syria to seek
information. Syria has refused. The judge's name has not been
released.
	   ``I wonder how I, while in Syria, do not know his (Brunner's)
whereabouts, while the French judge does,'' Assad said.
 &UR; ______________________________________
	   On the Middle East peace process, Assad blamed Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the deadlock.
	   Assad said the main obstacle to resuming the talks was
Netanyahu's insistence on peace-for-peace based negotiations rather
than land-for-peace based talks _ as agreed by the previous Labor
government of Israel and Arab negotiating parties in 1991.
	   The talks between Syria and Israel have been deadlocked for more
than two years over Syria's demand that Israel hand over the Golan
Heights which Israel seized in 1967 in return for peace.
	   Netanyahu says the Heights are vital to Israel's security.
	   ``Netanyahu says he wants peace for peace, a motto which means
that he wants to retain our land and also take peace from us,''
Assad said.
	   Asked whether he would be willing to sit face-to-face with
Netanyahu if Israel agrees to withdraw from the Golan Heights,
Assad said it would be ``natural'' for foes to meet once peace is
achieved.
	   ``The hatred existing between us now is caused by the presence
of things which we differ over. When such things disappear, matters
will then be normal,'' Assad said.

Second car accident reported during World Cup party, 10 hurt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A drunken lawyer who lost control of his car hit a
group of bystanders during celebrations on the Champs Elysees
following France's World Cup win, injuring about 10 people,
including two Americans, police said Wednesday.
	   In a separate incident, another car driven by a panicked
schoolteacher hit bystanders about 3 a.m. (0100 GMT) Monday,
injuring about 80 people, one of whom later died.
	   More than a million people were gathered on the avenue at the
time of both accidents, which took place soon after France defeated
Brazil in the World Cup final.
	   The accident reported by police Wednesday occurred about two
hours before the first one, when an Alfa Romeo driven by a
33-year-old Kenyan born lawyer hit a group of people not far from
the Arc de Triomphe.
	   The victims, including the two Americans, aged 20 and 75,
suffered main from leg injuries, scrapes and bruises. Four injured
French police cadets who were supposed to march on the Champs
Elysees during Tuesday's Bastille Day parade were among those hurt.
	   No further information on the victims was available.
	   The driver had a blood alcohol level of .91 grams per liter,
nearly twice the legal amount in France, police said.

Bangladesh floods kill 22, half a million marooned

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ More than half a million people were
marooned across Bangladesh as major rivers swollen by torrential
monsoon rains drowned thousands of villages and claimed at least 22
lives, officials said Wednesday.
	   Seventeen people _ including five children _ died on Tuesday and
Wednesday in the northern Bogra and southeastern Chittagong and
Cox's Bazar districts, according to Dhaka's Flood Information
Center. Ten drowned in swirling flood waters and seven died when
their mud-and-straw huts collapsed.
	   Five more people drowned Monday in central Jamalpur and northern
Gaibandha districts, Daily Star newspaper reported.
	   A week of monsoon rains flooded the Ganges, Brahmaputra and
Meghna rivers, inundating thousands of villages where more than
half a million people are trapped, the center said. Some people
have fled their flooded homes to take shelter on high grounds and
embankments, it said.
	   The floods washed away thousands of mud-and-thatch houses and
small bridges, disrupting communication in 13 of Bangladesh's 64
districts.
	   Bangladesh, one of the world's largest low-lying delta, is hit
every year by floods and cyclones that kill hundreds of people.

Dutch predict bumper harvest as mussels season begins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YERSEKE, Netherlands (AP) _ A convoy of 120 trucks and three
helicopters rushed the first mussels of the season out of the
Netherlands Wednesday with producers predicting a bumper harvest.
	   Before the season ends in April, production may top 100 million
kilograms (220 million pounds) for only the second time this
decade, predicted Leo Lucas, director of the Dutch Mussel Bureau.
	   That spells good news for mussel lovers of Belgium and France
who buy about 60 percent of the Dutch mussels.
	   For the second year running, traders in Yerseke, the fishing
port which is the heart of Dutch mussel production launched the new
season with the sort of hype used to promote ``Beaujolais Nouveau''
wine in France.
	   Just as the French race to get the first bottles of the new wine
to Paris, the start of the season at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT) sharp send
the trucks rushing to take the first mussels to Brussels.
	   The Belgian capital, 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the south, has
made the succulent mollusks the centerpiece of local cuisine and
relies on Yerseke for most of its mussels.
	   Brusselers were expected to consume around 4 million mussels in
the first weekend of the season, said Tilly Sintnicolaas of the
Dutch Seafood Office.
	   For really mussel-hungry Belgians, some restaurants and one
supermarket chain hired helicopters to fly in the first supplies.

Thousands celebrate peace accord in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Beating drums and waving banners,
nearly 25,000 people flocked into a soccer stadium Wednesday in a
show of support for a controversial peace accord that ended two
decades of bush war in southeastern Bangladesh last year.
	   ``Peace has now returned to the southeastern hills,'' Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina, who signed the accord with tribal rebels in
December last year, told the cheering crowd at the rainsoaked Dhaka
stadium.
	   The belated celebration was seen as a show of strength amid
rising protests over the accord by the country's main opposition
parties, which accuse the government of conceding too much to the
rebels.
	   Last month, several thousand opposition activists held a protest
march in the hills and at least 100 people were injured in clashes
with Hasina's supporters who tried to block the march.
	   At Wednesday's rally, Hasina said tribal people _ two-thirds of
the region's population _ could not be left out of the mainstream
of national development.
	   The accord allows the mostly Buddhist tribespeople to govern the
country's Chittagong Hill Tracts, a resource-rich region 110 miles
(176 kilometers) southeast of Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital.
	   The insurgency began after thousands of Muslims migrated to the
region from overcrowded plains and grabbed land from the tribals,
who are mostly Buddhist Chakmas. The resulting bush war left 20,000
people dead.
	   Nearly 2,000 rebels have surrendered and are preparing to form a
council to control the region's administration and development.

Manchester facilities under question as Malaysia team is announced
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New 5th graf with CGCE disputing reported remarks; SUBS 3rd

conference &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ As England prepares to send its biggest ever team
to the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia, preparations for the 2002
games in Manchester are coming under increasing scrutiny.
	   Norman Sarsfield, chairman of England's Commonwealth Games
Council, admits the facilities at Manchester are still only in the
planning stages.
	   Sarsfield, speaking at the announcement of England's swimming
team for the games in September, said the stadia in Kuala Lumpur
were the best he had ever seen.
	   But, speaking to reporters before the formal news conference, he
said he was ``ashamed'' because the facilities at Manchester did
``not measure up at all.''
	   The Commonwealth Games Council for England later issued a
statement denying that Sarsfield had made negative remarks about
Manchester's facilities. The statement said the CGCE was working
closely with Manchester ``to ensure that the best possible
facilities and arrangements are in place.''
	   ``The swimming pool at Kuala Lumpur is better than the pool used
for the Atlanta Olympics and the (track) stadium _ it's the best
I've seen. Better than the Stade de France (venue of the World Cup
soccer final),'' Sarsfield said.

Report: Nigerian junta to annul legislative elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Abubakar dissolving government
transition agencies, EDITS to conform. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's military government plans to
annul legislative elections held during the flawed transition
program of the country's late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, a
newspaper report said Wednesday.
	   Legislators have been told to prepare for a new round of
elections, the Lagos Press reported.
	   The country's new military leader, meanwhile, dissolved three
agencies Abacha had established to oversee the transition.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar folded the Transition Implementation
Committee, the National Reconciliation Committee and the Committee
on Devolution of Power after meeting with officials Wednesday,
according to Alex Akinyele, the chairman of the reconciliation
committee.
	   The agencies had long been viewed with suspicion by Nigeria's
opposition movement, and were staffed largely with Abacha's friends
and allies.
	   Some other electoral bodies, including the National Electoral
Commission, will be restructured to help give credibility to
Abubakar's revised transition plans, according to government
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Abubakar is expected to announce his plans on the transition
plan sometime this week.
	   As for the legislative elections, only a tiny fraction of
registered voters turned out in April for the voting, which had
been billed as the first step toward ending the country's military
rule. Opposition leaders had denounced the vote as rigged and
called for a boycott, and fears of violence kept others away.
	   But the winners of the those elections are rallying their
forces.
	   The legislators have formed a pressure group to fight to keep
their seats. They held a meeting Tuesday in Abuja, Nigeria's
capital, to discuss their options.
	   ``We all may have to forget our election,'' said the group's
leader, retired general and former foreign minister Joe Garba. He
has been hired to lobby Abubakar to hold to the election results.
	   Forgetting the elections, though, is what the legislators are
afraid of.
	   ``The annulment and cancellation of the elections will plunge
the nation into another political upheaval,'' they said in a
statement after the Abuja meeting. ``Any consultation on the
political future of the country without the contributions of the
legitimately elected representatives of the people will remain an
incomplete and unfair exercise.''
	   Opponents of Abacha's repressive military regime had urged
voters to stay away for polling stations to show disapproval of his
presidential nomination by all five political parties. They accused
Abacha of manipulating both the presidential nomination process and
the legislative elections in the military's favor.
	   Candidates for the 109 senatorial and 360 house seats came from
the five political parties sanctioned by the Abacha regime.
	   Abacha, who died suddenly in early June, was replaced by
Abubakar. He has vowed to continue with the transition plan, but
has vowed to bring true civilian rule to Nigeria.

Senior commander arrives in Sierra Leone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A senior Nigerian commander in
charge of a West African coalition force in Sierra Leone arrived
Wednesday on a fact-finding mission.
	   Gen. Timothy Shelpidi, who was lauded and given a hero's welcome
to Sierra Leone when his Nigerian-led force drove a brutal military
junta from power in Sierra Leone in February, is back to assess
ongoing hostilities in the countryside.
	   Although the coalition force, known as ECOMOG, controls the
capital and the vast majority of this small West African country,
rebel elements and the remnants of the junta continue to terrorize
some communities in eastern Sierra Leone near the borders with
Liberia and Guinea, as well as other isolated pockets across the
country.
	   At least 750 people trying to find shelter in the town of
Massingbi have perished from hunger and disease over the past few
months, a United Nations aid official said Tuesday.
	   Thousands more in Massingbi, in Sierra Leone's diamond-rich Kono
district, are in danger from measles, malnutrition and diarrhea,
the official said.
	   Fighting between ECOMOG forces, former junta soldiers and their
rebel allies was hampering the ability of aid groups to reach the
town.
	   ECOMOG in February swept into the capital Freetown and within
days was in full control of the capital and marching into the
countryside. Their advance, although largely successful, has been
marked by devastating destruction left behind by fleeing rebel
forces.
	   Rebel forces have been accused of grotesque atrocities,
including mass amputations, rape, torture and murder.
	   Massingbi, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) east of Freetown,
has swelled with inhabitants as residents have fled fighting in
towns throughout the Kono region.
	   Intervention force officials, who are now fighting on behalf of
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah say the rebels are weakened but still
able to fight.
	   Kabbah was overthrown in a military coup in May 1997, but
restored to power 10 months later by the ECOMOG army.
	   Other parts of the country have returned to normal, allowing for
some of the thousands of Sierra Leonean refuges to return home, the
United Nations refugee agency said Wednesday.
	   A chartered ship carrying 92 refugees home left The Gambia en
route for Freetown, the UNHCR said in a statement.

Diplomats visit Belgrade in effort to resume mediation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with ethnic Albanian reports of
fighting in Kosovo. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An influential trans-Atlantic
organization met with Yugoslav officials on Wednesday on
establishing a permanent presence in Kosovo to lessen fighting
between Serbs and ethnic Albanians seeking independence.
	   The 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which includes the United States and Canada, met with
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic. Hansjoerg Eiff, a
German diplomat leading the OSCE mission said the idea was to
``talk about all aspects of relations between OSCE and
Yugoslavia.''
	   Eiff also said OSCE would like former Spanish Premier Felipe
Gonzalez to start a mission to mediate the Kosovo conflict as soon
as possible. The Yugoslav reaction was not immediately known, but
Yugoslavia _ dominated by Serbia of which Kosovo province is a part
_ has in the past opposed such a mission as outside interference.
	   In Kosovo's capital, Pristina, an ethnic Albanian politician
criticized the organization' attempts to mediate in the region,
saying they come six years too late.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE in 1992 for fomenting
ethnic conflict in Croatia and Bosnia. It has refused to allow
permanent offices to be set up in the country until its membership
was restored.
	   But after strong pressure from the United States and from
Russia, their greatest ally, the Yugoslavs agreed last Thursday to
let an initial fact-finding mission visit Kosovo, where
Serb-Albanian fighting has killed more than 300 people since
February.
	   Other areas where OSCE would like to see permanent missions
include the Muslim Serbian region of Sandzak and Vojvodina, a
Serbian province with a large Hungarian minority, Yugoslav media
reported.
	   In Pristina, Bajram Kosumi, a top official in the ethnic
Albanian Parliamentary Party who is considered among more hardline
Kosovo Albanian officials, criticized the OSCE for sending a
mission after the conflict has advanced to such a bloody state.
	   ``The return of the OSCE mission in Kosovo could be a symbolic
gesture, which would stress the concern and interest Europe and the
international community in general have for Kosovo, but effectively
it will have little influence in the field,'' he said.
	   Fighting flared at various points in Kosovo Wednesday.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center said a group of armed
ethnic Albanians attacked a police checkpoint near the southwestern
Kosovo town of Decani, 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina,
Wednesday, wounding one policeman. Police repelled the attack, the
center said.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said three
Albanians were killed in an attack by Serb forces near Decani late
Tuesday. Two villages on the road leading to the border with
Albania fell under attack for three hours, with Serb forces setting
fire to seven houses before KLA fighters forced them to retreat,
the center said.
	   Fighting also continued Wednesday in two other regions,
Djakovica _ where one Albanian was killed and five others wounded
Monday _ and the KLA stronghold of Drenica, the center said.
	   No independent confirmation was available.
	   The leadership of the political party supporting Ibrahim Rugova
_ elected Kosovo president in elections not recognized by Serbia _
met in Pristina Wednesday to decide when the ethnic Albanian
assembly _ also elected unofficially _ is to convene. But no fixed
date was agreed on.
	   Attempts by world powers to rally the splintered Albanian
politicians behind Rugova have been unsuccessful, and with
political efforts to gain independence faltering, the Kosovo
Liberation Army continues to gain support.

Orangemen settle in for long siege at Drumcree
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police moving Orangemen out of fields while army
deals with suspected bombs
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police moved into the fields
near Drumcree Anglican church Wednesday, arresting more than 20
people and searching for explosives after another violent standoff
with frustrated Orange Order marchers.
	   About 300 people massed at a police barrier overnight, and some
threw bombs and fireworks at police and soldiers. Police said one
man appeared to have a handgun but no shots were fired. No injuries
were reported.
	   Police moved Orangemen off the field Wednesday afternoon, citing
safety concerns, as army specialists were summoned to deal with
several suspected bombs. The Orangemen have insisted they will stay
at Drumcree until they are allowed to march through a Catholic
neighborhood.
	   ``Once the security cordon is lifted people will be ready to go
back. This is definitely not the end of our protest,'' said Orange
spokesman David Jones.
	   Three adults and a juvenile were charged with offenses including
criminal damage, obstruction and riotous behavior in connection
with the disturbances at Drumcree, police said. A spokeswoman at
regional police headquarters in Armagh City, speaking on condition
of anonymity, declined to say exactly how many people were
arrested.
	   Among the items seized by police were two crossbows, five
slingshots, fireworks, five gallons (about 20 liters) of fuel,
balaclavas, fireworks and two spent 9mm cartridges.

Richter returns to Rangers, Brown goes back to Detroit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Richter news conference; EDITS &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Two players drafted by the expansion Nashville
Predators are headed back where they came from.
	   Goalie Mike Richter will remain with the New York Rangers,
agreeing Wednesday to a deal that will pay him dlrs 21.8 million
over four years.
	   The Detroit Red Wings, meanwhile, reacquired Doug Brown, who
scored two goals in the Stanley Cup-clinching game against
Washington.
	   The Rangers finally reached agreement Tuesday night with
Richter, who has played in New York during all nine of his NHL
seasons.
	   ``Mike Richter is as dedicated a Ranger as you can get,''
general manager Neil Smith said at a news conference.
	   Richter wasn't protected by the Rangers in the June 26 expansion
draft and was selected by Nashville. On July 1, Richter became free
to negotiate with any NHL team.
	   Just two days ago, it appeared Richter would be playing
elsewhere as the Rangers tried to land free-agent goalie Curtis
Joseph. But those talks hit a snag when Joseph's agent, Don Meehan,
said he had an offer for more money from another team.
	   ``In the end, if you achieved what you wanted to achieve, the
path doesn't make a difference,'' Richter said. ``I'm happiest here
and New York felt that the fit was good. It worked out the best
both ways.''
	   Joseph reportedly has agreed to a four-year, dlrs 24 million
deal with Toronto, contingent on the trade of Felix Potvin to
Vancouver.
	   Brown also was picked by Nashville in the expansion draft when
the Red Wings left him unprotected.
	   The Predators gave him back in a trade, receiving Czech Elite
League player Petr Sykora, a third-round pick in the 1999 draft and
another undetermined draft pick in either 1999 or 2000. Sykora, a
center, was the eighth-ranked European in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft
and was Detroit's second choice, 76th overall.
	   Brown, 34, scored a career-best 19 goals last season.
	   ``We're excited, I'm excited, our coaches are excited. He played
a very important role in our winning the Stanley Cup,'' Red Wings
general manager Ken Holland said. ``We're a better team now than we
were 24 hours ago without Doug Brown.''
	   Detroit decided not to bring back two familiar faces on defense,
as veteran Bob Rouse signed a two-year deal with an option with the
San Jose Sharks. The 14-year NHL veteran played the last four
seasons with the Red Wings.
	   Also not in Detroit's plans was defenseman Dmitri Mironov, who
signed a free-agent deal with Washington. The Red Wings added
free-agent defenseman Uwe Krupp last week and are looking to get
younger on defense.
	   A day after adding free-agent center Ron Francis, the Carolina
Hurricanes signed defenseman Al Iafrate, 32, to an incentive-laden
contract that could pay him dlrs 3 million this season.
	   Iafrate, who has one of the hardest shots in hockey, hopes to
revive a once thriving career with Carolina.
	   Iafrate played only 59 games the past four seasons with Boston
and San Jose because of operations on both knees and his back.
	   ``If I produce the way I did five years ago I will be right on
scale with all the other guys who are All-Stars now,'' Iafrate
said.
	   In other NHL news, Scotty Bowman found out he has no heart
problems, but said he must be pronounced in excellent health to
rejoin the Red Wings. The 64-year-old coach, who has won a
record-tying eight Stanley Cups in a 26-year career, expects to
have an answer this week.
	   Last month, Bowman's 61-year-old brother, Jack, a longtime NHL
scout, died during heart surgery.
	   Calgary and Dallas completed a trade with the Flames getting
veteran center Bob Bassen for 24-year-old center Aaron Gavey.
	   The Flames also obtained the rights to left wing Jan Hlavac from
the New York Islanders for the rights to draft pick Jorgen Jonsson.
	   Defenseman Murray Baron, meanwhile, agreed to a three-year
contract with the Vancouver Canucks, and the Lightning agreed to a
three-year contract worth as much as dlrs 5.8 million with
defenseman Paul Mara, the team's 1997 first-round draft pick.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat
arrived in Islamabad Wednesday en route home from China with an
offer to mediate between Pakistan and its hostile neighbor India.
	   Arafat said he would like to see Pakistan and India -- the
world's newest nuclear powers -- reach an agreement on the
protracted dispute of Kashmir.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the Himalayan state
which was split between the two countries when the British left the
subcontinent in 1947 and created Pakistan as a homeland for the
Muslims of the region.
	   Pakistan and India fought a third war over Bangladesh or what
was then East Pakistan.
	   The Kashmir dispute heated up in May when India and Pakistan
both conducted underground nuclear tests and declared themselves
nuclear powers.
	   The international community fears another war between the two
neighbors could result in the use of nuclear weapons.
	   Pakistan's Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub also has warned that
another conflagration on the subcontinent could escalate into a
nuclear confrontation.
	   ``We have to continue our attempts'' to get India to agree to
mediation in the dispute over Kashmir, said Arafat.
	   India has refused international mediation. Last month the Indian
leadership refused to see a special envoy of the United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan saying the Kashmir dispute is a
bilateral issue between India and Pakistan.
	   The prime ministers of the two countries are to meet July 29 in
Sri Lanka for the first time since carrying out nuclear explosions.
	   Pakistan is demanding a plebiscite in Kashmir in line with a
1948 U.N. resolution, which calls for Kashmiris to decide whether
to join India or Pakistan.
	   Indian-held Kashmir is the only Muslim-dominated state in a
predominately Hindu India. A secessionist uprising in Indian-held
Kashmir has raged since 1989.
	   New Delhi accuses Pakistan of fomenting violence on its
territory, a charge Islamabad denies.

Belarus says U.S. raising tension over diplomatic housing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The Belarusian Foreign Ministry accused
the United States on Wednesday of escalating tension between the
two countries in a dispute over diplomatic housing.
	   The U.S. State Department on Tuesday announced it was banning
travel to the United States by Belarusian officials and was halting
exchange programs in retaliation for the eviction of the U.S.
ambassador and European envoys.
	   The Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that instead of
seeking constructive dialogue, the United States was making ``rough
attacks'' on Belarus. ``An escalation of tensions is taking
place,'' it said.
	   Belarus has said it needs to repair the plumbing and sewage
system in the compound where the ambassadors live. The ambassadors
say that under the Vienna Convention, Belarus has no right to force
them out for any reason.
	   The Foreign Ministry said the Vienna Convention contains
provisions which say foreign diplomats are obligated to follow the
laws and decisions of the host country.

German TV team arrested after trying to hire a killer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Journalists from a television
newsmagazine who were working on a story about ``the abysses of our
society'' may face charges themselves after placing a newspaper ad
for a hitman.
	   Five employees of ``Taff,'' a daily tabloid news show on the
private Pro Sieben network, were temporarily arrested after a man
who answered their ad notified police.
	   Officials said Wednesday they were considering misdemeanor
charges of disorderly conduct against the five.
	   Pro Sieben spokesman Torsten Rossman said the ``Taff'' team
never intended to actually go through with a crime.
	   The planned ``look into the abysses of our society,'' he said,
``was supposed to show what kind of criminal stories you can have
in Germany for 25,000 marks,'' (about dlrs 14,000).
	   But he said the network did not agree with the team's methods.
``There will now be serious discussions with those responsible for
the show,'' he said.
	   According to police, ``Taff'' placed an ad in Monday's newspaper
seeking ``a courageous, dependable and conscientious individualist
for a short-term matter with an honorarium of 25,000 marks.''
	   When a 59-year-old salesman called the number listed, he was
told he would have to kill someone, police said. A meeting was
arranged for Tuesday, but the man notified police instead, who
arrested the TV team.
	   Authorities said they would not bring charges of incitement to
commit a crime, but said ``Taff'' could be fined up to 2,000 marks
(dlrs 1,100) if convicted of disorderly conduct.
	   In a statement, Munich's police chief called the incident
``tasteless,'' adding that ``reality TV apparently knows no
boundaries anymore.''

Justin Leonard: A cautious custodian of the Claret Jug
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ He lost his composure when he accepted
it a year ago at Royal Troon, but since then Justin Leonard's been
a cautious custodian of the Claret Jug.
	   ``As far as I know it wasn't dropped,'' the defending British
Open champion said Wednesday. ``It didn't make it to any bars. It
was basically between my house and my parents' house.''
	   Now it may be time to give it back _ unless he wins again _
which hasn't happened since Tom Watson did it 15 years ago.
	   Leonard, 26, is the third consecutive American to win the Open
and _ with apologies to Tom Lehman and John Daly _ probably
Britain's favorite, thanks to his humble, tearful acceptance
speech.
	   Leonard established himself one of golf's best young players at
Scotland's Royal Troon, when he tied the Open record by coming back
from five strokes down in the final round to win.
	   The clincher was a 35-foot birdie putt on the par-3 17th, and a
solid par on the closing for a 65.
	   Four hours later, the course deserted and dark, Leonard
described how he returned to the 17th with a pizza and a can of
beer, and camped out behind the green.
	   ``There was a background hum from the clubhouse but hardly a
soul in sight,'' he recalled. ``There were moments on that summer
night when I could almost hear the putt dropping again.''
	   His mother and father, Nancy and Larry, who were at home in
Dallas last year when he won, took a guided tour of Troon this week
and felt the magic again _ in broad daylight.
	   ``My mom walked around with one of the newspaper clippings that
had the clubs I hit, the yardage, and things like that,'' Leonard
explained. ``She went through on each tee.''
	   ``They kind of walked through my round as my dad was playing.''
	   Dad's round?
	   ``It blew like 40 mph (60 kph), I don't think he was too in to
keeping score.''
	   Now the methodical Texas grinder meets Royal Birkdale, a seaside
links tangle of sand hills, pot bunkers, ankle-high rye grass _
with winds gusting up to 40 mph (60 kph) on the eve of Thursday's
first round.
	   ``You do need to work the ball here,'' Leonard said. ``You need
to hit it very solid and, I think, keep it down. Keeping the ball
out of the wind is going to be very important for me.''
	   For Leonard, and 155 others.

Family reunion turns into terror as Israeli shells land on home
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RODEINA KENAAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Three brothers who came to South Lebanon
for a family reunion for the first time in 12 years had to flee
their home Wednesday after Israeli shells smashed into their living
room.
	   The bombardment on the front line town of Nabatiyeh may be
commonplace for residents, but for the Mourad brothers it was a
terrifying reminder of the Israeli military occupation they had
left behind years ago when they migrated to different countries.
	   ``We're all packing up and leaving,'' said Ferial Mourad, wife
of Ghassan Mourad, 38, who is a car dealer in Germany.
	   The couple arrived with their five children two days ago to be
with Ghassan's parents in their sprawling three-story home on the
outskirts of Nabatiyeh.
	   They were joined by Mohammed Mourad, 39, also a car dealer, and
the eldest brother, 41-year-old Hussein, a mechanical engineer.
They both flew in from Sweden with their wives and five children.
	   Around midnight Tuesday, while the household was asleep, Israeli
tanks opened fire. One shell hit the living room, another one an
empty bedroom and a third smashed into the kitchen. Nobody was
injured except a pet parrot that lost one wing.
	   There was no question of going back to bed now.
	   After tending to the parrot, the brothers and their wives, their
10 children and the elder Mourads rushed down to spend the rest of
the night in an underground shelter _ an indispensable chamber in
most houses on the front line.
	   At daybreak, a decision was made: the family will move in with
relatives in another part of Nabatiyeh and the visitors will leave
Lebanon as soon as possible.
	   Nabatiyeh is about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of Beirut
but only few hundred meters (yards) from Israeli army lines, often
bearing the brunt of Israeli shelling.
	   Parts of South Lebanon, which Israel has occupied with the help
of an allied Lebanese militia since 1985, is the last active
Arab-Israeli war front. Lebanese guerrillas often stage hit-and-run
attacks on Israeli positions across the front line, drawing Israeli
fire that sometimes hit civilians.
	   ``God was merciful enough to save us but we just can't sit amid
the danger and ask God to protect us,'' Ferial, Ghassan's wife
said, in an interview over cellular phone.
	   As she spoke, her 90-year-old father-in-law, Daher Mourad, could
be heard pleading with his children to leave as soon as they can.
	   He came on the phone later to complain: ``One of the shells hit
the water tank on the roof of the house. Our house now is
uninhabitable.''
	   Mourad had built the house as a family retreat, hoping to host a
reunion that had eluded the family for 12 years, first because of
his sons' preoccupation in their new countries and then because of
the civil war in Lebanon that ended in 1990.
	   Except the Mourad compound, no house was hit in the shelling
Tuesday, and other residents who heard about the unfortunate family
reunion informed reporters in Beirut.
	   On Wednesday, the family members swept broken glass of the
windows and scooped up mounds of plaster that had rained down from
the roofs. The shells had blasted holes the size of truck tires in
the living room and the kitchen.
	   ``May God punish them for what they've done'' the elder Mourad
said, referring to the Israeli and allied militia gunners
positioned on hills overlooking Nabatiyeh.
	   His sons now plan to cut short their six-week vacation.
	   ``We're going to move earth and sky to advance our ticket
reservations and leave,'' said a frustrated Sana Mourad, the eldest
brother's wife.
	   ``No matter how much it'll cost us, it will surely be less than
costing the life of one of us,'' she added.

Security cabinet clashes over framework for talks with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrangled with
his security cabinet Wednesday over the framework for talks with
the Palestinians aimed at reaching agreement for an Israeli troop
withdrawal, Israel radio reported.
	   The radio added that Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon
warned Netanyahu that right-wing members of his coalition would
abandon him and bring down the government if Netanyahu accepted an
American proposal for a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the
West Bank now and more later.
	   The United States, in efforts to mediate an end to a 16-month
stalemate in peace talks, submitted the proposal to Israel and the
Palestinians in January. The Palestinians have accepted the deal
but Netanyahu said a 13 percent withdrawal would harm Israel's
security and despite months of efforts, the United States was
unable to coax Israel to accept the deal.
	   As a result, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
suggested the two sides meet directly to hammer out the remaining
differences and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, a relative
moderate in the cabinet, was thought to be the best choice for such
talks.
	   Wednesday, Netanyahu met with Sharon and Mordechai, the two
members of his inner security cabinet, for three hours to discuss
strategy for the talks.
	   Israel radio and Channel 2 TV, both citing aides present at the
meeting, said the three differed greatly on how to handle the
negotiations.
	   Mordechai said he was prepared to meet with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to discuss all issues. He told reporters before the
meeting that ``there are several matters that require direct
discussions between ourselves and the Palestinians. If the
Palestinians show flexibility I think that the security staff can
advance the progress and bring it to the government,''
	   A senior official in the prime ministry told The Associated
Press that Netanyahu insisted that Mordechai stick to two issues
only: the scope of the Israeli troop withdrawal and sections of the
PLO charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   Mordechai is believed to be among several ministers in
Netanyahu's government who are pressuring the Israeli leader to
accept the American proposal.
	   Those opposed to the deal include the influential Sharon who
leads the right-wing camp inside the government. Netanyahu
reportedly tried to assure Sharon in the meeting that he did not
tell the United States he would accept a 13 percent withdrawal. But
Mordechai challenged the claim, Israel radio said, leading to more
friction among the three men.

Berlusconi denies he is seeking an amnesty in corruption cases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Two days after receiving his third conviction for
corruption, media magnate Silvio Berlusconi denied Wednesday he is
seeking an amnesty in the kickback scandals that swept the country
in the early 90s.
	   Instead, Italy's former premier and current opposition leader
called for a strong parliamentary commission to review the behavior
of judges and prosecutors during the ``Clean Hands''
investigations.
	   ``We're not ready for an amnesty,'' Berlusconi told reporters at
a Foreign Press Club news conference. ``An amnesty today would mean
giving up the search for the truth.''
	   ``We need a parliamentary commission with full powers of inquiry
and investigation,'' said Berlusconi, who claims he is a target of
leftist prosecutors.
	   Italy's parliament is considering setting up such body after
years of widespread corruption scandals that toppled much of
Italy's old political and industrial guard.
	   Opponents have often said that Berlusconi's eventual goal was an
amnesty.
	   Berlusconi spoke out strongly for a parliamentary commission
following his conviction Monday for illegal party financing. He is
appealing the conviction and sentence of two years, four months in
prison.
	   As he did after his two other convictions, Berlusconi denied any
wrongdoing and accused Milan prosecutors of carrying out a
political vendetta against him.
	   The Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament, is
expected to vote on setting up a commission July 23.

	   CHOLET, France (AP) - The yellow jersey keeps changing and the
Festina drug controversy remains on the Tour de France.
	   Wednesday's fourth stage found the fourth different rider to
lead the overall standings in the five days of racing, counting
Saturday's prologue.
	   Stuart O'Grady became the second Australian to wear the leader's
jersey in the Tour.
	   The Tour's drug drama continued with Bruno Roussel, Festina team
director, being heard by the police just after the stage ended.
	   O'Grady won a pair of intermediate sprints and came in third in
another to gain 14 extra seconds. Although he finished eight
seconds behind in the main pack, he came out ahead in the overall
standings.
	   He leads Bo Hamburger, Tuesday's leader, by 11 seconds with
George Hincapie of the United States third, also 11 seconds behind.
	   O'Grady found it poetic justice after his GAN teammate Chris
Boardman won the prologue and had the yellow jersey for a day
before falling on Monday.
	   ``I saw the pressure that Chris was under for just six minutes
of racing. It was absolutely incredible. But then we worked for him
to hold on to the yellow jersey and I remember he came to me and
said `I wish I could do the same for you some day,' ''
	   ``Unfortunately he crashed and the thing I can say is that I
wish him the best,'' O'Grady said.
	   He is a sprint specialist who has won cycling medals on the
Olympic track events and was a world team champion with Australia.
	   Jeroen Blijlevens of the Netherlands took the fourth stage
sprint finish in the leg from Plouay to Cholet, 252 kilometers (127
miles), the longest stage of this year's Tour.
	   It took more than 5 hours and 45 minutes of riding on the day
and a fall in the middle of the pack around a tight left-hand
corner less that 3 kilometers (2 miles) from the finish cut the
pack in two, eliminating a few of the top sprinters.
	   Blijlevens won the sprint for his fourth individual stage
victory. Second was Italian Nicola Minali with Czech Jan Svorada
third.
	   Most of the pack was eight seconds behind after the fall delayed
many of them.
	   As riders were finishing, Roussel was giving his side of the
drug controversy to police.
	   The team issued a statement saying it was his choice since he
wanted to explain how the team operates and deny charges by another
member of the Festina team.
	   Last week a Belgian member of Festina's team was arrested after
police found a large quantity of performance enhancing drugs in the
Festina car he was driving.
	   According to judicial sources, after first admitting the drugs
were for his personal use, the man charged said that he was under
orders.
	   Festina officials denied those accusations and said that they
had hired two lawyers to protect their image and riders.
	   Also, Festina's main sponsors, the watch company of Festina, was
threatening to break its contract with the team if there is any
evidence of drug use among the riders.

	   CHOLET, France (AP) - A quick look at Wednesday's stage of the
85th Tour de France.
	   STAGE: The fourth stage, from Plouay to Cholet, near the west
coast of France, 252 kilometers (157 miles), the longest stage of
this year's Tour.
	   WINNER: Jeroen Blijlevens of the Netherlands in a sprint after a
late fall cut the final pack in two groups.

German foreign minister backs Baltics' EU, NATO aspirations

<TEXT>
	   NIDA, Lithuania (AP) _ At a meeting with his Baltic counterparts
Wednesday, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said his country
strongly backs Baltic bids for membership in NATO and the European
Union.
	   At the meeting in the coastal town of Nida, Kinkel told
journalists he hoped the Baltics would win EU membership as soon as
possible. He also repeated NATO policy that the alliance was open
to all three Baltic countries if the can meet military
requirements.
	   Russia adamantly opposes the inclusion of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia in NATO, and some Balts have questioned whether Bonn would
be willing to anger Moscow by pushing for the Baltic countries'
membership.
	   Kinkel said at a news conference both that Germany backed the
Baltic effort to join NATO and that ``Russia has the central role
in Europe that it deserves.''
	   The meeting in Nida, 370 kilometers (220 miles) west of
Lithuania's capital Vilnius, was the third such get-together in
recent years, part of an agreement between the German and Baltic
governments to consult each other regularly on regional affairs.
	   Also on the agenda Wednesday was visa-free travel with Germany,
for which the Baltics have been lobbying hard in recent years.
Kinkel said Germany hoped to conclude agreements for visa-free
travel by the end of the year.
	   Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus broached the subject of
visas in a meeting with Kinkel earlier in the day. The president
told Kinkel that he sees a long line of Lithuanians outside the
German embassy waiting to get visas on his way to work every day.
	   ``The president joked that this was the only such line in
Lithuania,'' presidential spokeswoman Violeta Gaizauskaite said,
according to the Baltic News Service.

Anti-Hoover activists even score in `free flights' battle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The latest battle over Hoover Europe's infamous
``free flights'' promotion intensified Wednesday, as Hoover lost
three lawsuits from customers who bought appliances just so they
could fly for free.
	   Hoover won another lawsuit, and following four victories the
company racked up on Tuesday, the score in this round of litigation
is tied at five judgments for each side.
	   ``It's clear that they can't sweep it under the carpet,'' said
Harry Cichy, head of an alliance calling itself the Hoover Holiday
Pressure Group that won its first two lawsuits last year. ``We have
thousands of people who fit into the category of the cases we won
today.''
	   Hoover Europe created its own dilemma six years ago by making an
offer that was too good to be true. Anybody in Britain or Ireland
who spent as little as 100 pounds (dlrs 165) on a Hoover appliance
was promised two free overseas airline tickets.
	   Vacuum cleaners being cheaper than international air fares, many
people bought Hoovers only to get a free flight. Hoover was
overwhelmed and tried to deter customers by attaching numerous
conditions to the deal, but thousands fought back.
	   Hoover Europe's former corporate parent, U.S.-based Maytag
Corp., eventually paid out dlrs 72 million to fly some 220,000
people, but Hoover still has been unable to close out one of the
most embarrassing blunders in corporate history.
	   Cichy has said as many as 350,000 people might have grounds to
sue Hoover. But the new batch of rulings from Judge Ivor Bennett,
sitting in tiny St. Helens, just outside of Liverpool, northwest
England, would make some of those cases difficult to press.
	   Hoover said it plans to appeal the three judgments it lost,
while calling the cases it won similar to ``other examples of free
flights litigation.''
	   ``We are confident of similar successful outcomes in the
future,'' the Hoover European Appliance Group said in a statement.
	   But Cichy pointed out that two previous lawsuits won by members
of the Hoover Holiday Pressure Group were upheld after Hoover
appealed. Cichy said his group must ``take stock of the situation''
but predicted the angry customers will keep fighting, perhaps with
a class-action.
	   ``We're not going to rule out knocking on Maytag's door,'' Cichy
said. ``When you do a deal with somebody you should stick to it,
and Maytag didn't.''
	   Maytag, based in Newton, Iowa, has sold Hoover Europe to the
Italian appliance maker Candy S.p.A., but it had to set up a fund
to handle litigation in the free flights fiasco. Maytag, which
still sells Hoover products in the United States, did not
immediately return a reporter's phone calls on Wednesday.
	   Although the judge awarded the price of airline tickets _ about
400 pounds (dlrs 650) to each of the winning plaintiffs _ his
rulings have indicated that Hoover can beat people who got a real
offer for tickets, even if the customer found the flight too
inconvenient to take.
	   The plaintiffs who won on Wednesday _ David Albutt, Malcolm Hill
and Peter Madigan _ also received costs of nearly 100 pounds (dlrs
165) each after convincing the court Hoover was in breach of
contract by making it impossible for them to fly.
	   Hoover was relieved last year when the judge refused in his
first rulings to award any damages beyond ticket prices and minimal
costs.

Six killed in local fighting in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Members of a radical Islamic religious sect
clashed Wednesday in the breakaway province of Chechnya, leaving
six people dead and 15 wounded, a Russian news agency said.
	   The clashes broke out Tuesday night in the city of Gudermes
among ``so-called Wahhabites,'' former Prime Minister Shamil
Basayev told the Interfax news agency.
	   Basayev said security forces had taken control of the situation
by Wednesday afternoon, and separated the clashing groups.
	   Hundreds of Wahhabite families settled in Chechnya after many of
the Islamic fundamentalists living in the neighboring republics of
Dagestan aided Chechen guerrillas during the 1994-96 war with
Russia.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov for the first time Wednesday
criticized the Wahhabites, and said he might have to expel them
from Chechnya.
	   ``Supporters of this movement are coming to Chechnya from Arab
countries, calling for war and trying to justify the abduction of
people,'' Maskhadov said, according to Interfax.
	   He said he would soon expel ``everyone who has come here to
impose a hostile ideology on the Chechen people,'' according
Interfax.
	   Since its war of secession with Russia, Chechnya considers
itself an independent, Islamic republic. Russia still considers it
a Russian republic.
	   Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, on a one-day visit to
the North Caucasus republic of Dagestan, called for an end of
terrorism and crime in the region.
	   ``We have the same goal _ preservation of peace, stability and
calm in the North Caucasus, economic development and prosperity,''
he said at the inauguration ceremony of Magomedali Magomedov as
chairman of Dagestan's State Council.

Mountain eaglet born in Transylvania for first time in 20 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CLUJ, Romania (AP) _ A mountain eaglet hatched on a craggy,
remote cliff in western Transylvania is believed to be the first of
it species born outside of captivity in two decades, an
ornithologist said Wednesday.
	   Mountain eagles are featured on the present-day Romanian flag
and have been used as a symbol by Romanians since 1881. Dan
Munteanu told Mediafax news agency only a couple dozen mountain
eagles are believed to be left in the Romanian wilds, as humans
have encroached on their natural habitat.
	   Reporters from private PRO-TV television crept within 500 meters
(1,650 feet) of the nest in Cheile Turzii in the Apuseni Mountains,
some 325 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of the capital and filmed
the eaglet Wednesday.
	   Munteanu said it was the first visual evidence of a mountain
eagle's birth outside of captivity in 20 years.
	   Unlike its white-headed cousin, the American bald eagle, the
sooty brown mountain, or golden, eagle's feathers reach all the way
down to its toes.

Daewoo head criticizes Romanian law on car imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The president of Daewoo, the South
Korean car maker that is one of Romania's top investors, on
Wednesday criticized a law that he says undercuts his company by
allowing non-profit organizations to import cars.
	   The comments, by Daewoo President Oh Joon Kwon, were the latest
from foreign investors critical of murky legislation, red tape,
slow economic reform and corruption in Romania.
	   Kwon said that his company, which invested more than dlrs 800
million since setting up in Romania in 1994, was hurting through
used car imports that are duty free.
	   ``Between 1995 and 1997 half of the 212,000 second-hand cars
imported in Romania have been duty-free because they were brought
in as property of charitable organizations,'' Kwon told reporters.
He said Daewoo sales dropped more than two-thirds between 1996-1997
in part because of such imports _ from more than 22,000 to just
under 7,000.
	   Total investments in Romania have been less than dlrs 4 billion
since the fall of communism in 1989.
	   In contrast, post-communist Hungary _ which has only 10 million
people compared to Romania's 23 million _ has drawn about dlrs 17
billion in the same time.

McLaren appeals Schumacher's British Grand Prix victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ World auto sports governing body FIA scheduled a
hearing in Paris on July 27 to hear McLaren's appeal against
Michael Schumacher's victory in the British Grand Prix on Sunday.
	   Schumacher won the Silverstone race ahead of McLaren's Mika
Hakkinen after one of the most unusual finishes in the sport's
history.
	   The Ferrari driver crossed the finish line for his third
consecutive win but he crossed on pit lane _ under instructions
from his team _ instead of taking the flag on the track.
	   Schumacher's win cut Hakkinen's lead in the series standings to
two points but McLaren protested the result immediately and, when
that failed, appealed to FIA's panel.
	   Three stewards of the British Grand Prix have been invited to
appear before an extraordinary meeting of the World Motor Sport
Council in Paris on July 29.

At least 20 arrests as police move against march protesters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: AMs; UPDATES with 20 arrests, comment from Blair, government
says investment jeopardized
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ After another night of
bomb-throwing by Protestant hard-liners, police moved into the
fields near a rural church Wednesday searching for explosives,
fireworks and other weapons used in a standoff between Orange Order
marchers and the government. At least 20 people were arrested
	   Orangemen were moved out as army specialists were summoned to
deal with several suspected bombs.
	   ``Once the security cordon is lifted people will be ready to go
back,'' said David Jones, spokesman for the Orange lodges in
Portadown. ``This is definitely not the end of our protest.''
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said he still hoped to revive
proximity talks between the marchers and Catholic protesters, which
collapsed after a few hours on Saturday.
	   ``With a bit of goodwill and dialogue we can find a way 'round
this, so that people can have their right to march, but at the same
time do it in a way that is peaceful, unprovocative and where local
residents' dignity is respected as well,'' Blair said in the House
of Commons in London.
	   Police seized two crossbows, five slingshots, fireworks, five
gallons (about 20 liters) of fuel, balaclavas and two spent 9mm
cartridges in the fields near Drumcree Anglican church, where the
Orange march was stopped on July 5.
	   Three adults and a 16-year-old boy were charged with offenses
including criminal damage, obstruction and riotous behavior in
connection with the disturbances at Drumcree.
	   Meanwhile, police released without charge one of the two men
arrested for questioning about the firebombing deaths of three
young boys Sunday in Ballymoney, 40 miles (60 kms) northwest of
Belfast. The other man was still being questioned Thursday.
	   The Housing Authority said 107 families _ mainly Catholics but
some related to police officers _ had applied for help after being
burned or frightened out of their homes this month.
	   Violence has continued at Drumcree although the number of
marchers and supporters has declined sharply from a peak of more
than 20,000 last Thursday. About 300 people massed at a police
barrier overnight, and some threw bombs and fireworks. No injuries
were reported.
	   Portadown Orangemen had said they intended to scale down their
protests but to remain until they are allowed to go down the
Garvaghy Road, their traditional route home from an annual
religious service.
	   Adam Ingram, a government minister in Northern Ireland, said a
U.S. company _ which he did not identify _ was having second
thoughts about investing in Northern Ireland. ``Now they are
thinking of not doing so, because of recent events,'' he told the
House of Commons.
	   The Portadown siege opened splits in the Orange Order, which
stages hundreds of parades every summer, mostly on the 12th of July
anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne, where the Protestant King
William defeated the Catholic King James II in 1690.
	   Following the deaths of the three boys, the Rev. William
Bingham, chaplain to the Orange Order in County Armagh, called for
an end to the standoff. He was supported by some senior Orangemen,
but denounced by hard-liners as a traitor.
	   The Rev. Warren Porter, the Order's deputy grand chaplain in
County Londonderry, wrote in The Belfast Telegraph Wednesday that
many Orangemen were ``simply broken-hearted'' by the violence
ignited by the Portadown confrontation.
	   ``Are we to be wedded to a policy of confrontation, issuing in
bitterness bigotry, burning and eventual death and destruction?''
Porter wrote.

 &UR; GM battles to keep up production of key new pickup model &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSHAWA, Ontario (AP) _ While most General Motors factories
across North America are closed by a strike, a Canadian truck plant
continues to roll out a new pickup considered vital to GM's 1999
performance.
	   ``It's a beautiful truck,'' said assembly-line worker Neil
Anderson. But he expects a parts shortage to shut down the plant by
Friday, and has little sympathy with the company's plight.
	   The Oshawa truck plant, part of the biggest auto-industry
complex in Canada, has stayed open so long because of GM's
determination to keep the launch of the 1999 C/K pickup as close to
the original schedule as possible.
	   The current model of the truck _ the Chevrolet Silverado and its
twin, the GMC Sierra _ is GM's best-selling vehicle. The new model
is the result of the first major redesign in a decade.
	   When the strike began in Flint, Michigan, in early June, GM had
a big enough inventory at Oshawa to continue assembling the truck.
The inventory has lasted a relatively long time because _ as is
customary with a new model _ the pickup is being produced at the
low level of about 70 per day in order to fine-tune it and ensure
bugs are eliminated.
	   The company refuses to comment on the status of its inventory,
but the Canadian Auto Workers union says management has confided
that the parts will run out by the end of this week.
	   ``We'll be surprised if the plant finishes its normal shift on
Friday,'' said Dave Broadbent, secretary-treasurer of the CAW's
Local 222, which represents nearly 10,000 workers at GM's Oshawa
complex.
	   More than 5,500 of those workers _ at two car assembly plants
and two parts plants _ already have been laid off.
	   Anderson, who has worked for GM for 23 of his 41 years, said he
and his 3,500 co-workers at the truck plant expect to join the
out-of-work ranks by the weekend. He is braced for a long strike _
one that could last well into August.
	   ``Both sides are dug right in,'' he said. ``As far as we can
see, GM isn't going to back down _ they're looking to cut costs
everywhere they can.''
	   GM has declined to say if it plans to bring in parts from
alternative sources to keep the truck plant running. CAW leaders
say they will refuse to keep their members on the job if any tactic
used by GM is considered to be undermining the U.S.-based strike by
the United Auto Workers.
	   ``We have no problem as long as they operate with parts they
made prior to the strike,'' said CAW President Buzz Hargrove. ``But
if they're taking dies out of plants struck in Flint, we'd see that
as scab work.''
	   ``We would have much preferred a smooth launch (of the new
pickup),'' Hargrove said. ``But we also appreciate the position the
UAW is in _ we are sympathetic to their struggle.''
	   The UAW provided strong backing to the Canadian union during a
1996 strike in Canada, and CAW officials are intent on returning
the favor.
	   ``This strike is not about wages _ it's about job security,''
said Broadbent. ``A lot of us are happy to see the Americans
finally taking this on.''
	   Anderson said workers members at the truck plant shared the
sense of solidarity with the UAW and would be ready to strike if
the alternative was to keep their jobs while assembling parts made
by non-union employees.
	   As for the new pickup truck _ its sale price still a secret _
Anderson had mixed feelings.
	   ``It's a good-looking truck,'' he said. ``It's practically a
luxury vehicle. The average guy working here couldn't afford it.'

Peace efforts during Colombian administrations since 1982
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   A summary of developments in peace efforts during Colombian
administrations since 1982.
	   ---
	   _President Belisario Betancur (1982-1986): A faction of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) disarms in 1985 to
form the Patriotic Union (UP), a leftist political party. Fourteen
members were elected to Congress in 1986. But the movement is
decimated after some 3,000 of its members are assassinated,
including two presidential candidates, allegedly by right-wing
paramilitary groups.
	   _President Virgilio Barco (1986-1990): The M-19 rebel group
disarms in 1990 after year-long peace talks, forming a political
party. Leader Carlos Pizarro is assassinated while running for
president the same year, but his replacement finishes a strong
third in national voting. The party's political influence is now
minimal.
	   _President Cesar Gaviria (1990-1994): Several small rebel groups
disarm during 1991, including the Revolutionary Workers Party, the
Popular Liberation Army (EPL), and the armed indigenous group
Quintin Lame. But talks with the two largest rebel groups, the FARC
and the National Liberation Army, or ELN, sputter in Venezuela and
Mexico amidst increased rebel violence.
	   _President Ernesto Samper (1994-1998): Rebel groups largely shun
talks with the scandal-ridden government while gaining militarily
over a dispirited army. Secret Spain-brokered talks begin with ELN
in February 1997 but are aborted by rebels after details are leaked
to the media.
	   _President-elect Andres Pastrana (takes office Aug. 7): Vowed to
seek peace if elected and met last week with top FARC leaders,
agreeing to talks with the country's most powerful rebel faction
during his administration's first 90 days. Parallel talks began
July 12 in Germany between the ELN and Colombian civic leaders,
raising hopes for an end to the 34-year civil war.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said
Wednesday that Russia should hold early elections for the
presidency and parliament.
	   Gorbachev, in an interview with Echo Moscow radio, said early
elections would help overcome the ongoing economic crisis.
	   If early elections are not held, he said, Russia will face a
serious nationwide protest in the autumn.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A Polish woman working for the United
Nations in Georgia was shot dead by unidentified attackers at the
entrance to her apartment in the capital Tbilisi, officials said
Wednesday.
	   The U.N. Security Council condemned it as a ``terrorist act,
which must be investigated,'' council President Sergey Lavrov of
Russia said in New York.
	   However, Georgian officials said there was no evidence the
killing was political. The Foreign Ministry issued a statement
saying it was doing ``everything possible'' to establish the motive
and apprehend the killer.
	   The U.N. worker, Maria Magdalena Wewiorska, 31, was shot at
point-blank range on Tuesday evening, said Maya Musidze, a
spokeswoman for the Georgian Interior Ministry.
	   Deputy Interior Minister Demuri Murguliya said investigators
believe that Wewiorska apparently came home and startled burglars.
U.N. officials said she had recently moved to Tibilisi and was
working as a secretary for the head of the U.N. mission in Georgia.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency quoted a prosecutor, Gigla
Ogulashvili, as saying he could not rule out the possibility that
it was a ``domestic crime.''
	   The U.N. observers are in Georgia to monitor the truce between
government forces and separatists in the northwestern Black Sea
province of Abkhazia. The separatists took control of the province
in a 1992-93 war.
	   Also Wednesday, news reports said eight civilians were killed
when their horse-drawn cart hit a landmine in the breakaway
Georgian province of Abkhazia.
	   Abkhazian officials blamed pro-government militants who are
active in the separatist region, the Interfax news agency reported.

	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Ronnie Moran, who earned the nickname
``Mr Liverpool'' after nearly 50 years service with the Premier
League soccer team, announced his retirement Wednesday.
	   Moran, who joined Liverpool in July 1949 and played 379 games
for the club before joining the coaching staff, was an integral
part in the Reds domestic and European campaigns during the 1970s
and 1980s.
	   He also acted as caretaker manager in 1991 when Kenny Dalglish
left the club.
	   Club officials and former players Wednesday praised Moran for
his loyal contribution, saying he was an unsung hero and corner
stone of every Liverpool success in the last 30 years.
	   Liverpool will honor Moran by allowing the use of its facilities
at Anfield for his testimonial.

Spanish soccer federation confirms Clemente as national coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish Soccer Federation on Wednesday
confirmed that Javier Clemente's job as national squad coach is
safe despite Spain's embarrassingly early exit from the World Cup.
	   Following a meeting of the national board, Federation President
Angel Maria Villar told reporters that Clemente's contract, that
runs through the European Championships in the year 2000, has never
been in doubt.
	   Spain was among the favorites to win this year's World Cup in
France, but a dejected team returned home at the end of the first
round. The squad's 6-1 swan song victory over Bulgaria in its final
match failed to compensate for its earlier 3-2 defeat by Nigeria
and 0-0 draw with Paraguay.
	   Failure to live up to expectations had put Clemente's future in
doubt.
	   Villar apologized to the fans for the national squad's poor
World Cup performance but asked everybody ``to respect the opinion
of those of us who have confidence in Clemente.''

Diplomats visit Belgrade in effort to resume mediation

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An influential trans-Atlantic
organization met with Yugoslav officials on Wednesday to discuss
establishing a permanent presence in Kosovo to lessen fighting
between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
	   The 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which includes the United States and Canada, met with
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic. Hansjoerg Eiff, a
German diplomat leading the OSCE mission said the idea was to
``talk about all aspects of relations between OSCE and
Yugoslavia.''
	   Eiff also said OSCE would like former Spanish Premier Felipe
Gonzalez to start a mission to mediate the Kosovo conflict as soon
as possible. The Yugoslav reaction was not immediately known, but
Yugoslavia _ dominated by Serbia of which Kosovo province is a part
_ has in the past opposed such a mission as outside interference.
	   In Kosovo's capital, Pristina, an ethnic Albanian politician
criticized the organization' attempts to mediate in the region,
saying they come six years too late.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE in 1992 for fomenting
ethnic conflict in Croatia and Bosnia. It has refused to allow
permanent offices to be set up in the country until its membership
was restored.
	   But after strong pressure from the United States and from
Russia, their greatest ally, the Yugoslavs agreed last Thursday to
let an initial fact-finding mission visit Kosovo, where
Serb-Albanian fighting has killed more than 300 people since
February.
	   Other areas where OSCE would like to see permanent missions
include the Muslim Serbian region of Sandzak and Vojvodina, a
Serbian province with a large Hungarian minority, Yugoslav media
reported.
	   In Pristina, Bajram Kosumi, a top official in the ethnic
Albanian Parliamentary Party who is considered among more hardline
Kosovo Albanian officials, criticized the OSCE for sending a
mission after the conflict has advanced to such a bloody state.
	   ``The return of the OSCE mission in Kosovo could be a symbolic
gesture, which would stress the concern and interest Europe and the
international community in general have for Kosovo, but effectively
it will have little influence in the field,'' he said.
	   Fighting flared at various points in Kosovo Wednesday.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center said a group of armed
ethnic Albanians attacked a police checkpoint near the southwestern
Kosovo town of Decani, 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina,
Wednesday, wounding one policeman. Police repelled the attack, the
center said.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said three
Albanians were killed in an attack by Serb forces near Decani late
Tuesday. Two villages on the road leading to the border with
Albania fell under attack for three hours, with Serb forces setting
fire to seven houses before KLA fighters forced them to retreat,
the center said.
	   Fighting also continued Wednesday in two other regions,
Djakovica _ where one Albanian was killed and five others wounded
Monday _ and the KLA stronghold of Drenica, the center said.
	   No independent confirmation was available.
	   The leadership of the political party supporting Ibrahim Rugova
_ elected Kosovo president in elections not recognized by Serbia _
met in Pristina Wednesday to decide when the ethnic Albanian
assembly _ also elected unofficially _ is to convene. But no fixed
date was agreed on.
	   Attempts by world powers to rally the splintered Albanian
politicians behind Rugova have been unsuccessful, and with
political efforts to gain independence faltering, the Kosovo
Liberation Army continues to gain support.

U.N. official: Result of Iraq VX test could take a month
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Tests to find out whether Iraq loaded
missiles with deadly VX gas will last at least a month, a U.N.
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Six U.N. arms experts who came to Iraq recently have taken
samples from missile fragments to be sent to European laboratories,
Ewen Buchanan, the spokesman for U.N. weapons inspectors said.
	   The samples were taken from missile shards now stored in a
warehouse at the military camp in Taji, north of Baghdad.
	   On Wednesday, Iraq's Culture and Information Ministry showed
Western media representatives footage of the six scientists
gathering the samples as two U.N. monitoring cameras recorded the
activity.
	   The tests were called after a U.S. laboratory last month
determined that an examination of a different set of samples proved
that Iraq loaded VX on warheads before the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Iraq disputed the findings, and the United Nations agreed to
send the parts to laboratories in France and Switzerland for
testing.
	   In addition, the U.N. sent to Iraq a 15-member team led by Horst
Reeps, the top U.N. chemical weapons investigator, to pick up more
samples and conduct talks with Iraqi scientists on the scope of
Iraq's work with VX, a gas so deadly a few drops can kill a person.
	   Buchanan declined to comment on the result of the talks.
	   However, he said, ``results (of the tests) will not be known
before the second half of August.'' He was reached by telephone at
the U.N. headquarters in New York.
	   Iraq has admitted experimenting with VX but denies it loaded the
gas on warheads or bombs. Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapons
inspector, has said he does not doubt the accuracy of the U.S.
laboratory.
	   Buchanan said another U.N. team of 10 germ warfare experts under
Richard Spertzel, chief U.N. biological investigator, will visit
Baghdad Friday for discussions with Iraqis on the extent of their
past biological weapons program.
	   U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990 will
not be lifted until U.N. arms monitors certify that Baghdad has
eliminated all its banned weapons.

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A Polish woman working for the United
Nations in Georgia was shot dead by unidentified attackers at the
entrance to her apartment in the capital Tbilisi, officials said
Wednesday.
	   The U.N. Security Council condemned it as a ``terrorist act,
which must be investigated,'' council President Sergey Lavrov of
Russia said in New York.
	   However, Georgian officials said there was no evidence the
killing was political. The Foreign Ministry issued a statement
saying it was doing ``everything possible'' to establish the motive
and apprehend the killer.
	   The U.N. worker, Maria Magdalena Wewiorska, 31, was shot at
point-blank range on Tuesday evening, said Maya Musidze, a
spokeswoman for the Georgian Interior Ministry.
	   Deputy Interior Minister Demuri Murguliya said investigators
believe that Wewiorska apparently came home and startled burglars.
U.N. officials said she had recently moved to Tibilisi and was
working as a secretary for the head of the U.N. mission in Georgia.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency quoted a prosecutor, Gigla
Ogulashvili, as saying he could not rule out the possibility that
it was a ``domestic crime.''
	   The U.N. observers are in Georgia to monitor the truce between
government forces and separatists in the northwestern Black Sea
province of Abkhazia. The separatists took control of the province
in a 1992-93 war.
	   Also Wednesday, news reports said eight civilians were killed
when their horse-drawn cart hit a landmine in the breakaway
Georgian province of Abkhazia.
	   Abkhazian officials blamed pro-government militants who are
active in the separatist region, the Interfax news agency reported.
The Georgian Foreign Ministry blamed Abkhazian separatists, and
accused the commander of Russian peacekeeping forces of failing to
stop them.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel's parliament met a key demand of
victims' families Wednesday by establishing a committee to
investigate last year's bridge collapse which killed four
Australian athletes, a lawmaker said.
	   Micha Goldman of the opposition Labor party said he hopes the
Knesset committee will succeed in answering the concerns of
Australian families whose relatives were killed or injured when the
rickety footbridge buckled at the Maccabiah Games, or Jewish
Olympics, sending the athletes into the polluted Yarkon River below
last July 14.
	   The Australian team was on its way to the stadium during rh
opening ceremonies when the bridge collapsed. Four team members
died and dozens were injured.
	   Last week, the sister and brother-in-law of Yette Bennett, one
of the four killed in the accident, were in Israel and urged the
Knesset to set-up such a committee and establish guidelines to
ensure that such an accident would not be repeated.
	   At a court session Wednesday in the criminal trial over the
incident, the prosecution tried to show Wednesday that contractors
for the opening ceremonies took safety precautions in every area
except the construction of the footbridge that collapsed.
	   An engineer and a set designer testified in Tel Aviv Magistrates
Court about their work on installations inside the stadium where
the opening ceremonies were held.
	   Two contractors, the engineer who designed the bridge, the
director of the games and the chairman of the Maccabiah organizing
committee are on trial on charges of negligent homicide and
building without proper permits.
	   On Wednesday, engineer Sasson Assif testified that he oversaw
construction and checked the safety of installations such as a
lighting tower inside the stadium and the entrance gates to the
stadium.
	   Assif said he was not informed about the construction of the
footbridge. ``I was not even aware of it,'' he said.
	   Prosecutor Hadass Forer-Gafni noted that while the contractor
hired Assif to oversee construction inside the stadium, no one was
hired to check out the safety of the bridge.
	   Judge Edna Beckenstein asked Assif whether he would have ordered
someone to oversee construction of the bridge if he had been in
charge of it, and Assif said, ``Yes.''
	   Another witness, Dov Ben-David, testified about his design for
the stage set for the opening ceremonies
	   Forer-Gafni said she called Ben-David ``to show that the
Maccabiah invested serious effort in the way it presented itself
and in the way it dealt with other issues _ except for the
bridge.''
	   Also testifying briefly Wednesday was a policeman who drove an
ATV across the bridge the day before the collapse.

U.N. committee voices encouragement at Israel human rights report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Members of a U.N. committee investigating alleged
human rights violations in Israel said Wednesday they were
``encouraged'' by the openness of the government's first ever
report on the subject.
	   But they criticized its lack of reference to the human rights
situation in parts of the country including the densely populated
Gaza Strip.
	   Members also quizzed the Israeli government delegation
presenting the report at the U.N. headquarters in Geneva on a range
of issues including arbitrary detention of prisoners.
	   Israel is required to report to the committee on its human
rights record as part of its obligations under the international
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it ratified in 1991.
	   Human rights groups have been urging the committee to take the
country to task on a range of alleged human rights violations.
	   They include killings of Palestinians by Israeli troops,
Israel's use of physical force in interrogations of Palestinian
suspects, the arbitrary detention of dozens of prisoners without
charge or trial, and ``unfair'' trials of Palestinians in Israeli
military courts.
	   The Israeli delegation told the U.N. committee the government
had decided to make the report ``as comprehensive as possible.''
	   ``I am greatly encouraged by the transparency with which this
report has been presented,'' Lord Colville, of Britain, told other
members of the committee.
	   Colville said, however, he was disappointed it contained ``not a
word'' about the human rights situation in the Gaza strip.
	   Another committee member, Prafullachandra Bhagwati of India,
called for safeguards, such as a panel of judges, to oversee
arbitrary detentions of prisoners.
	   Committee members suggested there should be an independent
review of the continued need for Israel's use of emergency powers.
	   Israeli delegation officials told the committee there was an
internal review system aimed at ensuring the country lived up to
its international obligations. Individuals with complaints against
the country's authorities have redress through Israel's judicial
system, they said.
	   They said the use of administrative detention against Jews or
Arabs was needed in cases where the existence of Israel or the
security of its people are threatened by terrorist operations.
	   The committee continues its discussion of the report Thursday.
Israel is among several countries whose reports the committee is
considering during its 63rd session, which lasts until July 31.

	   RICHMOND, South Africa (AP) _ While army troops patrolled the
streets, peace talks collapsed Wednesday between political parties
whose rivalry is apparently behind the killings of 23 people this
month.
	   Government leaders fear the surge of violence in Richmond, a
town in KwaZulu-Natal province, will escalate. The province has a
bloody history _ 10,000 people were killed there in the last years
of apartheid and the runup to the 1994 elections, many in fighting
between supporters of the African National Congress and the rival
Inkatha Freedom Party.
	   Now, a new party _ the United Democratic Movement _ has become a
factor.
	   The party accused police of being involved in an overnight
attack on a shop belonging to one of its leaders.
	   Police were investigating what they called a break-in early
Wednesday at UDM National Secretary Sifiso Nkabinde's general
store, next door to his house.
	   UDM spokeswoman Annelize van Wyk said shots were fired at
Nkabinde's house, but no one was hurt. Nkabinde, a controversial
figure, found a police pager apparently dropped by the assailants
and spent police-issue cartridges, van Wyk said.
	   Witnesses saw the attackers arrive in a police armored vehicle,
according to van Wyk, who decried the ``obvious involvement'' of
police in the attack.
	   Residents suspect police have been involved in the recent
killings. If true, whose side they are is unclear.
	   The new round of violence came after Nkabinde was expelled as
local ANC chairman when he was fingered as an alleged informant for
the apartheid-era security forces. Nkabinde earlier this year was
acquitted of charges that he killed 16 people.
	   President Nelson Mandela, attending the burial Sunday of three
people who were killed in a July 3 massacre, noted that violence
had returned to Richmond after Nkabinde was released from jail in
April. However, Mandela did not specifically accuse Nkabinde of
being behind the killings.
	   Nkabinde has denied being behind the violence.
	   The Star, a top Johannesburg daily, said the reasons for the
killings were unclear but nevertheless posed a grave threat.
	   ``The problem is a monumental one that cannot be resolved
overnight, but immediate action needs to be taken to stop the
killings,'' wrote political correspondent Jovial Rantao.
	   Local leaders of the ANC, the UDM and the IFP were to meet
Wednesday to try to end the violence, but the ANC walked out amid a
dispute over whether an IFP or ANC official would chair the
meeting.
	   The first of hundreds more security forces the government
planned to disptch to Richmond began arriving Wednesday.
	   Uniformed soldiers carrying assault rifles patrolled in a
half-dozen armored vehicles on the roads around Richmond, set in a
hilly region 450 kilometers (280 miles) southeast of Johannesburg.
Police also were on guard.
	   Despite the developments, less tension was evident Wednesday in
the sprawling black townships surrounding Richmond than during the
weekend, when 10 people were gunned down.

of the Eskom utility company smashed windows, set cars alight and
destroyed conference rooms at the company's headquarters Wednesday.
	   About two dozen riot police confronted the strikers, who began
dispersing in the evening.
	   They are seeking a 13 percent increase and have rejected an
offer of 8 percent, the South African Broadcasting Corp. television
reported.

Soldiers arrest 32 opposition party members

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Another 32 supporters of Congo's foremost
opposition politician have been arrested just weeks after their
leader's release from five months of internal exile, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Party members of Etienne Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and
Social Progress, were arrested Tuesday at the politician's home in
a Kinshasa suburb, activists and government officials said
Wednesday.
	   Although there was no immediate explanation for the arrests,
many believed the UDSP was planning a campaign of disobedience
against President Laurent Kabila's government.
	   The clampdown follows the arrest of 12 other Tshisekedi
activists last Thursday.
	   Tshisekedi's party has been the most vocal opposition group
since Kabila took power last year following a seven-month rebel war
that ended in the ouster of the late Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko.
	   Although Kabila was widely welcomed following more than three
decades of mis-rule under Mobutu, Kabila's support has waned in the
face of growing intolerance toward opposition. In Kabila's Congo,
dozens of journalists and political opponents have been arrested,
while opposition politics have been banned.
	   Also, Congolese and Rwandan soldiers loyal to Kabila have been
accused of massacres of Rwandan refugees in the war leading up to
the takeover.
	   ``It is feared that the evil forces surrounding Mr. Kabila are
... (trying to) promote a Mobutu-era confrontation,'' said Adrien
Phongo the secretary-general of Tshisekedi's opposition party.
	   Phongo said his party wished to work together with Congo's
government.

Colombians cautiously upbeat on Germany peace results
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombians were cautiously upbeat about
agreements reached in Germany on Wednesday between civic leaders
and leftist rebels which included commitments to protect civilians
and the oil industry from attacks.
	   ``It's noteworthy, incredibly important that they have taken
steps to humanize the conflict,'' Carlos Rodriguez of the Colombian
Commission of Jurists, a leading human rights organization, told
Associated Press.
	   Rodriguez said he was concerned, however that the agreement
could be ``torpedoed'' by sectors interested in prolonging the war.
	   Asked whether he thought the rebels would stand by their word,
Defense Minister Gilberto Echeverri said ``we'll have to give it
time.''
	   In a statement read by both rebel and civilian delegates in
Germany, where the parties were cloistered since Sunday,
representatives of the 5,000-member National Liberation Army, or
ELN, Colombia's second-largest rebel group, said Wednesday they
would stop kidnapping civilians for ransom and suspend attacks on
oil pipelines.
	   Oil industry executives reacted cautiously to the announcements,
pointing out that the Mainz delegates had limited authority to
enforce accords. ``The agreement has to be done with the Colombian
government. There is nothing anybody else can do except wait and
see,'' said British Petroleum spokesman Pablo Urrutia.
	   The conferees also agreed they would push for the holding of a
national convention in Colombia in October, where rebel leaders and
a broad array of civic groups will discuss a substantive agenda for
direct peace talks between the guerrillas and the incoming
administration of president-elect Andres Pastrana, who takes office
August 7.
	   Wednesday's announcements come less than a week after Pastrana
met in Colombia with leaders of the 15,000-member Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the country's strongest rebel
group, agreeing to direct talks within 90 days of his inauguration.
	   The flurry of initiatives has sent peace expectations skyward,
but political leaders are urging caution..
	   Pastrana declined to send a representative to Mainz, but it is
rumored the president-elect, who is traveling in Europe, will meet
with ELN leaders before returning to Colombia.
	   Juan Francisco Mesa, spokesman for the Free Country Foundation,
a private anti-kidnapping group, called the rebel promise to
curtail the practice ``a great advance''. But Mesa said he was
concerned the ELN would replace the lost income by turning to other
illicit sources of financing such as drug trafficking.
	   To finance their operations the ELN seized 205 civilians during
1997 and 93 more through June of this year, according to a
presidential anti-kidnapping office which says the rebel group
currently hold 25 hostages, among them journalists, ranchers and
engineers.
	   The rebels also kidnap oil executives and bomb pipelines to
protest what they consider foreign exploitation of Colombia's
resources.

Environmentalist warns of drilling in Caspian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Oil drilling in the Kazak sector of the
Caspian Sea could be disastrous to the environment, a prominent
environmental activist warned Wednesday.
	   Mels Eleusizov, the head of the Kazak ecological organization
Tabigat, said he was particularly concerned about the shipment of a
drilling rig through Russia's Volga River to the Caspian by the
Offshore Kazakstan International Operating Co. (OKIOC).
	   ``We are not against oil companies, we are against drilling in
the Caspian,'' said Eleusizov. ``It's a crime against mankind.''
	   Eleusizov said he had formed a new environmental group, For a
Clean Caspian, and has asked international organizations for
support.
	   OKIOC is an international consortium consisting of Mobil,
Italy's Agip, British Gas, France's Total, an alliance between
British Petroleum and Norway's Statoil, Royal Dutch-Shell Group and
the local KazakhstanCaspiShelf.
	   If the drilling is successful, oil production could start by
2004, Kazakstan's national oil company Kazakhoil announced earlier
this year.

Diplomats visit Belgrade in effort to resume mediation

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An influential trans-Atlantic
organization met with Yugoslav officials on Wednesday on
establishing a permanent presence in Kosovo to lessen fighting
between Serbs and ethnic Albanians seeking independence.
	   The 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which includes the United States and Canada, met with
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic. Hansjoerg Eiff, a
German diplomat leading the OSCE mission, said the idea was to
``talk about all aspects of relations between OSCE and
Yugoslavia.''
	   Eiff also said OSCE would like former Spanish Premier Felipe
Gonzalez to start mediating the Kosovo conflict as soon as
possible. The Yugoslav reaction was not immediately known, but
Yugoslavia _ dominated by Serbia of which Kosovo province is a part
_ has in the past opposed such a mission as outside interference.
	   In Kosovo's capital, Pristina, an ethnic Albanian politician
criticized the organization' attempts to mediate in the region,
saying they come six years too late.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE in 1992 for fomenting
ethnic conflict in Croatia and Bosnia. It has refused to allow
permanent offices to be set up in the country until its membership
was restored and was likely to demand reactivated membership as the
price for allowing a serious OSCE role in Kosovo.
	   After strong pressure from the United States and from Russia,
their greatest ally, the Yugoslavs agreed last Thursday to let an
initial fact-finding mission visit Kosovo, where Serb-Albanian
fighting has killed more than 300 people since February.
	   Other areas where OSCE would like to see permanent missions
include the Muslim Serbian region of Sandzak and Vojvodina, a
Serbian province with a large Hungarian minority, Yugoslav media
reported.
	   In Pristina, Bajram Kosumi, a top official in the ethnic
Albanian Parliamentary Party who is considered among more hardline
Kosovo Albanian officials, criticized the OSCE for sending a
mission after the conflict has advanced to such a bloody state.
	   ``The return of the OSCE mission in Kosovo could be a symbolic
gesture, which would stress the concern and interest Europe and the
international community in general have for Kosovo, but effectively
it will have little influence in the field,'' he said.
	   Fighting flared at various points in Kosovo Wednesday.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center reported 13 policemen
wounded, three seriously, after Albanian militants raked their bus
with machine-gun fire and hit it with a rocket-propelled grenade.
The attack occurred in northern Kosovo, on the road connecting
Kosovska Mitrovica with Pec.
	   It also said a group of armed ethnic Albanians attacked a police
checkpoint near the southwestern Kosovo town of Decani, 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina, Wednesday, wounding one
policeman. Police repelled the attack, the center said.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said three
Albanians were killed in an attack by Serb forces near Decani late
Tuesday. Two villages on the road leading to the border with
Albania fell under attack for three hours, with Serb forces setting
fire to seven houses before KLA fighters forced them to retreat,
the center said.
	   Fighting also continued Wednesday in two other regions,
Djakovica _ where one Albanian was killed and five others wounded
Monday _ and the KLA stronghold of Drenica, the center said.
	   No independent confirmation was available.
	   The leadership of the political party supporting Ibrahim Rugova
_ elected Kosovo president in elections not recognized by Serbia _
met in Pristina Wednesday to decide when the ethnic Albanian
assembly _ also elected unofficially _ is to convene. But no fixed
date was agreed on.
	   Attempts by world powers to rally the splintered Albanian
politicians behind Rugova have been unsuccessful, and with
political efforts to gain independence faltering, the Kosovo
Liberation Army continues to gain support.

International drug ring targeted by 14 arrests in Canada, abroad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Police in Canada and three other countries have
arrested 14 suspects in an international drug trafficking ring, the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Wednesday.
	   Most were arrested in Montreal and Toronto. The others were
arrested in the United States, Mexico and Italy.
	   RCMP Inspector Ben Soave said the target of the investigation
was a crime family that runs one of the largest drug-smuggling and
money-laundering organization in the world.
	   He described the alleged leader, Alfonso Caruana, who was
arrested in Woodbridge, Ontario, as ``an organized crime icon.''
	   ``If organized crime was a hockey game, Mr. Caruana would be
(Wayne) Gretzky,'' said Soave, referring to the hockey superstar.
	   Police said the investigation lasted two years and led to the
seizure of 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of cocaine. The arrested will
be charged with drug trafficking and conspiracy to import.

Easy does it: Pressure's now off Montgomerie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Maybe the emergence of Lee Westwood
will finally allow Colin Montgomerie to be himself in the British
Open.
	   And maybe, just maybe, Montgomerie will finally contend in the
one tournament that means the most to him.
	   With Westwood his country's best hope for an Open championship,
Montgomerie clearly was more relaxed and affable on Wednesday in
discussing his chances at Royal Birkdale.
	   His assessment? Pretty good, if he can just figure out a way to
stay relaxed.
	   ``I have put a little too much pressure on myself in the past,''
Montgomerie said. ``I have learned that I play better golf when I'm
relaxed. If I relax and have good rhythm, I'm confident on the
first tee.''
	   A year has passed since Montgomerie failed miserably on his home
course of Royal Troon, shooting a 76 in the first round to
eliminate himself from contention at a layout where his father is
course secretary.
	   Royal Troon was supposed to be where Montgomerie finally won a
major. After all, he had come so close in three U.S. Opens and a
PGA, losing twice in playoffs. Instead, it was just another
disappointment in a tournament where he has missed the cut four of
the last six years.
	   ``It's human nature to feel more pressure at your own course,''
Montgomerie said. ``Unfortunately, my first round wasn't good but
the last three were. But there's less pressure this year than
last.''
	   Montgomerie has long been burdened with the expectations of the
British press and public, who saw him as the only legitimate
successor to Nick Faldo as the best hope of a country starved for
sports heroes.
	   He himself raised the expectations with a remarkable level of
play that won him the last five money titles on the European tour
and helped him to a No. 5 world ranking.
	   But at 35 he still has no major titles. And Montgomerie seems to
be getting a bit more desperate as the years go by, particularly at
home.
	   ``I'm a British golfer and this is the British Open,''
Montgomerie said. ``Obviously, it's the most important title for a
British golfer. This would be the pinnacle of anyone's career.''
	   With the 25-year-old Westwood having been made a co-favorite
along with Tiger Woods by British bookies on the strength of seven
wins in the last nine months, Montgomerie doesn't have to contend
with the excruciating pressure he found himself under last year at
Troon.
	   That may be why he took such a low key approach this year,
waiting until late Tuesday to come to Southport. He played only two
nine-hole practice rounds in preparation for Birkdale.
	   ``I've tried not to put too much pressure on myself,'' he said.
``I came in here playing OK. I'm obviously looking forward to the
challenge of it all.''
	   If Montgomerie is going to compete at Birkdale, he'll have to
avoid the big first round that has been his undoing in most of his
eight Opens. He's never broken par in the first round, even in 1994
when his eighth-place finish was his best in an Open.
	   Part of his problem is a fierce temper that tends to flare with
each missed putt or misplaced shot.
	   ``I used to get upset with myself as I knew I could do better,''
he said. ``I just have to accept the bad with the good, and I am
doing that as I get older.''
	   One thing that does figure to go Montgomerie's way is the home
gallery. That's in contrast to the U.S. Open last month where
Montgomerie was disturbed by hecklers.
	   ``That's behind us now,'' he said. ``I'm looking forward to this
weekend and the support of the British crowd.''

Environmentalist warns of drilling in Caspian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Oil drilling in the Kazak sector of the
Caspian Sea could be disastrous to the environment, a prominent
environmental activist warned Wednesday.
	   Mels Eleusizov, the head of the Kazak ecological organization
Tabigat, said he was particularly concerned about the shipment of a
drilling rig through Russia's Volga River to the Caspian by the
Offshore Kazakstan International Operating Co. (OKIOC).
	   ``We are not against oil companies, we are against drilling in
the Caspian,'' said Eleusizov. ``It's a crime against mankind.''
	   Eleusizov said he had formed a new environmental group, For a
Clean Caspian, and has asked international organizations for
support.
	   OKIOC is an international consortium consisting of Mobil,
Italy's Agip, British Gas, France's Total, an alliance between
British Petroleum and Norway's Statoil, Royal Dutch-Shell Group and
the local KazakhstanCaspiShelf.
	   If the drilling is successful, oil production could start by
2004, Kazakstan's national oil company Kazakhoil announced earlier
this year.

U.N. committee voices encouragement at Israel human rights report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CHANGES second graf to clarify that Gaza is now mostly under
Palestinian autonomy. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Members of a U.N. committee investigating alleged
human rights violations in Israel said Wednesday they were
``encouraged'' by the openness of the government's first ever
report on the subject.
	   But they criticized its lack of reference to the human rights
situation in the densely populated Gaza Strip, which was occupied
by Israel but is now mostly under Palestinian self-rule.
	   Members also quizzed the Israeli government delegation
presenting the report at the U.N. headquarters in Geneva on a range
of issues including arbitrary detention of prisoners.
	   Israel is required to report to the committee on its human
rights record as part of its obligations under the international
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it ratified in 1991.
	   Human rights groups have been urging the committee to take the
country to task on a range of alleged human rights violations.
	   They include killings of Palestinians by Israeli troops,
Israel's use of physical force in interrogations of Palestinian
suspects, the arbitrary detention of dozens of prisoners without
charge or trial, and ``unfair'' trials of Palestinians in Israeli
military courts.
	   The Israeli delegation told the U.N. committee the government
had decided to make the report ``as comprehensive as possible.''
	   ``I am greatly encouraged by the transparency with which this
report has been presented,'' Lord Colville, of Britain, told other
members of the committee.
	   Colville said, however, he was disappointed it contained ``not a
word'' about the human rights situation in the Gaza strip.
	   Another committee member, Prafullachandra Bhagwati of India,
called for safeguards, such as a panel of judges, to oversee
arbitrary detentions of prisoners.
	   Committee members suggested there should be an independent
review of the continued need for Israel's use of emergency powers.
	   Israeli delegation officials told the committee there was an
internal review system aimed at ensuring the country lived up to
its international obligations. Individuals with complaints against
the country's authorities have redress through Israel's judicial
system, they said.
	   They said the use of administrative detention against Jews or
Arabs was needed in cases where the existence of Israel or the
security of its people are threatened by terrorist operations.
	   The committee continues its discussion of the report Thursday.
Israel is among several countries whose reports the committee is
considering during its 63rd session, which lasts until July 31.

Historian: Antiquities should be protected from mistreatment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The historian who sparked an international
debate with his revelations about destructive cleaning of the
Parthenon Marbles said Wednesday that all ancient sculptures should
be examined for signs of abuse or negligence.
	   ``Destroying evidence of the past also destroys possibilities
for the future,'' said William St. Clair, a British historian
visiting Greece to discuss his recent book ``Lord Elgin and the
Marbles.''
	   In the book, published in June, St. Clair wrote that the ancient
Greek Parthenon sculptures had been cleaned with metal scrapers by
British Museum workers in an effort to whiten them in the 1930s,
irreparably damaging the patina in places.
	   The Greek government has waged a decades-long battle to bring
the Parthenon Marbles back to Greece. Lord Elgin, the British
ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, took the marbles to England in
the early 19th century.
	   Greece has charged that the removal was illegal, and is building
a museum to house the marbles. British officials have repeatedly
said they will not return the sculptures.
	   St. Clair refused to take sides in the debate over where the
marbles belong.
	   Addressing a historical conference about the Elgin Marbles, St.
Clair said their mistreatment _ and an alleged cover-up by the
British Museum _ illustrate the need to better protect the world's
cultural heritage.
	   ``I would not like to lose 10 percent of my historic surface,''
he said.
	   The marbles consist of 17 figures, part of a 145-meter
(160-yard) frieze that decorated the front of the Parthenon.

Diplomats visit Belgrade in effort to resume mediation

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES details of fighting in grafs 10-14. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An influential trans-Atlantic
organization met with Yugoslav officials on Wednesday to discuss
establishing a permanent presence in Kosovo to lessen fighting
between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
	   The 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which includes the United States and Canada, met with
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic. Hansjoerg Eiff, a
German diplomat leading the OSCE mission said the idea was to
``talk about all aspects of relations between OSCE and
Yugoslavia.''
	   Eiff also said OSCE would like former Spanish Premier Felipe
Gonzalez to start a mission to mediate the Kosovo conflict as soon
as possible. The Yugoslav reaction was not immediately known, but
Yugoslavia _ dominated by Serbia of which Kosovo province is a part
_ has in the past opposed such a mission as outside interference.
	   In Kosovo's capital, Pristina, an ethnic Albanian politician
criticized the organization' attempts to mediate in the region,
saying they come six years too late.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE in 1992 for fomenting
ethnic conflict in Croatia and Bosnia. It has refused to allow
permanent offices to be set up in the country until its membership
was restored.
	   But after strong pressure from the United States and from
Russia, their greatest ally, the Yugoslavs agreed last Thursday to
let an initial fact-finding mission visit Kosovo, where
Serb-Albanian fighting has killed more than 300 people since
February.
	   Other areas where OSCE would like to see permanent missions
include the Muslim Serbian region of Sandzak and Vojvodina, a
Serbian province with a large Hungarian minority, Yugoslav media
reported.
	   In Pristina, Bajram Kosumi, a top official in the ethnic
Albanian Parliamentary Party who is considered among more hard-line
Kosovo Albanian officials, criticized the OSCE for sending a
mission after the conflict has advanced to such a bloody state.
	   ``The return of the OSCE mission in Kosovo could be a symbolic
gesture, which would stress the concern and interest Europe and the
international community in general have for Kosovo, but effectively
it will have little influence in the field,'' he said.
	   Fighting flared at various points in Kosovo Wednesday.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center reported 13 policemen
wounded, three seriously, after Albanian militants raked their bus
with machine-gun fire and hit it with a rocket-propelled grenade.
The attack occurred in northern Kosovo, on the road connecting
Kosovska Mitrovica with Pec.
	   It also said a group of armed ethnic Albanians attacked a police
checkpoint near the southwestern Kosovo town of Decani, 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina, Wednesday, wounding one
policeman. Police repelled the attack, the center said.
	   The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center said three
Albanians were killed in an attack by Serb forces near Decani late
Tuesday. Two villages on the road leading to the border with
Albania fell under attack for three hours, with Serb forces setting
fire to seven houses before KLA fighters forced them to retreat,
the center said.
	   Fighting also continued Wednesday in two other regions,
Djakovica _ where one Albanian was killed and five others wounded
Monday _ and the KLA stronghold of Drenica, the center said.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Guus Hiddink, who coached Holland's World
Cup squad, was due to meet with Real Madrid Chairman Lorenzo Sanz
Wednesday night with the club under pressure to replace outgoing
coach Jose Luis Camacho, national Spanish television reported.
	   Sanz told reporters he would not announce who would lead
European Champions Real into the next season until he had talked to
Hiddink. The Spanish season is due to kick off August 30th.
	   Italian Nevio Scala, Hiddink's main rival for the position and
former coach of Germany's Borrussia Dortmund, met with Sanz on
Tuesday.
	   Camacho tendered his resignation last week, after less than a
month on the job, over disagreements about the contract for one of
his assistants.
	   The former Real Madrid player had replaced German Juup Heynckes
who was let go in June after one season, despite leading Real to a
record seventh European Champions title. The side defeated Dortmund
to reach the final.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ With results in from 19 of 21 provinces,
centrist Quito Mayor Jamil Mahuad today appeared headed for victory
over a banana tycoon in Ecuador's presidential runoff.
	   Elections officials gave Mahuad, who has a master's degree in
public administration from Harvard University, a preliminary 7.6
percent lead in Sunday's vote over his populist rival, Alvaro
Noboa.
	   But with results still not in from Noboa's coastal stronghold of
Guayas, Ecuador's most populous province, the margin was expected
to shrink.
	   The final result, which had been expected today, will likely be
delayed until Thursday, election officials said this afternoon.
	   ``I don't think the results will be released today because we
still do not have all the votes from Guayas,'' election tribunal
Vice President Eduardo Villaquiran said.

Rising stars try to make their mark at British Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ The only thing that separates Lee
Westwood and David Duval is which side of the Atlantic they call
home.
	   They are the hottest players in the world on their respective
sides of the pond, both in their 20s, both having won more
tournaments than anyone else during the past nine months.
	   And when the 127th British Open begins Thursday at Royal
Birkdale, both will be out to prove that the youth movement taking
over golf's major championships has room for them.
	   ``Whenever I turn up at a tournament now, I feel like I should
be in contention,'' said the 25-year-old Westwood, who has won
three of his last four starts on the European tour.
	   The 26-year-old Duval has won twice on the PGA Tour this year.
He nearly broke through with his first major at the Masters until
Mark O'Meara surged past him with birdies on three of the last four
holes.
	   ``If the opportunity presents itself, I feel like I'm certainly
ready,'' Duval said.
	   Their biggest challenge this week may not be the fickle winds
gusting along the Lancashire coast, not the heather or the gorse or
any other trouble awaiting a shot that doesn't stay in the short
grass.
	   The pressure to win their first major will be chasing them
around Royal Birkdale the same way it has chased Phil Mickelson the
past four years, the same way it has hounded Colin Montgomerie ever
since he first contended at a major in the U.S. Open six years ago.
	   Five players in their 20s have won their first major in the
1990s _ Tiger Woods and Justin Leonard last year (Masters and
British Open), Ernie Els at the 1994 U.S. Open, Lee Janzen at the
1993 U.S. Open and John Daly at the PGA Championship in 1991.
	   Of that fraternity, only Woods heard his name mentioned as a
possible winner _ Jack Nicklaus predicted he would win 10 green
jackets, but Woods was not regarded as a favorite until the
weekend.
	   ``I didn't feel a lot of pressure from the media or from just
the general public,'' Leonard said, referring to his win last year
at Royal Troon, where he came from five strokes behind in the final
round.
	   ``Most of that pressure really was put on Phil Mickelson, Davis
Love and Colin Montgomerie,'' he said. ``I'm certain that guys like
Jim (Furyk) and Darren Clarke, Lee and David, they all expect
themselves to challenge and compete _ and now the media and general
public does.''
	   If the spotlight isn't hot enough, Westwood and Duval figure to
have plenty of company in their pursuit of the Claret Jug.
	   Woods hasn't contended at a major since winning at Augusta last
year, but his length should make him a factor at Royal Birkdale,
which features two par 5s on the closing four holes.
	   And it's not like the old guard has left town. Masters winner
O'Meara, 41, finished third at Birkdale seven years ago.
	   Lee Janzen made it three in a row for the over-30 set at the
U.S. Open, and Fred Couples joins Duval as the only other two-time
winner on the PGA Tour this year.
	   And don't forget Tom Watson, who has spent this week retracing
his steps and thinking over the strategy that helped him to victory
at Birkdale in 1983, the last of his eight major championships. At
48, he has not lost sight of joining Harry Vardon with six British
Open titles.
	   ``I have a belief that I can win this tournament,'' Watson said.
	   The fierce winds that made practice rounds feel like
self-inflicted punishment subsided slightly on the eve of the Open,
but the focus on Westwood and Duval was as strong as ever.
	   ``I would say Lee Westwood must be the favorite this week,''
said Els, who is listed with Westwood as the best bets at Birkdale
by British oddsmakers. ``He has been the hottest player _ him and
David Duval.''
	   Westwood, touted by Nick Faldo as Britain's next great golfer,
has certainly lived up to the billing.
	   Starting with the Volvo Masters last year, Westwood won seven
tournaments on four continents in the past nine months, including
the Freeport-McDermott Classic in New Orleans the week before the
Masters.
	   ``I guess I would compare him to David Duval in the way that
winning is getting to be a real habit,'' Tom Lehman said.
	   Winning last week at Loch Lomond puts Westwood in position to
earn a $1 million bonus should he win this week.
	   But Westwood also carries the burden of trying to become the
first Englishman to win an Open in his native country since Tony
Jacklin at Royal Lytham in 1969. (All three of Faldo's Open
victories were in Scotland.)
	   Even though Faldo warned the British press to leave the
25-year-old alone, Westwood, with a gap-tooth smile and a game
beyond his years, seems to be doing quite fine.
	   ``I'm not afraid of winning, I'm not afraid of losing,'' he
said. ``I won't be nervous coming down the stretch if I'm leading.
It won't bother me.''
	   That nonchalance is what carried Duval through seven near-misses
on the PGA Tour. There was a steely confidence in his game that
served him well once he finally broke through in October.
	   And while Duval may not play the worldwide schedule of Westwood,
he does have the experience of contending at a major. He handled
the Sunday pressure with alarming calm, his only miscue coming on
the 16th hole with a tee shot that missed by about 10 feet (3
meters) _ the difference between possible birdie and the three-putt
bogey.
	   ``I realized the difference between major events when I got
beat, not when I was actually playing,'' Duval said. ``That was
like getting kicked in the head.''

Senegal allows relief supplies into battle-torn Guinea-Bissau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Senegal has allowed an emergency aid
shipment to cross its borders into neighboring Guinea-Bissau for
the first time since Senegalese forces joined Guinea-Bissau
loyalists trying to smash a five-week military rebellion, the U.N.
food agency said Wednesday.
	   United Nations World Food Program representative Sanda Maina
welcomed a decision by Senegal's government to allow a convoy
carrying 90 tons of food donated by a Danish aid group to cross
Tuesday into northeastern Guinea-Bissau, where thousands of
refugees sought safety after the country erupted in violence on
June 7.
	   ``This is the first aid convoy that Senegalese authorities have
allowed across the border in four weeks,'' Maina said in a
statement issued in Ivory Coast.
	   He urged Senegal to ensure that a ``humanitarian corridor'' with
Guinea-Bissau be maintained for relief agencies. Food and medical
supplies have reached some other parts of the country through
neighboring Republic of Guinea.
	   Senegalese troops have barricaded borders and joined soldiers
loyal to Guinea-Bissau's President Joao Bernardo Vieira battling
renegade troops led by a former armed forces chief, Brig. Ansumane
Mane.
	   The fighting has resulted in several hundred thousand people to
flee from their homes, and caused serious food shortages in some
safe havens in the country's interior.
	   Mane, who was fired from the military earlier this year for
allegedly supplying weapons to Senegalese separatists, has accused
Vieira of widespread corruption.

Second car accident reported during World Cup party, 10 hurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with driver charged &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A drunken lawyer who lost control of his car hit a
group of bystanders during celebrations on the Champs Elysees
following France's World Cup win, injuring about 10 people,
including two Americans, police said Wednesday.
	   In a separate incident, another car driven by a panicked
schoolteacher hit bystanders about 3 a.m. (0100 GMT) Monday,
injuring about 80 people, one of whom later died.
	   More than a million people were gathered on the avenue at the
time of both accidents, which took place soon after France defeated
Brazil in the World Cup final.
	   The accident reported by police Wednesday occurred about two
hours before the first one, when an Alfa Romeo driven by a
33-year-old Kenyan-born British lawyer hit a group of people not
far from the Arc de Triomphe.
	   The victims, including the two Americans, aged 20 and 75,
suffered main from leg injuries, scrapes and bruises. Four injured
French police cadets who were supposed to march on the Champs
Elysees during Tuesday's Bastille Day parade were among those hurt.
	   No further information on the victims was available.
	   The driver had a blood alcohol level of .91 grams per liter,
nearly twice the legal amount in France, police said. He was
charged Wednesday with deliberate violence.

Indian cabinet approves tough anti-corruption bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's federal cabinet approved a tough
anti-corruption bill Wednesday that seeks to give an independent
ombudsman sweeping powers to clean up the country's scandal-clogged
politics, domestic news agencies reported.
	   The bill to create the position of the Lok Pal (keeper of the
people) will be introduced in the current session of parliament,
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Madan Lal Khurana was quoted as
saying by Press Trust of India.
	   The bill would give the anti-corruption official the power to
consider charges of corruption against all government officials,
including the prime minister. It would be the first time an
official had such power. Few other details were available on the
proposed law.
	   Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party promised the law in its
manifesto for the February-March election. It also promised the
position in its National Agenda for Governance, which it presented
after coming to power at the head of a 20-party coalition.
	   A string of Indian political leaders have faced charges of
corruption in recent years. Former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha
Rao, ruling coalition member Jayaram Jayalalitha and powerful
regional leader Laloo Prasad Yadav are among the Indians on trial
in connection with some of the biggest corruption scandals in the
country's history.

Brazil prepares its biggest privatization ever
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANY CABRERA

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil said Wednesday that it expected
to fetch more than 15 billion reals (dlrs 12.9 billion) when it
sells its telecommunications holding company in Latin America's
biggest privatization.
	   The company, known as Telebras, will be sold in 12 parts on July
29 in auctions at the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange.
	   Communications Minister Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros said he
estimated bids would come in at 16 million reals (dlrs 13.8
billion). although market analysts were expecting bids of double
the minimum price of 13.47 billion (dlrs 11.6 billion).
	   Mendonca de Barros said 100 local and foreign companies _
between telecommunication operators, pension funds, banks and
investment groups _ should participate in the Telebras auction.
	   The government won't release the final list of approved bidders
until the morning of the auction, the minister said. Interested
bidders must submit extensive documents and financial guarantees to
qualify for the auction.
	   BellSouth of the United States, Telefonica SA of Spain and
Italy's Telecom Italia are just some of the big names expected to
launch bids.
	   Up for sale are the 12 enterprises that make up Telebras _ three
fixed-line services, eight cellular phone companies and one
long-distance carrier.
	   The government will sell 19.26 percent of its shares in
Telebras, which corresponds to 51.79 percent of the holding
company's voting capital.
	   Mendonca de Barros estimated 60 billion reals (dlrs 51.7
billion) will be invested in the country's telecommunications
sector over the next seven years. He added that the National
Development Bank will provide the sector with annual loans of 4.5
billion reals (dlrs 3.9 billion) during the same period to make
those investments.
	   He said he didn't expect any of the 12 companies to be
controlled entirely by foreign capital.
	   ``From what I can see each consortium will have a foreign
investor or operator joined by four or five Brazilian groups,''
Mendonca de Barros said.
	   Mendonca de Barros said the 20 billion to 22 billion reals (
dlrs 17.2 billion to dlrs 18.9 billion) in annual sales currently
being posted by the 12 companies is expected to grow to 50 billion
reals (dlrs 43 billion) by the year 2005.

<TEXT>
	   YEKATERINBURG, Russia (AP) _ Three days of ceremonies to bury
Russia's last czar and his family began on Wednesday in a modest
morgue in this Ural Mountains city where they were slain by
Bolsheviks 80 years ago.
	   The bones of Czar Nicholas II, his family and servants were
transferred from glass sarcophagi into small wooden coffins, and
local officials signed documents turning over responsibility for
the remains to the federal government.
	   The remains will be taken to St. Petersburg on Thursday, and
buried the next day in the cathedral where Russia's past emperors
lie.
	   But even before their arrival, they are stirring long-dormant
passions. Controversial in death as in life, Czar Nicholas II is
again dividing the nation he once ruled.
	   The funeral ceremonies, originally planned as a grandiose act of
repentance for the sins of Communism, have been scaled back because
of the controversy among the religious and political elite.
	   ``History repeats itself: It's a tragedy now turned into
farce,'' said Pyotr Gritsayenko, a forensic expert who took part in
the discovery and identification of the royal remains.
	   In St. Petersburg, several hundred priests and Russian Orthodox
believers, carrying banners and icons, rallied Wednesday on a
bridge leading to the fortress where the remains are to be buried.
	   ``This is a mockery,'' said Sergei Vasiliyev, one of the
organizers. ``God will not let this go forward.''
	   Also Wednesday, descendants of the Romanov czars laid wreaths at
a cemetery in St. Petersburg that contains the remains of many
ordinary Russians who died defending the city _ then Leningrad _
during World War II.
	   It appeared to be part of an effort by the Romanovs to reach out
to the Russian public and, perhaps, make amends for their family's
often-despotic past.
	   As solemn music was piped through speakers throughout the
cemetery, Nicholas Romanov, a distant cousin of the last czar, laid
flowers in a ceremony attended by city Gov. Vladimir Yakovlev and
scores of Romanov descendants.
	   Romanov signed a guest book: ``Nikolai Romanovich Romanov, Thank
you from all of us, the Romanovs.''
	   Nicholas II and his family were executed by Bolshevik
revolutionaries on July 17, 1918 _ 80 years ago Friday. Their
bodies were dumped in a mass grave in the forest outside
Yekaterinburg and doused with acid. They remained there until they
were unearthed in 1991.
	   The Russian Orthodox Church has refused to accept a series of
comprehensive genetic tests that scientists believe has
conclusively proven the remains' authenticity.
	   The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II,
went on television Tuesday to defend his decision not to attend the
funeral. He cited ``important scientific objections'' allegedly
casting doubt on the remains' authenticity.
	   ``To have objections, you must at least have some idea about
DNA,'' scoffed Gritsayenko, the forensic expert. ``The church's
stance has only confused ordinary people.''
	   Apparently discouraged by the church's stance, President Boris
Yeltsin canceled his plans to attend the services. The scaled-back
ceremonies will cost the federal government a relatively modest 5
million rubles (dlrs 800,000), according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   The burial procedures began in Yekaterinburg's city morgue,
which has housed the royal remains since they were dug up.
	   The coffins, each decorated with an ornately etched name plate,
hold the remains of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, three of their
five children, and four servants. The coffins of the czar and
czarina are draped with the yellow flag of the Romanov family, and
the servants' coffins are lined with silver, rather than the royal
gold.
	   The other two children, Alexei and the one scientists believe is
Maria, were executed along with the entire family, but their
remains have not been found and most investigators believe the
bodies were burned to ashes.
	   Legend has long held that Anastasia survived the shooting and
escaped, but scientific tests indicate that it is her sister Maria
whose bones are missing.
	   In Wednesday's ceremony, Anastasia's name, not Maria's, adorned
the name plate of one of the coffins handed over to the federal
government.

Workers demand better living standards in Belarus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ About 5,000 people demonstrated Wednesday
against declining living standards in Belarus and demanded that
President Alexander Lukashenko cede more authority to trade unions.
	   The demonstration in the industrial outskirts of Minsk, the
Belarusian capital, was organized by five industrial trade unions
and supported by the opposition Social Democratic Party.
	   Speakers at the rally complained that salaries were too low amid
rising prices, and demanded more control by workers in their
workplaces, including the creation of worker committees to run
factories.
	   Signs at the demonstration proclaimed ``No to miserable wages!''
and ``Stop raising prices for food!''
	   Among former Soviet republics, the economy of Belarus has
changed least since the breakup of the Soviet Union, and is still
tightly controlled by the president and his administration.

Security cabinet clashes over framework for talks with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrangled with
his security cabinet Wednesday over talks aimed at reaching
agreement with the Palestinians for an Israeli troop withdrawal,
Israel radio reported.
	   The radio added that Infrastructures Minister Ariel Sharon
warned Netanyahu that right-wing members of his coalition would
abandon him and bring down the government if Netanyahu accepted an
American proposal for a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the
West Bank now and more later.
	   The United States, in efforts to mediate an end to a 16-month
stalemate in peace talks, submitted the proposal to Israel and the
Palestinians in January. The Palestinians have accepted the deal
but Netanyahu said a 13 percent withdrawal would harm Israel's
security and despite months of efforts, the United States was
unable to coax Israel to accept the deal.
	   As a result, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
suggested the two sides meet directly to hammer out the remaining
differences and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, a relative
moderate in the cabinet, was thought to be the best choice for such
talks.
	   On Wednesday, Netanyahu met with Sharon and Mordechai, the two
members of his inner security cabinet, for three hours to discuss
strategy for the talks.
	   Israel radio and Channel 2 TV, both citing aides present at the
meeting, said the three differed greatly on how to handle the
negotiations.
	   Mordechai said he was prepared to meet with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to discuss all issues. He said before the meeting
that ``there are several matters that require direct discussions
between ourselves and the Palestinians. If the Palestinians show
flexibility I think that the security staff can advance the
progress and bring it to the government,''
	   A senior official in the prime ministry told The Associated
Press that Netanyahu insisted that Mordechai stick to two issues
only: the scope of the Israeli troop withdrawal and sections of the
PLO charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   Mordechai is believed to be among several ministers in
Netanyahu's government who are pressuring the Israeli leader to
accept the American proposal.
	   Those opposed to the deal include Sharon, who leads the
right-wing camp inside the government.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu clashed with
ministers in his security cabinet Wednesday over where Israel was
headed in upcoming talks with the Palestinians on an agreement for
an Israeli troop withdrawal, Israel Television reported.
	   In an intensive three-hour meeting, Infrastructures Minister
Ariel Sharon reportedly threatened to walk out of the coalition and
take right-wing members with him to topple the government.
	   The security cabinet, responsible for the highest ministerial
level of decision making in the peace process, met to discuss
Israel's strategy for talks with Palestinian officials, recommended
by the United States as the only route left to getting a long
overdue troop withdrawal underway.
	   Leaks from the meeting to Israeli diplomatic reporters
characterized the discussions as heated and said Netanyahu and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai sharply differed on the
framework for the talks.
	   Mordechai reportedly asked Netanyahu for leeway in his
discussions with the Palestinians but Netanyahu replied curtly,
``You are authorized only to present the Israeli stand, hear their
answers, and report back,'' Israel TV reported.
	   A senior official in the prime ministry told The Associated
Press that Netanyahu insisted that Mordechai stick to two issues
only: the scope of the Israeli troop withdrawal and sections of the
PLO charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   At issues is an American plan proposed in January for a staged
Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank while
Palestinians crackdown on terrorism.
	   Mordechai said he was prepared to meet with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to discuss all issues. He told reporters before the
meeting that ``there are several matters that require direct
discussions between ourselves and the Palestinians. If the
Palestinians show flexibility I think that the security staff can
advance the progress and bring it to the government,''
	   Sharon, who has said any pullback from more than nine percent
would harm Israel's security, reportedly told both Mordechai and
Netanyahu that he thought the scope of pullbacks being discussed
``lacked national responsibility.''
	   Sharon warned Netanyahu that right-wing members of his coalition
would abandon him and bring down the government if Netanyahu
accepted an American proposal for a troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank now and more later.
	   Netanyahu, apparently trying to calm the ex-general, told Sharon
that any troop further pullbacks would only comprise one percent of
the West Bank and added that the scope of the upcoming withdrawal
had not yet been determined.
	   ``I never promised 13 percent,'' Netanyahu was quoted as saying.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the deal but despite months of
efforts, the United States was unable to coax Israel to accept it
as well.
	   As a result, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
suggested the two sides meet directly to hammer out the remaining
differences and Mordechai, a relative moderate in the cabinet, was
thought to be the best choice for such talks.
	   Mordechai is believed to be among several ministers in

 &UR; Assad denies knowledge of Nazi war criminal's presence in Syria
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with interview being aired in France, CORRECTS that it
is TF1 not Channel One. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ President Hafez Assad has denied that Syria granted
refuge to Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner.
	   The denial came during an interview with France's TF1
television, which was aired Wednesday on the eve of Assad's visit
to France.
	   Syrian officials have often denied Brunner's presence in Syria
but this is the first time Assad has spoken on the subject.
	   Asked if he would allow a French investigating judge to visit
Syria to seek information on Brunner, Assad said: ``Nobody has told
me that he (Brunner) is in Syria. And why should Syria care about
this person?''
	   ``If you know where he is, go immediately to his address to find
out whether or not he is there,'' Assad told the interviewer.
	   Brunner is blamed for the deaths of 130,000 Jews from Germany,
Austria, France and Greece. Nazi trackers place Brunner in Syria
under the alias of Georg Fischer.
	   Brunner was placed under formal investigation by France in 1988
for crimes against humanity. France asked for his extradition and
said a French investigating judge be allowed to go to Syria to seek
information. Syria has refused. The judge's name has not been
released.
	   ``I wonder how I, while in Syria, do not know his (Brunner's)
whereabouts, while the French judge does,'' Assad said.

 &UR; Assad denies knowledge of Nazi war criminal's presence in Syria
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with interview being aired in France, CORRECTS that it
is TF1 not Channel One. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ President Hafez Assad has denied that Syria granted
refuge to Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner.
	   The denial came during an interview with France's TF1
television, which was aired Wednesday on the eve of Assad's visit
to France.
	   Syrian officials have often denied Brunner's presence in Syria
but this is the first time Assad has spoken on the subject.
	   Asked if he would allow a French investigating judge to visit
Syria to seek information on Brunner, Assad said: ``Nobody has told
me that he (Brunner) is in Syria. And why should Syria care about
this person?''
	   ``If you know where he is, go immediately to his address to find
out whether or not he is there,'' Assad told the interviewer.
	   Brunner is blamed for the deaths of 130,000 Jews from Germany,
Austria, France and Greece. Nazi trackers place Brunner in Syria
under the alias of Georg Fischer.
	   Brunner was placed under formal investigation by France in 1988
for crimes against humanity. France asked for his extradition and
said a French investigating judge be allowed to go to Syria to seek
information. Syria has refused. The judge's name has not been
released.
	   ``I wonder how I, while in Syria, do not know his (Brunner's)
whereabouts, while the French judge does,'' Assad said.
	   On the Middle East peace process, Assad blamed Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the deadlock.
	   Assad said the main obstacle to resuming the talks was
Netanyahu's insistence on peace-for-peace based negotiations rather
than land-for-peace based talks _ as agreed by the previous Labor

Joseph signs with Maple Leafs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Curtis Joseph joined the Toronto Maple Leafs on
Wednesday, the third high-priced National Hockey League goalie to
sign this week.
	   Joseph signed a four-year contract, reportedly for dlrs 24
million. He appeared headed to the New York Rangers earlier in the
week, but turned down a four-year, dlrs 22 million offer.
	   New York then turned back to Mike Richter, who re-signed
Wednesday, a four-year, dlrs 21.8 million contract. Earlier, John
Vanbiesbrouck signed with Philadelphia.
	   Joseph, 31, was 29-31-9 with a 2.63 goals-against average and
eight shutouts last season for Edmonton.
	   ``I'm ecstatic to put this jersey on,'' Joseph said. ``As a
little boy I watched the Maple Leafs, dreamed about playing for the
Leafs.''
	   There was no immediate word on the fate of Felix Potvin, the
Leafs' starting goalie.
	   Potvin will earn dlrs 2.7 million this season and then become a
restricted free agent on July 1, 1999. He made dlrs 2.5 million
last season, 10th among goalies, and dlrs 200,000 more than Joseph.
	   Potvin has spent six full seasons with the Leafs. He was
instrumental in leading Toronto to the Western Conference final in
1993 and 1994. The emergence of Potvin _ who played at the 1994 and
1996 all-star games _ cleared the way for the Leafs to trade such
goalies as Darren Puppa and Grant Fuhr.
	   Joseph leaves the Oilers after three stellar years in Edmonton.
He was spectacular in helping Edmonton to first-round upsets
against Dallas in 1997 and Colorado last season. Joseph, who played
his first five seasons in St. Louis, will be the second-highest
paid Leafs player behind captain Mats Sundin, who will earn dlrs 7
million this season.
	   Montreal, Vancouver and Florida are believed to be interested in
Potvin. Potvin, 27, was 26-33-7 with a 2.73 goals-against average
with five shutouts last season.

	   YEKATERINBURG, Russia (AP) _ Three days of ceremonies to bury
Russia's last czar and his family began on Wednesday in a modest
morgue in this Ural Mountains city where they were slain by
Bolsheviks 80 years ago.
	   The bones of Czar Nicholas II, his family and servants were
transferred from glass sarcophagi into small wooden coffins, and
local officials signed documents turning over responsibility for
the remains to the federal government.
	   The remains will be taken to St. Petersburg on Thursday, and
buried the next day in the cathedral where Russia's past emperors
lie.
	   But even before their arrival, they are stirring long-dormant
passions. Controversial in death as in life, Czar Nicholas II is
again dividing the nation he once ruled.
	   The funeral ceremonies, originally planned as a grandiose act of
repentance for the sins of Communism, have been scaled back because
of the controversy among the religious and political elite.
	   ``History repeats itself: It's a tragedy now turned into
farce,'' said Pyotr Gritsayenko, a forensic expert who took part in
the discovery and identification of the royal remains.
	   In St. Petersburg, several hundred priests and Russian Orthodox
believers, carrying banners and icons, rallied Wednesday on a
bridge leading to the fortress where the remains are to be buried.
They said they didn't believe the remains were those of the royal
family.
	   ``This is a mockery,'' said Sergei Vasiliyev, one of the
organizers. ``God will not let this go forward.''
	   Also Wednesday, descendants of the Romanov czars laid wreaths at
a cemetery in St. Petersburg that contains the remains of many
ordinary Russians who died defending the city _ then Leningrad _
during World War II.
	   It appeared to be part of an effort by the Romanovs to reach out
to the Russian public and, perhaps, make amends for their family's
often-despotic past.
	   As solemn music was piped through speakers throughout the
cemetery, Nicholas Romanov, a distant cousin of the last czar, laid
flowers in a ceremony attended by city Gov. Vladimir Yakovlev and
scores of Romanov descendants.
	   Romanov signed a guest book: ``Nikolai Romanovich Romanov, Thank
you from all of us, the Romanovs.''
	   Nicholas II and his family were executed by Bolshevik
revolutionaries on July 17, 1918 _ 80 years ago Friday. Their
bodies were dumped in a mass grave in the forest outside
Yekaterinburg and doused with acid. They remained there until they
were unearthed in 1991.
	   The Russian Orthodox Church has refused to accept a series of
comprehensive genetic tests that scientists believe has
conclusively proven the remains' authenticity.
	   The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II,
went on television Tuesday to defend his decision not to attend the
funeral. He cited ``important scientific objections'' allegedly
casting doubt on the remains' authenticity.
	   ``To have objections, you must at least have some idea about
DNA,'' scoffed Gritsayenko, the forensic expert. ``The church's
stance has only confused ordinary people.''
	   Apparently discouraged by the church's stance, President Boris
Yeltsin canceled his plans to attend the services. The scaled-back
ceremonies will cost the federal government a relatively modest 5
million rubles (dlrs 800,000), according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   The burial procedures began in Yekaterinburg's city morgue,
which has housed the royal remains since they were dug up.
	   The coffins, each decorated with an ornately etched name plate,
hold the remains of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, three of their
five children, and four servants. The coffins of the czar and
czarina are draped with the yellow flag of the Romanov family, and
the servants' coffins are lined with silver, rather than the royal
gold.
	   The other two children, Alexei and the one scientists believe is
Maria, were executed along with the entire family, but their
remains have not been found and most investigators believe the
bodies were burned to ashes.
	   Legend has long held that Anastasia survived the shooting and
escaped, but scientific tests indicate that it is her sister Maria
whose bones are missing.
	   In Wednesday's ceremony, Anastasia's name, not Maria's, adorned
the name plate of one of the coffins handed over to the federal
government.

UN sees reasonable chance for successful Cambodian elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _Voter intimidation, a lack of media access
and a ruling party that acts with impunity are all causes for
concern in Cambodia's electoral campaign, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Wednesday _ although he cited some progress.
	   The United Nations is coordinating election observers for the
July 26 vote, and Annan sent a statement to Cambodian leader Hun
Sen and other political parties in order to get his views on the
record, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told reportes.
	   Another senior U.N. official, who briefed reporters on Annan's
statement and the situation in the country ahead of the vote, said
there were any number of obstacles that could nullify the balloting
_ such as an upsurge of violence.
	   Nevertheless, as the situation stood, the United Nations gave
the election a ``reasonable chance'' for being free and fair, said
the official, who spoke on condition he not be named.
	   The elections are the first since last July's coup, when Hun Sen
ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-prime minister,
shattering a tense dual premiership formed after U.N.-sponsored
elections in 1993.
	   There has been widespread criticism that Hun Sen has stacked the
official electoral bodies in his favor, denied the opposition equal
access to the media and used intimidation and violence in an effort
to ensure he wins.
	   Though welcoming some progress, Annan statement said he
``remains concerned by discrepancies in access enjoyed by
opposition parties to the media and by persistent reports of
intimidation and impunity.''
	   He called on the government and the National Election Committee
overseeing the elections to ensure freedom of assembly and ``create
an atmosphere free from fear and intimidation,'' including promises
for voters of a secret ballot.
	   The senior U.N. official credited Cambodian authorities with
allowing Ranariddh and other opposition candidates unlimited
campaigning, except for preventing them from operating radio and
television stations they had controlled before the coup.
	   Despite the deaths last month of six people, which are believed
to be politically motivated, Cambodians have surprisingly rallied
by the thousands to attend campaign meetings, he said.
	   With enough election observers _ 300 international ones and
thousands of national ones from non-governmental organizations _
``there is a reasonable chance that the people will be able to
express their views when they enter the voting booth,'' the
official said.

Puerto Rico strike leaders seek end to walkout

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with union vote set for Thursday, details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Trying to save face _ as well as
their jobs _ union leaders sought a way on Wednesday to end their
month-old strike against the privatization of Puerto Rico's
telephone company.
	   Weeks of protests, service outages, an airport blockade and
sabotage of phone lines failed to get Gov. Pedro Rossello to budge
from his decision to sell Puerto Rico Telephone Co. for dlrs 1.9
billion to investors led by GTE Corp.
	   Instead, leaders of the two striking unions tried Wednesday to
win guarantees that returning strikers won't be fired or suspended.
	   ``Labor peace must be in exchange for something,'' said a
frustrated Annie Cruz, fiery leader of the 2,200-member Independent
Brotherhood of Telephone Employees.
	   Cruz's union set a Thursday vote to decide whether to end the
walkout. But Cruz insisted the labor movement hadn't given up on
stopping the sale, which must be approved by U.S. agencies.
	   Jose Juan Hernandez, head of the 4,200-member Independent Union
of Telephone Employees, said his union would quit the strike if
Cruz's union did.
	   After fruitless talks with Government Secretary Angel Morey,
Cruz and Hernandez planned to meet with telephone company officials
to work out an accord. Cruz said that in contrast with the hard
line taken by Morey, company president Carmen Ana Culpeper had
suggested sanctions could be avoided.
	   Cruz's remarks were a far cry from the heated rhetoric of a
two-day general strike last week by more than 60 unions in support
of the telephone workers. Thousands of strikers shut down shopping
malls, briefly blocked access to San Juan's international airport
and clogged highways to protest the sale of part of Puerto Rico's
``patrimony.''
	   The deal is the centerpiece of Rossello's privatization agenda,
which includes having private companies manage state-owned
utilities and hospitals.

Security cabinet clashes over framework for talks with
</HEADLINE>
Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrangled with
his security cabinet Wednesday over talks aimed at reaching
agreement with the Palestinians for an Israeli troop withdrawal,
Israel radio reported.
	   During a three-hour meeting, Infrastructures Minister Ariel
Sharon reportedly threatened to walk out of the coalition and
topple the government if Netanyahu accepted an American proposal
for a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, Israel
Television reported.
	   The United States, in efforts to mediate an end to a 16-month
stalemate in peace talks, submitted the proposal to Israel and the
Palestinians in January. The Palestinians have accepted the deal
but Netanyahu said a 13 percent withdrawal would harm Israel's
security. Despite months of efforts, the United States was unable
to coax Israel to accept the deal.
	   As a result, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
suggested the two sides meet directly to hammer out the remaining
differences and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, a relative
moderate in the cabinet, was thought to be the best choice for such
talks.
	   Leaks from the meeting between the three men characterized the
discussions as heated and indicated that Netanyahu and Mordechai
sharply differed on a framework for the talks.
	   Mordechai reportedly asked Netanyahu for leeway in his
discussions with the Palestinians but Netanyahu replied curtly,
``You are authorized only to present the Israeli stand, hear their
answers, and report back,'' Israel TV reported.
	   A senior official in the prime ministry told The Associated
Press that Netanyahu insisted that Mordechai stick to two issues
only: the scope of the Israeli troop withdrawal and sections of the
PLO charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   Mordechai said he was prepared to meet with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to discuss all issues. He said before the meeting
that ``there are several matters that require direct discussions
between ourselves and the Palestinians. If the Palestinians show
flexibility I think that the security staff can advance the
progress and bring it to the government,''
	   Mordechai is believed to be among several ministers in
Netanyahu's government who are pressuring the Israeli leader to
accept the American proposal.
	   Sharon, who leads the right-wing camp inside the government, is
opposed to the deal He has said any pullback from more than 9
percent would harm Israel's security and reportedly told both
Mordechai and Netanyahu that he thought the scope of pullbacks
being discussed ``lacked national responsibility.''
	   Netanyahu told Sharon that any troop further pullbacks would
only comprise 1 percent of the West Bank and added that the scope
of the upcoming withdrawal had not yet been determined.
	   ``I never promised 13 percent,'' Netanyahu was quoted as saying.

At least 20 arrests as police move against march protesters

	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ After another night of
bomb-throwing by Protestant hard-liners, police moved into the
fields near a rural church Wednesday searching for explosives,
fireworks and other weapons used in a standoff between Orange Order
marchers and the government. At least 20 people were arrested
	   Orangemen were moved out as army specialists were summoned to
deal with several suspected bombs.
	   ``Once the security cordon is lifted people will be ready to go
back,'' said David Jones, spokesman for the Orange lodges in
Portadown. ``This is definitely not the end of our protest.''
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said he still hoped to revive
proximity talks between the marchers and Catholic protesters, which
collapsed after a few hours on Saturday.
	   ``With a bit of goodwill and dialogue we can find a way 'round
this, so that people can have their right to march, but at the same
time do it in a way that is peaceful, unprovocative and where local
residents' dignity is respected as well,'' Blair said in the House
of Commons in London.
	   Police seized two crossbows, five slingshots, fireworks, five
gallons (about 20 liters) of fuel, balaclavas and two spent 9mm
cartridges in the fields near Drumcree Anglican church, where the
Orange march was stopped on July 5.
	   Three adults and a 16-year-old boy were charged with offenses
including criminal damage, obstruction and riotous behavior in
connection with the disturbances at Drumcree.
	   ``While the police will accommodate legitimate and peaceful
protest it will not tolerate the continued use of unarmed
protesters as cover for murderous acts on the security forces,''
Tom Craig, assistant chief constable for the area, said.
	   As the sun lowered Wednesday evening, scores of cars were backed
up along the Dungannon Road as Orangemen and supporters waited to
get back into the Drumcree church yard. On the Garvaghy Road,
people in twos and threes strolled in the evening sunshine.
	   ``I think it has failed,'' Garvaghy Road resident Gerry Johnston
said of the Orangemens' effort to walk the road.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ The Canadian dollar tumbled Wednesday to the
latest in a string of all-time lows against the U.S. dollar,
suffering one of its biggest one-day declines in recent months.
	   The dollar closed at 67.15 U.S. cents, down .41 from Tuesday's
close. Until last month, the dollar had never been below 68 U.S.
cents in its 150-year history.
	   The Canadian currency has been under pressure since late last
year because of weak commodity prices and the ripple effect of
Asia's economic crisis.
	   The pressure intensified Wednesday after the release of
manufacturing data for May showed that shipments fell 1.0 percent
in May, while new orders fell 0.4 percent. Both figures were well
below expectations.
	   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Finance Minister
Paul Martin both expressed confidence in the Canadian economy and
said the sinking currency is nothing to worry about.

Crossing Latin America, U.N. chief lauds world role of smaller

<TEXT>
	   MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
praised smaller nations Wednesday as indispensable players on the
world stage, saying no nation can stand alone against global
threats.
	   ``Increasingly, all countries face the same challenges,'' Annan
said in an address to Uruguay's Parliament at the midpoint of a
five-nation Latin American tour.
	   He was to fly later Wednesday to Buenos Aires, Argentina.
	   ``Some threats are overt, such as terrorism, pandemics and the
proliferation of arms. Others are insidious, such as climate
change, drug trafficking and money laundering.''
	   But Annan concluded that ``No country, no matter how big or
powerful, can ward them off alone or address them in isolation.''
And he said a ``compact'' is needed more than ever between nations
large and small.
	   The speech comes amid pressure from certain corners of the globe
_ including within Latin America, Asia and Europe _ for reforms to
allow more nations greater weight in U.N. decision-making.
	   The U.N. chief, who is from Ghana, said smaller nations can
``feel daunted'' alongside bigger and more powerful nations and may
even conclude they have little or no role to play internationally.
	   ``I would like to sound the strongest possible note to the
contrary,'' he declared. ``The small states of the world _ Uruguay
among them _ are more than capable of holding their own.''
	   As examples, he cited such nations as Denmark, Fiji and Nepal
who have played key roles in peacekeeping by providing troops,
police and observers.
	   Uruguay, he added, provides personnel for hotspots from the
former Yugoslavia to Angola, from the Iraqi-Kuwait border to the
troubled Kashmir region dividing India and Pakistan.
	   Annan also said small nations such as the Netherlands, Cameroon,
Finland and the United Arab Emirates all provide U.N. funding
``well out of proportion to their size.''
	   Earlier Wednesday, Annan met with Uruguayan President Julio
Sanguinetti, who support reforming the Security Council to make it
what he called ``more democratic.''
	   Annan signaled no change in eliminating the veto powers of the
five permanent members but said the United Nations was examining
ways to increase participation of other nations.
	   The Security Council now consists of five permanent members _
the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China _ and 10
others who serve rotating, two-year terms.
	   Many countries have called for restructuring the council to
reflect changes in the world since the United Nations was
established after World War II.
	   Annan planned to spend Thursday and Friday in Argentina before
heading on to Guatemala and Mexico.

peninsula &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council decided Wednesday to
keep a small U.N. observer mission in Prevlaka and said it was
deeply concerned that Croatia and Yugoslavia hadn't settled the
dispute over the strategic peninsula.
	   Under a resolution unanimously approved, the 28 observers will
remain in the area until Jan. 15.
	   Prevlaka, on Croatia's southernmost Adriatic tip, controls
access to the naval headquarters of Serb-led Yugoslavia. The
peninsula is the last major obstacle to the normalization of
relations between the two countries.

Rangers decide to keep Richter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with signing &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM NAZIMOWITZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When the National Hockey League merry-go-round
for free-agent goalies stopped, Mike Richter ended up right where
he started.
	   He rejoined the New York Rangers on Wednesday, signing a
four-year, dlrs 21.8 million contract.
	   ``Mike Richter is as dedicated a Ranger as you can get,''
general manager Neil Smith said at a news conference.
	   Richter, who began his career in New York in the 1989 playoffs,
appeared at one time to be heading elsewhere. He rejected at least
two other offers from the Rangers.
	   And on Monday, he looked to be on his way out when the Rangers
indicted they were ready to sign Curtis Joseph from Edmonton.
Joseph signed with Toronto on Wednesday.
	   Richter's contract does not include a no-trade clause, but for
now he will remain with the only team he has played for in nine
National Hockey League seasons.
	   ``In the end, if you achieved what you wanted to achieve, the
path doesn't make a difference, Richter said. ``I'm happiest here
and New York felt that the fit was good. It worked out the best
both ways.''
	   Richter was among three top free-agent goalies available to any
team as of July 1. He was thought to be among the two best, along
with Joseph, and a little ahead of former Rangers teammate John
Vanbiesbrouck.
	   But when Vanbiesbrouck signed a three-year, dlrs 11 million deal
last week with the Philadelphia Flyers _ Richter's hometown team _
Richter and Joseph lost leverage.
	   The Rangers then reduced their offer to Richter and were
rejected again. They turned to Joseph and were ready to give him an
extra year and more money, but still couldn't come to a deal.
	   Richter, who wanted to remain with New York, got a more
lucrative late offer from the Florida Panthers, Vanbiesbrouck's
former team.
	   Smith apparently gave in, offering Richter basically what Joseph
had turned down. Richter, who will turn 32 in September, finally
accepted.

Sponsor orders Hoch to British Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ It wasn't long ago that Scott Hoch
called the hallowed St. Andrews course the ``worst piece of mess
I've ever seen'' and promised never to return to the British Open.
	   So why is Hoch playing at Royal Birkdale this week? Easy. It's
required by his new equipment sponsor.
	   ``If it hadn't been in my contract to be here I don't know
whether I would have been or not,'' Hoch said. ``All I can tell you
is that right now it's hot in Orlando (Florida) and Jackson,
Mississippi. I might have taken the week off or I might have been
playing back home.''
	   Hoch may be the most reluctant of the 156 competitors in the
British Open, and he's certainly one of the most outspoken.
	   The veteran of 18 PGA seasons has played in the Open only twice,
in 1990 at St. Andrews where he missed the cut and in 1995, where
he finished in a tie for 68th at the same course.
	   ``The tradition of this tournament doesn't mean anything to me
compared to the States,'' Hoch said. ``It's in my contract to play
the majors for five years but there will be one exception. I guess
I will have to go to Japan or something to make up for that. After
all, why go where you don't want to go?''
	   Hoch picked a good time to return to the Open, where he has had
only unpleasant memories of St. Andrews. Birkdale is far different
from the world's oldest course, and so far Hoch has found it to his
liking.
	   ``I think the course is great and certainly better for me than
some of the courses on the Open rotation, especially one of them,''
he said. ``I'm not saying which one, although I guess you know.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WATSON ON WINNING: &LR;  Tom Watson spent his weekend watching his
15-year-old son, Michael, play a junior golf tournament at nearby
Formby. He used the time to give him some lessons in life learned
from a lifetime of golf.
	   ``It's nice to watch him succeed on the golf course but it's
also necessary for him to understand how to fail,'' Watson said.
``The more you play the game the more you realize that failure is
more prevalent than success is.''
	   Watson, of course, knows a bit about both. He's a five-time
British Open champion, whose last win in the championship came at
Royal Birkdale in 1983. He also went through some lean years with
the yips in which even his most ardent fans winced when he stood
over short putts.
	   At 48, Watson is playing in his 23rd Open. And, boosted by a win
at Colonial earlier this year, he believes he still has the game.
	   ``There's not a question that I think I can win,'' he said.
``Winning the Colonial reinforced the feeling I still have it, that
I'm not finished yet.''
	   __ &QC; 
	    &UR; WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP: &LR;  The top players in the world who qualify
for the three tournaments in the World Golf Championship series
that starts next year will get even richer.
	   The PGA Tours International Federation, composed of the five
leading golf tours, announced Wednesday the total purse for each
event will be dlrs 5 million.
	   The series begins in February with the Andersen Consulting Match
Play Championship at La Costa in California, featuring the top 64
players in the world. The NEC Invitational, which replaces the
World Series of Golf at Firestone in Akron, Ohio, will be a 72-hole
stroke play in August among members of the Ryder Cup and Presidents
Cup teams.
	   And the American Express Championship will be played in November
at Valderrama in Spain, a stroke-play event for top money-winners
on the five tours.
	   Prize money from the three tournament will count as official
money on the respective tours _ the PGA, European, South Africa,
Japan and Australasia.
	   The federation is still working on eligibility and format for
the World Cup team play, which begins in 2000. It will start in the
United States, moving to South Africa in 2001 and Japan in 2002.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LEHMAN INJURED: &LR;  A trip to a Southport amusement park didn't
turn out to be much fun for Tom Lehman.
	   Lehman, the 1996 British Open champion, had his right shoulder
in a sling after he fell off a carousel ride at Southport Fun Fair.
	   ``I'll definitely be OK,'' Lehman said. ``I was just messing
around with the kids.''
	   Lehman sought treatment immediately after Tuesday's mishap.
	   ``I'm glad to say he's responding well,'' said Michael Allen,
chief medical officer for the Royal and Ancient. ``I'm sure if he
feels he's capable of playing, he will be.''
	   Lehman has an afternoon tee time for the first round. He's
paired with Mark James and Ernie Els.

Family reunion turns into terror as Israeli shells land on home

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Ninety-year-old Daher Mourad had dreamed
of this moment for more than a decade.
	   After his sons left the country for better lives in Europe, he
built a sprawling three-story home in south Lebanon in hopes of one
day holding a family reunion.
	   But when his sons and their families finally gathered there for
the first time in 12 years, the joy was shortlived. Israeli shells
smashed into the living room while everyone was asleep Tuesday,
destroying the home and providing a terrifying reminder of the
violence that scattered the family.
	   ``We're all packing up and leaving,'' said Ferial Mourad, wife
of Mourad's son, Ghassan, a 38-year-old car dealer in Germany.
	   The couple had arrived at the home on the outskirts of Nabatiyeh
with their five children on Monday. They were joined by Ghassan's
brothers from Sweden _ Mohammed, 39, also a car dealer, and
Hussein, a 41-year-old mechanical engineer _ along with their wives
and five children.
	   The reunion had been put off for years, at first because the
sons were building new lives in Europe and later because of
Lebanon's civil war.
	   Although the war ended in 1990, Israel continues to battle
guerrillas in southern Lebanon. Nabatiyeh, 80 kilometers (50 miles)
southeast of Beirut, lies just a few hundred meters (yards) from
Israeli army lines and often bears the brunt of Israeli shelling.
	   On Tuesday, a stray Israeli tank shell hit Mourad's living room,
leaving a hole the size of a truck tire. Another shell tore through
the kitchen, and a third struck an empty bedroom. Nobody was
injured, although a pet parrot lost one wing.
	   After tending to the parrot, the entire family rushed into an
underground shelter _ an indispensable chamber in most houses on
the front line _ for the rest of the night.
	   At daybreak, a decision was made: The family would move in with
relatives nearby, and the visitors would cut short their six-week
vacation and leave Lebanon as soon as possible.
	   ``God was merciful enough to save us but we just can't sit amid
the danger and ask God to protect us,'' Ferial, Ghassan's wife
said, in an interview over cellular phone.
	   As she spoke, Daher Mourad, pleaded with his sons to leave as
soon as they can.
	   He came on the phone later to complain: ``One of the shells hit
the water tank on the roof of the house. Our house now is
uninhabitable.''
	   Israel, along with an allied Lebanese militia, has occupied
parts of south Lebanon since 1985. Lebanese guerrillas often stage
hit-and-run attacks on Israeli positions across the front line,
drawing Israeli fire that sometimes hit civilians.
	   The Mourad compound was the only house hit in the shelling
Tuesday. Other residents who heard about the unfortunate family
reunion informed reporters in Beirut.
	   On Wednesday, the family members swept broken glass of the
windows and scooped up mounds of plaster that had rained down from
the roofs.
	   ``May God punish them for what they've done'' the elder Mourad
said.

Leonard's a cautious custodian of Claret Jug
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ He lost his composure when he accepted
it a year ago at Royal Troon. Since then, Justin Leonard has been a
cautious custodian of the Claret Jug.
	   ``As far as I know it wasn't dropped,'' the defending British
Open champion said Wednesday. ``It didn't make it to any bars. It
was basically between my house and my parents' house.''
	   Now it may be time to give it back _ unless he wins again _
which hasn't happened since Tom Watson did so 15 years ago.
	   Leonard is the third consecutive American to win the Open and _
with apologies to Tom Lehman and John Daly _ probably Britain's
favorite, thanks to his humble, tearful acceptance speech.
	   The 26-year-old established himself as one of golf's best young
players at Scotland's Royal Troon when he tied the Open record by
coming back from five strokes down in the final round to win.
	   The clincher was a 35-foot (11-meter) birdie putt on the par-3
17th, and a solid par on the closing for a 65.
	   Four hours later, the course deserted and dark, Leonard
described how he returned to the 17th with a pizza and a can of
beer, and camped out behind the green.
	   ``There was a background hum from the clubhouse but hardly a
soul in sight,'' he recalled. ``There were moments on that summer
night when I could almost hear the putt dropping again.''
	   His mother and father, Nancy and Larry, at home in Dallas last
year when he won, took a guided tour of Troon this week and felt
the magic again _ in broad daylight.
	   ``My mom walked around with one of the newspaper clippings that
had the clubs I hit, the yardage, and things like that,'' Leonard
explained. ``She went through on each tee.''
	   ``They kind of walked through my round as my dad was playing.''
	   Dad's round?
	   ``It blew like 40 mph (64 kmph), I don't think he was too into
keeping score.''
	   Now the methodical Texas grinder meets Royal Birkdale, a seaside
links tangle of sand hills, pot bunkers, ankle-high rye grass _
with winds gusting up to 40 mph (64 kmph) on the eve of Thursday's
first round.
	   ``You do need to work the ball here,'' Leonard said. ``You need
to hit it very solid and, I think, keep it down. Keeping the ball
out of the wind is going to be very important for me.''
	   For Leonard, and 155 others.

U.N. committee voices encouragement at Israel human rights report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Members of a U.N. committee investigating
allegations of human rights violations in Israel said Wednesday
they were ``encouraged'' by the Israeli government's first ever
report on the subject.
	   But they criticized the report's lack of reference to the human
rights situation in the densely populated Gaza Strip, which was
occupied by Israel but now is mostly under Palestinian self-rule.
	   Members also quizzed the Israeli government delegation
presenting the report at the U.N. headquarters in Geneva on a range
of issues including arbitrary detention of prisoners.
	   Israel was required to report to the committee on its human
rights record as part of its obligations under the international
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it ratified in 1991.
	   Human rights groups have been urging the committee to take the
country to task on a range of issues including the killings of
Palestinians by Israeli troops, Israel's use of physical force in
interrogations of Palestinian suspects, the arbitrary detention of
dozens of prisoners without charge or trial, and ``unfair'' trials
of Palestinians in Israeli military courts.
	   The Israeli delegation told the U.N. committee the government
had decided to make the report ``as comprehensive as possible.''
	   ``I am greatly encouraged by the transparency with which this
report has been presented,'' Lord Colville, of Britain, told other
committee members.
	   Colville said, however, he was disappointed it contained ``not a
word'' about the human rights situation in the Gaza strip.
	   Another committee member, Prafullachandra Bhagwati of India,
called for safeguards, such as a panel of judges, to oversee
arbitrary detentions of prisoners.
	   Committee members suggested there should be an independent
review of the continued need for Israel's use of emergency powers.
	   Israeli delegation officials told the committee there was an
internal review system aimed at ensuring the country lived up to
its international obligations. Individuals with complaints against
the country's authorities have redress through Israel's judicial
system, they said.
	   They said the use of administrative detention against Jews or
Arabs was needed in cases where the existence of Israel or the
security of its people are threatened by terrorist operations.
	   The committee continues its discussion of the report Thursday.

Russia investigating attempted smuggling of weapons technology
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian government commission accused nine
companies and research institutions on Wednesday of attempting to
smuggle sensitive weapons technology out of the country, a news
agency said.
	   In Washington, the U.S. State Department said it had expressed
concerns to Russia about smuggling missile technology to Iran, and
added that it welcomed the Russian investigation.
	   According to the ITAR-Tass news agency, the Russian commission,
chaired by Economics Minister Yakov Urinson, accused the companies
and institutions of attempting to illegally export ``double-purpose
goods'' connected with weapons of mass destruction and missile
technology.
	   Such dual technologies are those that can be used for both
civilian and military purposes.
	   A U.S. State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said the United
States wanted ``to see the Russians get to the bottom of the
companies that we believe have been of assistance to Iran in its
pursuit of ... medium-range missiles.''
	   ``We have raised (this) at the highest levels _ the president
has raised it; Secretary Albright has raised it,'' he added.
``There has been progress.''
	   According to ITAR-Tass, those accused by the Russian commission
include the INOR scientific and production center, the Grafit and
Polyus research institutes, the Tikhomirov instrument-making
research institute, the Glavkosmos state organization, the
Komintern plant in Novosibirsk, the MOSO company, the
Europalace-2000 company and the Baltic state technical university.
ITAR-Tass said.
	   The agency, citing an unidentified government source, said the
commission intended to investigate further, and that the cases
could lead to administrative or criminal charges.
	   On Tuesday, the head of the Russian general staff was quoted as
saying the Russian military was stepping up efforts to control the
illicit export of military equipment and technology.
	   ``The danger of the spread of materials and technologies for the
manufacture of weapons of mass destruction and means of their
delivery is obvious,'' Chief of Staff Anatoly Kvashnin said,
according to Interfax.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Marv Albert, out of work for nearly a year
because of a sex scandal, was rehired Wednesday as a sportscaster
by the Madison Square Garden Network.
	   Albert will be the anchor of ``MSG Sports Desk'' and do radio
play-by-play on half of the New York Knicks basketball games.
	   Dave Checketts, president of Madison Square Garden, said Albert
had undergone therapy, at MSG's request, and was being rewarded for
his 30 years of service.
	   ``He got himself together in a good way,'' Checketts said. ``We
have decided that the time _ now _ is right.''
	   Albert resigned from MSG and was fired by NBC after pleading
guilty Sept. 25 to a misdemeanor assault charge in a sex case that
gained notoriety across America.
	   The sportscaster was accused of throwing his former girlfriend,
Vanessa Perhach, on a bed in a Virginia hotel room in February
1997, biting her on the back more than a dozen times and forcing
her to perform oral sex.
	   Albert has said he had a ``purely sexual'' 10-year relationship
with Perhach and suggested that she brought forcible sodomy charges
against him because she knew he was about to get engaged to someone
else.
	   The allegations about his sex life led him to abruptly stop the
trial and plead guilty to assault and battery. He offered a
grudging apology and was spared jail time if he stays out of
trouble for a year.
	   ``It was embarrassing and humbling,'' Albert said Wednesday of
the media scrutiny about the scandal. ``I went through a
nightmare.''
	   Albert spent more than three decades broadcasting the New York
Knicks and Rangers, many of them in the employ of MSG. He also was
the lead NBA announcer for NBC and also did National Football
League games for the network.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombians were cautiously upbeat about
agreements reached in Germany on Wednesday between civic leaders
and leftist rebels which included commitments to protect civilians
and the oil industry from attacks.
	   ``It's noteworthy, incredibly important that they have taken
steps to humanize the conflict,'' Carlos Rodriguez of the Colombian
Commission of Jurists, a leading human rights organization, told
Associated Press.
	   Rodriguez said he was concerned, however that the agreement
could be ``torpedoed'' by sectors interested in prolonging the war.
	   Asked whether he thought the rebels would stand by their word,
Defense Minister Gilberto Echeverri said ``we'll have to give it
time.''
	   In a statement read by both rebel and civilian delegates in
Germany, where the parties were cloistered since Sunday,
representatives of the 5,000-member National Liberation Army, or
ELN, Colombia's second-largest rebel group, said Wednesday they
would stop kidnapping civilians for ransom and suspend attacks on
oil pipelines.
	   Oil industry executives reacted cautiously to the announcements,
pointing out that the Mainz delegates had limited authority to
enforce accords. ``The agreement has to be done with the Colombian
government. There is nothing anybody else can do except wait and
see,'' said British Petroleum spokesman Pablo Urrutia.
	   The conferees also agreed they would push for the holding of a
national convention in Colombia in October, where rebel leaders and
a broad array of civic groups will discuss a substantive agenda for
direct peace talks between the guerrillas and the incoming
administration of president-elect Andres Pastrana, who takes office
August 7.
	   Outgoing President Ernesto Samper, who made contacts with the
ELN but was unable to progress in peace talks during his four year
term, called the agreements ``a historic step.''

Astronomers sweep away cosmic dust; reveal more and younger
</HEADLINE>
galaxies
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Astronomers using a sensitive new instrument have
lifted a dusty veil shrouding the universe to reveal galaxies
forming at a furious pace much deeper in space and far earlier in
time than expected.
	   A pair of studies to be published Thursday in the journal Nature
describe developing ``starburst'' galaxies observed for the first
time in patches of space at least 11 billion light-years from
Earth.
	   The galaxies were detected indirectly, by energy emissions. They
cannot be seen by optical telescopes because they are camouflaged
by dust that is characteristic of galaxies in their early stages of
development.
	   Researchers say the discoveries by astronomers at the University
of Edinburgh Royal Observatory in Scotland and the University of
Hawaii show that sections of the deep sky that had appeared empty
actually might be crammed with thousands of these bright objects,
each of which might contain billions of hot, young stars. In fact,
these starburst galaxies may be as common as all of the space
objects spotted by optical telescopes.
	   The discoveries demonstrate that astronomers may have been
missing a vital, formative period in the history of the universe.
	   The deeper astronomers peer into space, the farther back in time
they are looking. It takes so long for light from a star to reach
Earth that astronomers peering toward the far edges of space are
seeing objects as they were billions of years ago.
	   With potentially so many young starburst galaxies out there,
astronomers may have been drastically underestimating when galaxies
started forming and the rate at which they formed.
	   Up to now, astronomers believed a peak period of galaxy
formation occurred when the universe was 8 billion to 10 billion
years old. (The universe is thought to be 13 billion to 15 billion
years old.)
	   But this newly observed burst of galaxy formation may have
occurred much earlier _ perhaps when the universe was less than 2
billion years old.
	   ``The question as to exactly how far back in time this has taken
place still has some uncertainty associated with it,'' said Robert
Williams, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in
Baltimore. ``However, the basic interpretation should be correct.''
	   Also, this stellar baby boom may have peaked at a rate five to
100 times greater than previously estimated, the researchers said.
	   The findings may prompt astronomers to rewrite some early
chapters in the story of the universe.
	   ``Early, rapid star formation implies that the very first
objects might have had to form much earlier still,'' said Douglas
Scott, an astronomer at the University of British Columbia.
	   The studies were conducted in 1997-98 with the Submillimeter
Common-User Bolometer Array, or SCUBA. The instrument, developed by
the University of Edinburgh, is mounted on a 15-meter telescope at
the Mauna Kea observatory in Hawaii.
	   SCUBA has detectors that make the most rapid and extensive
measurements of invisible far-infrared light from deep space. The
very dust that obscures the young galaxies absorbs heat from the
new stars and re-radiates it in faint, longer wavelengths that
SCUBA picks up.
	   The Royal Observatory scanned a portion of the sky known as the
Hubble Deep Field.
	   Astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995 to zero in
on that region, which was thought to be a dull cosmic neighborhood.
As it turned out, the Hubble, using a regular optical telescope and
other instruments, found more than 3,000 galaxies, each containing
10 billion stars.
	   The Royal Observatory astronomers used SCUBA to look even deeper
into that portion of the sky and detected even more galaxies.
	   The other study, conducted by astronomer Amy Barger of the
University of Hawaii and seven collaborators, including four from
Japan, used SCUBA to look at other patches of the sky.

British historian: Antiquities should be protected from
</HEADLINE>
mistreatment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The historian who recently revealed how
the Parthenon Marbles were damaged by destructive cleaning methods
said Wednesday that all ancient sculptures should be examined for
signs of abuse or negligence.
	   ``Destroying evidence of the past also destroys possibilities
for the future,'' said William St. Clair, a British historian
visiting Greece to discuss his recent book ``Lord Elgin and the
Marbles.''
	   The book, published in June, revealed that the ancient Greek
Parthenon sculptures had been cleaned with metal scrapers by
British Museum workers in an effort to whiten them in the 1930s,
irreparably damaging the patina in places.
	   The Greek government has waged a decades-long battle to bring
the Parthenon Marbles back to Greece. Lord Elgin, the British
ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, took the marbles to England in
the early 19th century.
	   Greece has charged that the removal was illegal, and is building
a museum to house the marbles. British officials repeatedly have
said they will not return the sculptures.
	   St. Clair refused to take sides in the debate over where the
marbles belong when he addressed a historical conference about the
Elgin Marbles on Wednesday.
	   But he did say their mistreatment _ and an alleged cover-up by
the British Museum _ illustrates the need to better protect the
world's cultural heritage.
	   ``I would not like to lose 10 percent of my historic surface,''
he said.
	   The marbles consist of 17 figures, part of a 145-meter
(160-yard) frieze that decorated the front of the Parthenon.

Nigerian prisoners freed amid talk of elections reforms

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's military government on Wednesday
ordered the immediate release of hundreds of prisoners amid reports
that legislative elections held under the country's late dictator
would be annulled.
	   It was unclear exactly how many inmates were to be granted
freedom, although the government said in a statement that those
given clemency included at least 400 people convicted by special
military tribunals created by the late military ruler Gen. Sani
Abacha.
	   All of those to be freed had been held without trial or were
behind bars despite earlier completing their prison convictions,
the statement said giving few details.
	   The identities of the detainees were unclear and it was not
certain whether they had returned to their homes Wednesday night as
they were being held in far-flung jails across this sprawling West
African country.
	   The government said the decision to release the detainees was
intended to ``decongest the prisons and ... defend the freedom and
basic right of individuals.''
	   Many of the prisoners had earlier appealed to the country's new
military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, to review detentions
handed down by Abacha, who died suddenly in early June.
	   Abubakar has freed several dozen political prisoners, including
several prominent activists and opposition politicians. Yet the
country's most prominent detainee, presumed 1993 elections winner
Moshood Abiola, died of apparent heart failure in detention last
week amid hopes for his release. The death is being investigated by
Western doctors.
	   Since taking over, Abubakar has vowed to continue with his
predecessor's widely-criticized political transition plan, but has
also vowed to bring true civilian rule to Nigeria.
	   Abacha ruled Nigeria with an iron fist after taking power
following a bloodless 1993 coup. Nigeria has been under military
governments for all but 10 of 38 years since independence from
former colonial power Britain.
	   Earlier Wednesday, a Nigerian newspaper reported that the
government plans to annul legislative elections held under Abacha's
iron rule.
	   Legislators have been told to prepare for new elections, the
Lagos Press reported.
	   The country's new military leader, meanwhile, dissolved three
agencies Abacha had established to oversee the transition.
	   Abubakar folded the Transition Implementation Committee, the
National Reconciliation Committee and the Committee on Devolution
of Power after meeting with officials Wednesday, according to Alex
Akinyele, the chairman of the reconciliation committee.
	   The agencies had long been viewed with suspicion by Nigeria's
opposition movement, and were staffed largely with Abacha's friends
and allies.
	   Some other electoral bodies, including the National Electoral
Commission, will be restructured to help give credibility to
Abubakar's revised transition program, according to government
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Abubakar is expected to announce his transition plans sometime
this week.
	   Only a tiny fraction of registered voters turned out for April's
legislative elections, which had been billed as the first step
toward ending military rule. Opposition leaders called for a
boycott denounced the vote as rigged, while others stayed away
fearing violence.
	   But the winners of those elections are rallying their forces.
	   The legislators have formed a pressure group to fight to keep
their seats. They held a meeting Tuesday in Abuja, Nigeria's
capital, to discuss their options.
	   Pro-democracy campaigners accused Abacha of manipulating both
the presidential nomination process and the legislative elections
in the military's favor. Candidates for the 109 senatorial and 360
house seats came from the five political parties sanctioned by the
Abacha regime.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Andres Galarraga hit a pair of long home runs
Wednesday, driving in five runs as the Atlanta Braves pounded the
New York Mets 12-1.
	   Ryan Klesko also homered for Atlanta as the Braves battered five
Mets pitchers for 16 hits.
	   Denny Neagle (10-7) allowed four hits through six innings,
winning for just the second time since June 21. He struck out three
and walked three.
	   The Braves gave Neagle a quick first-inning lead against loser
Masato Yoshii (4-5). Walt Weiss opened with a single and two outs
later, Galarraga homered into the bullpen in left field, his 29th
of the season.
	   Atlanta put the game away with six in the fourth, capped by
Galarraga's 30th home run, a three-run shot to left of reliever
Bill Pulsipher. Andruw Jones drove in two runs with a double in the
inning. It was the sixth two-homer game of the season for Galarraga
and 25th of his career.
 &UR; Brewers 3, Phillies 2
	   In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Scott Karl won the first time in a
month Wednesday, allowing one earned run in seven innings as the
Brewers beat Philadelphia.
	   Karl (7-4), who last won on June 12, allowed two runs, one
earned, on five hits, striking out three and walking two.
	   Al Reyes pitched the eighth and Bob Wickman got into a jam in
the ninth, but worked out of it for his 14th save in 15
opportunities by striking out Rico Brogna and Mike Lieberthal with
the bases loaded.
	   Curt Schilling (9-9) allowed three runs on eight hits for his
major-league best ninth complete game. Schilling, who entered the
game tied with Seattle's Randy Johnson for the major-league
strikeout lead, struck out four to push his total to 189.

At least 20 arrests as police move against march protesters

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with police recovering submachine gun, explosive
crossbow bolts
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ After another night of
bomb-throwing by Protestant hard-liners, police moved into the
fields near a rural church Wednesday searching for explosives,
fireworks and other weapons used in a standoff between Orange Order
marchers and the government. At least 20 people were arrested
	   Orangemen were moved out as army specialists were summoned to
deal with several suspected bombs.
	   ``Once the security cordon is lifted people will be ready to go
back,'' said David Jones, spokesman for the Orange lodges in
Portadown. ``This is definitely not the end of our protest.''
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said he still hoped to revive
proximity talks between the marchers and Catholic protesters, which
collapsed after a few hours on Saturday.
	   ``With a bit of goodwill and dialogue we can find a way 'round
this, so that people can have their right to march, but at the same
time do it in a way that is peaceful, unprovocative and where local
residents' dignity is respected as well,'' Blair said in the House
of Commons in London.
	   Police seized a homemade submachine gun, one bomb, two
crossbows, 22 crossbow bolts with explosive tips, five slingshots,
fireworks, five gallons (about 20 liters) of fuel, balaclavas and
two spent 9mm cartridges in the fields near Drumcree Anglican
church, where the Orange march was stopped on July 5.

Vasco and River Plate to face of in Libertadores Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Vasco will be looking for payback
Thursday night at San Januario stadium where they face off against
Argentina's River Plate in the first game of the final phase of the
Libertadores Cup.
	   Last year, the Rio de Janeiro team lost to River Plate twice _
5-1 in Argentina and then 2-0 at home _ in the Supercopa and now
they're hoping to turn that losing streak around.
	   The, however, Argentines don't seem overly worried.
	   ``Vasco doesn't know how to play soccer. And we play soccer,''
River Plate coach Ramon Diaz was quoted in the Rio de Janeiro
sports daily Lance.
	   But the Brazilians promise Thursday's game won't be a repeat of
last year's matches.
	   ``I think their coach only said that because of what happened
last time. I wasn't even here, so I don't have an opinion. Our
answer will be the soccer we show them tomorrow,'' Lance quoted
Vasco striker Luizao.
	   Vasco's last defeat at the hands of River Plate was in a game
marked by violence with two of Vasco's players expelled before the
game was cut short when a Chilean linesman was injured by a fire
work set of by a fan.
	   Probable Lineups:
	   Vasco: Marcio, Marica (Mauricinho), Odvan, Mauro Galvao, Felipe,
Luisinho (Fabricio), Nasa, Juninho (Moises), Ramon, Pedrinho and
Luizao.
	   River Plate: Burgos, Hernan Diaz, Ayala, Berizzo, Placente,
Montserrat, Astrada, Berti, Gallardo, Sorin, Marcelo Salas
(Rambert).

Mexico-European Union trade talks seek rules of origin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Negotiators for a free-trade agreement
between the European Union and Mexico will seek guarantees that
European companies are prevented from using Mexico as a launching
pad to the United States, a European diplomat said Wednesday.
	   European negotiators also want to ensure that U.S. companies
don't exploit preferential tariffs under the North American Free
Trade Agreement to use Mexican operations as a springboard to
Europe, said Jacques Lecomte, ambassador of the European Commission
to Mexico.
	   Negotiators will rely on ``rules of origin,'' which require that
a certain percentage of an item be produced domestically to receive
the trade benefits of that country, Lecomte said at a news
conference,
	   ``It's not an easy thing to solve, but I believe with very clear
rules of origin it shouldn't be a problem,'' Lecomte said.
	   The 15-nation European Union and Mexico formally opened
negotiations for a free-trade agreement Tuesday in Brussels.
Negotiations are expected to take years.
	   The agreement will likely take effect in about two years, after
European parliaments and the Mexican Senate ratify it, said Helga
Winkler Camagna, Austria's ambassador to Mexico.
	   Reports of human rights abuses in Mexico's southern state of
Chiapas following a 1994 armed uprising have not hurt the trade
talks, Lecomte said.

UN sees reasonable chance for successful Cambodian elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS graf 7 to INSERTS Annan in Latin America &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _Voter intimidation, a lack of media access
and a ruling party that acts with impunity are all causes for
concern in Cambodia's electoral campaign, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Wednesday _ although he cited some progress.
	   The United Nations is coordinating election observers for the
July 26 vote, and Annan sent a statement to Cambodian leader Hun
Sen and other political parties in order to get his views on the
record, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told reportes.
	   Another senior U.N. official, who briefed reporters on Annan's
statement and the situation in the country ahead of the vote, said
there were any number of obstacles that could nullify the balloting
_ such as an upsurge of violence.
	   Nevertheless, as the situation stood, the United Nations gave
the election a ``reasonable chance'' for being free and fair, said
the official, who spoke on condition he not be named.
	   The elections are the first since last July's coup, when Hun Sen
ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-prime minister,
shattering a tense dual premiership formed after U.N.-sponsored
elections in 1993.
	   There has been widespread criticism that Hun Sen has stacked the
official electoral bodies in his favor, denied the opposition equal
access to the media and used intimidation and violence in an effort
to ensure he wins.
	   Though welcoming some progress, Annan, who was travelling in
Latin American, said in the statement he ``remains concerned by
discrepancies in access enjoyed by opposition parties to the media
and by persistent reports of intimidation and impunity.''

	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cubans welcomed the first direct flight between
the United States and Cuba in two years on Wednesday, greeting more
than 200 passengers from Miami with screams, waves and tears.
	   It was also an emotional moment for those arriving, who clapped
and cheered as Cuba came into view from the air, then wept when
they saw their relatives waiting for them in the airport terminal.
	   Angel Perera said he and his wife, Mirely, who now live in
Miami, hardly slept the night before in anticipation, eager to see
loved ones they had not seen in years.
	   ``It isn't easy to see your country in ruin _ your friends, your
family, practically with nothing,'' said Perera, who left Cuba four
years ago with one daughter and came back with two. The couple's
second child, now 18 months old, was born in the United States.
	   The flight ended a two-year ban meant to punish the communist
island for shooting down two unarmed civilian planes.
	   The resumption of flights means that families separated by the
Florida straits can see each other more easily, without having to
spend more money to fly to a third country such as the Bahamas or
Mexico.
	   ``I always wanted to fly directly. It's easier and more
comfortable with the kids,'' Perera said. ``Especially with all
these bags.''
	   Relatives and friends crowded in and around the Havana airport
terminal to meet the passengers, many of whom they had not seen
since long before direct flights were canceled.
	   The visitors, who each paid dlrs 399 for a round-trip ticket,
waved at the crowd and rushed through Cuban customs with packages
of clothes, vitamins and basic medicines such as aspirin.
	   Nine-year-old Joslyn Alvarez Dominguez waved at the crowd,
knowing his father was in there somewhere, but not remembering what
he looked like after 3 1/2 years.
	   ``Is this my father?'' he asked his mother as he reached over a
rail to touch a tall man waiting for them outside customs. ``Yes,''
she said, and the boy, dressed up for the occasion in a black tie,
smiled broadly.
	   ``He knows a lot of English now,'' said his father, Alberto Yuri
Alvarez, who works in a bakery. ``He's a man.''
	   The Boeing 767-300 rented from United Airlines landed at
Havana's Jose Marti International Airport about 10 a.m. after a
45-minute flight from Miami International Airport.
	   It was the first nonstop commercial flight to the island nation
since 1996, when U.S. President Bill Clinton canceled direct
flights to punish Fidel Castro's government for shooting down two
unarmed civilian aircraft.
	   The planes carried members of the anti-Castro exile group
Brothers to The Rescue. They were searching for refugees over
international waters when Cuban military jets shot them out of the
sky, killing four people.
	   Clinton lifted the ban on direct flights in March, after Pope
John Paul II visited Cuba in January. At the time, Clinton said the
resumption of flights and other measures were designed to build on
the Pope's trip and ``help prepare the Cuban people for a
democratic transition.''
	   The U.S. trade embargo against Cuba remains in place. But the
Treasury Department, which administers it, has granted approvals to
nine companies to resume direct flights.
	   Miami's Airline Brokers Co. _ also known as ABC Charters _ made
the first trip. Seven small charter companies were also approved,
along with American Airlines.
	   During the past two years, flights to Cuba had to stop in the
Bahamas or Mexico, increasing travel time to three hours or more.
The indirect routes also bumped up ticket prices by more than dlrs
100. With nonstop flights, travel agents say the cost will likely
inch downward.
	   But while many passengers said they were glad to be making a
quicker trip to see their relatives, some also said they were
bombarded with mixed emotions when they thought of returning.
	   As he looked out a rain-spattered window while waiting to board
the plane, Perera said that going back was difficult.
	   Working as a welder, he said he is able to support his wife and
children. But in Cuba, he said, his family must live much more
simply.
	   Just an hour before their flight touched down in a muggy Havana,
his wife warned her elder daughter about the lack of air
conditioning at the home of their relatives.
	   ``The air conditioner doesn't work,'' Perera said with a smile.
``They don't have one.''

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ The Philadelphia Flyers signed a one-year
contract extension with Ron Hextall, general manager Bob Clarke
said Wednesday.
	   The deal will keep the 34-year-old goalie with the Flyers
through 2000.
	   Hextall had a 21-17-7 record and 2.17 goals-against average in
46 games last season. He allowed one goal on eight shots in 20
minutes of relief of Sean Burke at Buffalo on April 27, his only
appearance in the Stanley Cup playoffs.
	   Hextall is the Flyers career playoff leader in games played by a
goaltender (84) and victories (45).
	   ``I look forward to completing my career in Philadelphia doing
everything possible to help the Flyers win a cup,'' Hextall said in
a release.
	   Also Wednesday, Flyers officials denied reports that the team
would trade Eric Lindros to the Toronto Maple Leafs.
	   The Flyers have had no contact with Toronto and did not intend
to trade Lindros, according to spokesman Zack Hill.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Two pictures painted by Winston Churchill sold for
a total of 115,000 pounds (dlrs 150,000) at an auction Wednesday
that also saw eager buyers snap up a black top hat worn by the
British World War II leader for 22,000 pounds (dlrs 35,000).
	   One picture, ``Blue Grass at La Cappancina,'' painted by
Churchill in 1954 in the south of France, sold for 75,000 pounds
(dlrs 120,000), more than twice the estimated price. A second
landscape by him sold for 40,000 pounds (dlrs 60,000). Both were
bought by an anonymous British buyer.
	   Despite the fact that art was just a hobby for Churchill, one
landscape fetched $241,500 at auction in November. Another
painting, from the collection of one-time daughter-in-law Pamela
Harriman, sold for $161,000 in May.
	   Churchill's personal possessions also sold well. A pair of
monogrammed velvet slippers were bought for 5,500 pounds (dlrs
8,800), while an engraved gold cigar case given to Churchill by the
late Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis was bought for 38,000
pounds (dlrs 60,000).
	   The sale of Churchill's artwork and possessions was part of a
Sotheby's auction of works of art and memorabilia relating to
political figures.

Now that she has Wimbledon, Novotna wants more majors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAHWAH, New Jersey (AP) _ The smile comes quickly to Jana
Novotna's face these days.
	   She jokes about being recognized by fans as she walks down the
street, kids about the ``choke label'' placed on her after near
misses in some majors and blushes about winning this year's
Wimbledon's doubles title with a slight hangover.
	   Nothing seems to bother her, and why should it?
	   Novotna, 29, has been riding the crest of winning the Wimbledon
women's singles title some two weeks ago, her first grand slam
title since turning pro more than 11 years ago.
	   ``Now that I have finally done it, I really feel the relief and
the kind of satisfaction I got out of this, and it's more than I
could ask for,'' Novotna said Wednesday during a news conference
for the A and P Tennis Classic, an exhibition that also features
Anna Kournikova and Steffi Graf.
	   Winning Wimbledon has not changed Novotna's life dramatically,
but it's obvious she feels a tremendous sense of accomplishment _
and relief _ since beating Nathalie Tauziat in straight sets.
	   ``I know that it was a big thing for me and I can feel from the
comments from ordinary people watching the match it was a big thing
for them as well,'' said Novotna, who lost two heartbreaking
three-set Wimbledon finals, in 1993 to Graf and in 1997 to Martina
Hingis. ``I'm glad I not only did it for myself, but also everyone
rooting for me and cheering for me.''
	   Novotna and Hingis combined to win the doubles title the
following day, and Novotna said that was as memorable, considering
she celebrated the night before with champagne and other
refreshments.
	   With a blush, Novotna admitted she was still feeling the effects
of the celebration the next day.
	   ``I still did very well,'' she quipped. ``I said maybe this is
working and I should do it more often. I was really enjoying myself
in the doubles. I was really feeling good.''
	   Novotna, who has not lost since the quarterfinals of the French
Open in early June, isn't feeling any pressure to add a couple more
grand slam titles now that she has her first.
	   However, she would not be surprised if she wins a few more,
starting with the U.S. Open in September.
	   ``I think if I can keep going with the same confidence and with
the same enjoyment I have at this moment on the court, it could
easily happen,'' she said. ``If it doesn't happen, my dream just
came true a week ago, and that was the ultimate goal. Anything I
can do afterward is a bonus.''
	   Speaking of bonuses, Novotna said she earned a few monetary ones
winning Wimbledon and she added that her overall value has
increased.
	   A perfect example is this event. Novotna got at least a dlrs
100,000 appearance fee late last week to play here, with her first
match coming against Kournikova on Thursday.
	   After this event, Novotna said she plans to take a month off and
play in tournaments at Montreal and New Haven, Conn. before the
U.S. Open. During the off time, she'll rest and then work on her
game, which she thinks is good enough to win another major and
maybe even get the No. 1 ranking in women's tennis.
	   It would be another thing to smile about for the new Jana.

Haiti's Preval nominates education minister to become new premier

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ In a bid to resolve a year-old
political crisis, Haitian President Rene Preval nominated his
education minister Wednesday to become prime minister.
	   The nominee, agronomist Jacques-Edouard Alexis, 50, was rector
of Quisqueya University before becoming education minister in 1996.
If confirmed by the legislature, Alexis would be Haiti's first
prime minister since Rosny Smarth resigned in June 1997.
	   Smarth quit to protest Preval's alleged complicity in tainted
April 1997 legislative elections that were unfavorable to Smarth's
majority party.
	   Preval had nominated a replacement for Smarth three other times.
But Congress, dominated by Smarth's party, rejected Preval's
choices.
	   Alexis' chances of approval appear better. In a significant
political breakthrough, Preval and Smarth's majority party agreed
July 8 to set up a panel to organize new legislative and municipal
elections.
	   Without a prime minister running the government, foreign donors
have shied away from Haiti, withholding hundreds of millions of aid
dollars from the impoverished Caribbean nation.
	   The United States, which invaded Haiti to restore a democratic
government in 1994, had repeatedly urged Haiti's leaders to break
their stalemate. Early this month, a U.S. congressional delegation
warned that U.S. aid might be cut off if a new government wasn't
installed.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton is seeking to double U.S. aid to
Haiti, from dlrs 70 million to dlrs 140 million. Republicans in the
U.S. Congress have objected.
	   U.S. officials also have urged Haiti to organize new elections,
and creation of a new electoral panel is a first step in that
direction.
	   Because of the fraud claims, runoff elections to the April 1997
legislative vote were postponed indefinitely. Every party but that
of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide _ which finished
strongly in the vote _ refused to participate in runoff races.
	   The new panel, whose members haven't been chosen, is charged
with organizing elections for sometime next year. It will review
the results of the 1997 legislative races as well as voting for
local municipal councils to determine whether they should be
annulled.
	   Aristide's party, whose members control many local councils,
opposes any revisions.
	   Aristide also opposes the government's internationally backed
economic policies, which include the transfer of inefficient
state-owned enterprises to private hands.

Brown returns to defend Deposit Guaranty Classic title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN HAWKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADISON, Mississippi (AP) _ Billy Ray Brown is still trying to
find the perfect balance between remaining competitive on the PGA
Tour and being a family man.
	   After winning last year's Deposit Guaranty Golf Classic, Brown
cut back his playing schedule to spend more time at home with his
wife and young daughter. He is enjoying the family time, but his
golf performance has been inconsistent.
	   ``It affects my golf game, it really does,'' Brown said. ``I
used to live and die by the way I played. It's just a change of
priority and a change of heart. My family is very important to me.
	   ``But don't mistake that with me not having a burn in my gut
when I'm out here. I still have that fire,'' he said Wednesday.
	   After blowing a two-stroke lead at No. 17 in the final round
last year, Brown hit gutsy 4-wood shot to the green on the 18th
hole. That set up a two-putt birdie and a one-stroke victory over
former Houston teammate Mike Standley.
	   Brown is one of former 11 Deposit Guaranty winners at Annandale
Golf Club this week. But there has been only one two-time winner in
the previous 30 Mississippi tournaments, Dwight Nevil in 1973 and
1974.
	   ``It's always good to be back anywhere where you played well,
especially where you won,'' Brown said. ``It revives a lot of
memories, and also gives me a lot of confidence. I haven't played
particularly well this year.''
	   The 7,157-yard Annandale course designed by Jack Nicklaus will
play longer, at least for Thursday's first round. More than three
inches of rain has fallen here since Monday, including six straight
days of some rain through Wednesday.
	   Among the others in the 143-player field is Jim Gallagher Jr.,
who like Brown is trying to get back to top form. The Mississippi
native's PGA Tour exemption from two 1995 victories runs out after
this season.
	   ``I'm on the verge of doing something good. I can't find any
more excuses,'' Gallagher said. ``Things are going better.''
	   Gallagher, 37, has missed three straight cuts after making four
of five before that. But he has already made dlrs 141,483 _ more
than last year _ and is ranked 115th on the money list.
	   David Toms, 38th on the money list, is coming off a fourth-place
finish in last week's Quad City Classic. The eighth-year pro from
LSU has already won a career-best dlrs 519,922, with eight top-25
finishes.
	   ``I feel pretty confident. And this week, with this type of
weather and this type of grass (bermuda), I feel a lot like I'm
playing at home. It's the same atmosphere,'' said Toms, who is from
Shreveport, La., about a four-hour drive on Interstate 20.
	   At this point last year, Brown was considering a drastic cutback
in his schedule and possibly leaving the tour.
	   ``When I came here last year, I hadn't played well. I starting
thinking about how it would be good to be home with family, and
that after 12 years it might be time to hang it up,'' Brown, 35,
said. ``I messed up, played good one week and won a golf
tournament. Now I have to play a couple of more years.''
	   Brown has missed 11 of 17 cuts this season, and has been in the
money for just one of the seven events he has played since early
May. He has made just dlrs 45,563 overall and is 171st on the money
list. But his tour exemption from the 1997 DGGC victory runs
through next season.

Ecuador vote count nears end with Quito mayor leading

apparent winner, Noboa accusations of vote fraud. &QL;

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ A Harvard-educated mayor who promised to
end corruption in Ecuador's politics has apparently been elected
president, defeating a banana tycoon who says the election was
marred by fraud.
	   With more than 99 percent of the vote counted from Sunday's
runoff, Quito Mayor Jamil Mahuad had 51 percent and rival Alvaro
Noboa had 49 percent, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal reported
Wednesday.
	   Although the lead is statistically insurmountable, election
officials have not yet declared Mahuad the winner. A tribunal
spokesman said results will not be official until they are
announced Thursday.
	   Ecuadoreans have waited anxiously for three days for the final
vote results. Both candidates have claimed victory based on exit
polls, and Noboa charged that the vote was riddled with fraud.
	   About 100 Noboa supporters surrounded the elections office in
the port city of Guayaquil, Noboa's hometown, after he told them to
go there to protect his votes.
	   ``They have forced us to militarize vote-counting centers to
protect the people working there,'' said Patricio Vivanco,
president of the electoral tribunal.
	   Foreign observers who monitored the election rejected Noboa's
fraud charges, pronouncing the vote fair.
	   Noboa said his private exit poll showed him winning by 3
percentage points. He accused election officials of awarding blank
ballots to Mahuad and marking ballots in his favor. He refused to
concede the election to Mahuad.
	   Noboa's press office said it had sent a letter to the armed
forces protesting the alleged fraud. ``This serious crime against
democracy _ electoral fraud _ must not be consummated,'' it said.
	   Mahuad, 48, and Noboa, 47, were the top vote-getters in the
first round of voting on May 31. Neither won an outright majority,
necessitating a runoff.
	   The winner will take over the Andean nation of 12 million people
with its democracy and economy in tatters. The economy is expected
to grow by no more than 1 percent in 1998, battered by El
Nino-driven floods and mudslides and falling prices for its main
export, oil.
	   Ecuador's 19-year-old democracy almost collapsed in February
1997, when Congress removed eccentric President Abdala Bucaram from
power for ``mental incapacity.''
	   Congress named Fabian Alarcon as interim president, but for 48
chaotic hours following Bucaram's ouster, three people all claimed
to be president.
	   During his six years as Quito's mayor, Mahuad earned a
reputation as a clean, effective politician. He had the support of
Ecuador's political elite and business community.
	   Noboa, Ecuador's richest man, campaigned as the candidate of the
poor and had the support of Bucaram's Roldosista party.

Australian parliamentary report denounces Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Israel &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Israel's approach to the Middle East
peace process was denounced as short-sighted and a tragedy in a
strongly worded parliamentary report just four weeks before a visit
to Australia by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The Wednesday report was made by a parliamentary delegation to
Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Israel, led by Speaker Ian Sinclair.
	   ``The delegation concluded that the current position adopted by
the Israeli government on the peace process is very
short-sighted,'' the report said.
	   ``The delegation is of the view that the peace process has
entered a critical period which demands timely action.
	   ``The response of the Netanyahu government, however, suggests it
has concluded that delay is to Israel's advantage.''
	   The report warned that Israel was placing its future at risk by
stalling the peace process.
	   It puts pressure on Prime Minister John Howard ahead of his
meeting with Netanyahu next month in Australia.
	   ``The delegation welcomes the prospect of a visit to Australia
by Prime Minister Netanyahu because it would give another
opportunity to express the strong view of the Parliament,
government and people of Australia that an early settlement is
essential and that the present stance of the Israeli government is
not contributing to the achievement of that goal,'' the report
said.
	   The report also attacked Israel's handling of the Maccabiah
Games bridge collapse, which killed four Australian athletes
exactly a year ago.
	   ``The delegation was disappointed with the (Knesset) Speaker's
response that an (parliamentary) inquiry would not be held unless
new evidence came to light,'' it said.
	   ``The delegation is disappointed by the position taken by both
the Knesset and the Israeli government on the issue.''
	   David Bar-Illan, a spokesman for Netanyahu, said the report was
an ignorant piece of Palestinian propaganda written out of pique
because the prime minister was too busy to meet the delegation.
	   ``Having read the report ... it sounds to me like the delegation
was trying to compete with Arabian Nights,'' Bar-Illan told Radio
National.
	   ``There is hardly a sentence in which the facts are accurate.
I'm very disappointed that anyone could come to this country and
write what looks and reads like a PLO (Palestinian Liberation
Organization) propaganda tract.''
	   The report interfered in Israeli politics, he said.
	   ``When I also read in it something recommending to the people of
Israel to understand that it is their government that is standing
in the way of peace agreement, it is not only patronizing but an
outright and a rather outrageous interference in domestic affairs
of Israel,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   ``The fact is the whole report does not mention one word of the
continuous 100-year-old aggression that we've been subjected to
here.''

At least 20 arrests as police move against march protesters

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with police allowing eight Orangemen to return to
church
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ After another night of
bomb-throwing by Protestant hard-liners, police moved into the
fields near a rural church Wednesday searching for explosives,
fireworks and other weapons used in a standoff between Orange Order
marchers and the government. At least 20 people were arrested
	   Orangemen were moved out as army specialists were summoned to
deal with several suspected bombs.
	   ``Once the security cordon is lifted people will be ready to go
back,'' said David Jones, spokesman for the Orange lodges in
Portadown. ``This is definitely not the end of our protest.''
	   Jones and seven other officers were allowed to return to the
church at around midnight to maintain a token presence. Police said
they wanted the numbers of protesters strictly limited in future,
but Jones said the issue had not been discussed.

Pak stirs memories for Nancy Lopez
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM O'CONNELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW ROCHELLE, New York (AP) _ Only a handful of golfers have
experienced the kind of season Se Ri Pak is having on the LPGA
tour.
	   And Nancy Lopez knows it best.
	   The similarities between Lopez's 1978 rookie season and Pak's
first year on tour are enough to cue the spooky background music.
	   Lopez's LPGA record of five consecutive victories was set that
year and the third tournament in the streak was played at Wykagyl
Country Club.
	   Pak has won the last two tour events and she will attempt to
keep her streak going this weekend at the JAL Big Apple Classic at
Wykagyl Country Club.
	   Both were 20-year-old rookies and each won a major tournament
during their streak.
	   Oh, yeah, they will be playing together on Thursday and Friday.
	   ``I'm very excited about being paired with her,'' Lopez said
Wednesday. ``Usually playing with somebody who's doing so well rubs
off and maybe I'll start playing well, too.''
	   Lopez has missed the cut in her last three starts, the longest
such run of her Hall of Fame career. Pak has missed almost nothing
the last two weeks, winning the U.S. Open in a 20-hole playoff and
then setting LPGA records with a round of 61 and 23-under 261 total
in last week's Jamie Farr Kroger Classic.
	   ``When I see people playing the way she is, it always brings
back memories for me,'' Lopez said. ``I went through that same
thing 20 years ago. I thought I was going to win everything. She
would never say it, but I'm sure Se Ri feels the same way right
now.''
	   The two played a practice round Tuesday at Wykagyl and that
showed Lopez just how well Pak is handling all that goes with
sudden fame.
	   ``We were playing dlrs 1 for closest to the pin and she was just
loving it and I saw how she was able to focus so well over the
ball, hit it, then break up and have fun,'' Lopez said. ``That's
the way to not burn out. She has to do that. I did it.''
	   Pak recalls first starting to play golf in South Korea and
watching Lopez on television.
	   ``I start golf at 14 and three years later I saw Nancy on TV in
women's tournament,'' she said. ``I remember her because of smiling
even when she didn't play good. My goal then was to be like her.''
	   Pak took some hits from the media and fans for her stoic
demeanor early in the season. As her English improves, her smile
has become as much of a trademark as her deadly short irons.
	   She leads the money standings, and with the McDonald's LPGA
Championship is the tour's only three-time winner this year.
	   ``It is like I just dreaming,'' she said. ``I want to play
slowly. I want to learn about golf and see the best players play.''
	   She won't have to look far to see one of the best ever for the
next two days. Lopez and Pak were grouped for the first two rounds
of the McDonald's in May.
	   ``Her caddie said she was nervous but she beat the heck out of
me and JoAnne Carner,'' Lopez said. ``We'll enjoy this more because
we've gotten to know each other a little better.''
	   Pak said the conversation during the practice round was fun.
	   ``I tell Nancy, `When you were 20 I was little baby,''' she
said, giggling.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein
Barrillas demanded Wednesday that the head of the Roman Catholic
Church's human rights group disclose the names of two military men
allegedly involved in a bishop's murder.
	   Ronaldo Ochaeta, head of the Archdiocese Human Rights Office,
said this week in Spain that two officers may be linked to the
April slaying of Bishop Juan Gerardi Conodera.
	   Without revealing names, Ochaeta said one of the officers is
still on active duty on President Alvaro Arzu's staff, while the
other is retired.
	   Gerardi was killed in the garage of his home two days after he
released a human rights report that blamed the army for most of the
atrocities in Guatemala's 36-year civil war.
	   The only suspect arrested in the killing so far, 24-year-old
worker Juan Carlos Vielma, claims he is innocent.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A judge in western Guatemala increased the
sentences of 11 former paramilitary members serving time for the
1993 killing of an activist, and opened procedings against the
retired general who commanded them.
	   The judge in Quezaltenango, 65 miles (110 kms) west of Guatemala
City, increased the men's sentences from 14 years to 25 years on
Tuesday. The men had appealed the sentences in the hopes of getting
them reduced.
	   And he opened proceedings against retired Gen. Luis Felipe
Miranda Trejo, who was in charge of the Huehuetenango military zone
at the time of the killing.
	   The members of the paramilitary ``Civil Defense Patrols'' opened
fire on a march protesting their activities in 1993, killing
activist Juan Chanay Pablo. They were convicted and sentenced soon
after.
	   Miranda, who retired two years ago, has never been charged. He
denies involvement in Chanay's death.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombian prosecutors said Wednesday
they have asked former U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette to tell them
what he knows about a planned 1995 coup against President Ernesto
Samper.
	   The prosecutors' office said it was reiterating a written
request it first made in September 1997. Frechette did not respond.
	   In August 1996, Frechette said he was approached a year earlier
by a group of Colombian civilians seeking U.S. support to overthrow
Samper. At the time, Samper was mired in scandal over charges that
his campaign took donations from drug traffickers.
	   The diplomat said he declined the request and never identified
the civilians. Frechette, who served in Colombia from July 1994 to
November 1997, could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A top investigator in the Mexico City police
department has been forced to resign after it was disclosed he was
convicted of kidnapping, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Antonio Carrillo Luna left his office after a report of his
criminal record surfaced, apparently on Tuesday, the newspapers
said. Authorities said they were trying to confirm the report.
	   Several Mexico City papers identified Carrillo as the deputy
director of investigations for the city's Judicial Police. The
Attorney General's Office said Carrillo was not deputy director and
that his job was merely administrative.
	   Carrillo was convicted of kidnapping a businessman in 1989 and
served four years in prison. The newspapers reported that Carrillo
entered the city's police force in 1997 after apparently managing
to erase the conviction from his record.
	   ___
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Former President Patricio Aylwin, who
restored civilian rule to Chile after the long military
dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, remained hospitalized
Wednesday with acute gastritis.
	   Aylwin, who ruled from 1990 to 1994, was admitted the day before
at the private Las Condes Clinic, and was still undergoing tests.
	   The clinic said the 79-year-old Aylwin was expected to be
released by Thursday morning.
	   In 1989, Aylwin won a landslide election that Pinochet was
forced to call after he lost a referendum in which he sought to
extend his rule until 1998. Pinochet ruled from 1973 to 1990.
	   ___
	   XALAPA, Mexico (AP) _ A passenger bus skidded off a road in the
Gulf state of Veracruz on Wednesday and rolled down an embankment,
injuring at least 30 people.
	   According to a report by the Federal Highways Police, the crash
occurred before dawn near the port of Coatzacoalcos, 320 miles
southeast of Mexico City.
	   Police said most of the injured were hospitalized in serious
condition.
	   ___
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ President Ernesto Perez Balladares
warned construction workers Wednesday the strike they are
threatening may cause great harm to the nation's economy.
	   ``The repercussion for workers, employers and the economy will
be such that I feel duty bound to call upon you all to reflect on
it,'' Perez Balladares said during a weekly radio address.
	   Perez Balladares said that, among other consequences, a strike
by the nation's 15,000 construction workers could cut short this
year's record 5 percent economic growth.
	   The National Construction Workers Union is threatening a walkout
beginning Monday to demand a wage increase of 54 cents an hour.
Management says it will not increase wages beyond 12 cents an hour.
	   The workers typically earn between dlrs 200 and dlrs 300 a
month.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ George Foreman keeps looking for something in
the mirror that he doesn't see.
	   ``I'd like to wake up one morning and be old like everybody
else,'' Foreman said. ``But I keep looking in the mirror and
saying, ``Go for it, George.''
	   But when he looks across the ring Jan. 23, 13 days after his
50th birthday, Foreman will be looking at a mirror image of
himself. His opponent for a scheduled 12-round fight that night
will be Larry Holmes, who turns 49 Nov. 3.
	   Promoter Roger Levitt of Boxing International said a site for
the bout, dubbed ``The Birthday Bash,'' would be announced in
September. He said the possibilities are three unidentified Las
Vegas hotels or Madison Square Garden in New York.
	   The way the two former heavyweight champions were tossing out
one-liners at a news conference Wednesday, maybe they ought to get
together in Las Vegas lounge.
	   Foreman called the fight the Eighth Wonder of the World,
prompting someone to wonder if the two aging champions might have
all the maneuverability of the Great Pyramids.
	   Holmes said he had a chance to fight Foreman in 1976, but
couldn't take the bout because he had broken a thumb in beating Big
Roy Williams that year. Foreman instead fought Dino Denis and
knocked him out.
	   In 1976 Holmes was a future champion and Foreman was a once and
future champion.
	   ``It's one of those things that should have happened a long time
ago,'' Foreman said. ``But I'm happy it didn't because it wouldn't
have meant anything. This fight will lead the nation, the whole
world into the next millennium.''
	   Boxing critics will see a match between two men whose ages total
99 years as a step backward. And the leading question regarding the
bout is this: Why?
	   ``It's pride,'' Holmes said. ``A lot of pride. George don't want
to go out there and lose and get beat up. He wants to win. The same
thing for me.''
	   ``I'm going to get in that ring at between 227 and 235 pounds
(102 and 106 kg),'' said Foreman, who has weighed between 250 and
260 pounds (113 and 117 kgs) for his last 22 fights.
	   Holmes has weighed between 240 and 248 pounds (108 and 112 kgs)
for his last six bouts.
	   Foreman smiled when someone said he might be outweighed by an
opponent.
	   ``I'm not getting in that ring as a 50-year-old man but as a
conditioned athlete,'' Foreman said. ``If I get out there and
really function at 50, people will say, `Hey, man, I can do such
and such.''
	   But along with pride on Jan. 23 will be money.
	   ``If I turned dlrs 4 million down, I'd have to be crazy,''
Holmes said.
	   Foreman said Holmes has been seeking a fight for a long time,
adding, ``I can only take so much money.'' His audience laughed and
so did Foreman, whose purse will be dlrs 10 million for the
pay-per-view match.
	   The total age of the two fighters is probably the highest in
boxing history. Joe Bugner and former champion James
``Bonecrusher'' Smith totaled 93 years when Bugner, 48, won their
July 4 fight. Smith, 45, quit after the first round, saying he had
a dislocated right shoulder.

Hundreds cheer as opposition returns to Guyana's parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Opposition party members on Wednesday
marched back into the parliament they had boycotted for seven
months, rekindling hope of reconciliation in racially divided
Guyana.
	   The 23 lawmakers of the People's National Congress were led by
former president Desmond Hoyte and cheered by hundreds of
placard-waving supporters gathered outside the National Assembly
building. Two other members were absent, citing personal matters.
	   Hoyte's party claimed President Janet Jagan's People's
Progressive Party rigged the Dec. 15 elections. Violent riots and
firebombings tore through the South American country until
mid-January, then erupted again in June after an international team
of auditors declared the election fair.
	   Hoyte and Jagan agreed to a truce earlier this month at a summit
of the Caribbean Community trade bloc in St. Lucia.
	   On Wednesday, the lawmakers led a march of more than 900
supporters from Georgetown's Square of the Revolution to the
parliament building. ``End discrimination now!'' said banners
carried by some of the marchers.
	   National Congress supporters are mainly of African descent, and
they claim the ethnic East Indians that dominate Jagan's party deny
them government jobs and limit their role in government.
	   The legislators were sworn in under television lights while
dozens of uniformed police nervously supervised a group of their
supporters. Police reported no problems.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's military government on Wednesday
ordered the immediate release of hundreds of prisoners amid reports
that legislative elections held under the country's late dictator
would be annulled. It was unclear how many inmates were to be
granted freedom, although the government said that those given
clemency included at least 400 people convicted by special military
tribunals created by the late military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha. All
of those to be freed had been held without trial or were behind
bars despite earlier completing their prison convictions, the
government said, giving few details. The country's new military
leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has freed dozens of political
prisoners, including several prominent activists and opposition
politicians. However, the country's most prominent detainee,
Moshood Abiola, died of apparent heart failure in detention last
week. The death is being investigated by Western doctors.
(NIGERIA-ELECTIONS).
	   QUITO, Ecuador _ A Harvard-educated mayor who promised to end
corruption in Ecuador's politics has apparently been elected
president, defeating a banana tycoon who says the election was
marred by fraud. With more than 99 percent of the vote counted from
Sunday's runoff, Quito Mayor Jamil Mahuad had 51 percent and rival
Alvaro Noboa had 49 percent, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal
reported Wednesday. Although the lead is statistically
insurmountable, election officials said final official results
would be announced Thursday. Both candidates have claimed victory
based on exit polls, and Noboa charged that the vote was riddled
with fraud. (ECUADOR-ELECTION).
	   PARIS _ President Hafez Assad has denied that Syria granted
refuge to Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner. The denial came during
an interview with France's TF1 television, which was aired
Wednesday on the eve of Assad's visit to France. Syrian officials
have often denied Brunner's presence in Syria but this is the first
time Assad has spoken on the subject. Assad said: ``Nobody has told
me that he is in Syria. And why should Syria care about this
person?'' Brunner is blamed for the deaths of 130,000 Jews from
Germany, Austria, France and Greece. Nazi trackers place Brunner in
Syria under the alias of Georg Fischer. Brunner was placed under
formal investigation by France in 1988 for crimes against humanity.
France asked for his extradition and said a French investigating
judge be allowed to go to Syria to seek information. Syria has
refused. The judge's name has not been released. (SYRIA-FRANCE)
	   YEKATERINBURG, Russia (AP) _ Three days of ceremonies to bury
Russia's last czar and his family began Wednesday in a modest
morgue in this Ural Mountains city where they were slain by
Bolsheviks 80 years ago. The bones of Czar Nicholas II, his family
and servants were transferred from glass sarcophagi into small
wooden coffins, and local officials signed documents turning over
responsibility for the remains to the federal government. The
remains will be taken to St. Petersburg on Thursday, and buried the
next day in the cathedral where Russia's past emperors lie. But
even before their arrival, they are stirring long-dormant passions.
Controversial in death as in life, Czar Nicholas II is again
dividing the nation he once ruled. The funeral ceremonies,
originally planned as a grandiose act of repentance for the sins of
Communism, have been scaled back because of the controversy among
the religious and political elite. (RUSSIA-CZAR'S BURIAL)

Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Technology shares propelled the Nasdaq market to
a sixth straight record, but most stocks pulled back Wednesday amid
some mild profit-taking on Tuesday's rally. An early 60-point gain
put the Dow Jones industrial average above 9,300 for the first
time, but the blue-chip barometer finished about 11 points lower
for the day at 9,234. Broader indicators were mixed Wednesday, with
decliners outnumbering advancers overall, but the technology-heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose more than 1 percent despite a slight
earnings disappointment from Intel. Although Intel's profits were
down 29 percent from a year ago and just below forecasts. But
compared with recent quarters, it was somewhat optimistic about its
near-term prospects, and the chipmaker's stock rose more than 4
percent as the most active Nasdaq issue. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The hard-line parliament held a special session
Wednesday to debate President Boris Yeltsin's economic austerity
plan, key to implementing a dlrs 17.1 billion in new loans to help
stabilize financial markets that have been in a tailspin for
months. But legislators managed to pass only five measures and
spent the rest of the day on unrelated business. The government's
plan contained more than 20 proposals, and parliament's verdict on
it could determine whether international lenders proceed promptly
their bailout package, which would provide urgently needed cash for
Russia. Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said he hoped parliament
would pass the entire economic plan, but said the government had
fallback plans if the package is not approved. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ With police poised to arrest their
leaders, some 55,000 employees of telephone and other state-run
companies and five banks joined a nationwide strike Wednesday to
protest layoffs, labor leaders said. Organizers said the new
walkouts brought to about 110,000 the number of workers
participating in the strike begun Tuesday by metal workers in auto,
shipbuilding and other heavy industries. But the Labor Ministry
said fewer than 60,000 workers had joined the strike. It said many
union members disobeyed their leaders and did not take part.
Earlier Wednesday, police said they were seeking to arrest about
four dozen union leaders on charges of organizing illegal strikes.
The government said the strike would not hurt manufacturing
industries, most of which already have large inventories of unsold
goods. (SKOREA-LABOR)
	   FLINT, Michigan (AP) _ The United Auto Workers agreed Wednesday
to let an independent arbitrator decide whether its strikes against
General Motors Corp. are legal under their contract. The strikes
have shuttered 25 assembly plants and more than 100 parts plants
across North America, and idled about 178,600 workers. In light of
the Wednesday agreement, federal Judge Paul V. Gadola said he would
hold the UAW and GM to their word to schedule a hearing with the
arbitrator soon. He asked the parties to return to his courtroom
Tuesday to report on what progress they've made toward scheduling a
meeting with the arbitrator. The judge said there was no indication
that the union had engaged in foot dragging so far, as GM's
attorney alleged. The strikes have shuttered 25 assembly plants and
more than 100 parts plants across the United States, Canada and
Mexico, and idled about 178,600 workers. GM, the No. 1 U.S.
automaker has lost about dlrs 1.2 billion. (US-GM-STRIKE)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ WorldCom's takeover of MCI Communications
Corp. won conditional approval Wednesday from antitrust
authorities, clearing a major regulatory hurdle to the deal valued
at dlrs 37 billion. The U.S. Justice Department _ like European
antitrust regulators last week _ cleared what would be one of the
biggest U.S. mergers on the condition MCI sell all of its Internet
business. MCI agreed to sell the rest of its Internet business and
announced Wednesday that it found a buyer: London-based Cable and
Wireless PLC, which in May agreed to buy MCI's wholesale Internet
business. Now it also will acquire MCI's retail Internet business
for dlrs 1.75 billion _ a move satisfying regulators on both sides
of the Atlantic. The merger also be approved by the U.S. Federal
Communications Commission, which is expected to act next month.
Shares in both companies rose Wednesday in advance of the
anticipated approval. (US-MCI-WORLDCOM)

Guyana says it would not arrest former Surinamese dictator
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyanese police would ignore an
international arrest warrant for former Surinamese dictator Desire
Bouterse if he visits, Guyana's foreign minister said Wednesday.
	   ``Suriname is a neighboring country with us, and you don't just
jump and do things to antagonize your neighbor,'' said Foreign
Minister Clement Rohee.
	   Bouterse, 52, caused a diplomatic stir last week when he visited
the twin-island Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago. Dutch
prosecutors asked Trinidadian officials to arrest him, but they
refused.
	   Rohee said Guyana would do the same because it does not have an
extradition treaty with the Netherlands.
	   ``We have no plans to arrest anybody from a neighboring country
if there is no extradition treaty,'' he said.
	   Bouterse seized control of Suriname through a coup in 1980, five
years after the country won independence from the Netherlands. The
United States and Netherlands suspended aid to the country after 15
of his political opponents were executed.
	   Bouterse resigned after elections in 1987, but he remained a
political power broker and masterminded another bloodless coup in
1991. His party lost the 1992 elections, but Bouterse helped forge
a governing alliance and pushed the party to victory again in 1996.
	   He is frequently mentioned as a possible presidential candidate
in the 2000 elections.
	   Dutch officials claim he used his influence to shield a
smuggling operation that brought more than 1,300 kilograms of
cocaine into the Netherlands between 1989 and 1995. The Interpol
warrant was issued in August 1997.
	   Bouterse remains an adviser to Surinamese president Jules
Wijdenbosch, who has refused to extradite him.

 &UR; HAITI: Preval nominates fourth choice for new premier &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ In a bid to resolve a year-old
political crisis, Haitian President Rene Preval nominated his
education minister Wednesday to become prime minister.
	   The nominee, agronomist Jacques-Edouard Alexis, 50, was rector
of Quisqueya University before becoming education minister in 1996.
If confirmed by the legislature, Alexis would be Haiti's first
prime minister since Rosny Smarth resigned in June 1997.
	   Smarth quit to protest Preval's alleged complicity in tainted
April 1997 legislative elections that were unfavorable to Smarth's
majority party.
	   Preval had nominated a replacement for Smarth three other times.
But Congress, dominated by Smarth's party, rejected Preval's
choices.
	   Alexis' chances of approval appear better. In a significant
political breakthrough, Preval and Smarth's majority party agreed
July 8 to set up a panel to organize new legislative and municipal
elections.
 &UR; GUYANA: Hundreds cheer as opposition returns to parliament
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Opposition party members on Wednesday
marched back into the parliament they had boycotted for seven
months, firing hope of reconciliation in racially divided Guyana.
	   The 23 lawmakers of the People's National Congress were led by
former president Desmond Hoyte and cheered by hundreds of
placard-waving supporters gathered outside the National Assembly
building. Two other members were absent, citing personal matters.
	   Hoyte's party claimed President Janet Jagan's People's
Progressive Party rigged the Dec. 15 elections. Violent riots and
firebombings tore through the South American country until
mid-January, then erupted again in June after an international team
of auditors declared the election fair.
	   Hoyte and Jagan agreed to a truce earlier this month at a summit
of the Caribbean Community trade bloc in St. Lucia.
	   On Wednesday, the lawmakers led a march of more than 900
supporters from Georgetown's Square of the Revolution to the
parliament building.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Anti-Castro group leader denies any links to
smuggling
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The leader of an anti-Castro group that flies the
Florida Straits in search of fleeing Cubans denied any involvement
in refugee smuggling missions in an appearance Wednesday before a
federal grand jury.
	   The panel is investigating the interception of 37 Cubans aboard
a boat southeast of Miami last month on the basis of a relative's
report of smuggling negotiations and down payments for the roughly
100-mile (160-kilometer) crossing from Cuba to Florida.
	   Jose Basulto, president of Brothers to the Rescue, was
subpoenaed after his group received telephone calls from a woman at
El Palacio de los Jugos, a popular Miami fruit stand and juice bar,
around the time of the crossing.
	   Members of the family that owns El Palacio were implicated in
the smuggling run, including a cook who has been arrested.
	   If the payments reported by the relative of one of the smuggled
Cubans were the same for everyone aboard, the smugglers would have
collected more than dlrs 100,000 in down payments and about dlrs
285,000 for the completed trip.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Strike leaders seek end to walkout
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Trying to save face _ and the jobs
of their members _ union leaders sought Wednesday to end their
month-old strike against the privatization of Puerto Rico's
telephone company.
	   Weeks of protests, service outages, an airport blockade and
sabotage of phone lines failed to get Gov. Pedro Rossello to budge
from his decision to sell Puerto Rico Telephone Co. for $1.9
billion to investors led by GTE Corp.
	   Instead, leaders of the two striking unions tried to win
guarantees that returning strikers won't be fired or suspended.
	   ``Labor peace must be in exchange for something,'' said a
frustrated Annie Cruz, the militant leader of the 2,200-member
Independent Brotherhood of Telephone Employees.
	   Cruz's union set a Thursday vote to decide whether to end the
walkout. She insisted the labor movement hadn't given up on
stopping the sale, which must be approved by U.S. federal agencies.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Coast Guard to crack down on Cuban entries
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The U.S. Coast Guard on Wednesday declared most of
Florida a ``security zone'' to help it restrict exiles planning to
enter Cuban territory illegally.
	   Restrictions previously in place only in South Florida were
expanded to ports as far away as Fernandina Beach north of
Jacksonville and St. Marks south of Tallahassee, the Coast Guard
said in a release.
	   Operators of private boats up to 150 feet long must get a permit
if they plan to go to Cuba from ports within the restricted area.
	   A boat in the security zone could be seized and those aboard
subject to prosecution that could bring up to 10 years in prison
and a dlrs 10,000 fine if a Cuba trip is planned without a permit,
according to the release.
	   The policy, initiated by the Justice Department and presidential
proclamation, went into effect Tuesday, the Coast Guard said.
	   The action is intended to curb unauthorized forays into Cuban
waters by the Democracy Movement, whose leader, Ramon Saul Sanchez,
has eluded previous restrictions by setting out from ports in
central or northern Florida.
 &UR; GRENADA: Second opposition party to protest Castro's visit
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ The smaller opposition United
Republican Party is joining a growing movement against a visit to
Grenada this summer by Cuban President Fidel Castro.
	   Party Leader Clem Langdon said Tuesday the group's supporters
plan to organize a protest on the day of Castro's arrival. No date
has been set for the visit.
	   The largest opposition party, the Grenada United Labor Party,
said last week it would protest the visit because party leaders
were persecuted following a 1979 leftist coup that established a
government friendly to Cuba.
	   The United States led an invasion in 1983 to oust another
socialist junta and drive out armed Cuban construction workers who
were building the Point Saline International Airport.
	   Castro is expected to unveil a plaque at the airport, address a
rally and sign a new technical cooperation agreement.
 &UR; GUYANA: Police not arrest former dictator, foreign minister says
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyanese police would ignore an
Interpol arrest warrant for former Surinamese dictator Desire
Bouterse if he visits, Guyana's foreign minister said Wednesday.
	   ``Suriname is a neighboring country with us, and you don't just
jump and do things to antagonize your neighbor,'' foreign minister
Clement Rohee said.
	   Bouterse, 52, caused a diplomatic stir last week when he visited
the twin-island Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago. Dutch
prosecutors asked Trinidadian officials to arrest him, but they
refused.
	   Rohee said Guyana would do the same because it does not have an
extradition treaty with the Netherlands.
	   Bouterse seized control of Suriname through a coup in 1980, five
years after the country won independence from the Netherlands. The
United States and Netherlands suspended aid to the country after 15
of his political opponents were executed.
 &UR; CUBA: Tears greet first direct flights from U.S. in two years
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cubans welcomed the first direct flight between
the United States and Cuba in two years on Wednesday, greeting more
than 200 passengers from Miami with screams, waves and tears.
	   It was also an emotional moment for those arriving, who clapped
and cheered as Cuba came into view from the air, then wept when
they saw their relatives waiting for them in the airport terminal.
	   Angel Perera said he and his wife, Mirely, who now live in
Miami, hardly slept the night before in anticipation, eager to see
loved ones they had not seen in years.
	   ``It isn't easy to see your country in ruin _ your friends, your
family, practically with nothing,'' said Perera, who left Cuba four
years ago with one daughter and came back with two. The couple's
second child, now 18 months old, was born in the United States.
	   The flight ended a two-year ban meant to punish the communist
island for shooting down two unarmed civilian planes.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Time running out for Puerto Rican statehood
supporters
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With fewer than 40 legislative days remaining
before a new Congress is elected in November, the chances of the
Senate approving a plebiscite for Puerto Rico are diminishing
rapidly.
	   Both supporters and opponents of Puerto Rican statehood want the
Senate to authorize the plebiscite to help determine the future
political status of the Caribbean island.
	   The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which has
jurisdiction over U.S. territories, began hearings on the issue
Tuesday and was scheduled to hear Wednesday from Clinton
administration officials and lawmakers in both houses.
	   But while the committee may act favorably on a plebiscite, the
measure is not likely to make it to the Senate floor for a vote
before the 105th Congress adjourns, committee officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Although Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott already has said
there isn't enough time, proponents of Puerto Rican statehood are
trying to change his mind.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Parliament members to meet in Kingston July 21-25
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Members of parliaments from across the
Western Hemisphere will meet July 21 through July 25 in Kingston,
Jamaica, organizers announced.
	   About 50 delegates from 12 countries in the Americas, Atlantic
and Caribbean divisions of the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association will discuss ways to manage and educate lawmakers in
British-style parliamentary governments.
	   They will also exchange ideas for legislation, said Peter
Phillips, leader of government business in the Jamaican
legislature, on Tuesday.
	   The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is an 87-year-old
organization that now has branches in 119 national, state,
provincial and territorial parliaments.

17 deaf Mexican vendors return home after captivity in United

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Seventeen deaf Mexicans freed from captivity
in a New York City apartment last year have returned voluntarily to
an uncertain future in their homeland, despite an offer of U.S.
residence status.
	   Dazed by an unfamiliar sign language and the jailing of
countrymen they depended on to mediate with the outside world _ the
same people convicted of exploiting them _ most of the deaf trinket
vendors were welcomed by family members at the Mexico City airport
Wednesday.
	   The deaf workers complained of the abuse to which they were
subjected by their captors, most of them also deaf Mexicans, and at
the same time conceded that they couldn't continue living in the
United States without them.
	   ``It seemed difficult to stay in the United States, there was no
one to help us and we couldn't say anything, we couldn't buy
things,'' signed Alberto Vazquez Avila, 21, who arrived with his
wife Analberta and their 6-month-old son Javier.
	   A total of 49 deaf immigrants were given permission to remain in
the United States after cooperating with prosecutors in the trials
of their former captors, who confiscated their earnings, abused
them and held them in virtual slavery in cramped quarters in a New
York apartment.
	   Eighteen people _ all Mexicans, and most of them deaf _ were
convicted of charges ranging from enslavement to immigrant
smuggling in the scheme and ordered to pay back the millions they
took from their countrymen.
	   Vazquez and his small family waved to photographers and
relatives upon their arrival at Mexico City's International Airport
and held up the three-finger sign meaning ``hello.''
	   But Vazquez's father, Jaoquin Valladares, said his son and his
daughter-in-law ``have no prospects for employment in Mexico.''
	   Pedro Portillo, Analberta's father, made a plea for authorities
to provide more help for Mexico's deaf.
	   ``They chose Mexico ... they love Mexico, but let's ask the
Mexican government to love them. They're not second-class
Mexicans,'' Portillo said.
	   Not all of the deaf _ 13 adults and four children _ had family
members at the airport to meet them. Three deaf women will be
placed under the care of social workers until their relatives can
be located.
	   That possibility seemed remote, considering that many deaf
people in Mexico speak a non-standard sign language that isolates
them, and know one another by signed nicknames.
	   Sara, an energetic, dark-haired woman, said she returned because
U.S. food made her sick and she was unable to understand U.S. sign
language. Still, she was full of praise for U.S. police who
``always helped me.''
	   Now she's looking for a husband she left in Mexico, whom she
knew only by a signed nickname.
	   ``I had his (legal) name written on a piece of paper, but then
they (her captors) took it away from me,'' Sara said.
	   She didn't know her own last name.

Deputy economy minister resigns in Argentina
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's deputy economy
minister will resign Aug. 1 to return to academia, the economy
minister said Wednesday.
	   Deputy minister Carlos Rodriguez will return full time to his
post as head of a private university and economic think tank.
Treasury secretary Pablo Guidotti will take on the additional post
of deputy minister.
	   Economy Minister Roque Fernandez said the moves will not slow
the government's plans for key reforms, including its efforts to
win congressional approval of a sweeping tax bill.
	   The Chamber of Deputies' budget commission approved the bill
Wednesday, but only after dropping a controversial provision to
broaden the scope of the 21 percent value-added tax.
	   Without the revenue from a more inclusive VAT, Fernandez said,
the government would not be able to offset lower income from a
planned reduction of payroll taxes, which he called ``the central
part of the reform.''

Faldo say he's better than 50-1 bet to win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Nick Faldo has some advice for British
bettors: bet on me.
	   The three-time British Open champion is 50-1 to win this time
and says he's fully recovered from an injured right elbow suffered
a week ago in practice.
	   ``It's a good chance for a few punters to make a few bucks, I
feel much better than a 50-1 shot,'' said Faldo, also a three-time
Masters champion who recoils at suggestions his career is winding
down.
	   ``Yes, there's one (major) in there somewhere,'' he added.
	   ``I'm not trying to prove anything to anybody. ``I just want to
get back to the right end of the leaderboard. The arm is doing
great. It has knitted together well and everything is fine.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NO PRESSURE: &LR;  Defending champion Justin Leonard, who won a major
early in his career, has never battled the pressure that weighs on
Colin Montgomerie or Phil Mickelson, the best two players who've
yet to win one.
	   ``I think it would be harder on Colin or Phil Mickelson because
they've been hearing that for a number of year,'' Leonard said.
	   ``I put a lot of pressure on myself,'' he added. ``But I didn't
feel a lot of pressure from the media or from just the general
public.''
	   Montgomerie, who shot a 76 in the first round last year at Royal
Troon, where is father is course secretary, will try relaxing this
time.
	   ``I have put a little too much pressure on myself in the past,''
Montgomerie said. ``I have learned that I play better golf when I'm
relaxed. If I relax and have good rhythm, I'm confident on the
first tee.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TIGHT SECURITY: &LR;  Dogs jumped into car trunks to sniff for bombs
and guards were especially vigilant in searching packages as
security has been stepped up at Royal Birkdale.
	   British officials are on guard. This course is only 10 miles (16
kilometers) from Aintree, where last year's Grand National was
delayed 48 hours after a bomb threat forced an evacuation.
	   There is also heightened security in light of the violent
standoff in Portadown, Northern Ireland, between police and Orange
Order marchers.
	   ``It is better to be safe than sorry and we want to ensure there
is no disruption to the Open championship as there was at
Aintree,'' said Michael Bonallack, secretary of the Royal and
Ancient Golf Club.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WATSON ON WINNING: Tom Watson spent his weekend watching his
15-year-old son, Michael, play a junior golf tournament at nearby
Formby. He used the time to give him some lessons in life learned
from a lifetime of golf.
	   ``It's nice to watch him succeed on the golf course but it's
also necessary for him to understand how to fail,'' Watson said.
``The more you play the game the more you realize that failure is
more prevalent than success is.''
	   Watson, of course, knows a bit about both. He's a five-time
British Open champion, whose last win in the championship came here
at Royal Birkdale in 1983. He also went through some lean years of
struggling with the yips where even his most ardent fans winced
when he stood over short putts.
	   At the age of 48, Watson is playing in his 23rd Open. And,
boosted by a win at Colonial earlier this year, he believes he
still has the game to win.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DALY'S LIFE: &LR;  John Daly is back with his wife, Paulette, who
left him in March 1997 when he trashed their Jacksonville Beach,
Florida hotel room after a night out drinking.
	   Daly, who entered the Betty Ford Clinic and says he has been
sober ever since, said he and Paulette reconciled about two months
ago.
	   His problem now is his putting, which has come and gone this
year. Daly, who won the British Open in 1995 at St. Andrews, said
he's hoping for some wind at Royal Birkdale to help even the odds
out some.
	   ``As long as the wind blows real hard where par is a good score,
I have a chance,'' he said. ``I'm not putting well enough to make a
whole bunch of birdies.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LET IT BLOW: &LR;  Jesper Parnevik, who tied for second in last
year's Open and was second in '94, isn't satisfied with the 40 mph
(60 kph) winds buffeting Royal Birkdale in practice. ``I would not
mind more wind,'' he said. ``I enjoy playing in the wind. It's more
of a survival test then.''
	   ``Here you need to have a very good head,'' added Parnevik,
golf's most famous flake and the son of Sweden's most famous
comedian. ``If your head is not screwed on right, you do not play
well.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DIVOTS: &LR;  Don't expect Ernie Els to have great memories from
Royal Birkdale. Playing here in the British Amateur in 1989, he had
his clubs stolen from his car while he was enjoying a local pub.
	   Add 17-year-old Justin Rose to up-and-coming amateurs like
American Matt Kuchar and Spain's Sergio Garcia. The 17-year-old
Briton has yet to win a noted amateur championship, but he was
playing scratch golf at 12.

O'Grady in yellow; Festina officials questioned

<TEXT>
	   CHOLET, France (AP) - Stuart O'Grady's short sprinting talents
helped him take over the lead of the three-week long Tour de France
on the race's longest stage.
	   The Australian O'Grady has gained world and Olympic medals for
his powerful sprinting on a cycling track. On the 252-kilometer
(157-mile) fourth stage of the Tour Wednesday, he used that ability
to gain precius bonus seconds to gain the overall lead in the race.
	   He became the fourth different rider to lead the overall
standings in the five days of racing, counting Saturday's prologue.
	   Meanwhile the Tour's drug drama continued with Bruno Roussel,
Festina team director, and the team doctor, Erik Ryckaert were
being heard by the police just after the stage ended.
	   O'Grady won a pair of intermediate sprints and came in third in
another to gain 14 extra seconds. Although he finished eight
seconds behind in the main pack, he came out ahead in the overall
standings.
	   He leads Bo Hamburger, Tuesday's leader, by 11 seconds with
George Hincapie of the United States third, also 11 seconds behind.
	   O'Grady got a bit of revenge after his GAN teammate Chris
Boardman won the prologue and had the yellow jersey for a day
before falling on Monday.
	   ``I saw the pressure that Chris was under for just six minutes
of racing. It was absolutely incredible. But then we worked for him
to hold on to the yellow jersey and I remember he came to me and
said `I wish I could do the same for you some day,' ''
	   ``For me to wear the yellow jersey is a dream come true,'' the
25-year-old O'Grady said. ``And to be only the second Australian
makes me very proud.''
	   The other Australian, Phil Anderson, wore in briefly over four
different Tours in the early 1980s.
	   O'Grady was lucky to avoid a getting caught in traffic when a
tight turn about threee kilometers (2 miles) frm the finish cut the
pack in two.
	   Jeroen Blijlevens of the Netherlands took the sprint finish
	   over a small group that was at at head of the pack and avoided
troubel.
	   Blijlevens won the sprint for his fourth individual stage
victory. Second was Italian Nicola Minali with Czech Jan Svorada
third.
	   Most of the pack was eight seconds behind after the fall delayed
many of them.
	   As the stage ended, Roussel and Ryckaert were talking with the
police about the growing drug controversy.
	   The Festina team issued a statement saying it was Roussel's wish
to be heard to explain how the team operates and deny charges by
another member of the Festina team.
	   However later Wednesday police offically detained him for more
questioning. French law allowsd up to 48 hours before any further
action can be taken and Roussel could miss the fifth stage of the
race Thursday.
	   Last week a Belgian member of Festina's team was arrested after
police found a large quantity of performance-enhancing drugs in the
Festina car he was driving.
	   According to judicial sources, after first admitting the drugs
were for his personal use, the man charged said that he was under
orders.
	   Festina officials denied those accusations and said that they
had hired two lawyers to protect their image and riders.
	   Also, Festina's main sponsors, the watch company of Festina, was
threatening to break its contract with the team if there is any
evidence of drug use among the riders.

	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cubans welcomed the first direct flight between
the United States and Cuba in two years, greeting more than 200
passengers from Miami with screams, waves and tears.
	   It was also an emotional moment for those arriving, who clapped
and cheered as Cuba came into view from the air, then wept when
they saw their relatives waiting for them in the airport terminal
Wednesday.
	   Angel Perera said he and his wife, Mirely, who now live in
Miami, hardly slept the night before in anticipation, eager to see
loved ones they had not seen in years.
	   ``It isn't easy to see your country in ruin _ your friends, your
family, practically with nothing,'' said Perera, who left Cuba four
years ago with one daughter and came back with two. The couple's
second child, now 18 months old, was born in the United States.
	   The flight ended a two-year ban meant to punish the communist
island for shooting down two unarmed civilian planes.
	   The resumption of flights means that families separated by the
Florida straits can see each other more easily, without having to
spend more money to fly to a third country such as the Bahamas or
Mexico.
	   ``I always wanted to fly directly. It's easier and more
comfortable with the kids,'' Perera said. ``Especially with all
these bags.''
	   Relatives and friends crowded in and around the Havana airport
terminal to meet the passengers, many of whom they had not seen
since long before direct flights were canceled.
	   The visitors, who each paid dlrs 399 for a round-trip ticket,
waved at the crowd and rushed through Cuban customs with packages
of clothes, vitamins and basic medicines such as aspirin.
	   Nine-year-old Joslyn Alvarez Dominguez waved at the crowd,
knowing his father was in there somewhere, but not remembering what
he looked like after 3 1/2 years.
	   ``Is this my father?'' he asked his mother as he reached over a
rail to touch a tall man waiting for them outside customs. ``Yes,''
she said, and the boy, dressed up for the occasion in a black tie,
smiled broadly.
	   The Boeing 767-300 rented from United Airlines landed at
Havana's Jose Marti International Airport after a 45-minute flight
from Miami International Airport.
	   It was the first nonstop commercial flight to the island nation
since 1996, when President Bill Clinton canceled direct flights to
punish Fidel Castro's government for shooting down two unarmed
civilian aircraft.
	   The planes carried members of the anti-Castro exile group
Brothers to The Rescue. They were searching for refugees when Cuban
military jets shot them out of the sky, killing four people.
	   Cuba maintains that the planes were shot down after violating
Cuban airspace. The United States insists that the planes were shot
down over international waters. In 1996, a U.N. panel ruled the
planes were shot down over international waters and that Cuba
violated international law.
	   Clinton lifted the ban on direct flights in March, after Pope
John Paul II visited Cuba in January. At the time, Clinton said the
resumption of flights and other measures were designed to build on
the Pope's trip and ``help prepare the Cuban people for a
democratic transition.''
	   The U.S. trade embargo against Cuba remains in place. But the
Treasury Department, which administers it, has granted approvals to
nine companies to resume direct flights.
	   Miami's Airline Brokers Co. _ also known as ABC Charters _ made
the first trip. Seven small charter companies were also approved,
along with American Airlines.
	   During the past two years, flights to Cuba had to stop in the
Bahamas or Mexico, increasing travel time to three hours or more.
The indirect routes also bumped up ticket prices by more than dlrs
100. With nonstop flights, travel agents say the cost will likely
inch downward.
	   But while many passengers said they were glad to be making a
quicker trip to see their

Japan's current account surplus rises 62 percent in May
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with figures figures for imports and exports, ministry
comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's broadest measure of trade jumped 62 percent
in May from a year ago, the government announced Thursday.
	   Japan's current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal
factors, was at 1.409 trillion yen (dlrs 10.03 billion) in May, up
62.2 percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry
announced.
	   The rise, higher than Tokyo-based economists had forecast,
marked the 14th consecutive monthly year-on-year increase in the
surplus.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its sluggish
economy to import more goods and cap a ballooning surplus.
	   But while both exports and imports declined in May, the drop in
the latter far outpaced that of the former, the ministry said.
	   Exports fell 1.8 percent from the same month a year ago, while
imports declined 18.1 percent, the ministry said.
	   The ministry said that while it doesn't forecast large rises in
the surplus over the long term, it will likely continue to expand
in the short term.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia's desire to return to the
international stage might help diplomats in their latest effort to
quell the Kosovo crisis that in four months has left hundreds dead
and thousands more displaced.
	   Members of a fact-finding mission from the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which includes
the United States and Canada, plan to go to Kosovo as part of its
attempt at helping quell the conflict.
	   On Wednesday, after meeting with officials in the Yugoslav
capital of Belgrade, Hansjoerg Eiff, a German diplomat, said the
idea was to ``talk about all aspects of relations between OSCE and
Yugoslavia.''
	   Eiff also said OSCE would like former Spanish Premier Felipe
Gonzalez to start mediating the Kosovo conflict as soon as
possible. The Yugoslav reaction was not immediately known, but
Yugoslavia _ dominated by Serbia of which Kosovo province is a part
_ has in the past opposed such mission as outside interference. has
in the past opposed such a mission as outside interference.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE in 1992 for fomenting
ethnic conflict in Croatia and Bosnia. It has refused to allow
permanent offices to be set up in the country until its membership
is restored.
	   Russian and U.S. pressure led the Yugoslavs to agree to let an
initial fact-finding mission visit Kosovo, where Serb-Albanian
fighting has killed more than 300 people since February.
	   Other areas where OSCE would like to see permanent missions
include the Muslim Serbian region of Sandzak and Vojvodina, a
Serbian province with a large Hungarian minority, Yugoslav media
reported.
	   Meanwhile, fighting flared Wednesday in several areas of Kosovo.
Serb and ethnic Albanian media outlets reported Wednesday's
violence left a total of 14 Serb policemen wounded, four ethnic
Albanians killed and 19 people wounded _ 14 Serb policemen and five
Kosovo Albanians.
	   The leadership of the political party that supports Ibrahim
Rugova _ elected Kosovo president in elections Serbia did not
recognize _ met in Pristina Wednesday to decide when the ethnic
Albanian assembly, also elected unofficially, is to convene. No
date was agreed on
	   Attempts by world powers to rally the splintered Albanian
politicians behind Rugova have been unsuccessful, and with
political efforts to gain independence faltering, the Kosovo
Liberation Army continues to gain support.

Acoustics may hold clue to protecting overfished species,
</HEADLINE>
scientists say &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURENCE M. CRUZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Using a boat, an underwater microphone and a tape
recorder, scientists say they can capture the ``purring'' and
``knocking'' sounds of fish.
	   Then, they believe, they can develop spawning maps that fishery
managers can use to protect overfished species and their habitats.
	   Certain species of fish _ many of them of high commercial value
_ make unique sounds during their reproductive phases, allowing
scientists to identify them.
	   And where there are sounds of courting fish, fish eggs are not
far behind, according to researchers who gathered in Seattle
recently at the Joint 16th International Congress on Acoustics and
the 135th meeting of the Acoustical Society of America.
	   The correlation between identifiable fish sounds and egg
presence is significant, because fishery managers cannot protect
spawning fish if they cannot first locate them, said Joseph
Luczkovich, an associate professor of biology at East Carolina
University.
	   ``It's very important that we know which fish we're hearing, so
that we can set up spawning grounds,'' Luczkovich said. ``Almost
every fisherperson worldwide understands that if you over-harvest
spawning aggregations, you're not going to have a future.''
	   Luczkovich and fellow researcher Mark Sprague, an assistant
professor of physics also at East Carolina University, found large
volumes of sea trout eggs in parts of North Carolina's Pamlico
Sound.
	   At the same time, they recorded and analyzed choruses of sea
trout that purred so loudly they could be heard from the boat. They
found the same correlation for red drum fish, which produce a loud
knocking sound when courting.
	   Sea trout, less commonly known as weakfish or corvina, and red
drum are members of the drum and croaker family of fish. The
researchers recorded underwater sounds measuring more than 145
decibels _ a volume they said is close to that of loud rock music.
They also found a strong correlation between the loudness of the
sounds and egg production.
	   The fish make the sound with their swimbladder _ a gas-filled
sack in their bodies. The fish also emit sounds during aggressive
encounters and to alert other fish, Luczkovich said.
	   Sprague said the existing method of locating fish by catching
them in gill nets is inefficient and unreliable.
	   Paul Brouha, executive director of the American Fisheries
Association in Bethesda, Md., said in an interview that sonar
techniques also used to map fish populations can identify some fish
species based on size and numbers, but ``it's definitely much more
hit and miss.''
	   Luczkovich said it was hard to estimate what percentage of
overfished species produce sounds that could be recorded using the
techniques his team employed.
	   But he said other commercially important fish also make sounds,
among them cod, mackerel and grouper. ``Of the top 20 or so
commercially harvested fish species ... perhaps half of them
produce sounds,'' he said.
	   Brouha called the research ``very impressive,'' but he noted it
was a relatively new study that needs to be repeated over a period
of years to verify that gatherings of vocalizing fish in spawning
areas are not ``chance aggregations.''
	   The researchers' conclusions are reasonable in light of the
habits of some land creatures _ such as prairie chickens _ which
return to the same spot every year to mate, Brouha said.

WTO announces official start of leadership race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Trade Organization has formally
announced the start of the race to select its next chief, with a
senior official cautioning against a long, potentially damaging
contest.
	   Ambassador John Weekes, chairman of the global trade body's
general council, has asked governments to nominate candidates to
replace Renato Ruggiero as director-general by October 1 this year.
	   The contest will be decided by consensus rather than a vote.
	   Weekes reminded members of the need to try to come to an
agreement quickly, thereby avoiding the regional candidacies which
deadlocked the last leadership contest in 1995.
	   A power struggle between blocs of countries pushing their own
candidates caused a lengthy delay before a leader was chosen and
harmed the credibility of the WTO as an authoritative global trade
policeman.
	   Another long and difficult leadership contest could plunge the
organization into damaging controversy at a time when it is already
being accused of contributing to poverty in developing countries
and lacking sensitivity towards environmental and labor issues.
	   Weekes suggested a way to achieve a quicker resolution of the
issue would be to invite candidates to Geneva to make a
presentation to members and respond to questions.
	   Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister, has said he will
leave the WTO post by April 30, 1999.
	   Weekes paid tribute to Ruggiero. ``I must say it is with regret,
and trepidation, that I propose initiating a process to find a
successor,'' Weekes said.

Newly available progesterone pill targets growing women's market

<TEXT>
	   MARIETTA, Georgia (AP) _ Menopause was more than a change for
Claudette Loda. It threatened to ruin her life.
	   ``It wasn't gradual _ it was like falling off a pier,'' the
California woman recalled. ``My body went into a shock.''
	   Pain, weakness, sudden problems with allergies, and other
symptoms sidelined her from activities such as tennis, hiking,
dancing _ ``everything I loved to do.''
	   She refused to accept that. And like many others in the growing
population of baby-boom women who have reached menopause, she
demanded medical help.
	   ``Women's health is truly a major growth area for the
industry,'' said Jim Hynd, group product director for women's
health at Solvay Pharmaceuticals' U.S. headquarters in Marietta.
	   In June, Solvay, part of a Belgium-based company, introduced to
the U.S. market the drug Prometrium, the first plant-based
progesterone pill for menstrual disruption available here.
	   In Europe, however, that kind of medicine has been sold for
nearly two decades.
	   After Ms. Loda hit menopause eight years ago, her doctor
prescribed hormone-replacement therapy. It left her with severe
headaches and depression, and she quit.
	   Her doctor told her about the European drug. She tried it and
was able to resume her active life. Today, in her 50s, she still
exercises every day, from aerobics to tennis. She has relied on
friends traveling to Europe to pick up her medicine.
	   Her story and others like hers are driving the new research.
	   An estimated 25 million American women are now of menopausal age
and will live with menopause for one-third of their lives, Hynd
said.
	   Millions of women take estrogen to counter the effects of
menopause. But many women refuse to take it because of its
potential to increase the risk of breast cancer and other side
effects.
	   Research has taken off with the world's pharmaceutical giants
pursuing new drugs.
	   ``Basically, it's being driven by demographics. The large
demographics equate to dollars: serve your market,'' said Melissa
Wilmoth, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst.
	   Solvay earlier this year gained Food and Drug Administration
approval to market Estratab, a yam-based drug containing half the
usual dose of estrogen, to protect against thinning bones. It hopes
the progesterone drug, Prometrium, will gain FDA approval later
this year for use with estrogen in hormone-replacement therapy that
helps protect women against bone and heart disease.
	   Eli Lilly and Co. has said its new non-hormonal drug Evista,
approved for treatment of osteoporosis, was being tested with
favorable results for reducing the risk of breast cancer and heart
disease.
	   And Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories announced nationwide availability
of its Crinone progesterone gel for menstrual disruption.
	   Premarin, an estrogen replacement introduced in 1942, is now
prescribed to some 9 million women, making it the most prescribed
drug in the United States.
	   Estrogen is good at relieving hot flashes but also causes
menstrual periods to resume in most women. Studies show that many
women _ as Ms. Loda did with her first drugs _ stop taking them
because of side effects.
	   Dr. Robert W. Rebar, chairman of the obstetrics and gynecology
department at the University of Cincinnati, said liability and
public relations concerns in the past made some companies reluctant
to focus on drugs tied to women's reproductive cycles.
	   But extensive testing has reduced cancer and other risks, and
there is now ``recognition that there are clearly many, many women
that could benefit,'' Rebar said. Also, the baby-boom generation
came of age during the women's movement and is unwilling to be ``as
silent as women used to be'' about their needs, he noted.
	   In 1993, Wyeth-Ayerst established a Women's Health Research
Institute to focus on menopausal disorders. It has more products in
its development pipeline for ``unmet medical needs'' of menopausal
women, spokesman Doug Petkus said.

Baby kicking away after open-womb surgery to treat spina bifida
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MEKI COX &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Little Noah, smaller than the palm of his
doctor's hand, was headed for a life in which he could never walk
or control his urine and bowel movements.
	   After only 20 weeks in his mother's womb, doctors could see that
Noah Kipfmiller's backbone had not closed. His spinal cord was
partially deformed and nerve bundles were protruding from his back.
	   The only hope was to let doctors operate on the fetus while it
remained in the mother's womb.
	   That was four months ago. Now, 2-month-old Noah is kicking his
little legs in the air.
	   For the first time, doctors said, they performed successful
fetal surgery on a spina bifida child at 23 weeks into the
gestation period.
	   This one case could pave the way for a normal life for the
estimated 1,500 babies born in this country each year with spina
bifida, they said.
	   ``It feels good to know my baby can help others,'' Mellissa
Kipfmiller of Bay City, Michigan, said July 2 as she watched Noah,
her first child, wiggle his toes. Earlier in the day, she had sat
in the hospital nursery watching him do the same thing.
	   ``I couldn't help but compare him to the other babies. And he
didn't seem to be moving any slower than the other ones,'' she
said. ``For some reason, I knew all along this was going to work
out.''
	   Five of the seven babies who have undergone the open-womb
operation have survived and have shown improved prognoses. The
other two babies have not been delivered yet, according to Dr.
Joseph Bruner, director of fetal diagnosis and therapy at
Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.
	   But, excluding Noah, those surgeries were conducted
significantly later in the pregnancy _ at 28 weeks. Conducting the
surgery sooner can reduce the chance of spinal damage, he said.
	   ``This has not been scientifically proven to be beneficial, but
I've seen things come and go, and heard a lot of promises, and it's
obvious to me this is the real thing,'' said Bruner, who conducted
most of those spina bifida surgeries. ``Patients may now have the
opportunity of having this surgery done earlier in hope of a better
outcome and more options.''
	   Those options mean parents considering termination could choose
to have surgery first in hopes of a good outcome, said Dr. N. Scott
Adzick, who conducted Noah's surgery at The Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia.
	   One risk that comes with the surgery is premature birth. Noah
was born two months premature at 2 pounds, 7 ounces (1.1 kilos).
But he developed well, and now weighs 4 pounds (1.8 kilos) and
appears healthy, Adzick said.
	   Open fetal surgery is still relatively rare and reserved for
simple anatomic defects that are life-threatening. But although
spina bifida is not life-threatening and many children live normal
lives, this case warranted the treatment, Adzick said.
	   ``This family did not want to end their pregnancy. They were
going to take care of their child, either way, so they decided to
give the baby the best possible chances,'' he said.
	   As far as Noah's bladder and bowel control, Adzick won't know
anything for sure until he is potty-trained. When Noah reaches 10
pounds (4.5 kilos), he will return to Philadelphia to complete the
closure of his spine. During the fetal surgery, the skin around the
defect was too thin _ like tissue paper _ to use to completely
close the spine.
	   The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Vanderbilt
University Medical Center are the only two facilities that have
performed fetal surgery on spina bifida children, said Bruner.

Japanese stocks fall, dollar edges higher in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks fell moderately early Thursday on
profit-taking after a three-day advance, while the U.S. dollar
edged higher against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 111.44 points, or 0.67
percent, to 16,502.70 points in the first 30 minutes of trading.
	   Traders said the Nikkei index's slide came after the average
gained a total of 524.08 points, or 3.3 percent, over the past
three days. That included a rise of 125.23 points, or 0.76 percent,
on Wednesday.
	   In early trading on the foreign exchange market, the dollar
bought 140.71 yen in early trading, up a marginal 0.05 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
140.50 yen overnight.
	   Sentiment on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was also weighed down by
jitters over the selection of a new Japanese leader to succeed
outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   He announced his resignation Monday to take responsibility for
the stunning defeat of his ruling party in last Sunday's upper
house elections.
	   Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party will stay in power,
however, as it holds a majority in Parliament's more powerful lower
house. A new party president _ who would become the new prime
minister _ is scheduled to be named July 21. A new Cabinet is
expected to be formed as early as July 30.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi is emerging as the most probable
successor to Hashimoto.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 5.99 points, or 0.47 percent, to 1,269.32
points. The TOPIX closed up 8.66 points, or 0.68 percent, the day
before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.400 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.405
percent, driving its price up to 110.41 yen from 110.38 yen.

	   YEKATERINBURG, Russia (AP) _ Controversial in death as in life,
Russia's last czar and his family Czar Nicholas II continues to
divide the nation he once ruled.
	   A three-day burial ceremony underway for Czar Nicholas II, his
family and servants was originally planned as a grandiose act of
repentance for the sins of Communism, have been scaled back because
of the controversy among the religious and political elite.
	   ``History repeats itself: It's a tragedy now turned into
farce,'' said Pyotr Gritsayenko, a forensic expert who took part in
the discovery and identification of the royal remains.
	   The burial ceremonies began Wednesday in a modest morgue in the
Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg where they were slain by
Bolsheviks 80 years ago.
	   The royal remains were transferred from glass sarcophagi into
small wooden coffins, and local officials signed documents turning
over responsibility for the remains to the federal government.
	   The remains will be taken to St. Petersburg on Thursday, and
buried the next day in the cathedral where Russia's past emperors
lie.
	   In St. Petersburg, several hundred priests and Russian Orthodox
believers, carrying banners and icons, rallied Wednesday on a
bridge leading to the fortress where the remains are to be buried.
They said they didn't believe the remains were those of the royal
family.
	   ``This is a mockery,'' said Sergei Vasiliyev, one of the
organizers. ``God will not let this go forward.''
	   Also Wednesday, descendants of the Romanov czars laid wreaths at
a cemetery in St. Petersburg that contains the remains of many
ordinary Russians who died defending the city _ then Leningrad _
during World War II.
	   It appeared to be part of an effort by the Romanovs to reach out
to the Russian public and, perhaps, make amends for their family's
often-despotic past.
	   As solemn music was piped through speakers throughout the
cemetery, Nicholas Romanov, a distant cousin of the last czar, laid
flowers in a ceremony attended by city Gov. Vladimir Yakovlev and
scores of Romanov descendants.
	   Romanov signed a guest book: ``Nikolai Romanovich Romanov, Thank
you from all of us, the Romanovs.''
	   Nicholas II and his family were executed by Bolshevik
revolutionaries on July 17, 1918 _ 80 years ago Friday. Their
bodies were dumped in a mass grave in the forest outside
Yekaterinburg and doused with acid. They remained there until they
were unearthed in 1991.
	   The Russian Orthodox Church has refused to accept a series of
comprehensive genetic tests that scientists believe has
conclusively proven the remains' authenticity.
	   The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II,
went on television Tuesday to defend his decision not to attend the
funeral. He cited ``important scientific objections'' allegedly
casting doubt on the remains' authenticity.
	   President Boris Yeltsin canceled his plans to attend the
services because of the church's objections. The scaled-back
ceremonies will cost the federal government a relatively modest 5
million rubles (dlrs 800,000), according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   The burial procedures began in Yekaterinburg's city morgue,
which has housed the royal remains since they were dug up.
	   The coffins, each decorated with an ornately etched name plate,
hold the remains of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, three of their
five children, and four servants. The coffins of the czar and
czarina are draped with the yellow flag of the Romanov family, and
the servants' coffins are lined with silver, rather than the royal
gold.
	   The other two children, Alexei and the one scientists believe is
Maria, were executed along with the entire family, but their
remains have not been found and most investigators believe the
bodies were burned to ashes.
	   Legend has long held that Anastasia survived the shooting and
escaped, but scientific tests indicate that it is her sister Maria
whose bones are missing.

Withdrawal from cigarettes may raise accident risk at first,
</HEADLINE>
researchers say &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Smokers may become a bit more accident-prone
right after they try to quit, but it's still a good idea to kick
the habit, researchers say.
	   British scientists found a slight elevation in workplace
accidents on No Smoking Day, a country-wide effort by many smokers
to avoid tobacco. The effect is apparently due to nicotine
withdrawal interfering with mood and concentration, they said.
	   But the blip in accident rates ``doesn't even get close to
outweighing the long-term health benefits in quitting smoking,''
stressed psychologist Andrew J. Waters of the National Addiction
Center of the Institute of Psychiatry in London.
	   In the July 9 issue of the journal Nature, Waters and co-authors
report their study of non-fatal worksite accidents on No Smoking
Day from 1987 to 1996. The countrywide average for that day, always
the second Wednesday of March, was 575.8 accidents. That's slightly
higher than the average of 553.4 for the preceding Wednesday or
519.1 for the following Wednesday.
	   The researchers don't know how many accident victims on No
Smoking Day were in withdrawal from nicotine.
	   Waters said the study shouldn't be taken as criticism of ideas
like No Smoking Day or as an excuse to keep on puffing.

 &UR; Study: Children allergic to peanuts should avoid other types of
nuts, too
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Parents accustomed to screening their children's
snacks for peanuts also need to be vigilant about nuts that grow on
trees, according to a study.
	   The study, in the July issue of the American Academy of
Pediatrics, found that one-third of the children who are allergic
to peanuts are also allergic to tree nuts such as walnuts, almonds
and pecans, suggesting that such children should be wary of any
nutty snacks.
	   Researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and
the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock
tested 122 children with a history of acute allergic reaction to
nuts.
	   Researchers found that 68 of the children reacted only to
peanuts, 20 reacted only to tree nuts, and 34 reacted to both.
	   Only 1 percent of the population is allergic to nuts, but an
allergic person can have a life-threatening reaction to even a
small amount. Children experience a combination of wheezing, throat
tightness, hives, swelling, vomiting and diarrhea and do not
outgrow their allergy.

 &UR; Sandia, Berkeley scientists develop minuscule clocks
	   ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (AP) _ Bigger is definitely not better
for Jim Smith and his research team at Sandia National
Laboratories. They work in a microscopic world, and their latest
achievement is the tiniest of timekeepers.
	   The Sandia scientists _ along with those at the University of
California, Berkeley _ have found a way to make electronic clocks
that are smaller than the width of a human hair.
	   It's possible that these minuscule clocks could one day replace
the quartz clocks inside wristwatches, desktop computers or just
about any other electronic device.
	   Smith's Sandia team, working with Trey Roessig and his
colleagues at Berkeley, figured out a way to build a tiny tuning
fork embedded in an electronic circuit.
	   The scientists etched a tuning fork with tines the width of a
red blood cell. The entire length of the tuning fork is less than
one-quarter the width of a human hair, Smith said.
	   Similar devices have been made before, but the Sandia-Berkeley
team also worked out how to include the electronic circuitry
necessary to operate a clock on the same computer chip.
	   Smith and Roessig unveiled their clock at a scientific meeting
last month in South Carolina.

 &UR; Cystic-fibrosis study reveals strengths, limits of genetic
counseling
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Most parents of youngsters with cystic fibrosis
have more children even though they realize each baby faces a
1-in-4 chance of also inheriting the incurable and fatal disorder.
	   The finding in a new study is showing scientists how families
handle genetic counseling, in which couples are warned about the
possible health risks contained in their genes.
	   The study, based on a screening program in Wisconsin, found that
70 percent of parents whose first child had cystic fibrosis
eventually decided to have another child.
	   The study found that the genetic counseling the couples had
received gave them a good understanding of the risk, researchers
reported in the July issue of Pediatrics.
	   ``We considered this reassuring and a positive result of the
study,'' said Dr. Phillip M. Farrell, lead author and dean of the
University of Wisconsin Medical School in Madison. ``Some people
might say it would be better if they stopped having babies, (but)
what we really want is parents to make decisions about reproduction
based on having information and understanding.''
	   However, one troubling finding was that in cases where both
parents were carriers but their first baby was healthy, the couples
often failed to understand that their future children were still at
risk of being born with cystic fibrosis.
	   Cystic fibrosis causes the body to produce abnormally thick
mucus, which can cause severe lung infections and digestive
difficulties. People with cystic fibrosis live an average of 31
years.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The pressure was too much, the glare of the TV
lights too bright, the shame of his company's losses too
overwhelming. So the president of venerable Yamaichi Securities did
what came naturally.
	   He broke down and sobbed.
	   Shohei Nozawa's teary display on national TV in November was
just the first in a string of recent, highly public crying sessions
by Japanese men that have prompted some to ask: Has the samurai
gone soft?
	   Weeping men are everywhere in Japan these days.
	   Japanese athletes cried when they won at the Winter Olympics _
and cried when they lost at the World Cup. Magazines quote women
complaining their boyfriends get choked up over the slightest
things.
	   ``It's a dramatic change,'' said Megumi Hisada, an author of
books about gender and family relations. ``People don't think it's
that embarrassing anymore.''
	   Japan might seem an unlikely place for the ``sensitive man'' to
take root.
	   For centuries, males were trained to follow a feudal code that
required them to suffer hardships in silence _ a code that lives on
as part of Japan's vaunted corporate work ethic.
	   Even now, a man's place is widely seen as running industry and
government with a strong hand, not confessing feelings of weakness
or displaying his emotions with abandon. But that's slowly
changing.
	   Explanations vary. Some say Japanese males are just getting more
in touch with their feelings. With more women in the workplace and
men being called on to participate more in raising children, the
ironclad division between gender roles is starting to blur.
	   ``In the old days, they used to say that men were the brave ones
and women the sensitive ones,'' said Asyra Mizuno of the Men's
Center Japan in Osaka. ``But the best is for men to have both
sides.''
	   Critics see something else behind the trend: the doting Japanese
mother.
	   The bond between mother and son has almost mythical proportions
in Japan. While girls are taught early to fend for themselves, boys
bask in maternal attention and seldom are expected to lift a finger
around the house.
	   Many say this traditional relationship has only intensified in
postwar Japan, with fewer children in the house, fathers away at
work most of the time and more money for mom to lavish on her
little emperor.
	   ``Girls are being raised and encouraged to be independent, while
boys are being raised like precious things,'' said Hisada. ``So,
there aren't many males anymore who grow up being told not to
cry.''
	   The divide in opinion is clear when it comes to Nozawa's teary
display, when he announced his company _ one of Japan's largest
brokerages _ had failed under the weight of off-the-book losses.
	   Some Japanese considered his performance simply a shameless bid
for sympathy. Others, however, saw it as an understandable surge of
emotion from a man who had worked hard, but failed.
	   ``Those were really tears of regret,'' said Mizuno.
	   Indeed, the newer tolerance for male displays of emotion has
roots in Japan, where the samurai ethic lives side by side with a
cherished view of the Japanese as especially sensitive, emotional
people.
	   Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, for example, shed tears when he
resigned in 1972. And athletes blocked from participating in the
1980 Moscow Olympics by a boycott of the Soviet Union wept in
frustration.
	   But the debate these days in Japan focuses less on people like
Nozawa _ who clearly had serious worries _ than on younger men that
critics say just cry too easily, and make no effort to hold back
the tears.
	   ``Men are becoming more feminine and women are becoming
stronger,'' said coffeehouse waitress Hiromi Sasaki, 22. She said
that seeing men lose it in public ``makes me angry.''
	   Masahiko Watanabe, 28, a bartender in downtown Tokyo, took a
kinder view, saying that a person should go ahead and cry if he
wants, and ``nobody else has the right to say it's good or bad.''
	   Still, Watanabe was emphatic when asked if he ever cried in
public.
	   ``Never!'' he said, shaking his head.

Police seize weapons at scene of protest in Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Supporters of the Orange
Order waited in a country road Thursday to resume a controversial
and violent protest after police recovered explosives and
submachine gun from fields near a rural church.
	   ``While the police will accommodate legitimate and peaceful
protest it will not tolerate the continued use of unarmed
protesters as cover for murderous acts on the security forces,''
Assistant Chief Constable Tom Craig said Wednesday.
	   ``Now is the opportunity to stop the violence and the only way
the Orange Order can control the protests is with limited
numbers.''
	   Eight Orange officials were allowed back on the church grounds
late Wednesday night to maintain a token presence. ``You can't get
much more limited than that,'' said Portadown Orange spokesman
David Jones.
	   Two years ago the Orangemen faced down police and the army to
march through a Catholic neighborhood down the Garvaghy Road.
	   But this year Northern Ireland's largest Protestant fraternal
organization has faced reversals on several fronts.
	   The security forces stopped them at the Drumcree Anglican church
on July 5, enforcing a government order; the police lines held
while hard-line Protestants threw bombs at the barricades, blocked
roads around Northern Ireland and attacked the homes of Catholics
and police with firebombs.
	   Support for the Drumcree protest waned after five police
officers were injured by protesters last week, then it collapsed
after a firebomb killed three young sons of a Catholic woman on
Sunday.
	   An organization which prides itself on its Christianity and
discipline fell into public feuding between hard-liners and those
who agreed with an Orange chaplain who said no road was worth three
lives.
	   While the Orangemen said they wanted a peaceful and dignified
protest, bombs were thrown and shots were fired at police in the
darkness.
	   On Wednesday, the Orange Order's inability to control its
violent allies was further exposed when police found a submachine
gun, two crossbows, explosive tipped crossbow bolts and other
explosives in the field near the church. Orangemen were ejected
while police continued the search.
	   Police arrested more than 20 people, and four were charged
Wednesday with offenses including riotous behavior and possessing a
bomb.
	   On Wednesday, the Church of Ireland demanded that the Orange
Order ``end their occupation of church property at Drumcree.'' The
church closed the parish hall were protesters had been meeting and
cooking, and also padlocked two fields where Orangemen had been
parking.
	   The Rev. John Dixon, moderator of the Presbyterian Church,
Northern Ireland's largest Protestant denomination, added his voice
to calls for an end to the protest.
	   ``The violent events now nightly associated with the continuing
Orange presence at Drumcree are wholly insupportable by any
Christian standard,'' Dixon said.
	   The Orange lodges of Portadown insisted that their protest would
continue.
	   ``Once the security cordon is lifted people will be ready to go
back. This is definitely not the end of our protest,'' said Jones.
	   But on the Garvaghy Road, where residents strolled casually,
there was growing confidence that the march would not come their
way.
	   ``I would hope that the protest is over,'' said Brid Rodgers of
the Social Democratic and Labor Party, which gets the largest share
of Catholic votes. ``People recognize that the rule of law and
order and the decision of the Parades Commission has been upheld
and that has been welcomed.''
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair said he still hoped the marchers would
agree to negotiate a settlement with the residents.
	   ``With a bit of goodwill and dialogue we can find a way 'round
this, so that people can have their right to march, but at the same
time do it in a way that is peaceful, unprovocative and where local
residents' dignity is respected as well,'' Blair said in the House
of Commons in London.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Andres Galarraga hit a pair of long home runs
Wednesday, driving in five runs as the Atlanta Braves pounded the
New York Mets 12-1.
	   Ryan Klesko also homered for Atlanta as the Braves battered five
Mets pitchers for 16 hits.
	   Denny Neagle (10-7) allowed four hits through six innings,
winning for just the second time since June 21. He struck out three
and walked three.
	   The Braves gave Neagle a quick first-inning lead against loser
Masato Yoshii (4-5). Walt Weiss opened with a single and two outs
later, Galarraga homered into the bullpen in left field, his 29th
of the season.
	   Atlanta put the game away with six in the fourth, capped by
Galarraga's 30th home run, a three-run shot to left of reliever
Bill Pulsipher. Andruw Jones drove in two runs with a double in the
inning. It was the sixth two-homer game of the season for Galarraga
and 25th of his career.
 &UR; Brewers 3, Phillies 2
	   In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Scott Karl won the first time in a
month Wednesday, allowing one earned run in seven innings as the
Brewers beat Philadelphia.
	   Karl (7-4), who last won on June 12, allowed two runs, one
earned, on five hits, striking out three and walking two.
	   Al Reyes pitched the eighth and Bob Wickman got into a jam in
the ninth, but worked out of it for his 14th save in 15
opportunities by striking out Rico Brogna and Mike Lieberthal with
the bases loaded.
	   Curt Schilling (9-9) allowed three runs on eight hits for his
major-league best ninth complete game. Schilling, who entered the
game tied with Seattle's Randy Johnson for the major-league
strikeout lead, struck out four to push his total to 189.
 &UR; Pirates 3, Cubs 0 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Francisco Cordova pitched eight shutout innings
to outduel Kerry Wood and stop a five-game losing streak, and Kevin
Young's two-run homer carried Pittsburgh.
	   Wood (8-5), making his first career start against the Pirates,
took a two-hit shutout into the sixth only to lose it on Jason
Kendall's leadoff walk and Young's first-pitch drive over the
left-field wall.
	   Young also drove in the Pirates' third run when reliever Dave
Stevens hit him in the back with the bases loaded in the seventh.
	   Cordova (7-8) did the rest, giving up four hits, striking out
eight and walking none in his best start since shutting out the
Giants on April 23. Ricardo Rincon pitched the ninth for his 10th
save.

Now that she has Wimbledon, Novotna wants more majors

<TEXT>
	   MAHWAH, New Jersey (AP) _ The smile comes quickly to Jana
Novotna's face these days.
	   She jokes about being recognized by fans as she walks down the
street, kids about the ``choke label'' placed on her after near
misses in some majors and blushes about winning this year's
Wimbledon's doubles title with a slight hangover.
	   Nothing seems to bother her, and why should it?
	   Novotna, 29, has been riding the crest of winning the Wimbledon
women's singles title some two weeks ago, her first grand slam
title since turning pro more than 11 years ago.
	   ``Now that I have finally done it, I really feel the relief and
the kind of satisfaction I got out of this, and it's more than I
could ask for,'' Novotna said Wednesday during a news conference
for the A and P Tennis Classic, an exhibition that also features
Steffi Graf.
	   Anna Kournikova was scheduled to play, but withdrew Wednesday
night because she aggravated a thumb injury received in a mid-June
tournament in Eastbourne, England, said event director John Korff.
	   Winning Wimbledon has not changed Novotna's life dramatically,
but it's obvious she feels a tremendous sense of accomplishment _
and relief _ since beating Nathalie Tauziat in straight sets.
	   ``I know that it was a big thing for me and I can feel from the
comments from ordinary people watching the match it was a big thing
for them as well,'' said Novotna, who lost two heartbreaking
three-set Wimbledon finals, in 1993 to Graf and in 1997 to Martina
Hingis. ``I'm glad I not only did it for myself, but also everyone
rooting for me and cheering for me.''
	   Novotna and Hingis combined to win the doubles title the
following day, and Novotna said that was as memorable, considering
she celebrated the night before with champagne and other
refreshments.
	   With a blush, Novotna admitted she was still feeling the effects
of the celebration the next day.
	   ``I still did very well,'' she quipped. ``I said maybe this is
working and I should do it more often. I was really enjoying myself
in the doubles. I was really feeling good.''
	   Novotna, who has not lost since the quarterfinals of the French
Open in early June, isn't feeling any pressure to add a couple more
grand slam titles now that she has her first.
	   However, she would not be surprised if she wins a few more,
starting with the U.S. Open in September.
	   ``I think if I can keep going with the same confidence and with
the same enjoyment I have at this moment on the court, it could
easily happen,'' she said. ``If it doesn't happen, my dream just
came true a week ago, and that was the ultimate goal. Anything I
can do afterward is a bonus.''
	   Speaking of bonuses, Novotna said she earned a few monetary ones
winning Wimbledon and she added that her overall value has
increased.
	   A perfect example is this event. Novotna got at least a $100,000
appearance fee late last week to play here. She was to play
Kournikova on Thursday. Korff said Wednesday night he would have to
quickly find an opponent for Novotna.
	   After this event, Novotna said she plans to take a month off and
play in tournaments at Montreal and New Haven, Conn. before the
U.S. Open. During the off time, she'll rest and then work on her
game, which she thinks is good enough to win another major and
maybe even get the No. 1 ranking in women's tennis.
	   It would be another thing to smile about for the new Jana.

Assad's rare visit could set stage for new peace dynamic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Assad scheduled to arrive at 1300 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad, on a rare visit to
the West, is heading to France for a two-day visit that could
presage a higher profile for Europe in the blocked Middle East
peace process, and for Syria on the world stage.
	   Assad's visit _ the first here in 22 years _ also aims to pull
Syria out of its diplomatic and economic isolation. The state visit
comes two months after beginning negotiations for an association
accord with the European Union.
	   President Jacques Chirac was to meet Assad on his arrival at
Orly airport Thursday afternoon. Talks were scheduled to begin two
hours later.
	   The French Foreign Ministry this week said economic relations
are not up to par with the level of political ties. A boost in
bilateral ties is a sure outcome of the visit.
	   Less certain is the outcome of talks on the Middle East peace
process. Chirac, who visited Syria in 1996, has long sought a role
for Europe, and France in particular, in the process mediated
primarily by the United States.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said Monday all
aspects of the peace process, including Syria and Lebanon, would be
addressed. He underscored France's belief that only a global accord
can bring peace.
	   In an interview aired Wednesday on France's TF1 television
station, Assad said Syria is demanding Israel hand over the Golan
Heights, seized in 1967, in exchange for peace, in keeping with the
land-for-peace-based talks that are the basis of the peace process.
	   ``Netanyahu says he wants peace for peace, a motto which means
that he wants to retain our land and also take peace from us,''
Assad said.
	   Asked if Syria would withdraw from Lebanon if Israel gave up the
Golan Heights, Assad replied: ``I don't see the link between the
two.'' Syria maintains about 30,000 soldiers in Lebanon and is the
main power broker in the country.
	   A French-Egyptian proposal for an international conference to
save the peace process made in May will be discussed.
	   The visit by Assad, who runs Syria with a tight fist and is
accused by the United States of sponsoring terrorism, has stirred
passions that surpass politics.
	   A nagging issue between Paris and Damascus has been the alleged
presence in Syria of Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner and Syria's
refusal to respond to French requests to make a judicial inquiry.
	   In the interview, Assad denied knowledge that Brunner, 87, is in
Syria.
	   ``If you know where he is, go immediately to his address to find
out whether or not he is there,'' Assad said.
	   Brunner is blamed for the deaths of 130,000 Jews from Germany,
Austria, France and Greece. Nazi trackers place Brunner in Syria
under the alias of Georg Fischer.
	   Brunner was placed under formal investigation by France in 1988
for crimes against humanity.

No one jumping for Rwanda tribunal job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The international tribunal for Rwanda,
criticized for its slow pace and winning only one conviction in
more than three years, is facing another problem: too few judges.
	   The U.N. chief has only come up with five of the necessary 18
candidates to fill a new third chamber that was approved by the
Security Council in April.
	   On Wednesday, the council gave Secretary-General Kofi Annan
another month, until Aug. 4, to come up with more candidates.
	   The job, however, is tough to fill. Terms run through May 24,
2003, and judges can't hold any other job during that time.
	   The court is in Arusha, Tanzania and _ unlike the U.N. tribunal
for Yugoslavia at the Hague, Netherlands _ has less than adequate
facilities, administrative and other support systems, court
staffers have complained.
	   In February 1997, U.N. inspector-general Karl Paschke reported
serious administrative and management deficiencies in court offices
that prompted Annan to replace the chief administrator and the
deputy prosecutor.
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was established
November 1994 to try those accused of masterminding and carrying
out the slaughter by Hutu extremists of more than 500,000 Rwandan
Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
	   The tribunal has indicted 35 people, including 23 suspects in
custody and awaiting trial. All face maximum life sentences. Only
one person has been convicted, the former prime minister, and he
pled guilty to genocide and crimes against humanity.
	   So far, Annan has passed along candidates to try the cases from
Senegal, Russia, South Africa, Nepal and Tanzania.

Police seize weapons at scene of protest in Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES background on Orange Order parades; EDITS throughout
to tighten. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Supporters of the Protestant
Orange Order waited on a country road Thursday to resume a
controversial and violent protest after police recovered explosives
and a submachine gun from fields near a rural church.
	   ``While the police will accommodate legitimate and peaceful
protest it will not tolerate the continued use of unarmed
protesters as cover for murderous acts on the security forces,''
Assistant Chief Constable Tom Craig said Wednesday.
	   ``Now is the opportunity to stop the violence and the only way
the Orange Order can control the protests is with limited
numbers.''
	   Eight Orange officials were allowed back on the church grounds
Wednesday night to maintain a token presence. ``You can't get much
more limited than that,'' said Portadown Orange spokesman David
Jones.
	   Two years ago the Orangemen faced down police and the army to
march through a Catholic neighborhood down the Garvaghy Road. But
this year Northern Ireland's largest Protestant fraternal
organization has faced reversals on several fronts.
	   The security forces stopped them at the Drumcree Anglican church
on July 5, enforcing a government order; the police lines held
while hard-line Protestants threw bombs at the barricades, blocked
roads around Northern Ireland and attacked the homes of Catholics
and police with firebombs.
	   Support for the Drumcree protest waned after five police
officers were injured by protesters last week, then it collapsed
after a firebomb killed three young sons of a Catholic woman on
Sunday.
	   The Orange Order stages hundreds of parades every summer, mostly
on the 12th of July anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne, where
the Protestant King William of Orange defeated the Catholic King
James II in 1690.
	   An organization that prides itself on its Christianity and
discipline fell into public feuding between hard-liners and those
who agreed with an Orange chaplain who said no road was worth three
lives.
	   While the Orangemen said they wanted a peaceful and dignified
protest, bombs were thrown and shots were fired at police in the
darkness.
	   On Wednesday, the Orange Order's inability to control its
violent allies was further exposed when police found a submachine
gun, two crossbows, explosive tipped crossbow bolts and other
explosives in the field near the church. Orangemen were ejected
while police continued the search.
	   Police arrested more than 20 people, and four were charged
Wednesday with offenses including riotous behavior and possessing a
bomb.
	   On Wednesday, the Church of Ireland demanded that the Orange
Order ``end their occupation of church property at Drumcree.'' The
church closed the parish hall where protesters had been meeting and
cooking, and also padlocked two fields where Orangemen had been
parking.
	   The Rev. John Dixon, moderator of the Presbyterian Church,
Northern Ireland's largest Protestant denomination, added his voice
to calls for an end to the protest.
	   ``The violent events now nightly associated with the continuing
Orange presence at Drumcree are wholly insupportable by any
Christian standard,'' Dixon said.
	   The Orange lodges of Portadown insisted that their protest would
continue.
	   ``Once the security cordon is lifted people will be ready to go
back. This is definitely not the end of our protest,'' said Jones.
	   But on the Garvaghy Road, where residents strolled casually,
there was growing confidence that the march would not come their
way.
	   ``I would hope that the protest is over,'' said Brid Rodgers of
the Social Democratic and Labor Party, which gets the largest share
of Catholic votes. ``People recognize that the rule of law and
order and the decision of the Parades Commission has been upheld
and that has been welcomed.''
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair said he still hoped the marchers would
agree to negotiate a settlement with the residents.
	   ``With a bit of goodwill and dialogue we can find a way 'round
this, so that people can have their right to march, but at the same
time do it in a way that is peaceful, unprovocative and where local
residents' dignity is respected as well,'' Blair said in the House
of Commons in London.

Japanese stocks lower, dollar higher at midday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks were moderately lower at the end of
morning trading Thursday on profit-taking after a three-day
advance, while the U.S. dollar rose slightly against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 52.70 points, or 0.32
percent, ending the morning session at 16,561.44 after losing more
than 100 points earlier in the session.
	   The index's slide followed gains totaling 524.08 points, or 3.3
percent, over the past three trading days, including Wednesday's
125.23-point, or 0.76 percent, advance.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 2.34 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,272.97
points. The TOPIX closed up 8.66 points, or 0.68 percent, the day
before.
	   Sentiment on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was weighed down by
jitters over the selection of a successor to outgoing Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, traders said.
	   Hashimoto announced his resignation Monday to take
responsibility for the defeat of his ruling party in last Sunday's
upper house elections.
	   Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party will stay in power,
however, as it holds a majority in Parliament's more powerful lower
house. A new party president _ who would become the new prime
minister _ is scheduled to be named July 21. A new Cabinet is
expected to be formed as early as July 30.
	   So far, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi is seen as the
front-runner after gaining support in the LDP.
	   But the delay in a public announcement of his candidacy left the
currency market with little news on which to trade, dealers said.
	   The dollar bought 140.71 yen at midday, up 0.08 yen from late
Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of 140.50
yen overnight.
	   Obuchi was originally due to formally announce his candidacy
Thursday. But that was postponed until Friday as he continued to
work to solidify support, according to party sources.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.410 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.405
percent, driving its price down to 110.34 yen from 110.38 yen.

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Bowler Colin Miller was a surprise
inclusion in the Australian cricket squad named Thursday to tour
Pakistan starting in September.
	   Miller, who last season set a record for the most Sheffield
Shield domestic wickets taken in a season, earned his first call-up
to the national squad when the 14-man touring party was released by
the Australian Cricket Board.
	   The 34-year-old Miller set the record of 70 wickets bowling a
mixture of pace and spinners.
	   Also included in the touring squad is West Australian batsman
Justin Langer, with Greg Blewett omitted.
	   Australia lost 1-0 in the three-test series in Pakistan four
years ago.
	   The squad is: Mark Taylor (captain), Steve Waugh (vice-captain),
Damien Fleming, Ian Healy, Michael Kasprowicz, Justin Langer,
Darren Lehmann, Stuart MacGill, Glenn McGrath, Colin Miller, Ricky
Ponting, Gavin Robertson, Michael Slater, Mark Waugh. (djp)

Hyundai autoworkers end strike ahead of schedule
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Striking workers at Hyundai Motors Co.
returned to work Thursday, pulling out of a nationwide strike begun
two days ago to protest increasing layoffs.
	   The abrupt end of the strike by Hyundai's 26,000 unionized
workers markedly weakened the strength of the nationwide strike
called by the nation's two major umbrella labor groups.
	   The union of Hyundai Motors, the nation's leading automaker, has
been by far the dominant force in a recent series of labor
protests.
	   Hyundai's union had called for an indefinite strike. Leaders
said Thursday they decided to end the walkout to spur negotiations
with management.
	   ``Now that we have taken a flexible stand, we expect that
management will be flexible, too,'' Kim Yun-ho, a union leader,
said.
	   Hyundai's management said the union's decision to halt the
protest would not affect plans to trim its work force by 4,800 in
the coming month. Hyundai already has laid off 5,000 employees.
	   Hyundai workers began the walkout Tuesday, vowing to continue
their protest until the company cancelled its layoff plan.
	   Organizers said the nationwide strike drew about 110,000 workers
from auto, shipbuilding, banking and other industries. But the
government said fewer than 60,000 took part.
	   ``The protests will rapidly fizzle out with the withdrawal of
Hyundai workers,'' one Labor Ministry official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Reversing an earlier decision, the union at Korea Telecom, the
nation's largest phone carrier, decided to join the strike late
Wednesday, but only one-fifth of its 50,000 members responded to
the strike call.
	   Other state-run companies reported normal operations.
	   Armed with court-issued warrants, police sought to arrest about
four dozen union leaders on charges of organizing illegal strikes.
The wanted men took refuge in a Roman Catholic cathedral in central
Seoul, a traditional safe haven for political dissidents and
striking workers. Thousands of police in riot gear stood guard
around the church.
	   A flexible labor market is a key condition of a record dlrs 58
billion bailout of the battered South Korean economy by the
International Monetary Fund in December.
	   Thousands of financially shaky firms have since collapsed,
driving nearly 1.5 million people out of their jobs. By year's end,
the number of jobless people is expected to reach 2 million in a
nation of 42 million people.
	   Government officials have consistently warned that recurring
labor unrest would chase away potential foreign investment _ a key
to reviving the shattered South Korean economy.

<TEXT>
	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ Welton scored his 13th goal of the season
and Wellington Sanchez had two assists as the Los Angeles Galaxy
beat the Tampa Bay Mutiny 3-1 on Wednesday night in Major League
Soccer.
	   Martin Machon and Greg Vanney scored first-half goals for the
Galaxy (16-3) and Welton completed the scoring in the 63rd minute.
Jorge Salcedo scored for the Mutiny (5-15).
	   Doug Petras made his second straight start in goal for the
Mutiny in place of Thomas Ravelli, serving a six-game suspension
for kicking a ball at referee Ruben Rodhas during a July 4 match.
	   Tampa Bay forward Roy Wegerle left the contest late in the first
half because of a hamstring injury. Los Angeles played without
forward Carlos Hermosillo, serving a one-game suspension after
receiving a red card in Friday night's 3-0 loss at D.C. United.
 &UR; Fusion 3, Clash 2 (SO)
	   In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, goalkeeper Jeff Cassar scored on
Miami's sixth shootout attempt as the Fusion welcomed back Carlos
Valderramaby by beating the San Jose Clash 3-2 Wednesday night.
	   After each team converted two of five shootout attempts, John
Doyle shot wide right for the Clash. Cassar, who had saved two of
San Jose's attempts, then went around David Kramer to score the
winner.
	   David Vaudreuil and Pablo Mastroeni also converted for Miami
(7-11), which is unbeaten in four shootouts this season. Victor
Mella and Jeff Baicher hit their attempts for San Jose (6-12).
	   The Fusion was 1-8 without Valderrama, who left May 14 to join
Colombia's national team for World Cup preparations. The lone
victory during his absence was June 27 against Tampa Bay in a
shootout.
	   Colombia was eliminated in the first round in France, scoring
just once in three games.
	   Valderrama was active Wednesday, but struggled in linking up
with his teammates. He set up Leo Cullen perfectly in the first
half, but the rookie couldn't convert.
 &UR; United 1, Revolution 0
	   In Foxboro, Massachusetts, Roy Lassiter scored his 12th goal of
the season as two-time Major League Soccer champion D.C. United
beat the New England Revolution 1-0 on Wednesday night.
	   Lassiter, acquired from Tampa Bay in April, scored on a left
foot shot in the 81st minute. Mike Slivinski, a late-game
replacement at midfield, assisted on the goal, re-directing the
ball from the left wing.
	   United goalkeeper Scott Garlick has five shutouts this year.
	   United (16-5) leads the Eastern Conference with 38 points, 11
more than second-place Columbus. New England (5-14) has lost six
straight at home and 11 of 12 overall.

	   BOSTON (AP) _ Pedro Martinez pitched a four-hitter to outduel
Bartolo Colon in a matchup of All-Star pitchers as the Boston Red
Sox beat the Cleveland Indians 1-0 Wednesday night on a homer by
seldom-used Midre Cummings.
	   Martinez (12-3) struck out nine and walked two in his second
shutout this season and third complete game. He improved to 6-1 in
his last seven starts and faced just two batters over the minimum
through his first seven innings.
	   Colon (9-5) gave up seven hits in eight innings after going 5-0
in his six previous starts.
	   Colon, the winning pitcher in the All-Star game, and Martinez,
who was chosen but not used by Cleveland and AL manager Mike
Hargrove, began the day first and second in the AL in ERA. And they
kept the game scoreless for 4{ innings.
 &UR; White Sox 9, Blue Jays 3, 1st Game
 &UR; White Sox 5, Blue Jays 2, 2nd Game
	   In Chicago, Albert Belle hit a two-run homer in both games to
lead Chicago to the sweep.
	   Belle's homer in the second game was his ninth in his last eight
games and the 299th of his career.
	   In the first game, Belle, Robin Ventura and Ray Durham each
homered to support Jaime Navarro (8-10).
	   In the nightcap, rookie Mike Caruso hit a tiebreaking two-run
homer with two outs in the fifth to spoil Dave Stieb's first start
since 1993 and give the White Sox their sixth win in seven games.
	   Toronto also tied an unusual record in the second game when they
had three batters hit by pitches in one inning.
	   Belle connected for a two-run homer in the first inning of the
second game, his 27th. In the opener, he hit a two-run homer in the
fourth.
	   It is Belle's hottest stretch since he hit 10 home runs in seven
games from Sept. 18-27, 1995, while with Cleveland.
	   Stieb (0-1), making his first start since May 22, 1993, when he
was a member of the White Sox, gave up four runs and seven hits
with two walks over six innings.
 &UR; Yankees 11, Tigers 0
	   In Detroit, Hideki Irabu pitched eight strong innings and New
York hit three home runs in the eighth inning.
	   Chuck Knoblauch hit a three-run homer, Jorge Posada hit a
two-run drive and Paul O'Neill had a solo shot in the eighth off
reliever Doug Bochtler.
	   Knoblauch drove in four runs and O'Neill and Posada were 3-for-5
as the Yankees won for the 12th time in 13 games. Ricky Ledee and
Tim Raines added RBI doubles.
	   New York is 6-1 on its 11-game trip and leads the majors with a
34-15 road record. At 67-21, the Yankees matched the 1902
Pittsburgh Pirates for the best 88-game record for any team this
century.
	   Damion Easley had two singles for the Tigers, who have dropped
19 of their last 22 games against the Yankees.
	   Irabu (8-3), who didn't last more than 5 2-3 innings in any of

	   Rookie Seth Greisinger (1-4) took the loss.

	   YEKATERINBURG, Russia (AP) _ Controversial in death as in life,
Russia's last czar continues to divide the nation he once ruled.
	   A three-day burial ceremony under way for Czar Nicholas II, his
family and servants _ originally planned as a grandiose act of
repentance for the sins of Communism _ has been scaled back because
of contention among the religious and political elite.
	   ``History repeats itself: It's a tragedy now turned into
farce,'' said Pyotr Gritsayenko, a forensic expert who took part in
the discovery and identification of the royal remains.
	   The burial ceremonies began Wednesday in a modest morgue in the
Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg where the royal family was
slain by Bolsheviks 80 years ago.
	   The royal remains were transferred from glass sarcophagi into
small wooden coffins, and local officials signed documents turning
over responsibility for the remains to the federal government.
	   The remains will be taken to St. Petersburg on Thursday and
buried the next day in the cathedral where Russia's past emperors
lie.
	   In St. Petersburg, several hundred priests and Russian Orthodox
believers, carrying banners and icons, rallied Wednesday on a
bridge leading to the fortress where the remains are to be buried.
They said they didn't believe the remains were those of the royal
family.
	   ``This is a mockery,'' said Sergei Vasiliyev, one of the
organizers. ``God will not let this go forward.''
	   Also Wednesday, descendants of the Romanov czars laid wreaths at
a cemetery in St. Petersburg that contains the remains of many
ordinary Russians who died defending the city _ then Leningrad _
during World War II.
	   It appeared to be part of an effort by the Romanovs to reach out
to the Russian public and, perhaps, make amends for their family's
often-despotic past.
	   As solemn music was piped through speakers throughout the
cemetery, Nicholas Romanov, a distant cousin of the last czar, laid
flowers in a ceremony attended by city Gov. Vladimir Yakovlev and
scores of Romanov descendants.
	   Romanov signed a guest book: ``Nikolai Romanovich Romanov, Thank
you from all of us, the Romanovs.''
	   Nicholas II and his family were executed by Bolshevik
revolutionaries on July 17, 1918 _ 80 years ago Friday. Their
bodies were dumped in a mass grave in the forest outside
Yekaterinburg and doused with acid. They remained there until they
were unearthed in 1991.
	   The Russian Orthodox Church has refused to accept a series of
comprehensive genetic tests that scientists believe has
conclusively proven the remains' authenticity.
	   The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II,
went on television Tuesday to defend his decision not to attend the
funeral. He cited ``important scientific objections'' allegedly
casting doubt on the remains' authenticity.
	   President Boris Yeltsin canceled his plans to attend the
services because of the church's objections. The scaled-back
ceremonies will cost the federal government a relatively modest 5
million rubles (dlrs 800,000), according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   The burial procedures began in Yekaterinburg's city morgue,
which has housed the royal remains since they were dug up.
	   The coffins, each decorated with an ornately etched name plate,
hold the remains of Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, three of their
five children and four servants. The coffins of the czar and
czarina are draped with the yellow flag of the Romanov family, and
the servants' coffins are lined with silver, rather than the royal
gold.
	   The other two children, Alexei and the one scientists believe is
Maria, were executed along with the entire family, but their
remains have not been found and most investigators believe the
bodies were burned to ashes.
	   Legend has long held that Anastasia survived the shooting and
escaped, but scientific tests indicate that it is her sister Maria
whose bones are missing.

Malaysian finance minister leaves for Washington
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim
flew to Washington on Thursday for talks with the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund on the Malaysian economic crisis.
	   Although his itinerary was not released, a statement from
Anwar's office said he would ``gather views'' on ways to revive
Malaysia's recession-bound economy.
	   Malaysia has stood firm on declining an IMF-sponsored bailout
even after the government admitted this week that the economy would
shrink between 1 percent to 2 percent in 1998.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has pushed for overturning
IMF-advocated tight monetary policies, saying that companies needed
more credit to grow themselves out of the economic morass.
	   But Malaysia also needs to borrow several billion dollars
overseas to finance development and increased government spending.
The government recently announced two packages totaling 12 billion
ringgit (dlrs 3 billion) to revive many expensive civil works
projects that were postponed at the onset of the economic crisis.
	   The World Bank last month approved a dlrs 300 million loan to
Malaysia to help stimulate its faltering economy and deal with the
social consequences of the Asian financial crisis.
	   It was the first by the bank for Malaysia in four years.
Malaysia is expected to seek another dlrs 700 million credit from
the institution before the end of the year.
	   Anwar returns to Kuala Lumpur on Monday.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ The man Oleg Filatov believes to
be his grandfather will be buried Friday, and he'd like to be
there.
	   But Filatov is not invited. The deceased is Russia's last
emperor, Nicholas II, and Filatov is just one of hundreds of people
with unproven claims to be direct descendants.
	   By definition, all but one or two must be impostors, lured by
the romance surrounding the murdered czar, his wife and five
children. So far, not a single claimant has been able to prove the
relationship, including Filatov, who says he is trying to arrange a
DNA test.
	   ``I want to know the truth,'' he says.
	   The Bolsheviks who killed the czar went to great lengths to
obscure the truth. They didn't want the remains of the family _
especially those of the heir to the throne, Alexei _ to become
objects of worship or to be used to rally political opposition to
their new regime.
	   But the secrecy that helped their political cause also made it
difficult to disprove many of the stories told by would-be
Romanovs, who began popping up around the world soon after the
family disappeared.
	   Over the years, their tales have teased imaginations and spawned
books and films, including 20th Century Fox's animated feature
``Anastasia.''
	   The movie is based on the story of Anna Anderson _ a woman who
appeared in a mental hospital in 1920 and claimed to be the czar's
youngest daughter, Anastasia. She said she had been rescued by one
of the soldiers who killed the rest of the family and was carried
out of Russia on the back of a peasant cart, eventually winding up
in Berlin.
	   Anna Anderson died in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1984. A
decade later _ before the movie went into production _ DNA tests
revealed she was not related and was a Polish peasant named
Franziska Schanzkowska.
	   The truth about would-be Romanovs clearly doesn't dampen the
appeal of the legend. And because two bodies remain missing _ those
of the eldest son, Alexei, and a daughter _ claimants likely will
keep coming forward.
	   Filatov's tale is typical. He says 14-year-old Alexei was still
alive when he fell off the truck carrying the bodies through the
forest where they were to be buried. He was found and befriended by
a number of Russians, including a couple who gave him the name of
their deceased son, Vasily Filatov. He later taught geography and
was said to have an uncanny command of foreign languages and world
history.
	   Filatov says his father never claimed to be the czar's heir. But
he did tell stories about the czar's family and talk about a
``little boy'' who escaped.
	   ``We always wondered, who is that little boy he kept talking
about?''' Filatov says. After his father died in 1988, he and his
sisters reflected on his life. ``Then we knew _ he was that little
boy.''
	   Filatov acknowledges that there are holes in his story: How
could a hemophiliac survive gunshot and stab wounds? Why could his
father speak German but not English, which the Romanov children
spoke with their English-educated mother?
	   And sooner or later he may have to face the truth of DNA.
	   Nicholas Romanov, the head of the Romanov Family Association,
won't comment on Filatov's case. But he expresses sorrow for
claimants like him, saying they would rather believe fairy tales
than deal with reality.
	   ``If you can believe such stories,'' he says, ``you'll believe
anything.''

Japanese politician Okuda dies of cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Keiwa Okuda, a veteran Japanese politician and
one-time transport minister, died of stomach cancer at a hospital
in Tokyo on Thursday, an aide said. He was 70.
	   A former newspaper reporter, Okuda served in several Cabinet
posts, heading the ministries of Posts and Telecommunications and
Home Affairs before taking the helm of the Transport Ministry from
1991-1992 as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party.
	   Okuda, who advocated reform in Japan's political and electoral
systems, left the conservative LDP in 1993 to join other
politicians in forming a new opposition party.
	   His last political affiliation was as a member of the Democratic
Party of Japan, a new party formed in April and the major winner of
last Sunday's elections for the upper house of Parliament.
	   Okuda was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1995 and had been in
and out the hospital since.
	   A funeral service was planned in his hometown of Kanazawa, a
city located in his constituency of Ishikawa prefecture, or state,
in northwestern Japan. The date had yet to be determined.
	   Okuda is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.

Chiapas rebel leader taunts army in first statement in months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Subcomandante Marcos,
the masked guerrilla leader in southern Mexico's Chiapas state,
taunted the army in two bizarre faxes that broke a four-month
silence.
	   ``Yepa, yepa, yepa! Andale, andale! Arriba, arriba! Yepa,
yepa!'' he typed in large letters in a fax released Wednesday. It
was signed ``Subcomandante Insurgente Marcos, alias `The Sub.
Speedy Gonzalez' or, which amounts to the same, `the rock in the
shoe.'''
	   Marcos, leader of the Zapatista National Liberation Army, is
known for his odd sense of humor, and it was unclear exactly what
the taunt referred to.
	   But rumors have been circulating for several days in Chiapas
that the military, which has long claimed to know where Marcos was,
had lost track of him.
	   The fax was dated July 1998 and was addressed to the Mexican and
Guatemalan armies, Interpol in Paris and Mexico's intelligence
service. Marcos signed the fax ``from the mountains of southeastern
Mexico.''
	   He also sent another one-page fax addressed to ``the Mexican
people, the peoples and governments of the world, brothers and
sisters.'' It was in the Mexican Indian language Nahuatl _ a
language from central Mexico, not from Chiapas.
	   ``Zapata lives. Here is your father (a Mexican expression
meaning `I'm the one in charge.') He hasn't died yet. Zapata
lives,'' the fax read.
	   The faxes apparently were intended to put an end to speculation
about Marcos' continued presence among the Zapatistas after a long
silence.
	   The rebel leader, known for the pipe protruding from his ski
mask and his lengthy communiques, hadn't issued a statement since
March, and hadn't been seen publicly since a videotaped statement
in February.
	   He offered no reaction when soldiers and police raided several
pro-Zapatista villages and clashed with Zapatista fighters in
recent months, and he has repeatedly ignored efforts by government
and independent mediators to meet him.

Tokyo considers measures to rein in troublesome alley cats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prompted by growing complaints over a proliferation
of unruly alley cats, Tokyo municipal authorities have begun
considering tougher rules to force residents to keep their pets on
a tighter leash.
	   More than 10,000 complaints about felines were registered in
Tokyo last year, ranging from annoying cries to foul-smelling
feces, according to municipal government statistics. In addition,
some 24,000 cats died in road accidents.
	   ``We're seeing a marked increase in problems involving cats,''
Tokyo health bureau official Yoshiko Somura told The Associated
Press on Thursday.
	   In response, the city has asked a deliberative panel to mull new
measures for encouraging pet owners to spay or neuter their pets
and keep them indoors.
	   A first-ever health bureau survey on the subject found that
about 10 percent of Tokyo's 1.2 million cats are homeless. The
survey results, released Wednesday, also show that Tokyo's cat
population is double that for dogs.
	   While alley cats are scarce in downtown Tokyo, mangy cats can
often be spotted lurking on low rooftops or prowling around
dumpsters in outlying communities.

Tears and shouts greet first direct flights to Cuba in two years

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cubans welcomed the first direct flight between
the United States and Cuba in two years, greeting more than 200
passengers from Miami with screams, waves and tears.
	   It was also an emotional moment for those arriving, who clapped
and cheered as Cuba came into view from the air, then wept when
they saw their relatives waiting for them in the airport terminal
Wednesday.
	   Angel Perera said he and his wife, Mirely, who now live in
Miami, hardly slept the night before in anticipation, eager to see
loved ones they had not seen in years.
	   ``It isn't easy to see your country in ruin _ your friends, your
family, practically with nothing,'' said Perera, who left Cuba four
years ago with one daughter and came back with two. The couple's
second child, now 18 months old, was born in the United States.
	   The flight ended a two-year ban meant to punish the communist
island for shooting down two unarmed civilian planes.
	   The resumption of flights means that families separated by the
Florida straits can see each other more easily, without having to
spend more money to fly to a third country such as the Bahamas or
Mexico.
	   ``I always wanted to fly directly. It's easier and more
comfortable with the kids,'' Perera said. ``Especially with all
these bags.''
	   Relatives and friends crowded in and around the Havana airport
terminal to meet the passengers, many of whom they had not seen
since long before direct flights were canceled.
	   The visitors, who each paid dlrs 399 for a round-trip ticket,
waved at the crowd and rushed through Cuban customs with packages
of clothes, vitamins and basic medicines such as aspirin.
	   Nine-year-old Joslyn Alvarez Dominguez waved at the crowd,
knowing his father was in there somewhere, but not remembering what
he looked like after 3 1/2 years.
	   ``Is this my father?'' he asked his mother as he reached over a
rail to touch a tall man waiting for them outside customs. ``Yes,''
she said, and the boy, dressed up for the occasion in a black tie,
smiled broadly.
	   The Boeing 767-300 rented from United Airlines landed at
Havana's Jose Marti International Airport after a 45-minute flight
from Miami International Airport.
	   It was the first nonstop commercial flight to the island nation
since 1996, when President Bill Clinton canceled direct flights to
punish Fidel Castro's government for shooting down two unarmed
civilian aircraft.
	   The planes carried members of the anti-Castro exile group
Brothers to The Rescue. They were searching for refugees when Cuban
military jets shot them out of the sky, killing four people.
	   Cuba maintains that the planes were shot down after violating
Cuban airspace. The United States insists that the planes were shot
down over international waters. In 1996, a U.N. panel ruled the
planes were shot down over international waters and that Cuba
violated international law.
	   Clinton lifted the ban on direct flights in March, after Pope
John Paul II visited Cuba in January. At the time, Clinton said the
resumption of flights and other measures were designed to build on
the Pope's trip and ``help prepare the Cuban people for a
democratic transition.''
	   The U.S. trade embargo against Cuba remains in place. But the
Treasury Department, which administers it, has granted approvals to
nine companies to resume direct flights.
	   Miami's Airline Brokers Co. _ also known as ABC Charters _ made
the first trip. Seven small charter companies were also approved,
along with American Airlines.
	   During the past two years, flights to Cuba had to stop in the
Bahamas or Mexico, increasing travel time to three hours or more.
The indirect routes also bumped up ticket prices by more than dlrs
100. With nonstop flights, travel agents say the cost will likely
inch downward.
	   But while many passengers said they were glad to be making a
quicker trip to see their relatives, some also said they were
bombarded with mixed emotions when they thought of returning.
	   As he looked out a rain-spattered window while waiting to board
the plane, Perera said that going back was difficult.
	   Working as a welder, he said he is able to support his wife and
children. But in Cuba, he said, his family must live much more
simply.
	   Just an hour before their flight touched down in a muggy Havana,
his wife warned her elder daughter about the lack of air
conditioning at the home of their relatives.
	   ``The air conditioner doesn't work,'' Perera said with a smile.
``They don't have one.''

British Columbia Indian tribe a step closer to historic treaty
</HEADLINE>

	   TERRACE, British Columbia (AP) _ After trying for more than a
century, the Nisga'a Indians of northern British Columbia agreed
with government negotiators on the details of a precedent-setting
land-claims treaty.
	   Federal and provincial officials hope Wednesday's agreement on
the first modern land-claims treaty in British Columbia will clear
the way for similar deals with dozens of other Indian communities
in the province. Unlike Indians elsewhere in Canada, British
Columbia's tribes never gave up their land and resource rights in
treaties.
	   Government and Nisga'a negotiators reached an
agreement-in-principle in February 1996 after more than 20 years of
on-again, off-again talks. Since then, negotiations on the details
of the pact have continued.
	   The final treaty is expected to be similar to the
agreement-in-principle. It provided the Nisga'a with dlrs 190
million (dlrs 128 million U.S.) and about 2,000 square kilometers
(770 square miles) in the Lower Nass valley.
	   The Nisga'a _ more than half of whom live outside the remote
designated territory _ were also to receive fishing and forestry
rights and set up their own government, policing and courts.
	   Joe Gosnell, chief negotiator for the Nisga'a Tribal Council,
said he felt ``absolutely great'' about the deal, although the
Nisga'a didn't get everything they wanted.
	   British Columbia Premier Glen Clark had high hopes for the deal,
saying his government will ensure the legislature ratifies it.
	   ``This is a critical juncture in terms of reconciliation with
aboriginal people in B.C.,'' Clark said. ``It's an important
template for future negotiations. This is for all the marbles, so
to speak.''
	   The deal has its critics. Provincial opposition parties say the
treaty gives the Nisga'a powers and rights not enjoyed by other
British Columbians.

Toyota says overall Thai auto sales in June drop 70
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's depressed economy sent
automobile sales in June down 70.8 percent compared to the previous
year, Toyota Motors Corp. said Thursday.
	   Sales of cars plunged from 36,503 units in June 1997 to 10,641
in June 1998, according to figures released by Toyota, which tracks
industry-wide sales in Thailand.
	   About 90 percent of vehicles sold in Thailand are made by
Japanese automakers.
	   Often called ``the Detroit of Asia,'' auto industry analysts had
predicted more than a million cars would be sold in Thailand by the
year 2000. But the onset of a financial crisis has led to sharply
lower sales.
