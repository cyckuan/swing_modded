In face of real adversity, Cooper comes through like a champion
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Never underestimate the heart of a champion. Even the broken
heart of a champion.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets haven't fully come to grips with Kim Perrot's death
from cancer last week. They're still hurting, and none more so than
Perrot's best friend, Cynthia Cooper. But Cooper, showing herself
to be the consummate professional, put her grief on hold Sunday
afternoon and let hoops set her free.
</P>
<P>
   Temporarily anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prayed, and I prayed, and I prayed,'' Cooper said. ``I'm
still not out of the woods yet, but I felt more like my old self
today.''
</P>
<P>
   In an 83-55 season-saving Comets rout, Coop scored 22 points, 12
coming on timely 4-of-7 shooting from 3-point range. She handed out
nine assists and was ferocious on defense, too, perhaps more
ferocious than she had been all year. If this wasn't the game of
her remarkable, late-blooming career, it came close, certainly
graded on the curve these bizarre and tragic circumstances merited.
</P>
<P>
   ``That it happened when it did was hard for us,'' Cooper said of
Perrot's death. ``If it had occurred even a month ago, maybe we
wouldn't be having this conversation. But it's on everyone's minds,
and you can't just block it out because you have a big game.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as the two-time Most Valuable Player of the WNBA,
Coop feels a strong sense of duty and obligation to her team. She
must lead the Comets by example. Showing sadness, however honest
and obviously heartfelt the sentiment might be, is a bad example
during the money season.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, she had to find her way out of that deep, deep funk she
was in Thursday night, when her shots wouldn't drop and the Comets
would be hammered by the Sparks in Los Angeles. The ugly,
uncharacteristically tepid if not altogether unexpected defeat _
75-60 _ left the only champions the WNBA has known confronting the
reality of a possible early elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Coop's faith has been sorely tested by the events of the last
year. First, it was her mother who died. Now Kim. But prayer is how
she bolsters her resolve, and this was no time to change a winning
game plan.
</P>
<P>
   When morning broke, she did not fear in the least for the
Comets' future, and that was good. Coop's positive vibes filled the
locker room beforehand and then spilled out onto the court.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's rowdy fans took care of the rest. By tip-off, the
Comets' karma was intact. As coach Van Chancellor said, ``I could
tell we were a different team. I thought were were ready to play,
and we were.''
</P>
<P>
   None more so than Cooper. Although she missed two of her first
three shots _ the Comets started 1-for-10 _ there would be no
residual damage. Coop swished two treys to pull the Comets even at
11, and they wouldn't trail again. A six-point lead at halftime had
ballooned to 19 less than 10 minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim wouldn't have been pleased with the way I played Thursday
night,'' Cooper said. ``I was emotionally spent, and honestly, I
let my team down. So it was really important for me to refocus, to
play the kind of ball I know I'm capable of playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm going to suddenly stop thinking about my
mother or Kim. I'm not. Their deaths will stay with me for a long,
long time. But when you have a job to do ''
</P>
<P>
   Another beckons tonight. Sunday was about surviving, and so is
Game 3. The only difference is Los Angeles must confront the same
all-or-nothing scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we'll see how they can handle some adversity,'' Cooper
said. ``But I think we'll have to play an even better game
ourselves. It's going to be pretty intense, because everybody's
backs are against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Houston, the wall helps hold up the Compaq
Center roof. The Sparks have never won here, and the Comets have
lost but twice at home over the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans don't just support this team,'' Chancellor said.
``They love this team. Believe me, they do help us.''
</P>
<P>
   When you are as fatigued as the Comets must be, any extra source
of energy is a boon. Since a week ago Thursday, they have traveled
to LA twice, Sacramento and Lafayette, La., where Perrot's private
funeral was. They have played four games while having to bury a
special teammate, a spunky woman who was quarterbacking their
offense and inspiring their defense one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Comets rolled over Sunday, they would have been
deserving of our affection and sympathy just the same. Instead,
following Cooper's lead, the point became moot. They reduced the
Sparks to mere embers in short order. Hence, anybody dumb enough to
believe women are the inherently weaker sex is not paying
attention.
</P>
<P>
   If you are out there, I would love to introduce you to Cynthia
Cooper and her friends. They are amazing people.

NORMAN SHOWS HE CAN ALSO WIN ON HARD   COURTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMMACK, N.Y. _ Down a break in the third set of his Hamlet Cup
semifinal against Jason Stoltenberg on Saturday night, Magnus
Norman faced two possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   If he came back to win, he would face second-seeded Alex
Corretja in just over 12 hours in his first career hard courts
final. If he lost, he would get to pack up his things, travel to
Manhattan and hook up with his fellow Swedish tennis players at the
Roger Smith Hotel for a party before the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The party waited.
</P>
<P>
   Norman came back to defeat Stoltenberg, and Sunday, on a hot and
breezy afternoon, he won his fourth title this year _ tying him
with Pete Sampras for the ATP tour lead _ with a 7-6 (7-4), 4-6,
6-3 upset of Corretja. The first three titles came on clay in
Orlando, Fla., Stuttgart, Germany, and Umag, Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say, `Pete Sampras and Magnus Norman _ who's Magnus
Norman?''' the 6-foot-2-inch right-hander said with a laugh. ``I
don't know if I deserve to be up there. I know I have won four
titles, but I haven't won Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hamlet Cup victory did continue a rather extraordinary
streak that began after Wimbledon: Norman has won 22 of his last 26
matches. Norman, who is expected to move to No. 26 from 34 when the
new ranking is released Monday, credited his new coach, Fredrik
Rosengren, with whom he has been working since January, for the
turnaround in his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer I had been so negative _ I said I don't want to
play in two hard court tournaments before the Open because I am no
good on hard courts,'' said Norman, who made it to the third round
in Indianapolis last week. ``He made me realize I could do it. This
is the biggest week for us as a team because we've been working
very hard on my hard court game.''
</P>
<P>
   That was obvious against the Spaniard Corretja, whose hard court
performance has also improved substantially over the last few
years. In the first set, with both players' serves plagued by
swirling winds, Norman squeaked by in the tiebreaker, going up by
4-1 when Corretja double-faulted and then sent an easy backhand
sailing past the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   After falling into Corretja's rhythm of long baseline rallies in
the second set, Norman went on the attack in the third. Rushing the
net repeatedly, he got the break in the sixth game. At deuce, he
sent a backhand sizzling down the line, and he then laced a volley
crosscourt to go up by 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   A pumped-up Norman served out the match at love, letting out a
whoop of delight when Corretja's backhand return floated wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, he played much more aggressive and hit harder,''
Corretja said. ``He deserved to win at the end because he was going
for the points and I was sitting back, waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Corretja said he felt confident heading into his first-round
match at the Open against the left-handed Australian Wayne Arthurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to play five matches _ it helped my confidence,''
Corretja said. ``I did not play my best tennis today, but now I
will rest and prepare myself for the Open. If I am mentally strong
and ready to go I think I can do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman, whose confidence was bolstered even more by beating a
top player Sunday, was also looking forward to the Open, where he
will face No. 17-seeded Felix Mantilla of Spain in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to keep my game going for the next few weeks,'' said
Norman, who earned $46,000 for the victory. ``I am not going to be
satisfied with this _ I have more goals. The guys who play me in
the Open know they're going to have to play well.'' &QL;

GIANTS STARTING CENTER MAY MISS THE SEASON OPENER
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tests Sunday on the knee injury of Giants center Brian Williams
in Saturday night's loss to the Jets provided the team with better
news than expected, but the valuable, veteran lineman may still
miss the regular-season opener Sept. 12 at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a doctor's preliminary examination after the game, the
Giants had been preparing to play without Williams for a month.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Fassel of the Giants said that there was no timetable
for Williams' return, but he acknowledged that an early
interpretation of a magnetic resonance imaging test on Williams'
left knee indicated there was no damage to ligaments and that the
injury should not require a lengthy recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Williams missed the team's first game, it could be a
significant absence for the Giants, who also lost their backup
center, Lance Scott, to a knee injury in practice last week.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams left the field early in the second quarter of the
16-10 loss, the effect on the team was chilling.
</P>
<P>
   It did not carry the devastation familiar from a year ago
against the Jets, when Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn limped off.
It took only minutes last August to understand that Sehorn was out
for the season, and indeed he has yet to return.
</P>
<P>
   But with Williams on the sideline, the Giants' offense, so
poised and potent in the two previous preseason games, immediately
played as if panicked and powerless. It is not called the center
position without reason. Without Williams, the Giants looked
rudderless.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the notion that Williams could miss any time
during the regular season distressed an already disheartened locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in the locker room may be a bit brighter when the team
reconvenes Monday morning. Fassel was cautious, if optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for another opinion,'' said Fassel, adding that
Dr. Russell Warren, the team surgeon, had not examined the test
results. ``We aren't saying anything definitive. But the people who
have looked at this so far feel like it'd be a short-term thing.''
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's game, Fassel said that there was no structural
damage to the knee but suggested there might be a cartilage
problem.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how the injury was sustained.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who returned to the Giants after missing two years
with an eye injury, has had a dramatic impact on the Giants'
quality of play this year.
</P>
<P>
   He is the team's most senior player in terms of time of service
(11 years) and age (33). His leadership has been plainly evident on
what was the National Football League's youngest team the past two
seasons. His ability to elevate the line's pass protection skills
and his ability to get the line to play more cohesively _ the most
important component of good line play _ has been one of the more
impressive stories of the Giants' preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was considered one of the best centers in the NFL
before his eye injury, has also implored the offense to play
tougher and with more confidence, something notably missing in
recent seasons. The dropoff in the Giants' production _ as well as
the team's equilibrium in the face of a blitzing opponent _ was
obvious when Williams left Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of Williams' absence was exacerbated by Scott's
injury. Scott, who tore a knee ligament last week, had been the
starting center for most of the past two years. He had shifted to
left guard since Williams' return, but figured to be a highly
experienced backup at center.
</P>
<P>
   The center duties on Saturday instead fell to Derek Engler, a
third-year player. Engler, 25, is a valued reserve who played
capably as a rookie starter in 1997 until he broke his ankle. Since
then, Engler has not started a game. He could easily play well for
Williams, but he has big shoes to fill, especially because Williams
had created such a comfort level for the line.
</P>
<P>
   And should Williams miss any extended time, it could stunt the
development of rookie Luke Petitgout, who is starting at left guard
because Scott is out.
</P>
<P>
   Petitgout would normally be lining up shoulder to shoulder with
Williams, who could counsel the rookie on line calls and other
decisions. Naturally, it never hurts a rookie to be playing between
two seasoned linemen like Williams and left tackle Roman Oben.

CASH FOR TRASH KEEPS HOMEOWNERS SMILING

<P>
   TULLYTOWN, Pa. _ On the Delaware River a few miles south of
Trenton, Martha Paden, 72, was sunbathing on the poop deck of the
black and white houseboat she and her husband have lived on for 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Across the water and beyond some trees, a bald mountain
challenged the sky. But even when the roar of giant trucks reached
the boat, Mrs. Paden was content.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, Mrs. Paden, a retired roller-skating teacher, has
seen the mountain slowly rise, built of countless truckloads of
trash.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of hundreds of modern, leak-proof private landfills
that have opened around the country in recent years, replacing
thousands of town dumps.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of trash from New York businesses wind up here, and as the
city closes down the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, some of
the city's household trash is likely to end up here as well,
according to Waste Management Inc., the company that runs the
landfill.
</P>
<P>
   And that is fine with many people here. Despite anti-garbage
rhetoric from elected officials, dozens of places appear content
with an influx of trash _ as long as it comes with a big infusion
of cash.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Tullytown, a small borough of Philadelphia commuters
and blue-collar workers, was near bankruptcy, said Robert
Shellenberger, a former mayor.
</P>
<P>
   When Waste Management offered large payments for the right to
build the dump, there was opposition, Shellenberger said. But the
money overcame it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the town, population 2,300, is flush with income from the
dump _ fees last year totaled $2.3 million _ and the trappings are
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   A two-story atrium graces Tullytown's new $1.2 million Borough
Hall. Four late-model patrol cars are nearby. Roads are freshly
paved, and there is a new park.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is more remarkable than the $1,500 checks that the
Borough Council sends each holiday season to each of the borough's
700 homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   Town officials say that in a few years, the cash surplus
generated by the garbage is likely to reach a figure at which the
checks would be able to continue indefinitely, even after the dump
closes in decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Mailey said she still generally opposed the landfill, which
loomed behind the backyard of the house she and her husband bought
15 years ago. But her antipathy for it fades a bit every December.
``The check comes in handy at Christmas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As the financial benefits have accrued, complaints to
Pennsylvania environmental officials about Tullytown's dump and
another one a few miles away have dropped markedly, to two so far
this year from 30 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On her boat, Mrs. Paden said she was not bothered by the mound
in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pretense of it is that it's my mountain,'' she said.

POOR PITCHING AND SLOPPY FIELDING UNDO THE METS IN LOSS TO
DIAMONDBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Mets pitcher Al Leiter fidgets so much and so
routinely on the mound _ adjusting his cap, swiping the dirt in
front of the pitching rubber with his right foot, tugging on the
belt of his pants, rubbing the ball furiously _ that it is hard to
tell sometimes if he is distressed by something that is happening
in the game or if he even realizes what he is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for Leiter's mannerisms, it's safe to assume
he wasn't thrilled with his role in what amounted to a pitchers'
duel in reverse Sunday night. This game evolved as if he and
Arizona's starter, Andy Benes, went 20 paces and then fired water
pistols at each other. Their aim wasn't great then, either.
</P>
<P>
   In a game as ugly as a mosh pit, that included poor pitching
(the teams used nine pitchers, and the Mets relievers gave up two
runs) and erratic fielding, the Diamondbacks outlasted the Mets,
8-4, to win 2 of 3 from a potential playoff opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Mets 3 1/2 games behind the National League
East-leading Atlanta Braves, who beat St. Louis, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter and Benes each struggled with his control from the first
batters he faced. But Benes, who allowed a leadoff single to Rickey
Henderson, never settled down after escaping the first inning
without a run.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter did. He gave up four runs in an abysmal first inning in
which it seemed he would never retire a batter. He walked the first
two batters he faced, gave up a double that dropped between
Henderson and center fielder Darryl Hamilton in left center when it
appeared Hamilton called for the ball, then backed away at the last
moment.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed the first run to score. Then Matt Williams laced a
first-pitch double down the left-field line that bounced against a
pole at the bullpen fence and rolled away from Henderson to give
Arizona a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   A Greg Colbrunn comebacker rolled to the right of the mound and
Leiter threw wildly to John Olerud, allowing Williams to advance to
third. Bernard Gilkey then flied out to almost exactly the same
spot as Luis Gonzalez's fly ball, scoring Williams for the fourth
run of the inning. Leiter was wiping his foot in front of the
rubber so furiously every time he had the ball that a trough was
probably forming.
</P>
<P>
   As terrible as Leiter's start was, Benes was almost worst. When
he threw strikes, the Mets hit them or had worked Benes deep into
the count. The Mets scored three runs in the second, led off when
Roger Cedeno singled and moved to second on Todd Pratt's groundout.
He scored when Rey Ordonez, who has been hot at the plate on this
road trip, sent a single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter sacrificed Ordonez to second and he scored when Henderson
got his second single of the night to make the score 4-2. Henderson
stole second and came home for the third run when Edgardo Alfonzo's
double drove him in and the Mets trailed by 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks and Mets each added another run and then, just
as the fans were reaching for their pillows and blankets to settle
in for a long night, the teams stopped scoring. Benes was gone
after the fourth, having thrown 103 pitches and allowing nine hits.
Leiter forged on a bit longer and his sixth inning was his finest.
He struck out two and got Tony Womack to fly out.
</P>
<P>
   But Bobby Valentine's gamble to leave his ace in for the seventh
backfired. He began the inning with 102 pitches and, after getting
Jay Bell to fly out, Gonzalez hit an 0-1 pitch over the right-field
wall. It was Leiter's 110th pitch and his last. He left with the
the Mets behind by 6-4 after allowing six runs on seven hits and
walking six.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter has been a vastly improved pitcher since he beat the
Yankees at Yankee Stadium on the day after three Mets coaches were
fired in June, but this outing was one of his worst of the season.
It dropped him to 10-9, and was reminiscent of how he pitched in
the first two months, when he struggled in almost every outing got
just two victories in his first 10 starts.

YANKEES SWEEP MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yes, the New York Yankees have a good team. They are
31 games over .500, they've won two of the last three World Series
and there's little they don't do well.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners manager Lou Piniella did not think it necessary to
expand on that Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really want to talk about their pitching, their
hitting, their defense, their speed,'' said Piniella, after the
Yankees stomped the M's, 11-5, to complete a three-game sweep at
Yankee Stadium. ``I have no interest in talking about it _ none,
zero, zilch, nada, nil, you can name it in whatever language you
want.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team beats you seven games in a row, it gets a little
frustrating, too. It's not much fun to sit there and be on the
other side of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not look like much fun for Piniella, who was ejected from
the finale of the Yankees' four-game sweep three weeks ago at
Safeco Field. He stuck this one out, enduring a gruesome afternoon
in which the Mariners made three errors, allowed an inside-the-park
home run, a bases-loaded walk and leadoff base runners in five of
the past six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The manager's only notable on-field appearance came in the
sixth, when Todd Williams, brought in to keep the Mariners' deficit
at 6-4, walked leadoff hitter Joe Girardi and fell behind the next
hitter, Chuck Knoblauch. Piniella came to the mound _ with a brief,
emphatic message for Williams _ then returned to the dugout to
watch an embarrassing play unfold.
</P>
<P>
   The lumbering Girardi broke for second, apparently on a missed
hit-and-run. Catcher Dan Wilson's throw bounced off shortstop Alex
Rodriguez for an error, and by the time Rafael Bournigal recovered
it, he was in short right field. Girardi faked toward home, and
while Bournigal said he knew Girardi wasn't running, he felt he had
to throw home in case he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he decides to go, and I hesitate, then I might have a
problem throwing him out from that far away,'' Bournigal said.
</P>
<P>
   The throw hit the cutout where the grass meets the dirt in front
of the plate, skidded past Wilson, and with Williams backing up
third and not home, Girardi scored easily to give the Yankees a 7-4
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sinclair came in, walked Paul O'Neill, and surrendered a
two-run homer to Bernie Williams that made it 9-4 New York.
</P>
<P>
   It said something that Piniella praised the next reliever, Tom
Davey, who gave up two runs on three hits and a hit batsman but
issued no walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got hit a little bit, but that's OK, I don't mind that,''
Piniella said. ``But Williams walked (one), Sinclair walked (two) _
you can't get it done up here like that. Especially against a good
team like the Yankees, they're going to take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella was asked if that's part of the learning process for a
staff that came into this series with six rookies among its 12
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about the learning process,'' Piniella said.
``What it shows you is we're outmanned, plain and simple. If
there's a lesson to be derived, it's that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners finished their season series with the Yankees with
one win in 10 games. The M's have won only eight of 29 games
against the American League's first place teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees not only exploited the struggling Mariner hitters,
they also shut down Ken Griffey Jr., Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez,
who have been hitting well. The Mariners' 3-4-5 hitters batted .194
in this series (6-for-31), with no runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to point at anybody, because I look in the mirror
and I haven't gotten the job done,'' said Rodriguez. ``You can't
make mistakes over and over again and try to beat this team. You
have to play flawless baseball to compete. The effort was there, we
just didn't get the job done. They really put it to us this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners led, 2-0, doubling their run total from the series'
first two games on Wilson's two-out, two-run double in the second
inning. It was the Mariners' first hit this series with runners in
scoring position, and gave Paul Abbott a lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Abbott was not sharp. He allowed three consecutive singles
to start the third, the last one bringing in a run. O'Neill then
slapped a grounder to third, but Russ Davis, shifting to get in
position for a would-be third-to-first double play, couldn't field
the ball. It went for an error and brought in a run, and the
Yankees took a 3-2 lead when Abbott walked Ricky Ledee with the
bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got behind hitters, and I had to make pitches that you
don't want to make,'' said Abbott (5-1). ``I just gave them too
many looks at too many pitches, and they're way too good a team to
do that to.''
</P>
<P>
   For Abbott, the final blow came in the fifth, again with Ledee
hitting. With two outs and a runner at first, Ledee crushed a pitch
deep to center. Griffey gave chase, leaped and missed _ ``Once it
hit the wall, I didn't see the ball,'' he said _ and Ledee circled
the bases for a stand-up inside-the-park homer.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first inside-the-park homer at Yankee Stadium since
Deion Sanders did it against the Kansas City Royals _ beating
fellow two-sport star Bo Jackson's throw to the plate _ in 1990.

HIT-STARVED IBANEZ HUNGRY FOR SOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Raul Ibanez's first hit after the All-Star break was
a grand slam, so maybe he had nowhere else to go.
</P>
<P>
   But Ibanez never thought the second half would continue as it
has. The Mariners outfielder/first baseman, who was hitting .333 at
the break, has just 11 hits in 68 at-bats since, for a .162
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to helping the team more than I have,''
Ibanez said. ``I've struggled this whole second half, but I think
I've found something.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's game, hitting coach Jesse Barfield worked with
Ibanez on staying closed in his stance, and the adjustment worked
immediately. In his first at-bat, Ibanez homered off the New York
Yankees' Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're searching and searching and searching, and then when
you find something, it's like you've learned to hit all over
again,'' Ibanez said. ``We all know what we're doing wrong, but the
thing is, how do you stop it? You have to be able to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibanez was hitless in his last two at-bats Saturday, and popped
up with the bases loaded Sunday as a pinch hitter against Yankees
closer Mariano Rivera, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a quick hip going right now, and from a hitting
standpoint, that's suicide,'' said Barfield, adding that Ibanez has
struggled with outside pitches. ``He understands that, and he's
working hard to alleviate it. If it's all up to work ethic, he's
got a great chance, because he works extremely hard and he's
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibanez still has a month to raise his stock as the Mariners
prepare for the offseason. The 27-year-old could figure in at a
number of positions that might be available next year, including
first base, left and right field. He has made 16 starts since the
All-Star break _ after making just 10 starts the whole first half _
and that has been an adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're pinch hitting, you just have one at-bat, and it's
a tough thing to do,'' he said. ``But your level of concentration
only has to be intense for one at-bat, just a few pitches. When
you're playing more, you have to readjust and spread out your focus
to more at-bats. But it's way better to play more than pinch hit.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his chances of playing his way into next year's lineup,
Ibanez said he's narrowed his concerns to the Mariners' wild-card
pursuit. And there is opportunity to correct his own troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that there's time left to turn everything around,'' he
said. ``I'm very confident that I'll be able to. I know I'm a
better hitter than I've been, so I'm not really worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   BLOWERS SIGNED: The Mariners signed 34-year-old Mike Blowers to
a minor league contract over the weekend. Blowers made his debut
for Class AAA Tacoma Saturday, starting at first base and going
0-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   The UW product, who hit .251 with 10 homers and 43 runs batted
in this year for the Hanshin Tigers of Japan's Central League,
batted .237 for Oakland last year and .293 for the '97 Mariners.
The M's have used seven first basemen since trading David Segui
last month and are expected to make Blowers the eighth sometime in
September.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA BASES: Because they used three relievers Sunday, the
Mariners will send down a pitcher and promote right-hander Ken
Cloude to start the second game of today's doubleheader in Chicago.
... With the offense sagging, manager Lou Piniella rearranged his
lineup Sunday, putting Russ Davis in the leadoff spot. The last
time Davis batted there? ``Probably Little League,'' Davis said. He
had batted no higher than sixth this season. ... David Bell's home
run in the fifth inning was his second since June 12. ... When Paul
Abbott walked Ricky Ledee to force in a run in the third inning, it
was the Mariners' 24th bases-loaded walk of the year, the most in
the majors. ... Yankees third baseman Scott Brosius left the team
to travel to Oregon to be with his cancer-stricken father ...
Players from Little League World Series finalists Osaka, Japan, and
Phenix City, Ala., were honored before the game.

SEAHAWKS WIN SPELLS RELIEF FOR FOLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ It might have been only a second-half stint in
a preseason game, and a short one at that, but the importance of
his performance was not lost on Glenn Foley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was pressure on me tonight _ pressure like I hadn't felt
in over a year,'' Foley said after the Seahawks' 41-7 romp over the
Arizona Cardinals at the Kingdome on Saturday night. ``But I've
always played pretty well under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley completed only 4 of 5 passes, but two went for touchdowns
as he directed the Seahawks' second-string offense to three TDs in
his three series.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly numbers that will get him into Canton any time soon,
but the necessary effort to keep him in Kirkland.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure Foley spoke of, and had worn like a hair shirt for
the past two weeks, was self-generated. The Seahawks had worked a
trade in March with the New York Jets to obtain Foley as insurance
because Jon Kitna was still untested and about to test drive the
complex offense of new coach Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Foley's play has made him look more like a liability.
</P>
<P>
   In the preseason opener, he threw two interceptions and lost a
fumble to set up 21 Buffalo points in an embarrassing 24-10 loss to
the Bills. On the training-camp practice fields in Cheney, Foley
further tested Holmgren's already fiber-optic-thin patience by not
playing well and not seeming to be affected by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy for Glenn, because he really didn't play up to his
expectations or mine in the first game,'' Holmgren said Sunday,
before reviewing the videotape of his first victory as coach of the
Seahawks. ``(Saturday) night, he was better. Clearly better.''
</P>
<P>
   Redemption was a long time coming for Foley. He did not play in
the second preseason game at San Francisco. He spent the 14 days
between stints watching and learning, but also wondering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating because I didn't get to play in the second
game. So it was a long two weeks for me _ the longest two weeks of
my life,'' he said. ``Playing as poorly as I did in the first game,
I was itching to get back. But I just waited my turn and got two
more weeks of what the offense is all about, what it's like on game
day, after watching Jon and Brock (Huard, the No. 3 quarterback) do
it for a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that helped me a lot,'' he said. ``But I put a lot of
pressure on myself this week to show everybody what I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley was not without his foils and his friends Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   His second TD pass _ a 15-yarder to fullback Oscar Gray _ was on
the same play he threw for one his interceptions against the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time he did kind of what I asked him to do,'' Holmgren
said. ``I said, `See, it works.' So I can teach to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley's first TD pass _ a 23-yarder to Michael Jackson _ came
with an emotional and physical lift from the veteran wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn needed this game. We talked about that in the huddle
before the play because there was a TV timeout,'' Jackson said. ``I
told Foley, `Just put air under it and I'll find a way of getting
it somehow.' He was feeling pressure, so I told him, `Give me a
little of it. Let's share it. My shoulders are broad enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson used those broad shoulders, not to mention his long arms
and route-running savvy, to make a nice adjustment on the pass,
twisting from right to left and taking it over his shoulder behind
the Cardinals' rookie cornerback Coby Rhinehart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great throw by Glenn,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great catch by Mike,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was pressure there for Glenn, we all knew it,''
offensive tackle Grant Williams said. ``But he stepped up like a
champ. He was more lively and having fun in the huddle.''
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time in two weeks, able to smile about
something he had done on the field.

LONG SEASON FOR COLLINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A person would have to be pretty heartless to not empathize with
Terry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine spending every moment of your life trying to fix all
that is wrong with the Anaheim Angels, investing every ounce of
your energy into this impossible task because you don't know how to
do it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   Some Angels players may shrug off loses, but Collins can't. He
doesn't know how.
</P>
<P>
   Some Angels may snipe at their manager behind his back, but he
can't let that get in the way of who he plays. That's a luxury for
the few managers with job security.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans may say the Angels are cursed, but he can't indulge in
potions or bad karma.
</P>
<P>
   So Terry Collins resides in his own personal dungeon, a lonely
place where the frustration never ebbs for long.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to Boston and three losses to the Red Sox,
Collins sat in his claustrophobic office at Anaheim Stadium and
tried to find different ways to answer questions that have lost
their meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this personal hell is to be reminded every day that all
is lost. ``You can't keep talking about,'' said Collins. ``There's
only so many ways you can be negative. It gets old.''
</P>
<P>
   Cam he at least go home and talk out his frustrations? ``There's
no one there to talk to,'' said Collins, who has no wife, no
roommate, no pets.
</P>
<P>
   Friends? Long walks on the beach? Books? Relaxation tapes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I'll go to a movie, or go out to dinner,'' said
Collins. But the frustrations usually return before he digests his
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the business, part of the game,'' he said.
``There are good times, and there are crappy times, and we're in
the middle of a crappy time. But if you can't deal with it, you
shouldn't be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the kind of person (who can just tune it out). I'm
always thinking about the next game. Baseball can be a grind on the
major-league level. You play 162 games, and you're expected to play
162 games hard. When the season's over, you can leave it, but not
until it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   There is ample evidence that many Angels metaphorically ended
their seasons in July. The Angels were on a modest 12-7 run before
the All-Star break and, despite being under .500, were only 6{
games behind the Texas Rangers in the A.L. West.
</P>
<P>
   They won their first game back, then promptly fell off the
planet. They lost 11 straight games, the biggest chunk of a hideous
4-23 run. Since July 16, the Angels are a feckless 9-33.
</P>
<P>
   With just 51 wins (only Detroit and Florida have fewer), the
Angels are on pace to eclipse franchise lows set by the 1980 team -
just 65 wins, a .406 winning percentage, and 30 games under .500.
</P>
<P>
   This will likely be the 11th Angels team in 38 years to finish
20 games or more under .500 and six of the last seven precipitated
managerial changes, either at midseason or the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Collins suffers the same fate as Bobby Winkles,
John McNamara, Buck Rodgers and Marcel Lacheman remains to be seen.
Disney Sports extended his contract, but it was that subject which
sent the clubhouse into hysterics and the team on its descent.
</P>
<P>
   A case can be built against Collins. He's intense and projects
nervous energy, which can be a real negative in the dugout. He
wants his players to hustle in a nonchalant era of baseball. He
shares some
</P>
<P>
   micro-managing bad habits with other managers, and one has to
search the data base hard to remember a game he's won through
managerial skill. His recent decisions to use closer Troy Percival
in the eighth inning are examples of a manager lunging for answers.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins doesn't deserve the resentment he receives from many
players. He may not be a great manager, but this is his first
losing season on any level since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   How different might things have been in 1997 if Tony Phillips
isn't busted? How different might things have been last year if
Bill Bavasi deals for a much-needed pitcher down the stretch? The
Angels led the A.L. West as September began.
</P>
<P>
   How different would 1999 have been if Mo Vaughn doesn't hurt
himself in the top of the first inning of the
</P>
<P>
   season's first game?
</P>
<P>
   One really needs a tour of the Angels clubhouse to understand
why a critic might side with Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's refurbishment of the stadium included a gorgeous new
clubhouse that is spacious and well-appointed: Two massive big
screen TVs, a deluxe CD system, and subdued lighting like that of a
posh hotel bar.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is ever there. Seriously. You can find a few players
watching other sports events before or after games, but there is no
camaraderie. Many players hide out in the player-only dining lounge
or trainer's room. And when you do see players in the clubhouse,
they are often gathered in little cliques and whispering among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm Tony Tavares, the president of Disney Sports who OK'd a
lush locker room despite believing ballplayers are spoiled, I close
the private lounge, rip out the carpet and track lighting, and put
in some nuclear illumination.
</P>
<P>
   Collins meets his fate daily in his little office with the 200
watt lights, and then takes it home with him, which is more than
one can say for the players. At the very least, you wish his misery
had more company.

   The fringes of Hurricane Dennis began lashing the Carolina coast
with gusts and rain Sunday, prompting the pre-emptive evacuation of
more than 30,000 vacationers and residents from North Carolina's
barrier islands and forcing swimmers out of the water as far north
as Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night the storm began turning east, away from land, when
it was still 150 miles off Wilmington, N.C. And forecasters did not
expect the center of the storm, with its 105-mile-an-hour winds, to
get within 75 miles of the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the hurricane-force winds are going to remain
offshore,'' Tom Addington, a spokesman for the National Weather
Service in Wilmington, said at 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But winds of 60 miles an hour were predicted for the coast
overnight, accompanied by tides several feet above normal. Up to
five inches of rain is expected to fall on the Carolinas Monday.
And a hurricane warning remained in effect for the North Carolina
coast from the South Carolina state line to Oregon Inlet, near Nags
Head.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's governor, James B. Hunt Jr., bracing for the
worst, declared both a state of emergency and a state of disaster
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Further north, Virginia Beach and two beaches on Long Island's
South Shore closed to swimmers, and more rescues of swimmers than
usual were reported in rough waters off Ocean City, Md. A tropical
storm warning extended from Oregon Inlet north to Chincoteague,
Va., and south as far as Savannah, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Because of possible storm surges, which can cause flooding and
block roads, more than 20,000 people were evacuated from Ocracoke
and Hatteras, the delicate barrier islands of the Outer Banks north
of Wilmington. Closer to Wilmington, more than 10,000 people were
evacuated from Carolina Beach, Wrightsville Beach, Kure Beach and
Figure Eight Island, emergency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the Carolinas, residents and business owners went
through the familiar drills of boarding up houses and stores.
Thousands of tourists who had hoped to spend the second to the last
weekend of the summer season at the beach packed up their cars and
reluctantly headed home, taking their money with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a bunch of cancellations today and we've lost ten to
twelve thousand dollars,'' Keli Black, a hotel employee in
Charleston, S.C. _ where half an inch of rain fell Sunday _ told
CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses in North Carolina complained that the state was
overreacting by ordering the evacuations, but Robert Carver, a
spokesman for the division of emergency management, said officials
would rather be safe than sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows exactly where this storm is going,'' Carver said.
``We are trying to find a happy medium between overreacting and not
reacting appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mike Murphy, a state environmental program manager in
Virginia, it was the second straight year that a storm forced the
family to evacuate during a vacation in North Carolina. Last year's
culprit was Hurricane Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' Murphy, 45, said as he and his wife
and twins arrived in Wilmington after being evacuated from Topsail
Island, about 30 miles to the north. Around noon Sunday, their
rental company called and said they had to be off the island by 8
p.m. While Murphy and his wife packed, the children watched videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did this last year, so they know what to expect,'' Murphy
said. ``I guess they're hurricane veterans now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, red flags prohibiting swimming flew over Virginia
Beach, although the beaches stayed open, the police said. The
authorities also canceled a fireworks display that is a regular
fixture at the beach in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean City, Md.'s beaches remained open Sunday, but Lt. Mike
Stone of the Ocean City Beach Patrol said rough water had kept the
patrol busier than usual, with more than 200 rescues.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York metropolitan region, the sun was out, but the
combined forces of Hurricane Dennis and Hurricane Cindy, which is
400 miles east of Bermuda, caused waves big enough to prompt the
State Parks Department to close two Long Island beaches _ Jones
Beach and Robert Moses State Park _ to swimmers, although
sunbathing was allowed.
</P>
<P>
   By 1 p.m., five- to seven-foot swells had calmed enough that
some beaches allowed wading up to the waist, but no farther, said
George Gorman, a director of recreation services for the Parks
Department.
</P>
<P>
   High tides also washed out a beach road used by fishermen at
Democrat Point in Robert Moses State Park, Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the restrictions, the crowds were actually about 10
percent to 20 percent above normal for this time of year, Gorman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put up signs at the toll plazas warning people, but they
didn't turn around,'' he said. ``It turned out to be a great beach
day.''
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, two county-run emergency shelters were opened
at 3:30 p.m. Sunday in Wilmington. All city and county offices,
courts and all public schools will be closed today in the
Wilmington area.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters opened in northern South Carolina coastal counties
yesterday as well.
</P>
<P>
   In Litchfield, S.C., south of Myrtle Beach, a property manager,
Bobby Warner, oversaw precautionary measures at the Litchfield By
the Sea resort. Workers were busy boarding up buildings and
securing outdoor furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are being very careful,'' Warner said. ``We have been
through this many times before and have learned to err on the side
of caution. We've pretty much got this down to a science.''
</P>
<P>
   Caution was also the watchword of the day at Alligator Adventure
in North Myrtle Beach, S.C., where workers hurried to reinforce a
fence surrounding the park with steel to make sure the 800
alligators inside stayed inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst-case scenario,'' said the alligator park's manager,
Matt Burmeister, ``is that some may get out of their individual
pens, but they are not getting out of our park.''
</P>
<P>
   For a crew of students from Clemson University, driving four
research vans to Wilmington, the object was to get close to the eye
of the storm. Their vans were pulling trailers carrying towers that
they hoped to place in the hardest-hit areas on land to measure the
wind speed of the strongest part of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get an accurate measure of wind speed on the
ground,'' said Don Key, 22, a civil engineering student.
``Typically, winds are measured at high levels, but we are trying
to see the wind speeds at house level so we can write more accurate
building codes.''

BOEING HOPING HAPPY WORKERS NOW WILL MEAN BETTER PRODUCTIVITY
LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. and its top union are optimistic they
have forged a three-year contract that will win ratification from
the Machinists on Wednesday _ and boost worker productivity and the
company's performance for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and the International Association of Machinists base
their optimism on the fact that Boeing addressed many union demands
in the contract, which was unveiled on Saturday, including a
generous wage increase and improved pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The union's hopes are also built on what the company didn't
offer, such as alterations to the workweek or new health care
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives seem to be betting they can improve operations
by cooperating with Machinists rather than trying to squeeze
concessions from them during a labor dispute, say some financial
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major turn in the company's strategy _ making a bet
that a happier work force will hopefully lead to better
productivity,'' said Peter Jacobs, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie
Group Inc., a Seattle-based investment firm. ``That's where the
real risk is in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's desire to avoid a fight with its largest union _
especially in a year when it's scheduled to deliver a record 620
airplanes _ became evident when Chief Executive Officer Phil Condit
entered the talks on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are truly at a crossroads. With ratification, we can go
forward together to build a more secure future,'' Condit wrote in
an open letter sent to employees represented by the Machinists
union.
</P>
<P>
   While Boeing must wait until Wednesday for its employees to
vote, investors will render their verdict on Monday _ in the
trading of Boeing stock _ on whether they think the contract will
hurt or help the company's performance. Wall Street's opinion is
important because the company is trying to recover from two years
of production problems and bolster its image in the eyes of
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Whitlow, who tracks Boeing for Safeco Asset Management,
said Monday's reaction was likely to be modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they didn't strike is a plus,'' Whitlow said.
</P>
<P>
   If union members endorse the contract, Boeing will be able to
claim it negotiated 36 consecutive contracts, without a strike
during the last two years, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   So far, many union members have a positive view of the company's
strategy and offer, according to Steve Vergala Sr., a union
steward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the general consensus is, `Yeah I like this,'''
Vergala said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, some employees are upset and ratification is far from
guaranteed. For example, older Boeing workers are disappointed the
contract only offers a 25 percent increase in monthly pension
benefits, according to other union members. The company can also
abuse proposed language that is designed to protect union jobs,
according to David Clay, who works at Boeing's Everett plant.
</P>
<P>
   Under the contract, Boeing pledged there would be no layoffs due
to subcontracting or offloading, although other layoffs are
possible. In addition, a joint committee will review subcontracting
or offloading 180 days before any action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no teeth'' in job security provisions, Clay, who
opposes the contract, said.
</P>
<P>
   The Machinists will have the final say on Wednesday when they
cast their ballots at union halls spread throughout Washington,
Portland, Ore., and Wichita, Kan. The contract covers 44,000 Boeing
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot will have two parts. A Machinist must check one box
to ratify the proposal or another to reject it. Then a workers must
vote to either reaffirm or reject the union's authority to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a majority of those voting reject the offer, the
contract is accepted unless two-thirds vote to strike. The current
contract expires at 12:01 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While Boeing officials are hopeful their ``best and final
offer'' will be accepted, they realize they won't know until late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now in the hands of each individual employee,'' said
Peter Conte, who has been Boeing's primary spokesman during the
intense two weeks of negotiations.

FOR TRIBE, THERE'S MUCH TO CELEBRATE DURING MAKAH DAYS '99 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash. _ Even small things hint at a change in this
drizzly, sea-faring Native American town.
</P>
<P>
   Makah women knit wool hats with ``5-17-99'' woven into them.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerator magnets read: ``Vegetarian: Indian word for `lousy
hunter.'''
</P>
<P>
   A tribal mom has an image of a canoe, the canoe, tattooed on her
arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt where they shaded it,'' said Misty Sprouffske,
stopping during a stroll through this past weekend's Makah Days '99
celebration to show a tattoo-in-progress of the Hummingbird, the
hand-hewn cedar canoe used by Makah hunters to kill a gray whale
May 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hunt brought back our tradition,'' said Sprouffske,
pointing to her 5-year-old son Dakota. ``He will be one of the next
generation of hunters.''
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the Makah reservation, at least 25 animal-rights
activists gathered on Sunday to protest both hunt and hunters,
carrying signs that said, ``Neah Bay (whale killer) you betray your
own'' and ``Friends don't let friends kill whales.''
</P>
<P>
   Many attended an anti-whaling rally Saturday in Port Angeles,
Wash., organized by Peninsula Citizens for the Protection of
Whales. ``We celebrated the life of a gray whale, unlike these
people, who celebrate the death of a gray whale,'' Sandy Abels said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, who temporarily tied up traffic in and out of
Neah Bay Sunday, vowed to return if the Makah carry through with
plans to mount another hunt this fall. ``If they resume, we'll be
back out here with our boats in full force,'' said Erin O'Connell,
with the Sea Shepherd Society. ``We'll do everything possible to
protect the whale.''
</P>
<P>
   Some boastful tribal youths said they looked forward to another
showdown between whale-eaters and ``whale-savers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whale-savers, they just can't do it themselves, so they
are mad,'' said 13-year-old T.J. Reamer, who hopes to heft his own
harpoon some day. ``They know they can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite weekend demonstrations, the 75th annual Makah Days was a
low-key contrast to last year's event, when law officials worried
the war of words between tribal members and animal activists would
erupt in battle. The town filled with outsiders, journalists camped
out, waiting for a scoop, and National Guardsmen, alerted to
threatening phone calls describing the Makah as ``murderers,'' were
posted at tribal boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the tribal people called ``Kwih-dich-chuh-ahtx'' _
``people who live by the rocks and seagulls'' _ reclaimed the
streets. They moseyed past booths selling baskets and tanned hides,
abalone jewelry and Native American blankets, and they sampled
various fry bread vendors. Whale meat was not for sale _ to the
disappointment of some visitors _ but locals happily described the
steaks and shish kebabs, smoked jerky and stews made with meat from
the 30-foot-long female gray whale killed in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it roasted _ it's like braised beef,'' said Crystal
Hall, the 19-year-old Queen of Makah Days, who was crowned wearing
a red-and-black button robe and beaded headdress at the high school
gymnasium. The crowd provided a drum roll by pounding their feet on
the gymnasium floor and bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the hunt has brought a new unity to the Makah, the
only tribe in the continental United States with whaling rights
written into its treaty. ``After the hunt, life went back to
normal, but you could tell something was different _ very
different,'' she said. ``For one day, we had forgotten all our
little squabbles.''
</P>
<P>
   The hunt was the first in more than 70 years for the tribe,
whose whaling tradition reaches back more than 1,000 years. ``It's
something I never thought I would see in my lifetime,'' said Arnie
Hunter, wearing a Makah Nation T-shirt that said ``Pass the
harpoon!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has brought back something missing to our heritage and
brought people closer together.''
</P>
<P>
   Makah Days '99 included three days of traditional songs and
dances, a spectacular $10,000 fireworks display, bone-game
competitions that continued into the early hours of the morning,
salmon bakes and softball tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-generation Makah babies and teenage beauty queens rode on
car hoods and truck beds in a parade down the narrow main drag,
with reservation dogs crisscrossing in front of them. Moms cupped
their hands over infants' ears as the local ambulance passed,
sirens screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Sinewy paddlers showed their skills at canoe racing. The vaunted
32-foot Hummingbird easily aced the seagoing competition.
</P>
<P>
   A new whaling canoe, the 37{-foot ``People of the Cape,''
remained under wraps in a shed.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting families are running sea trials with the recently
completed ``People of the Cape,'' practicing for a fall hunt of the
gray whales, which head back to Mexico from Alaska to breed each
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Under International Whaling Commission guidelines, the tribe can
take up to five whales a year for a total of 20 through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meat's all gone, so we're going to go get some more,''
said Wayne Johnson, whaling captain on the Hummingbird.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-foot whale killed in May by Johnson and crew was
butchered on the beach, the meat distributed among tribal members.
</P>
<P>
   The whale's skeleton and baleen, now soaking in an ammonia
solution, will eventually be on display at the Makah Cultural and
Research Center. Despite intentions to use all of the animal, the
intestines had to be thrown back into the sea, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Whaling captain Johnson said he'll do things differently on the
next hunt. ``We'll probably take the whale directly to the fillet
plant, instead of butchering it on the beach. We probably lost a
lot of oil when we cut into it.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll also shorten the lines on the harpoon and buoy _ ``The
whale sank on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the community is just now recovering from the press
of media and outraged protesters that descended in the spring. He
knows the disruptive scene could repeat itself with the resumption
of hunting.
</P>
<P>
   But he also understands the change that has settled over this
remote town at the tip of the Olympic Peninsula, linking a past to
a future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started something and accomplished it,'' the hunter said.
``The community has a little more faith in us now.''

<P>
   A roller-coaster car climbing skyward at a New Jersey shore
amusement park lost its traction near the peak of its ascent
Saturday night and, plunging 30 feet backward onto a sharp curve,
hurled a woman and her 8-year-old daughter out to their deaths as
dozens of horrified witnesses looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, as investigators focused on a bizarre double mechanical
failure on the Wild Wonder roller coaster in Ocean City, N.J.,
witnesses gave chilling accounts of the deaths of Kimberly Bailey,
39, and her daughter, Jessica, of Pomona, N.Y., in the state's
first amusement-ride fatalities in a decade, who were among four
amusement-ride fatalities nationwide last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the car going up,'' recalled Tammy Matczak, 38, of
Tylersport, Pa., whose two children were waiting to board the ride.
``Then something let loose, and the car came slamming back
downward, slamming down. I saw two bodies fly, incredibly. It was a
woman and a child. The woman slammed into a beam. The child just
flew. I knew right away they had to be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   After a day of intense preliminary investigation, William
Connolly, director of the state's Division of Codes and Standards,
which regulates and inspects amusement rides, said the fatal plunge
occurred about 10 p.m. as the car bearing the mother and daughter
was being drawn up by a chain to the highest point of the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the 41-foot pinnacle, Connolly said, the drag chain is
supposed to let go automatically, allowing gravity to take over as
the freewheeling car picks up speed and hurtles down on a looping,
whipping, zigzag course that takes 60 seconds and has been
described by riders as exciting to terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons that were unexplained Sunday, Connolly said at a
late afternoon news conference, the drag chain ``released
prematurely'' and the car plummeted backward. At the same time, he
said, an anti-rollback device similar to an emergency brake,
intended to prevent a car from falling backward, also failed for
reasons not yet determined.
</P>
<P>
   After the two failures, Connolly said, there was nothing the
ride's operator could do as the car rushed back toward a 90-degree
curve at the base of the ride's initial ascent. It is a curve that
the cars pass slowly going up, and was never intended to be
negotiated by a car going backward at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   While the car remained on the tracks _ gripped by wheels
designed to hold them from above, below and on the sides _ the
powerful centrifugal force of the car rounding the curve hurled the
mother and daughter out, Connolly said. He noted that a safety bar
across the riders' laps failed to hold them in, apparently because
it was designed to prevent forward, not backward, movement.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, the car, decorated to look like a puppy or a
teddy bear, had no door to prevent an ejection, just an open side,
apparently to facilitate the loading and unloading of riders. The
victims, who apparently struck the roller coaster's walls and
column supports, fell about 10 feet down from the elevated curve,
and about 7 feet from the base of the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics and the Ocean City police rushed to the scene, but
the victims were pronounced dead at Shore Memorial Hospital in
nearby Somers Point. Autopsies were to be performed there Monday,
but officials said Ms. Bailey and her daughter had apparently died
of extensive blunt-trauma injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the empty roller-coaster car, after swinging
around the curve, struck another car at the loading platform, and
two people in it were slightly injured. Irit Taub, 25, of
Clementon, N.J., suffered cuts and a neck strain, and Michael
Barteld, 7, of Pine Hill, N.J., suffered a bump on the head. Both
were treated at Shore Memorial Hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   Expressions of sorrow for the victims and a willingness to
cooperate with investigators were voiced Sunday by Jay Gillian,
whose family has owned Gillian's Wonderland Pier, the site of the
roller coaster, since 1930 on the boardwalk at Ocean City, a resort
10 miles south of Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is every park owner's nightmare,'' he said. ``We are
deeply saddened by this tragedy and our hearts go out to the
family. Our family has been in this business for 70 years and
safety has always been our first concern. This is the first major
accident in the park's history.''
</P>
<P>
   The park, a collection of rides and arcades just off the north
end of the 2.3-mile boardwalk in Ocean City, was ordered closed by
Gillian after the accident out of respect for the victims and their
families. He said the park would remain closed ``until we have some
answers.'' The roller coaster, and one like it in Wildwood, N.J.,
were closed on orders from state inspectors.

   ``We are truly at a crossroads. With ratification, we can go
forward together to build a more secure future,'' Condit wrote in
an open letter sent to employees represented by the Machinists
union.
</P>
<P>
   While Boeing must wait until Wednesday for its employees to
vote, investors will render their verdict on Monday _ in the
trading of Boeing stock _ on whether they think the contract will
hurt or help the company's performance. Wall Street's opinion is
important because the company is trying to recover from two years
of production problems and bolster its image in the eyes of
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Whitlow, who tracks Boeing for Safeco Asset Management,
said Monday's reaction was likely to be modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they didn't strike is a plus,'' Whitlow said.
</P>
<P>
   If union members endorse the contract, Boeing will be able to
claim it negotiated 36 consecutive contracts, without a strike
during the last two years, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   So far, many union members have a positive view of the company's
strategy and offer, according to Steve Vergala Sr., a union
steward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the general consensus is, `Yeah I like this,'''
Vergala said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, some employees are upset and ratification is far from
guaranteed. For example, older Boeing workers are disappointed the
contract only offers a 25 percent increase in monthly pension
benefits, according to other union members. The company can also
abuse proposed language that is designed to protect union jobs,
according to David Clay, who works at Boeing's Everett plant.
</P>
<P>
   Under the contract, Boeing pledged there would be no layoffs due
to subcontracting or offloading, although other layoffs are
possible. In addition, a joint committee will review subcontracting
or offloading 180 days before any action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no teeth'' in job security provisions, Clay, who
opposes the contract, said.
</P>
<P>
   The Machinists will have the final say on Wednesday when they
cast their ballots at union halls spread throughout Washington,
Portland, Ore., and Wichita, Kan. The contract covers 44,000 Boeing
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot will have two parts. A Machinist must check one box
to ratify the proposal or another to reject it. Then a workers must
vote to either reaffirm or reject the union's authority to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a majority of those voting reject the offer, the
contract is accepted unless two-thirds vote to strike. The current
contract expires at 12:01 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While Boeing officials are hopeful their ``best and final
offer'' will be accepted, they realize they won't know until late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now in the hands of each individual employee,'' said
Peter Conte, who has been Boeing's primary spokesman during the
intense two weeks of negotiations.

 UNDATED: state inspectors.

<P>
   Gillian said the new Wild Wonder roller coaster, with four cars
that each hold four passengers on rides featuring sharp curves, was
manufactured by an Italian company, Zamperla, which has an American
sales and service office in Parsippany, N.J. He said the
manufacturer would send engineers to participate in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was opened on July 1 at ceremonies attended by Gov.
Christie Whitman, who pressed a button to start the ride but balked
at trying it herself, acknowledging that she was afraid of roller
coasters. Before being put into operation, the ride was inspected
by state officials on July 1, and it was inspected again on July
21, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said no problems were found on either inspection, and
in particular no problems were found with the drag-chain or
anti-rollback mechanisms. Other officials said the state would
study the possible hazards thoroughly in an inquiry that might take
weeks. Among other things, they said, the investigators would look
for possible design flaws, such as a restraining bar that would not
prevent rearward ejections or lower sides to the cars.
</P>
<P>
   The state of New Jersey cracked down on amusement park rider
operators in 1997 after a series of accidents. Among other things,
inspections and other regulatory functions were transferred from
the State Labor Department to the Division of Codes and Standards,
part of the Department of Community Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The state also increased inspections from one to as many as four
a year for each ride, increased penalties for safety violations
from $500 to $5,000, and made it a crime for riders who to ignore
rules on rides.
</P>
<P>
   The tighter safety regulations have reduced serious accidents on
the 1,600 amusement park rides in New Jersey by 20 percent this
year, according to E.J. Miranda, a spokesman for the codes and
standards division. He said there had been 443 reported incidents
and 12 serious injuries on rides through Aug. 26, down from 548
incidents and 16 serious injuries in the same period last year.
Moreover, he said, the deaths in Ocean City were the first on an
operating amusement ride in the state in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The state's experience has run counter to a national trend,
however, he said. In the nation, accidents and serious injuries
have increased by about 20 percent in the past year. And there has
been a surge of fatal accidents in the nation this summer,
including four deaths on rides last week alone _ one each in
California and Virginia, in addition to the two in New Jersey on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As state inspectors examined the tracks, cars and structure of
the roller coaster Sunday, the Ferris wheel and other rides at
Gillian's Wonderland were silent, the end-of-summer rhythms of
Ocean City's boardwalk went on.
</P>
<P>
   The wide beach of silky off-white sand was crowded with bronzed
sunbathers and swimmers; surfers were catching the big waves;
arcades rang with artificial gunshots, and awning-draped stands
sold hot dogs, fried clams and oysters.
</P>
<P>
   It was a teen-age crowd, mainly, too preoccupied to sense the
tragedy in the wings. But for those who had witnessed the accident
_ like Ms. Matczak, a day-care worker, her husband, Mark, a
machinist, and their children, Andrew, 12, and Breanna, 8 _ this
August would be unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd just come for the weekend,'' Ms. Matczak said. ``I've
been coming to this park since I was a child. I and my children
rode it the night before. It wasn't like a typical roller coaster.
It had quick turns. It made you feel like you were going to go off
the top.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting on line with the kids,'' Mr. Matczak recalled.
``My daughter had loved it so much the night before. She wanted me
to come with her. I was like, oh, all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was making a ratcheting noise coming down,
quickening,'' he said. ``It just came down and, wham! It was
sickening. Just wham! Those people just flew. They just launched
out of the car.''

DEATH OF PITCHER MARS WINNING YEAR FOR ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Every Sunday, Lorrie Robinson buckles her
2-year-old son, Chase, into his car seat and drives to what he
calls ``the park.'' She follows the narrow road past the tall, old
trees with moss draping from the branches to the newest section of
the Oaklawn Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   On clear summer days, she can't help but think this is the
perfect final resting spot for her husband, Kenny: On a mound in
the bright sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   While the Diamondbacks pursue a pennant in just their second
year of existence, it's easy to forget that this season began with
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   A one-car rollover on a dark Tucson road. One Diamondbacks
pitcher, Kenny Robinson, dead. Another, John Rosengren, charged
with manslaughter after tests showed he had a blood-alcohol level
of 0.162, above Arizona's legal limit of 0.10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took two people's lives,'' Liz Robinson, Kenny's mother,
said of the Feb. 28 accident. ``It took John's life, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosengren was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder and
released on $75,000 bail. A grand jury later indicted him on the
manslaughter charge. If convicted, he faces a prison term of seven
to 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rosengren, whose trial is set for Sept. 28, has been out of
baseball since the accident and is living with his parents near
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Robinson family had dreamed this would be a breakthrough
year for Kenny. His injured shoulder was returning to health and
the Diamondbacks were in need of relief help.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed to care that Kenny wasn't the prototype major
league pitcher. On rosters, he was listed at 5-foot-9, but he was
really three inches shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my heart is 5-9,'' he liked to say.
</P>
<P>
   Lorrie and Kenny hoped that at 29, Kenny's career would be
reborn in Arizona. Dreaming he would spend the year with the
Diamondbacks, calling her twice a day, just as he did every day
they had been apart in their 8-year marriage. Telling her of the
excitement of a pennant race, asking about Chase, laughing together
at their $500 monthly phone bills. Still building their days around
those calls.
</P>
<P>
   Lorrie Robinson still can't bring herself to erase Kenny's voice
from the answering machine at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest thing I can't do yet,'' Lorrie said. ``I just
finally opened his suitcases from when they shipped them home.
That's been five months.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny's parents, Liz and Ken Sr., hoped to travel to their son's
games or watch them on satellite. Instead of driving to games now,
they take weekend trips to try to fill lonely hours. &QL; 
Player distraught &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosengren declined to comment, but he is distraught over the
accident, said his lawyer, Mike Piccarreta of Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``John felt it was inappropriate to discuss what he's going
through at this time, and that all thoughts and concerns should be
for the Robinson family,'' Piccarreta said.
</P>
<P>
   North Silverbell Road in Tucson is narrow and filled with gentle
curves and dips as it crosses desert washes. Running roughly
parallel to Interstate 10, which dissects the city, the road is
poorly lit in the 3000 block, where the accident occurred. It's not
a challenging drive, but it does require a clear, attentive mind.
</P>
<P>
   There are few details available about the events of that night.
The families aren't sure where the two men went, and authorities
won't say.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that in the early evening of Feb. 27, Kenny
called Lorrie as usual. He said Rosengren was coming over that
night to watch the North Carolina-Duke basketball game and that
they would probably make an early night of it.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports, the players were southbound on
Silverbell, a two-lane road at that point, about 1:40 a.m. They
were less than a mile from Robinson's apartment when Rosengren's
'97 Explorer drifted off the east side of the road onto a dirt
shoulder. It was estimated to be traveling at 55 mph, 10 mph over
the speed limit. The Explorer then came back on to the road and
turned over on the driver's side.
</P>
<P>
   Neither player was wearing a seat belt, and paramedics had to
use an ax to break out the front windshield, so they could pull the
two men from the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Robinson suffered a severe head injury and was pronounced
dead at the scene. He had a blood-alcohol level of 0.258, according
to the medical examiner's report. That figure surprised Robinson's
family and friends, who said he preferred staying home and playing
video games to drinking and night life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that was very out of character,'' Lorrie
Robinson said. ``We didn't even go out or anything like that when
he was home.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosengren, who wasn't seriously hurt, smelled of alcohol and his
speech was slurred, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Expletive), I was the one driving and it's all my fault,'' he
told police that night, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and Rosengren weren't the best of friends, having known
each only a month or so, but they were bound by similar
circumstances. &QL; 
Coming off injuries &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both were coming off arm injuries and hoped to make the
big-league roster. Both reported early to the Diamondbacks spring
training camp in Tucson to continue rehabilitation work.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are forever tied by the events of one horrible night.
</P>
<P>
   When two Jacksonville police officers rang her doorbell that
Sunday morning, Lorrie Robinson's first thought was that something
had happened to her parents, who live just a few minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is your husband Kenny Robinson?'' they asked.
</P>
<P>
   Her breath stolen away, Lorrie had one thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please tell me he's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   They told Lorrie that Kenny had been killed in a car accident.
They had no details. She called her parents, who were there when
Lorrie called Kenny's mom and dad, who live near Akron, Ohio, where
Kenny grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, the families still wonder about the events of
that night. Kenny was fanatical about wearing his seat belt, yet he
didn't have his on. He felt strongly about drinking and driving,
yet he was riding with an apparently impaired driver.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the Robinsons think they would like to talk to
Rosengren, to find out more about that night. Rosengren is
prevented by Arizona law from contacting the family until his case
has been adjudicated.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Lorrie Robinson thinks, the family would only be
getting one side of the story. She wonders if the entire truth will
ever be known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know him (Rosengren),'' Lorrie said. ``I just know how
I feel about drinking and driving. You could be the nicest person
in the world and still get behind the wheel of a car and something
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying Kenny was not at fault. Obviously, he got into
the truck. They could have called a cab. I just don't know. I'm
affected. He (Rosengren) is affected. We're both going through a
whole whirlwind of emotions. I can't say they are exactly the same,
but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   She would like people to know that Kenny was more than just a
journeyman pitcher and is hopeful that he will be remembered more
for how he lived than how he died.
</P>
<P>
   He was the kind of guy who called his parents five times while
driving across the country for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``What other 29-year-old man would do that?'' Liz asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ken once organized a baby shower for a minor-league teammate's
wife and thought nothing of covering a round of golf for a young
minor-league player strapped for cash. He could make people laugh
by imitating the checkout scanner at a grocery store, driving
clerks nuts in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Robinson affectionately calls her son ``a momma's boy.''
Kenny called his parents several times a week and always after he
pitched, no matter the time. The family's social life revolved
around sports and the games played by Kenny and his younger sister,
Christi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you this much, we lived Kenny's life with him, so
when he dies, that kind of dies too,'' Liz said.
</P>
<P>
   A big man &QL; 
Robinson was a rarity in baseball _ a short right-handed pitcher
who made it to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, it was always the taller kids who were tried first
at pitcher, even though Robinson was begging for the chance.
Eventually, coaches would let the little guy throw and then realize
their mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said, `I don't understand why all they want is
height, height, height,' '' Lorrie said. ``If somebody has the
talent, why does height have to factor into it?''
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson was in the minors, opposing fans could be brutal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could just hear people jawing at him from the stands.
`Don't you need your step-stool?' Or ``Hey, Tattoo, where's the
plane?' That was a cute one.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Robinson began to pitch and the ribbing stopped. He had a
fastball that reached the mid-90s, and he spent parts of three
seasons in the majors, two with Toronto and one with Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks claimed him off waivers from Toronto in 1998
and had him targeted as a middle reliever or closer until he was
sidelined by a shoulder injury suffered in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he worked hard all year to come back from his injury,''
said Joe Garagiola Jr., the Diamondbacks' general manager. ``And I
guess that's the principal thing I take away from our association
and time with Ken _ his competitiveness, his determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was hard-nosed on the mound, Robinson was soft-hearted
off of it. He would send his son flowers, balloons and chocolates
on Valentine's Day. He wrote poetry and short stories.
</P>
<P>
   Before important times in his life, he would write letters to
those close to him, telling them how much they meant to him.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, some close friends cleaned out Kenny's
apartment in Tucson to send things back to Lorrie. On a closet
shelf, Diana found a letter that Kenny had written to Lorrie and
Chase before he underwent shoulder surgery in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted them to know how he felt should something go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you see Chase smile, please see me smiling, too,
because I'll be there watching over you.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about me, I want you to think one thing _ that
I was a good person who worked my ass off and never gave in or
quit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year of Kenny's life, he was able to do so many
things he never had before, Lorrie said. The surgery kept him out
of baseball in 1998, and he spent the summer at home for the first
time in years. He took pride in his yard, and Lorrie would tease
him when neighbors would ask for tips.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny attended his 10-year high school reunion, bought a
Corvette, saw an old friend for the first time in years, shook
hands with President Clinton during his visit to spring training.
</P>
<P>
   A Major League Baseball pension and a life insurance policy are
allowing Chase and Lorrie to live comfortably in the home the
couple bought in Jacksonville just over two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She has a business degree from Florida State and plans to
returns to work once Chase is a little older.

DODGERS MAKING SURE PEREZ READY TO RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Carlos Perez will not be called up immediately
when rosters are expanded Wednesday. Instead the Los Angeles
Dodgers' troubled left-hander will make one more minor-league start
Friday before the team returns him to the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Claude Osteen said Perez, who allowed six hits
and four earned runs in six innings in a victory over Omaha, will
pitch in September to see if he has improved his speed and
location.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as concerned with the numbers because he is throwing
mostly fastballs trying to get his velocity up,'' Osteen said.
``He's around 90 right now, which is a big jump from earlier this
season, when he was around 83.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure he is consistent there. That is why we're
giving him another start.''
</P>
<P>
   Arm's just fine: Struggling left-handed reliever Pedro Borbon
faced one batter Sunday and allowed a sacrifice fly to Mark Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon entered the game after allowing seven runs in his last
three appearances, but said his elbow _ which was surgically
repaired two years ago _ is sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically I'm fine,'' he said. ``But mentally I'm pretty
tired and I've made some mistakes out there. I've been in 61 games
this year and I've never done that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Borbon was 2-1 with a 1.64 ERA at the All-Star break. But since
then he has allowed 14 runs in 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to spot him with just a batter or two the rest of
the way,'' said manager Davey Johnson. ``His fastball still looks
very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Eric Gregg, worked home plate Sunday night in what
could be his last game as a major-league umpire. Gregg, one of 22
umpires whose resignations were accepted by Major League Baseball,
could have worked through Wednesday's game but he is taking a
vacation for the rest of the week. The umpires are appealing....
Eric Young's hitting streak ended at 10 games when he went hitless
in four at-bats.... Catcher Todd Hundley threw out Sammy Sosa at
second base in the fourth inning, the first runner he has gotten
since Aug. 16. Hundley has thrown out 15 of 104 runners trying to
steal (14 percent).... Gary Sheffield, who had 17 RBI in his
previous eight games, was 0 for 3, ending a streak of six
consecutive games with an RBI.... Starting pitchers Darren Dreifort
and Kyle Farnsworth both were born in Wichita, Kan., but Farnsworth
grew up in Georgia.

BOEING HOPING HAPPY WORKERS NOW WILL MEAN BETTER PRODUCTIVITY
LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. and its top union are optimistic they
have forged a three-year contract that will win ratification from
the Machinists on Wednesday _ and boost worker productivity and the
company's performance for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and the International Association of Machinists base
their optimism on the fact that Boeing addressed many union demands
in the contract, which was unveiled on Saturday, including a
generous wage increase and improved pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The union's hopes are also built on what the company didn't
offer, such as alterations to the workweek or new health care
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives seem to be betting they can improve operations
by cooperating with Machinists rather than trying to squeeze
concessions from them during a labor dispute, say some financial
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major turn in the company's strategy _ making a bet
that a happier work force will hopefully lead to better
productivity,'' said Peter Jacobs, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie
Group Inc., a Seattle-based investment firm. ``That's where the
real risk is in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's desire to avoid a fight with its largest union _
especially in a year when it's scheduled to deliver a record 620
airplanes _ became evident when Chief Executive Officer Phil Condit
entered the talks on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are truly at a crossroads. With ratification, we can go
forward together to build a more secure future,'' Condit wrote in
an open letter sent to employees represented by the Machinists
union.
</P>
<P>
   While Boeing must wait until Wednesday for its employees to
vote, investors will render their verdict on Monday _ in the
trading of Boeing stock _ on whether they think the contract will
hurt or help the company's performance. Wall Street's opinion is
important because the company is trying to recover from two years
of production problems and bolster its image in the eyes of
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Whitlow, who tracks Boeing for Safeco Asset Management,
said Monday's reaction was likely to be modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they didn't strike is a plus,'' Whitlow said.
</P>
<P>
   If union members endorse the contract, Boeing will be able to
claim it negotiated 36 consecutive contracts, without a strike
during the last two years, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   So far, many union members have a positive view of the company's
strategy and offer, according to Steve Vergala Sr., a union
steward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the general consensus is, `Yeah I like this,'''
Vergala said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, some employees are upset and ratification is far from
guaranteed. For example, older Boeing workers are disappointed the
contract only offers a 25 percent increase in monthly pension
benefits, according to other union members. The company can also
abuse proposed language that is designed to protect union jobs,
according to David Clay, who works at Boeing's Everett plant.
</P>
<P>
   Under the contract, Boeing pledged there would be no layoffs due
to subcontracting or offloading, although other layoffs are
possible. In addition, a joint committee will review subcontracting
or offloading 180 days before any action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no teeth'' in job security provisions, Clay, who
opposes the contract, said.
</P>
<P>
   The Machinists will have the final say on Wednesday when they
cast their ballots at union halls spread throughout Washington,
Portland, Ore., and Wichita, Kan. The contract covers 44,000 Boeing
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot will have two parts. A Machinist must check one box
to ratify the proposal or another to reject it. Then a workers must
vote to either reaffirm or reject the union's authority to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a majority of those voting reject the offer, the
contract is accepted unless two-thirds vote to strike. The current
contract expires at 12:01 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While Boeing officials are hopeful their ``best and final
offer'' will be accepted, they realize they won't know until late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now in the hands of each individual employee,'' said
Peter Conte, who has been Boeing's primary spokesman during the
intense two weeks of negotiations.

JETS EXHALE AS MARTIN BREAKS INTO THE OPEN
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It counted in Curtis Martin's mind, and that's what matters.
</P>
<P>
   He had played more than 80 games _ preseason, regular season,
and post-season _ in his National Football League career, but until
Saturday night against the Giants he had never run 80 yards for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   So in the afterglow of the Jets' 16-10 victory, Martin
understood the importance of what he had done, especially since all
last week everyone had expected him to make something happen, to
break out of a preseason slump in which he was averaging 2.5 yards
a carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of it, for me it's saying, `Everything's
OK,''' Martin said. ``It gives you hope. A running back needs to
know what he's capable of doing. This game I feel more like
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells, who had chided Martin last week for not
breaking a big run, agreed Sunday. ``It's called demonstrated
ability,'' said Parcells, who believes moments like that imprint
themselves on a player and make him believe he can do it again.
``This kid runs well and improved his pass-receiving skills
tremendously since his rookie year. He's just a good back _ not the
greatest back I've ever seen, but he's a high-quality back. He's
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is even more so now with help from the rookie right guard
Randy Thomas, who threw two blocks for him during the 80-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, everything seems OK with the Jets' offense, which has been
impressive on almost every drive this preseason. Parcells, whose
team improved to 2-1 in the preseason, admitted he is concerned,
however, because the Jets do not have a classic fullback to be a
lead blocker for Martin.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants' defense had held opposing runners to less than
three yards a carry in the team's first two preseason games, and
none had scored a touchdown. But Martin barreled across the goal
line twice _ his other touchdown capped the opening drive, which
was directed by Ray Lucas. Martin averaged 18.1 yards a run
Saturday night with 127 yards on seven attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is the leading ballcarrier in the NFL this preseason,
while Vinny Testaverde is the top-ranked quarterback in the
American Conference. He trails only the Giants' Kent Graham for
leaguewide honors.
</P>
<P>
   Martin leads in rushing yardage with 170 yards on 24 carries for
a 7.1-yard average. That is more than double his regular-season
average in 1998. He also leads the league with 207 yards from
scrimmage this preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde's 9-for-15 passing against the Giants was worse,
percentagewise, than his first two games. He has completed 73.8
percent of his passes (31 for 42) with two touchdowns and one
interception. He has not been sacked.
</P>
<P>
   This is how good the Jets' first-string offense has been in the
preseason: On 14 drives, it has scored four touchdowns and three
field goals. That offense, in the equivalent of less than a game
and a half, has scored 36 points. The Jets' first-team defense has
yielded only 23.
</P>
<P>
   After the Jets' first team scored a field goal and a touchdown
in two drives against the Packers in the first preseason game, an
Eagles advance scout said he thought the Jets were sensational.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Glanville, the former head coach and now a television
analyst, still was impressed the next day. As he waited in the
Green Bay, Wis., airport with his CBS counterpart Phil Simms,
Glanville said of those two series: ``The Jets are ready to play
now. I'd rest them now for the regular season.'' And Simms spent
much of the plane ride back to New York talking about ``all the
weapons Vinny has.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells would never speak so glowingly of his own team.
Instead, the coach said Sunday, what he liked about the offense was
the fact that it committed only six mental errors in 50 plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious our concentration was better,'' he said.
Sometimes, telling an entire team that he can find better players
in a bus station _ as Parcells did last week after a close victory
over Philadelphia _ will do that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Parcells was unhappy about Dedric Ward's drop of a
fourth-quarter pass from Testaverde that probably would have
resulted in a touchdown. ``We could have put the game away,'' he
said. And there was a missed extra point and a missed field goal by
John Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missed extra points are unacceptable,'' Parcells said. ``You
should go a whole season without one.''
</P>
<P>
   He has come closer to making a decision on Lucas, who did
everything asked of him in his only drive. He completed all four of
his passes for a total of 26 yards. None traveled more than six
yards in the air, but he successfully executed a comfortable game
plan. Now he sits and waits for Parcells to officially tell him he
has made the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' Lucas said, ``I might have a good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lucas was reveling in a post-game news conference, Parcells
poked his head in and shouted to the former Rutgers quarterback,
``Just like playing against Temple.''

LEYRITZ TRIES NEW ROLE AS THIRD-STRING THIRD BASEMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scott Brosius left the Yankees Sunday to be with his
father, Maury Brosius, who has been gravely ill at his Oregon home.
Scott Brosius may rejoin the team later in the week, depending on
his father's condition.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius is the everyday third baseman, and usually the
utilityman Luis Sojo would play in his place. Sojo, however, is
covered with a rash that has left him feeling ill. Last week in
Texas, Sojo attempted to treat a skin problem with some lotion and
apparently had a reaction to the lotion, with rashes breaking out
over much of his body.
</P>
<P>
   So Jim Leyritz, who has played catcher and first base most of
his career, started at third base Sunday. It just so happened that
the left-hander Andy Pettitte _ who generates an inordinate amount
of ground balls with his sinking fastball and cut fastball _
started for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But Leyritz, who played third in one game for San Diego last
year, did not have a ground ball chance for the first four innings
yesterday, and he noticed that Pettitte was pitching almost
exclusively outside to right-handed hitters _ which would be one
way to diminish the chances of the ball being hit to the left side.
``You're working away a lot,'' Leyritz said to Pettitte. ``That
have to do with me?''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte replied, with a smile, ``That just happens to be the
game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning, Leyritz fielded a grounder and threw the
ball away for an error, but in the eighth, he made one easy play
and later dived to his left to spear another grounder, before
throwing for the out at second base. ``He did fine,'' said Joe
Torre, the Yankees' manager.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said Sojo could have played yesterday if he had been
desperately needed, and he is hoping Sojo will be able to play
tonight, when the Yankees start a four-game series against the
Oakland Athletics. The Yankees will be able to expand their roster
on Wednesday, and it is very likely that Clay Bellinger, who can
play any position, will be recalled from Triple-A Columbus, along
with the outfielder Darryl Strawberry and a pitcher, in the first
wave of promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Maury Brosius has been battling colon cancer, and in recent
months, doctors have concentrated on diminishing his pain. He and
his son have talked nightly, after games, and early last week Scott
Brosius said that his father's voice had strengthened, that he
sounded good.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, Brosius received word that he was needed at
home. ``We're all thinking of Scott and his father,'' Pettitte
said. &QL;

A TAXI CRASH CLAIMS A LIFE AND ENDS A LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (lb) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary McGrath was barely out of high school when she
left her home in the Midwest and embarked on a love affair with New
York that lasted nearly 30 years, and ended Friday when she was
killed in a taxi crash on 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her favorite date was Little Italy on the weekend,'' said Jim
Bitros, who met her in a Manhattan singles bar and married her in
1976 in Tarrytown. ``Or we'd go to a cafe around here and bring the
dogs and sit there people-watching.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was just as content to stay home at night, ordering
dinner in and renting old Bette Davis or Barbara Stanwyck movies,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like being with an old buddy when you're 15 years old,
but you're married to her,'' he said of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Ms. McGrath _ who changed her name to Mara Bitros
after her marriage _ created a life with her husband that combined
the coziness she remembered from Minneapolis with the eclecticism
and electricity of the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved holidays,'' said Bitros, in their apartment on East
77th Street. ``From now until New Year's was her favorite time of
year.'' The living room where he was sitting was filled with
holiday knickknacks like a Santa carving on the side table and
framed photos of Casey and Murphy, the couple's pet Shih Tzus, on
Santa's lap. She started her Christmas shopping last month and had
already ordered a holiday wreath from a catalog, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bitros, 46, left Minneapolis after briefly attending a
community college there. James McGrath, her father, who died in
1980, owned a high-end haberdashery, and Rosalia, her mother, died
when Mrs. Bitros was a child. Her first job in New York was at B.
Altman's, the venerable department store, where she and the
childhood friend who came with her from Minneapolis found jobs as
security detectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever suspected her _ this pretty blond girl,'' said
Dennis McGrath, her brother, who works in public relations in
Minneapolis. ``She caught a lot of shoplifters that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, she found work matching home-care nurses with elderly
clients and selling weight-loss programs. She tried executive
headhunting for a while, but it did not suit her, said Bitros.
``Too barracudalike.''
</P>
<P>
   Her latest job was as a counselor for Career Blazers, an
employment agency and job-training company in midtown. There she
worked with people who lacked job skills and who were difficult to
place because of past alcohol and drug-abuse problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would get excited when she was able to get somebody who
was having a hard time finding work a good $20,000-a-year job,''
said Bitros. ``She got involved with her clients. She would say: `I
want you to go home and wear a blue suit at that job interview.'
Once she borrowed one of my blue blazers and gave it to a student
for an interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Mrs. Bitros was supposed to take last Friday off, she
went to work to meet with a company representative who had job
openings for her clients. She hated riding the subway, and was
mugged once on a platform, said Bitros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted her to take cabs to work,'' he said. ``I thought it
was safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bitros was taking a taxi on her way home from work Friday
afternoon when Joseph Cemeus, the driver, lost control of the car.
It jumped the curb and smashed into a building. Her head slammed
against the Plexiglas partition, injuring her severely and causing
cardiac arrest. The police, who are investigating, have not filed
charges against Cemeus, whose leg was broken in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bitros was not wearing a seat belt. Bitros said that his
wife made a habit of buckling her belt, and speculated that she had
not had time to buckle when the crash occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Her funeral is scheduled for 10 a.m. on Wednesday at St. John
the Baptist Church on the Upper East Side. Bitros said he wanted
taxis to change the Plexiglas partitions to a more flexible
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that will help, if I can get something good out of
this,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: BIGOTRY IN THE MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 30:
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department's new guidelines on the ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy may reduce some of the worst abuses against
homosexuals in the military. But they do not cure the fundamental
injustice of a policy that discriminates against homosexuals by
forcing them to hide their sexual orientation and by punishing the
truthful with expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the department issued a report showing that the number
of gay soldiers being forced out of the military had risen sharply
since adoption of the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy in 1994.
That policy was a compromise between the White House, which wanted
to end all discrimination against homosexuals, and opponents in the
Senate and the military who wanted to continue the longstanding ban
on homosexuals in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise, openly gay people are still barred from
the armed services. But they are allowed to serve if they do not
talk openly about their sexual orientation, and commanders are
barred from asking troops if they are gay.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise policy was supposed to increase privacy and end
witch hunts. Yet the data show that the climate remains as hostile
to gay military personnel as ever, if not more so. Last year, 1,145
service members were discharged for homosexuality, compared with
997 in 1997 and 617 in 1994. Worse, harassment seems not to have
diminished. In July a soldier at Fort Campbell, Ky., was beaten to
death with a baseball bat, allegedly because he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines would require that all military personnel
receive anti-harassment training in boot camp and throughout their
careers. Special training would be given to commanders and law
enforcement officers. The guidelines recommend that military
lawyers consult with senior legal officers at headquarters before
initiating investigations into allegations of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   In the very few cases where recoupment of military benefits is
at issue, investigations into a service member's sexual orientation
would require approval from the highest levels of the service. The
guidelines would also require that inspectors general in each
branch of the armed services review whether commanders and
investigators are being trained properly.
</P>
<P>
   More training clearly is needed at all levels. In some cases,
victims who report anti-gay harassment have found themselves being
investigated and subsequently drummed out of the service rather
than the harassers. The new guidelines remind commanding officers
that they are not to take this attack-the-victim approach, a
glaring sign of how poorly some commanders have carried out the
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But better training will not prevent absurd outcomes. The case
of Steve May, a Republican state legislator in Arizona, shows how
irrational the policy is.
</P>
<P>
   May, who is gay, made reference to his own sexual orientation
while debating a bill in the Arizona House dealing with health
insurance benefits for domestic partners. He also happens to be an
officer in the Army Reserve. He is now under investigation and may
be discharged from the military for publicly revealing his
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen has said that the policy on
homosexuals in the military will be carried out fairly and that
harassment will not be tolerated. But the policy, by labeling
homosexuals an unacceptable threat to order and discipline,
reinforces anti-gay hatreds that lead to harassment and violence.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-conceived ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy was supposed
to ensure that gay soldiers would be treated more humanely. The
record after five years shows that the policy is not protecting
qualified individuals from being forced out. Better guidelines will
not improve a policy that at its core tolerates and promotes
bigotry.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 30:
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is supposed to be developing democratic institutions in Kosovo, is
proposing new rules for the news media that could hurt the cause of
democracy and a free press. The OSCE is directing a radio station
and will do the same with television. It will also set up a media
monitoring group and regulations on print and especially broadcast
media.
</P>
<P>
   Respected Albanian-language newspapers and radio stations
survived in Kosovo before the war despite Belgrade's censorship.
Today, independent reporters there can certainly use European
support, including training and financing. But they do not need
more official media, nor another group of outsiders to tell them
what they can and cannot say.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE proposal is in part a response to the danger that hate
groups will take over broadcasting stations. Groups of armed men
have muscled their way into at least one small radio station and
broadcast appeals to Albanians to attack their Serb neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo needs proper regulation of its airwaves to reserve
licenses for legitimate applicants instead of those with the bigger
guns, with some licenses reserved for multiethnic, Serbian and
Roma-language stations.
</P>
<P>
   But this can be done without the large bureaucracy the OSCE
contemplates. Its staff would train local journalists, monitor
newspapers and broadcasts, and have ultimate control over a TV
station and a radio station with local staff. The bureaucracy would
also impose as yet unspecified regulations on what journalists can
say, especially broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   This approach is overkill. The project to train journalists and
support promising local news media is worthwhile. It will be
undercut, however, if high-paying, OSCE-run stations grab the best
reporters. At least two worthy news organizations _ the newspaper
Koha Ditore and Radio 21 _ want to start television stations. The
OSCE should help them and other qualified applicants, by granting
licenses, training staff and providing financial support to new
stations.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors and regulators are also a bad idea. The best way to
combat hate speech is not to ban it, but to ensure that Kosovo's
citizens have access to alternate views.
</P>
<P>
   There is added danger if the regulations are broad enough to bar
other ideas the international community does not like. It is risky
to establish even well-intentioned government-controlled broadcast
stations and to attempt to regulate ideas and expression in a
region where these powers have been so tragically misused.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: BILL CLINTON _ AFTER THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DUDLEY CLENDINEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The closer President Clinton gets to that awkward next stage of
life _ the ex-presidency _ the better former President Jimmy
Carter, white-haired and wrinkled, looks to him.
</P>
<P>
   The two have had a prickly relationship through the decades, but
also much in common. Fellow Southerners, former governors, fellow
Southern Baptists and men of supreme self-confidence, they were
each dark-horse candidates who drove Republican presidents from the
Oval Office, and then had sharply mixed experience in it
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was defeated in 1980 amid the general feeling that he may
have been a moral success, but was a failure as a leader. For Bill
Clinton, the more gifted politician, re-elected but unable to
resist temptation, it is the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will leave the White House with the same nagging needs
that Carter had _ to come to terms with his own record and
character, and to redeem himself in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton stood with Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter this month, to
award each of them the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest
civilian honor, for their work in combating disease and brokering
peace efforts around the world, his admiration for the way the
Carters have spent a generation beyond the White House was clear.
Together, he said, ``they have done more good things for more
people than any other couple on the face of the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words are a long way from the don't-call-us-we'll-call-you
treatment the Carters got when the Clintons moved into the White
House. But impeachment, the shrinking time left to him in the Oval
Office, Hillary Rodham Clinton's own ambition for a New York Senate
seat and Carter's success in creating the Carter Center in Atlanta
as a base from which to do good works have all focused the
president on the sea of time that looms past the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He will only be 54 when he leaves the White House in January
2001, the youngest ex-president since Theodore Roosevelt, and the
first to watch his wife seek office as he departs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cannot, like Roosevelt, lose himself on safari in Africa
for 10 months after walking out the door. He needs to be supportive
to his wife. He needs a position in life. He also has a home to
buy, lawyers' bills to pay from years of being investigated by
Kenneth Starr and a $125-million Clinton library and museum in
Little Rock, Ark., to build.
</P>
<P>
   Some earlier presidents took real jobs. Theodore Roosevelt
worked as a contributing editor for a magazine. William Howard Taft
taught law as a professor at Yale and became chief justice of the
Supreme Court. Woodrow Wilson established a brief law practice in
New York City. Calvin Coolidge became a paid spokesman for an
insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   But ex-presidents have not worked salaried jobs for some time.
Instead, pensioned and provided with office expenses and Secret
Service protection, they solicit money to build presidential
libraries and become personalities and presences, paid to write, to
speak, to advise and appear.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Ulysses Grant, Richard Nixon and Carter, have written
books for income or redemption. Herbert Hoover, who established the
first great modern example of postpresidential good works,
published more than a dozen, and coordinated efforts on war relief,
world famine and the reorganization of the federal government in
his 31 years out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, have
become wealthy _ or wealthier _ from fees for speeches, appearances
and service on corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   It has been speculated that Clinton, who loves Hollywood, might
become a partner in some firm like Dreamworks. But that sounds more
like a bad movie script than a real life choice _ and Clinton's
choices and qualifications are challenging enough.
</P>
<P>
   People find his future fascinating to guess at. Impeached by the
House, acquitted by the Senate, held in contempt of court by a
federal judge and despised by conservative Republicans in Congress,
he seems an intriguing but unlikely candidate for the United
Nations, the World Bank, the Supreme Court or some university
presidency _ positions that his global experience and his
background as a Rhodes scholar and former law professor might
otherwise suggest. Considering his gregarious talents, appointive
jobs seem somehow too constrained.
</P>
<P>
   But he can speak. He can write. His political goals, before
leaving office, are to install Al Gore as president and a
Democratic majority in Congress. The voters will decide. Beyond
that, he said at a dinner for his wife in Nantucket, Mass.,
recently, it is Hillary Clinton's turn to lead for the next 20
years, and his to follow. It will be interesting to see just what
that means.

`SIXTH SENSE' TOPS BOX OFFICE FOURTH WEEKEND IN ROW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Horror continued to dominate late-summer
moviegoing at the nation's multiplexes as the fourth weekend of
``The Sixth Sense'' easily led with an impressive $20.1 million at
2,688 theaters amid a moderate weekend overall at the box office,
studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sense,'' dropping off a mere 16 percent from last weekend,
became the first film since ``Saving Private Ryan'' to win four
consecutive weekends. The Disney release joined ``Titanic'' and
``Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace'' as the only movies to
top $20 million on four straight weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've joined some pretty good company,'' noted studio
distribution chief Chuck Viane, who projects a final gross of
around $225 million for ``The Sixth Sense.'' ``People keep going to
see it and bringing their friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Viane said repeat viewers for the tale of a boy beset by
supernatural forces currently comprise about 15 percent of the
movie's audience, far above rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sense'' has now taken in $138.8 million in 24 days during a
period when moviegoing usually falls off sharply due to the start
of school. It now ranks 84th on the all-time list, displacing
``Good Will Hunting'' and just behind ``Sister Act.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's only other solid performance came from Disney's
opening of ``The 13th Warrior,'' a 10th century action-adventure
based on Michael Crichton's novel ``Eaters of the Dead.'' The
Antonio Banderas vehicle finished second with $10.3 million at
2,306 theaters, giving Disney the first one-two finish at the box
office since Paramount managed to achieve that distinction with
``Titanic'' and ``Grease'' in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service, credited Disney with meeting a tough challenge in finding
an acceptable window for ``13th Warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They got pretty good results in a genre that hasn't been doing
very well,'' he noted. ``This is usually a really bad time to open
movies because kids are focused on going back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdover films took the next five slots, followed by a quartet
of new films that failed to generate much excitement. ``This
weekend's results are indicative of the strength of earlier films
and the weakness of new entries,'' industry tracker Arthur Rockwell
said. ``This is the time of year that studios often get rid of
their dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's fifth weekend of ``Runaway Bride'' continued to show
strong legs with a respectable third-place finish as it took in
$6.9 million at 3,090 sites. Julia Roberts' ``Bride'' has taken in
$124.5 million to go with the $114 million gross of ``Notting
Hill,'' firmly establishing the star as Hollywood's most bankable
actress.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's third weekend of ``Bowfinger'' followed with $6.6
million at 2,732 theaters, topping Warner Bros.' second weekend of
``Mickey Blue Eyes'' with $5.5 million at 2,573 locations, MGM's
fourth weekend of ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' with $4.7 million at
2,095 screens and Artisan's seventh weekend of ``The Blair Witch
Project'' with $4.3 million at 2,332 theaters. ``Blair,'' the most
profitable movie ever with a $35,000 production cost, has grossed
$128.1 million to become the 103rd highest domestic grosser of all
time.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's cop-action-adventure ``In Too Deep'' finished eighth
with a respectable $4.2 million at only 667 theaters to go with
$1.6 million it grossed in its opening days Wednesday and Thursday.
USA Films' ``The Muse,'' a Hollywood comedy with Albert Brooks and
Sharon Stone, came in ninth with a modest $4 million at 1,256
sites, followed by New Line's horror-thriller ``The Astronaut's
Wife'' with $3.6 million at 2,209 theaters and Universal's comedy
``Dudley Do-Right'' with $3 million at 1,802 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' debut of family oriented drama ``A Dog of
Flanders,'' the fifth film version of the 19th century story,
flopped with a minuscule $870,000 at 1,267 theaters. The woeful
numbers underscore the difficulty of selling a movie targeted at
children, Bucksbaum noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids just don't want to see a movie that's supposed to appeal
to them,'' he added. ``They want it to be something that's aimed at
teen-agers and adults.''
</P>
<P>
   The poor performance by ``The Astronaut's Wife'' was well below
Hollywood's consensus, given the generally strong market for horror
films, and probably reflected the surprisingly powerful drawing
power of ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``Sixth Sense'' is likely to lead again during
Labor Day weekend, when it faces a pair of new films _ Warner's
action-adventure ``The Chill Factor'' with Cuba Gooding Jr. and
Miramax's prep school comedy ``Outside Providence.'' Both open
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said the most powerful coming challenge to ``Sixth
Sense'' is likely to come from another horror-thriller, MGM's
``Stigmata,'' opening Sept. 10 with a first weekend that could hit
$17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although this weekend's overall total of $94 million declined 9
percent from last weekend, the figure was 20 percent above the same
weekend last summer as the summer season continues its
record-setting run. Year-to-date business has gone past $4.9
billion and leads the 1998 pace by 8 percent.

WOODS: MONEY PLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
 INVITATIONAL-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ This $5 million NEC Invitational was so lucrative
that Steve Pate, the 14th-place finisher, was handed a check for
$109,000 and Japan's Jumbo Ozaki, finishing last, as he often does
in America, was paid $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   And for Tiger Woods, a million dollars is still a million
dollars, but winning this elite tournament with 23 of the top 24
players in the world in the field meant so much more. Woods loves
to win, but winning is so much more meaningful when it comes
against the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning never gets old,'' said Woods, whose five-shot lead
entering the final round helped him cushion a surge from Phil
Mickelson. ``It feels good. Not only when you can win, but when you
can beat the best players. It gives you even more satisfaction to
beat the best.''
</P>
<P>
   And, at day's end, eight of the 12 golfers on the US Ryder Cup
team left the Firestone Country Club and boarded a plane to Boston
for a practice session Monday at The Country Club in Brookline,
Mass. Davis Love was a surprising late scratch from the passenger
list, skipping the practice round so he could receive treatment in
Georgia Monday for a sore neck ``that left my whole arm tingling
when I swung hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a tired group of European Ryder Cuppers headed home,
clearly needing rest after a frantic August. Another typical
American course, long from tee to green with rough heavy on the
sides, left the Europeans badly outplayed, the American Ryder Cup
team outshooting them by 80 strokes (The 12 US players scored a
cumulative 7 under par; the Europeans finished at 73 over par).
</P>
<P>
   Players on both teams said the lopsided advantage the US had
here means nothing. Strategy and tactics, of course, are radically
different playing stroke play for individual gain vs. the match
play for team glory of the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-shot differential, said the US's Payne Stewart, ``is not
relevant.'' No comparison or prediction should be made, said Woods,
``because this is a stroke play event and, quite honestly, we
really didn't care how we did against the Europeans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryder Cup mania can wait as more glory is poured upon Woods,
whose birdie putt on the 17th hole held off Mickelson, who started
the day seven shots behind Woods but had charged within a stroke of
the leader on the 16th. That 15-footer on the 17th was huge because
Woods's putter had been balky here, a fact virtually unnoticed when
his drives were prodigious and his approach shots nearly impeccable
during that glorious 8-under round on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But on that 17th, Woods had to make a putt. Woods's caddie,
Steve Williams, said to Woods, ``Just keep doing what you've been
doing. Trust your stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for a caddie to say. ``Great advice,'' Woods remembered
thinking, ``but I needed to bury this one.'' And then Woods the
Golf Scientist took over, remembering the constant refrain of the
week on the practice greens ``that my tendency was not to let the
blade release, but to kind of hold onto it. And if you hold onto
it, the toe comes over pretty quick and starts the ball over left
with a little hook spin.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for a scientist to analyze, even a Golf Scientist. Woods
still had to stroke the ball. ``And I said, `I don't care what
happens, but I'm releasing the blade.' I released it in my right
hand and it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   And Woods's perch atop golf's pedestal grew a bit more secure.
Woods Sunday tied Jack Nicklaus as the youngest player to win five
events in a season, tying him to the day (23 years, 8 months, 30
days) when Nicklaus accomplished the feat in the 1961 season.
</P>
<P>
   Even more, the victory was Woods's fifth in his last eight
tournaments as last year's ``hard work'' as Woods time and again
puts it _ when he and Butch Harmon, his guru, broke down his swing
and rebuilt it _ is paying off so clearly.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has won $4,266,585 this year, the first golfer to surpass
$4 million in earnings in one year. Finally, Woods had led or been
tied for the lead after 54 holes 10 times since turning pro three
years ago; he has won the last nine times he has been in this
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you one thing,'' said Woods with a wide smile,
``I'm not against playing with a big lead.'' His Saturday round had
been spectacular, ``but it's always the hardest thing to come out
the next day and shoot a low number again.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woods made the putt he had to make, as the best must do, no
matter how they drive. And Woods won the cool million. And now
Woods's swing is trustworthy, ``the pressure is less now because
I've been through it,'' and the golf world is his.

MOVIE TRAILERS KEY TO BOX OFFICE PROFITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``I see dead people.''
</P>
<P>
   Those four whispered words by Haley Joel Osment, spoken at just
the right time in the trailer for ``The Sixth Sense,'' launched the
movie toward the box office stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   It also underscored the growing importance of trailers, those
collections of images and catch phrases, lasting just one or two
minutes, shown in theaters before the main feature.
</P>
<P>
   True, trailers have been around since the early days of
Hollywood. But they have gained importance in recent years because
they can bring in huge crowds in the first weeks of a movie's
release, when studios now receive most of their box office grosses.
</P>
<P>
   Trailers also are shown, discussed and analyzed on the Internet,
a hotbed for whipping up the buzz about a movie even before it is
released.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trailers have become the No. 1 selling point for a movie,''
said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service. ``The money studios spend on them is worth it. With `The
Sixth Sense,' the trailer was one of the best around because it
summed up a complex story and raised the hair on the back of your
neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ``Sixth Sense'' has been an unexpected late-summer hit
with close to $139 million in domestic box office grosses through
24 days.
</P>
<P>
   It easily led the box office for the fourth straight weekend
thanks to strong word-of-mouth and that creepy trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Viane, the studio's distribution chief, said the film
benefited significantly from the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It played in front of a variety of great early summer hits and
really whetted people's appetites,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trailer for ``The Blair Witch Project'' may have been the
year's most influential because its costs were so low and the
movie's success was so unexpected. The decidedly low-tech trailer
managed to generate sensational response with a straightforward but
provocative approach: simply stating that three filmmakers had
disappeared in 1994 and their footage had been found a year later,
then showing 30 seconds of the trademark wobbly footage and ending
with the Web site address.
</P>
<P>
   Also impressive was New Line's decision to spoof ``Star Wars''
in its ``Austin Powers'' trailers, with Mike Myers' Dr. Evil as
Darth Vader and the voice-over: ``If you see one movie this summer,
see `Star Wars.' But if you see two movies, see `Austin Powers: The
Spy Who Shagged Me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Murray of Craig Murray Productions thought the ``Austin
Powers'' trailer was as important as the ``Blair Witch'' because
``it tapped into the audience's state of mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you're trying to do: break through the clutter of
ads and do it in a way that respects the audience,'' said Murray,
who recently produced the Disney ``Tarzan'' trailer. ``Audiences
are much more sophisticated, so you have less time to capture their
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Making that happen, though, is tricky. A trailer has to tell
enough about the movie to make it memorable, but not so much that
potential customers feel they've already seen the film.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the task now is that the key customers, the
free-spending adolescents and young adults often identified as
``The MTV Generation,'' have become far more image-oriented and
less patient with story development.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been five years ago, we would have done the `Tarzan'
trailer by saying first here's the movie, here are the songs, here
are the characters, and here's how you should feel,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Murray's trailer stressed such key elements as the way
Tarzan moved through the trees, almost as if surfing or
skateboarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movement really gave the movie a signature. The biggest
change is that stories are now told much more through images, so
we're no longer settling for the tried and true. The question we're
asking is, What kind of feeling and tone are we trying to impart?''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood studios are willing to spend up to $500,000 with one
of more than a dozen specialty operations that produce only
trailers. Besides Murray's Burbank-based operation, which has 60
employees, other key players include CBO, Trailer Park, Ant Farm,
Kaleidoscope, Aspect Ratio, Creative Domain and Intralink.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real art to trailers,'' said Drew Devlin, an
executive with Clark Film Buying. ``Sometimes they can be much
better than the movie. The major emphasis now is to come up with
something different.''
</P>
<P>
   And something shorter. The trend this summer has been toward
creating trailers that are far shorter than the maximum of two
minutes and 30 seconds set by the Motion Picture Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a lot more movement toward `get in and get out,'
'' Murray noted. ``They're used to a faster pace. We're looking to
generate an emotional response.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the move to shorter trailers may have stemmed from 20th
Century Fox's rule limiting total trailer time to eight minutes
before screening of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace.''
Studio executives still wanted to showcase a half-dozen projects
before ``Star Wars.'' They just shortened their trailers to
accommodate the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the shorter trailers may have actually helped a lot of
the midsummer and late-summer films,'' Devlin said. ``People's
attention spans seem so short now that you have to grab them in the
first five or six seconds. Trailers can be a tremendous marketing
tool even if they don't reveal everything.''

CONSTANT BATTLE FOR PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ After watching the Tampa Bay Buccaneers manhandle the
Patriots Saturday night in steamy Raymond James Stadium, one had to
wonder one thing about New England's football future.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any?
</P>
<P>
   It seems like only yesterday that Drew Bledsoe was a rookie and
Bill Parcells was stalking the sidelines but it has been seven
years since they arrived and in the NFL seven years is a lifetime.
For several seasons during that stretch, the Patriots could boast
that they had superior talent, the best in the AFC East. That is a
boast they no longer can make.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean the Patriots have degenerated in seven years
into also-rans, but what it does mean is that the rest of the
division has caught up to their talent, some of it now aging and
others of it never having come into full bloom. What is left is a
team that can beat anyone when everything is right. The problem
comes when everything is not right.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the 1996 season, when they unexpectedly went to the
Super Bowl, this collection of talent always has performed
erratically. When expected to win, too often it lost. When it
seemed the sky was falling, it often won. This makes for good
theater, but it does not make for a championship team.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Pete Carroll's two-plus seasons in New England, his
teams have been consistently inconsistent, as they have continued
to be this summer. One game they appear to be unbeatable. The next
they embarrass themselves. Why this occurs is difficult to pinpoint
but it is undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   Look at their record and go by what you see. There's no telling
from one week to the next, one month to the next, or one season to
the next what this team will do. That is a character flaw that will
haunt it again this fall.
</P>
<P>
   With two weeks to go before the season opener, the 1999 edition
of the Patriots seems different from its predecessors in only one
regard. While it remains as prone to inconsistency as its forebears
it no longer is as talented. What that means is simple. It will not
win as many games.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say this is a team without talent. There is rich
talent here in some areas, especially on offense, where it will
score explosively at times. But it is a team with a nearly 25
percent turnover in starters from a year ago and none have a track
record to rely on.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the new recruits play running back, center, linebacker,
and safety. Those positions are the heart of a team. Where will
that leave them? In the same condition as their old coach,
Parcells. With heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is poor Tedy Bruschi. For too long Bruschi heard
the preachings of Parcells when he would tell his players they
needed to know their role to survive in the NFL. Bruschi always
seemed to.
</P>
<P>
   He is a valuable role player, a cat-quick pass rusher who can
come into a game in the right situation and be a force. What he is
not is an every-down outside linebacker who can take on blockers
who are wider than he is tall and taller than he is wide play after
play, especially if the defensive linemen in front of him are not
adept at protecting him from those blockers, as the present group
without departed Ferric Collons has proven to be.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is the position Bruschi was put in when management
decided to dump Todd Collins for financial reasons last winter.
Collins was an always reliable if seldom spectacular anchor on the
edges of their defense and now that anchor, like those of Willie
Clay and Ted Johnson, is gone and the ship has begun to drift.
</P>
<P>
   Off what we've seen this summer, management's decision in just
this one area has made the team weaker in two spots and stronger in
none. If things don't improve, before the season is over Bruschi
will be unfairly criticized for not being what they should have
known he never was. He is not the only example of this, just the
latest.
</P>
<P>
   They ship out Jimmy Hitchcock and he intercepts seven passes for
a team that goes 15-1 while Chris Canty stays. They ship out Sam
Gash and he goes to the Pro Bowl while Tony Carter plays without
being noticed. They import a wall of young offensive linemen via
the draft and not a one shows the slightest sign of ever being
ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   They pass on drafting Sam Madison and Vonnie Holliday for Canty,
Tebucky Jones, and Robert Edwards. Madison is now considered one of
the best young corners in football, Holliday starts in Green Bay
and had eight sacks his rookie season at defensive end, while Canty
has been fired, Edwards probably never will play again after a
freak injury, and Jones remains much more in Carroll's eyes than he
is in the eyes of opposing coaches.
</P>
<P>
   What Tampa's shocking 45-14 dismemberment of the Patriots showed
Saturday night is that our worst fears about this team may be
realized. It is weak in the middle and weak at the top. Weak in the
middle of the offensive line, which Warren Sapp and the rest of the
Buccaneers readily broke down time after time. Weak in the middle
of the defense, which Mike Alstott and Warrick Dunn ran through
time after time. Weak in the running game and weak in the pass
rushing game. Weak, in other words, in too many places.
</P>
<P>
   That the Patriots have talent is obvious to anyone who spends
any time honestly evaluating them. Drew Bledsoe is among the best
passers in the league and Terry Glenn is one of the best wide
receivers in the AFC when healthy. Saturday night both were on
their games and single-handedly destroyed the Bucs' defense on one
scoring drive as Glenn caught three straight passes, the last for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Good as they were though, that touchdown made the score 14-7
Tampa, and soon it was 28-7, and then it didn't matter how good
Bledsoe and Glenn were because football is the one game that is
less about individuals and more about team. Ask the Lions, who for
years had Barry Sanders and Herman Moore and still couldn't win
anything.
</P>
<P>
   What Patriots management has done is sell out the whole for a
few of its parts. It has gone from a strong team to a team with
some strong, very well-paid parts, and that is not the same thing.
Where they are good they are very good but where they are not they
often are barely adequate and their backups are not even adept
enough to challenge those weaker links for a job.
</P>
<P>
   That is why New England's special teams have slipped the past
two years. It is not that Larry Whigham, that unit's leader, has
lost his enthusiasm. It's that the cast around him is not as good.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, six or eight stars do not make for a bright
constellation or for much of a football team. And an obsession with
dismantling what another man built just because you grew to despise
him is unsound at best and fatal at worst, but it has led to what
you saw Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   What remains behind seven years since Parcells came and three
years since he left is a dangerous team capable of slapping around
anybody on any Sunday but one just as capable of losing to anybody
at any time. It is a team that is not as good as it was a year ago
at center, middle linebacker, outside linebacker, safety, defensive
tackle, and probably running back.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the other side of the coin, where is it better?

SAFIN SERVES UP STUNNING WN

 PRO CHAMPIONSHIPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

   BROOKLINE _ Trophy presentations and the crowning of a new
winner normally create a charged atmosphere reserved for the last
day of a long competition. But Sunday afternoon at Longwood Cricket
Club there was a distinct difference.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,300 fans at the US Pro Championships final between Greg
Rusedski and Marat Safin witnessed an unusual occurrence. The
future of men's tennis served and returned his way to the first of
many titles. For all the attention paid Grand Slam events, the
smaller tournaments that comprise the bulk of the ATP Tour schedule
provide important plot points in a player's career.
</P>
<P>
   Safin will remember his triumphant week at Longwood as the rest
of his promising career takes shape. Even when his list of
accomplishments grows, it always will start with the No. 6 seed's
6-4, 7-6 (13-11) upset of top-seeded Rusedski. The 19-year-old
Russian earned 150 rankings points and $46,000 for the victory. And
when the new world rankings are released Monday, he will continue
his climb from No. 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to work hard to win. It's nice, but I'm still thinking
about (Pete) Sampras so it's not so nice,'' said Safin of the
opponent who awaits him in the first round of the US Open.
</P>
<P>
   The teenager, however, served notice to the No. 1 player in the
world with his performance. Safin defeated Rusedski with 16 aces,
solid returns, and occasional appearances at net, besting the
lefthander from London at his own game. Typically, Rusedski lets
his powerful serve set the tone of the match and makes returns
difficult, if not impossible. He managed just six aces against
Safin, who leaped at every opportunity to get his racket on the
speeding shots.
</P>
<P>
   Safin admitted after the match that returning a Rusedski serve
was all guesswork. Safin could not read his opponent's serves well
and simply selected a side to favor for the returns. On many
occasions, he had the right instincts. The Russian's ability to
catch up with Rusedski's serves improved as the match and points
went longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was concentration,'' said Safin. ``It's difficult
to play against Greg because he plays serve and volley. You just
have to return and concentrate all the time on the return. No
matter if I'm doing good or bad, I had to return serve. After
returning the first serve, I had just to put the ball in play, but
all match there was a lot of pressure. I know if I don't win a
point, he will serve an ace the next point. You are always thinking
about his serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither player fell behind in a service game until the middle of
the first set. In fact, the pace of the opening games was so quick
that the ball boys and girls had trouble keeping up. Few points
went beyond a serve and return. Few games lasted longer than five
points.
</P>
<P>
   The first time the top seed faltered on his serve proved costly.
The longest rally of the match gave Safin a 0-15 lead in the
seventh game. At the time, the small opening seemed insignificant.
And Rusedski edged ahead, 30-15, before his backhand volley
deserted him. Safin got the break necessary to win the first set
when Rusedski's third volley in a row didn't clear the net.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Russian capitalized on his lone break point, he
confidently served through his next game, notching two aces. After
Rusedski held serve, Safin struggled to reach deuce and then used a
cross-court forehand to take the early set lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player and that was probably his best match all
week,'' said Rusedski, the ninth-ranked player in the world who has
yet to win a title this year. ``He was just too good (Sunday). If
he consistently serves that well, he's going to be hard for anyone
to beat. I got my racket on a few serves, but not too many.''
</P>
<P>
   The second set went to a decisive tiebreaker, where Safin
squandered four match points and Rusedski let two set points pass.
The 13-11 outcome of the extra session marked the longest
tiebreaker in Longwood tournament history.
</P>
<P>
   The players battled back and forth for 20 minutes, mixing aces
and double faults, overhead winners, and missed volleys. Safin
double faulted on his fourth match point with the score 11-10. But
on the next two points, consecutive long volleys by Rusedski gave
away the match.
</P>
<P>
   Safin is just getting started. He lifted the winner's trophy
over his head as if it was the top prize awarded at Wimbledon or
Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be a really good player in the future,'' said
Rusedski. ``He'll probably be in the top 10.''

WEEKEND POSITIVELY HEAVENLY 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Red Sox should be hearing voices this morning. They
spent their weekend beating up on Angels, so now they have caught
the attention of the baseball gods. The gods are shouting. If the
Sox can't pick up the gist of the words they must be crazy.
</P>
<P>
   All of this began Sunday when the Sox beat the Motown Angels,
7-4, at Fenway Park. About an hour later, the A's lost to the White
Sox and began preparing for a four-game series in Yankee Stadium.
At the same time in Minneapolis, the Royals lost to the Twins and
started heading east to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just me. You hear that? The gods are screaming about
opportunities now.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are practically being dared to solidify their postseason
status this week. Even if they aren't thinking about the Yankees as
much as they should, they still can stiff-arm the A's if they
simply do what everyone else in the American League has done: Beat
up the Royals. If they can't do that, then maybe they don't need to
be in the playoffs this season.
</P>
<P>
   I know Jimy Williams likes to give credit to every team in the
majors, but the Royals are terrible. I think Williams says nicer
things about them than they say about themselves. Kansas City is
the birthplace of bebop legend Charlie Parker. It is also the
Midwestern land where a baseball team frequently gets bebopped
upside the head. Think about this: The Royals were just swept by
the Twins. Their own media relations staff recently noted that the
Royals have lost ``60 of their last 90 contests.'' And that was
before Sunday's loss.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the gods are playing air guitars and yelling like
thrash-metal vocalists.
</P>
<P>
   After their four games with the Royals, the Sox have a 12-game
road trip to Seattle, Oakland, New York, and Cleveland. So now is
the easiest time to pick up a couple of games on somebody, either
the Yankees or A's. If they don't do it now, the Sox will regret it
in September, an easy month for both New York and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Kansas City has struggled, but they've got some pretty
good hitters over there,'' Sox catcher Scott Hatteberg said. ``And
Jeff Suppan is pitching there now; he's having a good year.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sox prospect Suppan starts Monday night. He and Jose
Rosado are the only KC starters in this series with earned run
averages under 6. Earlier this month, Suppan got a complete-game,
5-2 win over his former teammates. But the man opposing Suppan is
Pedro Martinez. So that means the Sox get to start a series with
their rotation set from the top, facing the worst team in the
league. There is also a chance that Ramon Martinez could start
Thursday's game, which will end the series.
</P>
<P>
   The gods are chanting, waving freshly printed playoff tickets,
and arguing over the brand of champagne the Sox should use when
they secure a postseason spot.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Sox never would say anything like that on the
record. They speak safely when discussing the opposition. They need
an irreverent speaker, someone like Tim Belcher, who started Sunday
for the Angels. Belcher gave up seven runs in 5 1/3 innings.
Afterward, he gave an indication that he also hears the gods
talking to the Sox. He subtly ripped his teammates, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take an aggressive approach to hitting,'' he said of the
Sox. ``You don't see that from a lot of clubs. They swing at a lot
of strikes and spoil a lot of good pitches. That's why they're
where they're at and we're where we're at.''
</P>
<P>
   With Sunday's loss, the Angels are now 27 games behind
first-place Texas in the AL West. Predictably, Mo Vaughn was booed
each time he went to the plate. His summer ended with a 3-for-20
performance against his former team. Two of those hits came Sunday.
Vaughn swears that he has no regrets about leaving, but I am
convinced he wants to come back. If the Red Sox were like a
university and allowed players to take six-month sabbaticals, I bet
Vaughn would have leapt at that option. It is clear now that he
needed a break more than he needed to leave. He now finds himself
teamed with the Angels of Oz, surrounded by players with dazzling
potential and questionable hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's game, Dan Duquette chatted with a few reporters
and ``innocently'' asked if anyone had noticed Jose Offerman's
on-base capability. You may remember that the general manager was
mocked for that on-base quote last November, when he said Offerman
could replace Vaughn in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you weren't gloating,'' someone said to Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not gloating,'' he said. ``Just asking.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette talking a little trash? The gods are hysterical,
whooping and high-fiving each other. Duquette was fully aware of
the on-base numbers, which are .384 for Offerman and .345 for
Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Now all the numbers seem to be favoring the Sox. Bryce Florie
was shaky in the ninth, but Derek Lowe bailed him out in four
pitches and got the save. Trot Nixon had three hits. Pat Rapp gave
up a run. And if you listened closely in the sixth, you could hear
the divine whispers beginning then. That's when Donnie Sadler
scored from third on a short sacrifice fly to left field. He ran so
fast that you weren't sure if it was Sadler or his
computer-generated, animated likeness. There was a streak across
home plate, like dirt lightning, after Sadler slid past catcher
Matt Walbeck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many people would have scored there,'' said Williams,
shaking his head in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   You know what people say about speed like that, right? It's
God-given.

perennial bane of the city's least populous borough _ would finally
close. There was one small problem. Until 48 hours before the
announcement, no one in the mayor's office had bothered to tell
anyone in the Sanitation Department. The department suddenly had to
figure out what to do with the 13,000 tons of household garbage
that was heading each day for the dump. Thus began a long-running,

MIAMI MAKES A STATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The message, if indeed the intention was
to send one, was more subtle than some Miami teams of the past had
sent.
</P>
<P>
   The strutting was held to a minimum, and while some of their
on-field antics suggested that the Hurricanes still were linked to
their past, the reaction to one of the school's biggest victories
in recent years Sunday was almost sedate.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we're not back yet,'' said Miami coach Butch Davis
following a convincing 23-12 victory over No. 9 Ohio State in the
Kickoff Classic at Giants Stadium. ``But this was a step forward.
It is something that this team and this program can build on.''
</P>
<P>
   When Miami was winning national championships in 1983, 1985,
1987, and 1991, and was a traveling road show that attracted
national attention, a win in August, even over a team with the
credentials of Ohio State, only would have been a footnote in a
season filled with greater goals.
</P>
<P>
   But a three-year probation that cut the Hurricanes to Division
1-AA strength in terms of scholarships and quality players, has
lowered the bar slightly. The Hurricanes finally have gotten back
to a full scholarship level of 85, although 56 are either freshmen
or sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   Five years into a plan that still has not reached its peak _
``We're still probably a year away from being back completely to
the levels where we really want to be,'' said Davis _ the
Hurricanes look like a team that can and will compete against
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was a case in point. Granted, Ohio State was not the team
that went 11-1 a year ago and was regarded in many quarters as the
best team in the country _ Florida State and Tennessee
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   But the Buckeyes had enough people left to make them a top 10
team in some preseason polls. Aside from inexperience at
quarterback and wide receiver, Ohio State still looked like a team
that could compete for the Big Ten title, if not for the national
crown.
</P>
<P>
   But on a 90-degree afternoon, which made the Hurrianes feel more
like they were in Miami than in the Meadowlands, the Hurricanes
were better. They were quicker. They were more aggressive, playing
with the kind of intensity and enthusiasm that characterized Miami
teams of the past.
</P>
<P>
   They made a statement early in the first quarter, scoring in
just two plays on their first offensive series on a 44-yard run by
James Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of a series of big plays by the Hurricanes on
offense and defense that set the tone for the game, giving the
crowd of 73,037 a glimpse of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made big plays and we didn't,'' said Ohio State coach
John Cooper, a loser in his season opener for the first time in his
12 seasons in Columbus. ``They are a good football team and they
are going to win a lot of games this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way was a child of Miami's future. Sophomore
quarterback Kenny Kelly, making his first collegiate start, ran for
a touchdown, threw a touchdown pass, and completed 17 of 25 passes
for 245 yards.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Kelly threw a pair of interceptions and
fumbled once.
</P>
<P>
   But with a defense that has some of the old Miami speed, as well
as swagger, correcting most of the mistakes, none of Kelly's errors
were fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State responded well at first, taking a 9-7 lead at the end
of the first quarter, largely because of a 69-yard breakaway run by
tailback Michael Wiley, the Buckeyes' latest link to the great
skill-position players they have turned out in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But after the first-quarter flurry, the Buckeyes could do
nothing offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, however, was making just enough plays, whether it was
Jackson, who ran for a game-high 89 yards, or Najeh Davenport, who
picked up 81. Or tight end Daniel Franks, who made a pair of key
third-down receptions. Or wide receiver Santana Moss, who had only
three catches, but those were for 115 yards, including a 67-yard
grab of an underthrown Kelly pass that gave Miami a touchdown in
the final eight seconds of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   That was good enough to give the Hurricanes a 23-9 lead, which
was more than enough to win, especially when they reached the
fourth quarter with a still-solid 23-12 bulge.
</P>
<P>
   For Miami, it was only a small step. Ahead in the next month are
games against Florida State and Penn State, who are No. 1 and No. 2
in most people's minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really good,'' said Kelly. ``We're very good. But for us
to be in the same league as the Miami teams of the late '80s, we
have to finish 13-0. If we finish 13-0 and I'm sitting in the
Louisiana Superdome (national championship game) with our same
guys, and we come out with a win, then I'll tell you we're back.''

 CHAMPIONSHIPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   SEVILLE, Spain _ Going into the World Championships, the
spotlight was on the quest of Marion Jones for a historic four gold
medals. Coming out of them, it's on Maurice Greene, who
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night won his third when he anchored the US men's 4x100
relay to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed I could be one of the best athletes in
the world,'' said Greene, wrapping up his busy week after earlier
winning the 100 and 200. ``I'm just glad I came here and performed
the way I could.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Michael Johnson didn't earn his share of the
stage. In the last event of the meet, which ended Sunday &UR;  &LR; night,
Johnson wowed 51,142 screaming fans with a 43.50 anchor leg in the
4x400 relay to bring another gold to the US while earning his ninth
world championship gold medal, surpassing Carl Lewis for the most
in history. Johnson had tied Lewis earlier this week when he won
gold while breaking the 400-meter world record when he ran 43.29,
the only world mark to fall in the meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a testament to what I've been trying to do my whole
career in being consistent in going to all the world championships
at the top of my game,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In the long relay, Jerome Davis ate up the track running first
leg, giving Antonio Pettigrew a lead over Robert Mackowiak of
Poland. Angelo Taylor opened the gap, and when Johnson got the
stick the race was over.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the 4x100 finally had come off without a hitch for the
Americans, a novelty after dropping the baton in the first round in
both 1995 and 1997. Jon Drummond got out strong in the first leg;
the exchanges were smooth all around to first Tim Montgomery and
then Brian Lewis; and by the time Greene got the stick Great
Britain's Dwain Chambers was only a step in front of him. That lead
soon evaporated as Greene turned on the jets to propel the US to a
win in 37.59 seconds, the fifth-fastest relay in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw Brian come around to me and I felt the baton in my
hand, I said `I got three gold medals,' '' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   Great Britain ended up second in 37.73, with Nigeria getting
bronze in 37.91. Canada was absent, disqualified in the first round
for a late baton pass.
</P>
<P>
   The US women, hurt by the absence of Jones, didn't fare as well,
with the 4x400 picking up silver and the 4x100 falling into fourth
and out of the medals with a bad first exchange and a tired-looking
Gail Devers unable to make up the ground as anchor. Jones had
planned to run one of the relays before succumbing to back spasms
in her 200-meter semifinal and dropping out of the meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish (Jones) could've been here, and it probably would've
been a different story,'' said Cheryl Taplin, who ran the first
leg.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic race of the night, if not the nine-day meet,
was the men's 800 meters, in which Wilson Kipketer of Denmark had
to nip South African Hezekiel Sepeng in a lean at the tape to win
his third world title. Kipketer, who raced little in 1998 after a
bout with malaria, said that despite trailing down the stretch, he
was never worried. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, it probably didn't look like it on television, but I knew
I was going to catch Sepeng,'' said the 26-year-old
Kenyan-turned-Dane. ``The only trouble was that time was running
out and I didn't know if I would make it before the line.'' He did,
clocking 1:43.30 to Sepeng's 1:43.32, the closest championship 800
meters ever.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 1,500, American Regina Jacobs took her second
straight silver medal, this time behind Olympic champion Svetlana
Masterkova of Russia. Elena Buhaianu of Romania took the race out
slowly in 1:03.87 for the first half, while the main group ran 10
meters behind. By 800 meters Jacobs, Masterkova, and Portugal's
Carla Sacramento, the 1997 gold medalist, were 1-2-3, but Jacobs
appeared to get boxed in with about 150 meters to go and Masterkova
kicked the final 100 to victory in 3:59.53 to Jacobs's 4:00.35.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's tremendous, especially for una vieja,'' said
Jacobs, 36, referring to herself as an old woman.
</P>
<P>
   Tenth was Marla Runyan, legally blind and running only her
eighth race ever at the distance. ``I'm just learning to run
back-to-back 1,500s,'' she said, never before having run rounds.
``I had a big PR Friday night and I felt it in my legs tonight.''
But Runyan was far from disappointed, adding: ``I am so honored to
wear a USA uniform and run in this stadium.''

HE'S BEEN THROWING OFF HIS QUESTIONABLE RAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The jury has been out for a long time on righthander
Pat Rapp. Now the evidence is piling up that the worst is over in
his short time with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp has found a groove that if it continues could make him the
second-best starter in manager Jimy Williams's never-a-dull-moment
rotation. When the Red Sox signed Rapp, who was 12-13 last season
in Kansas City, they hoped they had found a No. 2 man behind Pedro
Martinez. But he has struggled on and off the field, until
recently, and his timing couldn't be better.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp improved to 6-5 Sunday at Fenway Park after Boston's 7-4
victory over Anaheim. He's been going six innings or so and hoping
the bullpen can hang on, which it did in a 4-1 victory over
Minnesota last week. Since Aug. 2, Boston has won five of the six
games Rapp has pitched. He won't be winning the Cy Young Award this
season, but he's doing his part now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't take for granted what he's done,'' said pitching coach
Joe Kerrigan. ``For the last month he's pitched very well and has
done a hell of a job of focusing. His control is good. He now has a
good curveball that makes him very effective against lefthanders.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Rapp has had to stay focused is he's been thinking
about his wife's rough pregnancy, although he knows there's nothing
he can do about that but pray.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp was so inconsistent to start the season he was banished to
the bullpen in late June and made 11 relief appearances. But he
returned to the rotation July 28 after posting a 2.66 earned run
average.
</P>
<P>
   And, magically, Rapp has been a different pitcher. A
tinkered-with motion has made his delivery more compact. Instead of
falling behind in the count, he's been getting ahead with his
fastball and throwing his curve and changeup for strikes. On July
28, Rapp went eight innings in an 8-0 victory at Toronto. He hasn't
lost since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot more comfortable out there and I hit my spots,''
said Rapp. ``I've simplified my mechanics and gotten rid of a lot
of wasted moves and turns. It's helped me keep myself in the strike
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The change has been duly noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tip your cap to him,'' said manager Jimy Williams. ``He's
really done an outstanding job. I believe the stint in the bullpen
really helped him. It gave him a chance to work on some things. His
delivery has been simplified. I think that has helped him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least on the diamond. With his wife, Rebecca, at home
in Sulphur, La., Rapp is living two lives: Baseball pitcher, and
nervous father awaiting the birth of his third child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like the last couple of weeks I've blocked it out,''
said Rapp of the situation at home. ``It's actually helped me
concentrate a lot more on the job for as long as it takes and as
long as Jimy wants me out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan has played a big part in the recent success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe told me one day last month, `You're 32 years old and you
might have found the key to your success.' Maybe he's right,'' Rapp
said. ``I'm just trying to throw strikes, hit my spots, and get a
good read on the hitters the first time around so the second time
around I can make an adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in the last month I found some mechanics that have been
working. I throw a lot more strikes. The curveball has gotten
better so that I can use it almost any time I want to. I haven't
had to use my changeup too much. Seems like I'm getting ahead in
the count more this half of the season. Knowing that you can still
make quality pitches for a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little chance that Bret Saberhagen, the veteran who has
been in the No. 2 slot, will return soon. His shoulder problems
continue and he has been scratched from Thursday's start. The Sox
have the option of bringing back Tim Wakefield on that day or
activating Ramon Martinez. Rapp is next scheduled to pitch Friday
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our starters are important,'' said Williams. ``But of
late Rapp has risen to the occasion and really given us a lift.
He's been very consistent in all of his starts the last month. He's
very durable.''

SOSA HITS 54TH TO LEAD CUBS OVER DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Sammy Sosa, it was a night like so many
others. For Kyle Farnsworth it was the game of his young life.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 54 reasons why Sosa isn't sharing the spotlight
much these days, 54 homers that bring the crowd to its feet no
matter where he is playing.
</P>
<P>
   But just as special Sunday was the two-hit, 6-0 shutout
Farnsworth threw at the Los Angeles Dodgers, just the third
major-league victory for the struggling 23-year old right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who was cheered wildly throughout the three-game series,
received a standing ovation from the crowd of 47,411 at Dodger
Stadium after leading off the seventh inning with a homer off
Darren Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   It was a 427-foot, opposite-field drive that landed deep in the
Cubs' bullpen. Dodgers right-fielder Raul Mondesi didn't even look
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What for,'' he said. ``Sammy is just so strong.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Sosa caught Todd Hollandsworth's flyout to end the
game, he unwittingly tossed Farnsworth's momento into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anybody cared, except maybe Dreifort, who pitched well
but unraveled after the home run and the huge response from the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   For Farnsworth, who is scheduled to pitch against the Dodgers on
Saturday at Wrigley Field, it was his first victory in his last 12
major-league starts.
</P>
<P>
   That win also came at Dodger Stadium on May 11. Since then he
also has been sent to the minors and pitched out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But through eight inings, he had allowed just one hit, a bloop
single by Hollandsworth with one out in the furth inning that
should have been caught by left fielder Glenallen Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mark Grudzielanek ended the what-ifs by bouncing
infield single to open the ninth, Farnsworth's performance did have
historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   The last Cubs pitcher to throw a one-hitter in Dodger Stadium
was Bob Hendley in September 1965, the same night Sandy Koufax
pitched a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This felt great,'' said Farnsworth, who came in wth a 6.17
ERA. ``This is a long time coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is making a little history of his own.
</P>
<P>
   He is nine games ahead of his pace from last season when he hit
66. This year he is leading the Cardinals Mark McGwire, who had 70
last year. McGwire has 51, but is stuck in a 2 for 19 slump.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were successful against Sosa in the first two games
in the series. But Sosa who came in 1 for 8, owns Dreifort. The
home run made him 6 for 12 lifetime. He also added two singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two games here they pitched me real well and I was
swinging at too many pitches out of the strike zone,'' Sosa said.
``But I went to the cage early today with my batting coach (Jeff
Pentland) and pretty much figured out what happened.``I came into
the game trying to be patient, which is part of my game. went up
there relaxed and it pretty much worked.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sosa circled the bases, the flashbulbs popped and the crowd
roared. When play resumed Mark Grace lined a double to right and
Hill walked.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Houston came up in a bunt situation and rolled the ball
toward third base. Instead of breaking for the ball, Dreifort raced
toward the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Adrian Beltre picked up the ball and made a wild
throw to first. Grace scored and Hill and Houston moved into
scoring position. Both scored on a base hit by Gary Gaetti.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was upset by the home crowd's reaction to Sosa,
Dreifort looked sternly ahead and said, ``I really don't know what
to say about that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also was booed when he fell behind 2-0 to Sosa before the
home run. &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson said Dreifort, who pitched brilliantly for
six innings, wasn't rattled. Grudzielanek disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed right away that he wasn't the same,'' Grudzielanek
said. ``He had pitched so well to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   In additon to his ninth-inning single, Grudzielanek played a big
role in Farnsworth's night.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the sixth by hittng a line drive back to the mound.
Farnwaorth caught the ball, but it struck him on his pitching
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Play was halted for several minutes as Farnsworth tried to
restore the feeling in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really it that well,''Grudzielanek said. ``We knew he
had a good fastball, but the scouting report was that he is more of
a thrower. Tonight, he was a pitcher, a very good pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hollandsorth's bloop single, Farnsworth retired the next
14 batters he faced. He got another run in the eight and even drove
one home with a ninth-inning single off rookie Matt Herges, his
first big league RBI.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Grudzielanek opened with a high chopper that
bounced over the head of Gaetti at third. Farnsworth then balked
Grudzielanek to second, which cost him a double play when Gary
Sheffield grounded to short. Eric Karros flied to center and
Holandsworth flied to Sosa to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a game,'' said Farnsworth, who threw 121 pitches. ``I'll
remember it for a long time.''

<P>
   The fringes of Hurricane Dennis began lashing the Carolina coast
with gusts and rain Sunday, prompting the pre-emptive evacuation of
more than 30,000 vacationers and residents from North Carolina's
barrier islands and forcing swimmers out of the water as far north
as Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, the storm began turning east-northeast,
parallel to the coast, when it was still 150 miles off Wilmington,
N.C. And forecasters expect the center of the storm, with its 105
mph winds, to stay at least 30 miles offshore.
</P>
<P>
   But because the hurricane is unusually wide, hurricane-force
winds _ anything in excess of 74 miles an hour _ were still a
distinct possibility on shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not your classic hurricane,'' said Stacy Stewart, a
meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``Even
if it never makes landfall, they are not out of danger by any
means.''
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane warning remained in effect for the North Carolina
coast from the South Carolina state line to Oregon Inlet, near Nags
Head. Thirty miles off the coast of Cape Fear, 31-foot waves
battered Frying Pan Shoals, while 10-foot breakers hit the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Tides several feet above normal were expected, and up to five
inches of rain were forecast for the Carolinas Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's governor, James B. Hunt Jr., bracing for the
worst, declared both a state of emergency and a state of disaster
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Further north, Virginia Beach and two beaches on Long Island's
South Shore closed to swimmers, and more rescues of swimmers than
usual were reported in rough waters off Ocean City, Md. A tropical
storm warning extended from Oregon Inlet north to Chincoteague,
Va., and south as far as Savannah, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Because of possible storm surges, which can cause flooding and
block roads, more than 20,000 people were evacuated from Ocracoke
and Hatteras, the delicate barrier islands of the Outer Banks north
of Wilmington. Closer to Wilmington, more than 10,000 people were
evacuated from Carolina Beach, Wrightsville Beach, Kure Beach and
Figure Eight Island, emergency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the Carolinas, residents and business owners went
through the familiar drills of boarding up houses and stores.
Thousands of tourists who had hoped to spend the second to the last
weekend of the summer season at the beach packed up their cars and
reluctantly headed home, taking their money with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a bunch of cancellations today and we've lost ten to
twelve thousand dollars,'' Keli Black, a hotel employee in
Charleston, S.C. _ where half an inch of rain fell Sunday _ told
CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses in North Carolina complained that the state was
overreacting by ordering the evacuations, but Robert Carver, a
spokesman for the division of emergency management, said officials
would rather be safe than sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows exactly where this storm is going,'' Carver said.
``We are trying to find a happy medium between overreacting and not
reacting appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mike Murphy, a state environmental program manager in
Virginia, it was the second straight year that a storm forced the
family to evacuate during a vacation in North Carolina. Last year's
culprit was Hurricane Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' Murphy, 45, said as he and his wife
and twins arrived in Wilmington after being evacuated from Topsail
Island, about 30 miles to the north. Around noon Sunday, their
rental company called and said they had to be off the island by 8
p.m. While Murphy and his wife packed, the children watched videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did this last year, so they know what to expect,'' Murphy
said. ``I guess they're hurricane veterans now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, red flags prohibiting swimming flew over Virginia
Beach, although the beaches stayed open, the police said. The
authorities also canceled a fireworks display that is a regular
fixture at the beach in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean City, Md.'s beaches remained open Sunday, but Lt. Mike
Stone of the Ocean City Beach Patrol said rough water had kept the
patrol busier than usual, with more than 200 rescues.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York metropolitan region, the sun was out, but the
combined forces of Hurricane Dennis and Hurricane Cindy, which is
400 miles east of Bermuda, caused waves big enough to prompt the
State Parks Department to close two Long Island beaches _ Jones
Beach and Robert Moses State Park _ to swimmers, although
sunbathing was allowed.
</P>
<P>
   By 1 p.m., five- to seven-foot swells had calmed enough that
some beaches allowed wading up to the waist, but no farther, said
George Gorman, a director of recreation services for the Parks
Department.
</P>
<P>
   High tides also washed out a beach road used by fishermen at
Democrat Point in Robert Moses State Park, Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the restrictions, the crowds were actually about 10
percent to 20 percent above normal for this time of year, Gorman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put up signs at the toll plazas warning people, but they
didn't turn around,'' he said. ``It turned out to be a great beach
day.''
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, two county-run emergency shelters were opened
at 3:30 p.m. Sunday in Wilmington. All city and county offices,
courts and all public schools will be closed today in the
Wilmington area.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters opened in northern South Carolina coastal counties
yesterday as well.
</P>
<P>
   In Litchfield, S.C., south of Myrtle Beach, a property manager,
Bobby Warner, oversaw precautionary measures at the Litchfield By
the Sea resort. Workers were busy boarding up buildings and
securing outdoor furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are being very careful,'' Warner said. ``We have been
through this many times before and have learned to err on the side
of caution. We've pretty much got this down to a science.''
</P>
<P>
   Caution was also the watchword of the day at Alligator Adventure
in North Myrtle Beach, S.C., where workers hurried to reinforce a
fence surrounding the park with steel to make sure the 800
alligators inside stayed inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst-case scenario,'' said the alligator park's manager,
Matt Burmeister, ``is that some may get out of their individual
pens, but they are not getting out of our park.''
</P>
<P>
   For a crew of students from Clemson University, driving four
research vans to Wilmington, the object was to get close to the eye
of the storm. Their vans were pulling trailers carrying towers that
they hoped to place in the hardest-hit areas on land to measure the
wind speed of the strongest part of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get an accurate measure of wind speed on the
ground,'' said Don Key, 22, a civil engineering student.

US MEN'S EIGHT TAKES THIRD STRAIGHT ROWING TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CATHARINES, Ontario _ With a quarter of the race to go, the
US men's eight looked across Martindale Pond and saw the British
walking through them with wing-tipped shoes. ``There's a point
where you have to say, is the race over now?'' stroke Chris Ahrens
said later. ``Or are we going to dig down and find that extra
gear?''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't some Sunday morning paddle, after all. This was the
world rowing championships. So the Yanks pushed the stick into
overdrive, blew past the Brits by half a length _ and made a little
history here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's sunk in yet,'' said Ahrens, after he and
his mates had won the title for the third straight year and stamped
themselves as the clear Olympic favorite. ``It's a great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the Germans (the East in 1975-77-78-79; the West in
1989-90-91-93) ever had won three in a row, but the Americans were
sure they were up to it, even if they hadn't rowed an international
race since they won in Cologne last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had confidence we were going to win,'' said 3-man Porter
Collins, after the US had prevailed in a stiff headwind that added
half a minute (6:01.58) to the race. ``We can row anybody
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight's victory, their fourth in the last five world
regattas, was the showpiece to a strong week by the resurgent US
flotilla, which ended up with 10 medals (six gold, three silver,
one bronze) in 24 events, one shy of the Germans. The men's coxed
four and women's lightweight pair and quad also grabbed gold Sunday
and the women's eight and lightweight double (with Worcester,
Mass., attorney Christine Collins in bow) both took silvers behind
the Romanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're no slouches,'' Collins testified, after Camelia
Macoviciuc and Constanta Burcica had pulled away to win by a
length. ``They've been rowing together for a long time. They didn't
win the Olympics for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefty as the haul was, seven of the US medals came in
non-Olympic events. With the Sydney Games on the horizon the
Americans wanted to make sure they produced something that would
make the whole world watch next summer, particularly in the eights,
which is still the sport's glamour event.
</P>
<P>
   The women, who now have won medals in five of the last six
Worlds, thought they had a terrific chance at unseating the
Romanians, whom they'd only beaten once since the 1984 Olympics.
But the Yanks, who hadn't raced before they came here, gave up too
much ground early and the Romanians held off their late surge to
prevail by a quarter of a length.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let 'em get out too far, just like last year,'' said stroke
Amy Fuller, whose mates lost by the same margin in Cologne. This
time, the US had to come out of third at the quarter pole and spent
most of the race half a length behind.
</P>
<P>
   So cox Rajanya Shah called for the finish sprint early, hoping
to reel in the the scarlet-capped Romanians before they ran out of
space. ``Just before the launch we told ourselves, let's not say we
needed another 200 meters,'' said Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, the US appeared to be drawing even. Then Romanian
stroke Dolna Ignat hit the gas and the Americans found themselves
on the award dock listening to the same old song _ made in
Bucharest. ``Next year is the year that counts,'' Fuller mused.
``I've gone into the Olympic year as the favorite. I'd rather be
the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   The US males haven't won the Olympics since 1964 but they've
been hell in a shell ever since Atlanta, winning as many titles in
one quadrennium as they had in the previous 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans came hammering off the line, hoping to shake the
field. But with 500 meters to go the British, who hadn't won a
world medal since 1991, had them down by nearly half a length.
``(Cox Pete) Cipollone called us even,'' said Collins, ``but we
knew we were down.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. The US mashed the pedal to the floor and ripped
off a stunning sprint that left the British agape and astern. Fifth
gear is a wonderful thing to have. The Yanks just have to make sure
theirs clears Customs in Sydney next summer.

<P>
   TAMPA _ There were more than 64,000 screaming fans in the
Buccaneers' state-of-the-art stadium Saturday night. It was warm.
The opposition was tough.
</P>
<P>
   There was every reason for the Patriots to be intense,
emotional, their adrenaline flowing. It was an exhibition game, but
an important one, the third of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   New England also was playing in the city where it embarrassed
itself two years ago in the regular season, 27-7.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't the players want to show the fans of Tampa Bay and
their players that that result was a fluke?
</P>
<P>
   So how did a 45-14 thrashing occur? How was all the emotion,
intensity, and adrenaline left on the practice field? How did the
basics of tackling, rushing, blocking, catching, throwing, kicking,
covering suddenly seem so foreign? How did the Bucs, 8-8 last year,
seem so much quicker, faster, and stronger than the Patriots, who
were 9-7 and made the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt defensively we were playing at three different
levels,'' said Patriots nose tackle Chad Eaton. ``The line was
playing at one level, the linebackers at another, and the defensive
backs at another. It didn't feel right. The calls were great. The
communication was great. We were flying around. It just felt like
we weren't at the same stage we were last week. We need more heat
on the quarterback. There's more we need to come with. It was bad
and all, but at least it doesn't count. We have time to get it
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably one of the most embarrassing games I've played
in,'' said wide receiver Shawn Jefferson. ``I don't know how it
happened, but it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everything looked horrible. Drew Bledsoe threw the ball well
except for an early interception and got his time in, like a
pitcher in spring training gets his innings in. Rookie running back
Kevin Faulk scampered for a 17-yard gain and netted 40 yards on
nine carries. Although the offensive line had real problems with
Warren Sapp and Brad Culpepper, rookie center Damien Woody appeared
to hold his own. Save for a fumble in the first quarter, Terry
Glenn made four very good and tough catches.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots' secondary and special teams were horrendous.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing special happened on special teams, and in fact, things
got worse. Rookie linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer wasn't as lost as he
was in his first game, but he wasn't as good as he was in his
second game. And the Tebucky Jones experiment at right corner had
another bad night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need to point fingers,'' said cornerback Ty Law,
who had one of his worst days as a Patriot. ``We win and lose as a
team. You can't single out one particular effort. You can't do it.
We have to ask ourselves what can we do as individuals to help this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Law is right about the team concept, but his recently signed
huge contract makes him one of the leaders of this team. He is now
under a microscope. He can ask Bledsoe all about that; for years
Bledsoe had to live up to the expectations of his contract, and he
has done it. Law must do it as well.
</P>
<P>
   From now on Law will be expected to perform at an extremely high
level at a very visible position. Since he's now paid close to
Deion Sanders money, he'd better make that type of impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's perfect,'' said Law. ``Just because we're veterans
we're still human beings. This is just a wake-up call. It's the
preseason, not the regular season. It's a very disappointing loss,
but we can go back and look at ourselves in the mirror and figure
out what each one of us has to do better. I love these guys around
here so I'm not gonna let them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll addressed the letdown straight on, but he's
had to make that speech too often during his tenure. By now
shouldn't there be some hint, something that lets him know that his
team isn't ready to play? And shouldn't he have a quick fix for
turning a flat team into an energetic one on the fly? That's what
he's paid $1 million per year to do.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches go by what happens during the week in practice. If the
sessions are fruitful, if everything on the checklist is
accomplished, then everything must be fine, they believe. But too
often everything has been fine and then at game time all that was
accomplished during the week is lost.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have been off and on so far, they were out to lunch
against Washington, on their game vs. Dallas, and back to sleep
against Tampa Bay. In three days they visit Carolina, a team they
should dismantle easily if they are who they claim they are.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to start expecting consistency, or at least something
close to it. There aren't many teams in the NFL who offer such
consistency, but the good teams take the down periods and minimize
them. The Patriots have too many times when they don't click.
</P>
<P>
   None of this will be remembered in December if the Patriots are
vying for the AFC East title. But something has to be done about
this periodic amnesia _ when the players forget why they're among
the best in the world, and how they're expected to tackle, run,
block, catch, and cover at an intense, spirited, and productive
level.

NO STANDOUTS IN PATRIOTS' DEBACLE 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ Shawn Jefferson was at a virtual loss for words. Troy
Brown also searched for answers, and Drew Bledsoe sounded agitated.
The Patriots' three veterans conveyed a frustration and
disappointment that echoed throughout the locker room following the
team's humiliating loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   But those veterans could take some solace from the 45-14
debacle. At least it won't affect their employment status.
</P>
<P>
   Others might not be so fortunate. Over the next week, NFL teams
pare their rosters twice: The first will come Tuesday, when each
roster must be cut to a maximum of 65 players.
</P>
<P>
   The second comes Sunday, when rosters must be cut to a maximum
of 53 players.
</P>
<P>
   Surely some Patriots rookies and free agents will endure a few
sleepless nights throughout that period.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night would have been a great time to shine, to put
forth a diamond-like effort amid 60 minutes of rough play by the
team as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, no player stood out. Because the poor performance came
so close to the season opener, one wonders how many more
opportunities players will get as the last exhibition game,
Thursday night at Carolina, looms.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Tampa Bay effort would change his plans for the
Carolina game, coach Pete Carroll said, ``Yeah, most likely it
will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't leave this as one of our last attempts. We'll play .
. . I don't want to say right now, because I have to figure it out.
But (Carolina) is much more important than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if anyone played himself out of a job Saturday night,
Carroll said, ``I don't know that, but the word was out in the
locker room. I let it be known that guys playing without emotion,
just playing flat and not giving it up, are in trouble . . . making
this club. Just flat out, they're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that some of the younger players didn't fill the statistics
sheet. It's just that nothing was sustained for long, by any
player.
</P>
<P>
   Even thrill-a-minute backup quarterback Michael Bishop wasn't
his usual self. The seventh-round pick had three rushes for 37
yards, but threw just three passes, completing two, while being
sacked for a 4-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other draftees, Kevin Faulk, who is being groomed as
the team's go-to running back, had 40 yards on nine carries, but 17
of those yards came on one carry.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer had four tackles, including one on
special teams. Safety Marcus Washington had three tackles, one on
special teams. Wide receiver Sean Morey didn't have any catches but
returned a kickoff 19 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the only rookie who stood out Saturday night was safety
Tony George, who was ejected for throwing a forearm at Darnell
McDonald in the fourth quarter in retaliation for a blind-side hit
he suffered from the Bucs' rookie wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ejection, George played solidly. He finished with
four tackles, one on special teams. But after the game, he was
apologetic, knowing he can't deny himself opportunities to shine.
</P>
<P>
   Asked where he felt he would fit in on the team long term, the
former standout from the University of Florida said, ``Definitely
as a special teams player. It's just like it was at Florida,
playing special teams and just make a mark, go out, and be excited
all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not excited to be out there in this league, the NFL,
then this is not the league for you.''

SAFIN PROVES HIMSELF AN ACE 
</HEADLINE>
 PRO-SAFIN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE _ As Marat Safin, a formidable juvenile hunk
resembling a fugitive tight end, crunched his 16th ace past the
equally long-reaching but short-circuited Greg Rusedski, a solitary
red-white-and-blue Russian flag was raised in the south grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   The flag-waver didn't look like Boris Yeltsin, the first hacker
and wayward president of Safin's country. But Boris probably wishes
he'd been sunbathing at Longwood Cricket Club Sunday instead of
trying to hold together the disintegrating homeland. He would have
been pleased to witness the efficient manner in which Safin, a
husky, 6-foot-4-inch Muscovite, carried the flag in formerly enemy
territory to disintegrate Rusedski and win the US Professional
Tennis Championship, 6-4, 7-6 (13-11).
</P>
<P>
   Another appreciative guy would have been one of Russia's first
tennis players, Leo Tolstoy, who also wrote books. Tolstoy, whose
faded court can be seen in outline on his Yasnaya Polyana estate,
might have thought of Safin as a sporting reincarnation of his own
embattled Pierre in ``War and Peace,'' somehow lugging the flag in
the war against Napoleon.
</P>
<P>
   And yet another countryman-with-racket, Czar Nicholas II, might
have decorated puissant Safin for winning the oldest of
professional tournaments. However, the US Pro wasn't launched until
1927, and poor Nicholas had been dead nine years, executed by Lenin
presumably for serving too many double faults.
</P>
<P>
   Safin didn't serve enough of them (six) to help the Czar of Zip,
Greg Rusedski, fastest server in the business. Rusedski, a
lefthanded fireballer holding the record, 149 miles per hour, found
himself uncomfortably in the fiery right hand of a boy bomber, and
hoisted by his own kind of petard.
</P>
<P>
   ``His serve was a joke,'' pronounced Rusedski, dealing in
gallows humor. ``I kept reaching and could never touch it.'' At
least 16 times anyway, plus eight service winners.
</P>
<P>
   Aces are supposed to be up Rusedski's short sleeve, but they
came streaming out of Safin's as though he were a magician or
somebody you wouldn't want to play poker (or tennis) with. Sixteen
dingers. One of every four points Safin won on his inviolable serve
was an ace. This kind of serving sorcery is hard to resist. Safin
served Rusedski blind _ the Englishman never saw a break point.
</P>
<P>
   Safin, 19, merely the third teenager to seize the crown (Aaron
Krickstein was 16 in 1984, Bjorn Borg 18 in 1974), did other good
things, too. He ran astoundingly, stealing points that Rusedski
thought were his. His low, skimming returns, particularly
double-fisted backhands, kept serve-and-volleying Rusedski hot and
bothered.
</P>
<P>
   As the No. 9 of the universe, a US Open finalist two years ago,
Rusedski figured to beat No. 33. But breaking Safin's serve was
about as easy as cracking George W. Bush's silence about youthful
fun and games.
</P>
<P>
   That 16th ace, prominently lifting the Russian flag, made it
10-9 for Safin in the excruciating 24-point tiebreaker that twisted
and turned for 14 minutes like a zonked-out snake. Rusedski was
dodging match points, Safin set points. Nothing so suspenseful had
concluded a US Pro finale.
</P>
<P>
   Safin's sixth double fault (the joke on himself) to 11-11 gave
Rusedski fleeting hope, but Greg was gone two points later, and the
Russian flag-flutterer halfway up the grandstand joyously flapped
while 3,300 patrons clapped.
</P>
<P>
   This match was about two guys starving for victory. Rusedski,
holder of seven titles, but none since last autumn, had said, ``It
sure would be good to take No. 8 out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Safin? His career total was zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday I have to win one. You never think about where. But
Boston is nice place. I have this good memory now.'' He was
breaking his maiden as they say at the racetrack, and he looks like
a fine horse for the Russians to ride in Davis Cup for a long time.
His someday in the winner's circle paid $46,000.
</P>
<P>
   Marat's journey to a first title went from Moscow with mother
love to Valencia, Spain, and through way stations across the world.
Mom, Raisa Islanova, a tennis teacher herself, packed him off to
Valencia six years ago to be schooled by coach Rafael Mensua. She
felt the weather and opportunity among the Spaniards was superior
to that of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard. I was homesick. I had to learn Spanish fast,'' he
says. But the maternal get-outta-town treatment worked. His hunger
was momentarily abated, and as a reward he gets Pete Sampras to
gnaw on at the US Open.
</P>
<P>
   He'll remember Longwood forever for a couple of reasons. Aside
from the hunger that was checked by victory, he wasn't thirsty
enough Saturday. Failing to drink sufficiently during morning
practice, Safin got dehydrated and almost missed his semifinal date
with 1997 champ Sjeng Schalken, whom he beat after a slow, groggy
start, 5-7, 6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Rehydrated in time by Dr. Rich Paul and trainer Bill Norris,
Safin learned a valuable lesson: Keep drinking. President Yeltsin
would agree, and advise vodka. Dr. Paul said water was just as
good.
</P>
<P>
   This was Safin's 38th pro tournament, perhaps confirming the old
Russian proverb, ``The 38th time never fails.'' It probably dates
back to the much-stabbed Rasputin, advisor to Czarina Alexandra,
who apparently succumbed on the 38th stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The flag that took over shortly after Rasputin, Czar Nicholas,
and Czarina Alexandra, the Soviet hammer and sickle, has also
succumbed. But the hammer is around, and named Marat Safin.

HARKES CAN'T STOP REVOLUTION FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution have returned to their
customary place in the MLS standings. They are deep into a streak
of failures and desperately chasing a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   This is like a recurring nightmare for many of the Revolution
players, but it is a new experience for John Harkes. After a 2-1
loss to the Chicago Fire Saturday night extended the Revolution's
streak to nine games without a regulation-time victory, Harkes
seemed almost in a state of shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say anymore,'' Harkes said. ``We just
have to play basic soccer and be more of a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkes's clubs usually have been successful _ D.C. United went
to the MLS Cup final in the first three seasons of the league and
Sheffield Wednesday played in the FA and League Cup finals in
England. He seldom has been at a loss for words in his career.
</P>
<P>
   But there are few signs the Revolution are capable of
recovering, and Harkes's influence on the team has not been strong
enough to change its losing habits.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have the Revolution failed to win in regulation time
since a 3-2 victory over the MetroStars July 4, they have not taken
the lead against an Eastern Conference opponent since then. In the
last 810 minutes of play, they have taken the lead for a total of
48 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This lack of success has taken a toll on the team's confidence
and revived memories of the nine-game losing streaks of 1997 and
'98. Nor have the Revolution displayed the resourcefulness or
attacking unpredictability that could rescue them.
</P>
<P>
   Management has shown signs of desperation by acquiring players
such as Jeff Baicher and Ariel Graziani, who was an influential
goal-scorer for nearly every team he played for in Latin America,
and found his form four minutes into his first game with Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Baicher nor Graziani, nor the trading of Graziani for
midfielder Leonel Alvarez, could be expected to solve the
Revolution's fatal weaknesses in defense, though. Walter Zenga is
still performing exceptionally well as a goalkeeper, but his
coaching tactics have been ineffective. There is simply not a
winning combination among the players.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution were humiliated by the Fire's first-half
performance. At this stage of the season, the team should be
galvanized but instead is filled with self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes was especially upset by the way the Fire's first goal was
scored, as Jerzy Podbrozny easily shielded a defender about 25
yards from goal and found Frank Klopas with a short pass. Klopas
then penetrated to the penalty area and found Roman Kosecki, whose
finish was excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankie Klopas should never be allowed to chip a ball like
that,'' Harkes said. ``The defense needed to step up with Mike
Burns and put them offside. That's just basic soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter Zenga was making great saves but we weren't doing what
we are supposed to do. We are knocking ourselves down. We need to
have discipline, be smart, and use our heads. We need to work hard,
but work hard in the right places.''

ARIZONA HIGH COURT LIFTS BLOCK TO 14 YEAR-OLD'S ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINA LEONARD AND JANELLE COWGILL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Arizona Supreme Court on Sunday cleared the way
for a 14-year-old girl to fly to Kansas for a late-term abortion by
overturning a state appeals judge's ruling that had temporarily
blocked it.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull and other state officials declined to comment,
but law experts say state appeals may be exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday, it was unclear when the 14-year-old ward of the
state would leave for Kansas, where abortion laws are more liberal,
or whether she was already there.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conference early Sunday, the high court voted 3-2
to overturn appellate Judge Michael Ryan's decision Saturday, which
temporarily blocked the foster child from aborting her 24-week-old
fetus.
</P>
<P>
   In making the decision, however, the court did not spell out its
reasoning, saying it would release a more detailed order later. The
order released Sunday concluded that the original trial judge who
ruled that the abortion could proceed had not ``abused his
discretion,'' nor was his ruling ``clearly erroneous.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether opponents of the decision have remaining grounds for
appeal is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney John P. Frank, an expert on constitutional law, said
that if the girl has left the state, the issue is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's gone, it becomes simple,'' he said. ``It becomes
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to lay hands on her.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if she's still here, the state could still take the
case to federal District Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's some side that wants to attempt to challenge
legally the state court order, they would have to find a way to get
to federal court,'' said attorney Marc Budoff, another legal
expert. &UR; ``A district judge would have to determine that there's a
federal issue involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge William Sargeant
ordered that the girl be allowed to have the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Hull and the state attorney general questioned whether the fetus
was too advanced for an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The state also questioned the girl's competency, and had asked
Sargeant to reconsider his ruling and allow a doctor to determine
whether the fetus could survive outside the womb.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, Sargeant affirmed his earlier decision,
permitting the girl to seek an abortion. All the decisions have
been made in secret because the girl, who officials say was raped
or had sex with an adult, which is statutory rape, is a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   The state immediately took the case to the Arizona Court of
Appeals, which ordered the temporary stay.
</P>
<P>
   Without releasing an explanation Sunday, the Supreme Court
vacated that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Laura Knaperek, R-Tempe, and Rep. Jeff Groscost, R-Mesa,
say they are shocked that the Supreme Court sided with Sargeant's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chiseled on the walls of the state Supreme Court are the
words, `Where law ends, tyranny begins,' '' Groscost said. ``With
today's 3-2 court decision, tyranny began and our hopes ended.
Tonight we pray for the little girl and her unborn child.''
</P>
<P>
   Knaperek said she was unhappy that the decision was made over
the telephone and, she believes, didn't get the scrutiny it
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears there wasn't enough time for Supreme Court justices
to make right choices based on information,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Carolyn Gerster, chairwoman of Arizona Right to Life,
said she's outraged at the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This baby is no longer a fetus, this is now a premature
baby,'' she said. ``What crime did this baby commit to be sentenced
to death? We have just begun to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Miller, director of Arizona Right to Choose, said that
the Supreme Court made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have said, enough is enough _ this young woman had the
input of many more adults into her consideration of whether or not
to have an abortion than most teenagers do,'' according to a
release. ``We must respect her decision, and let her get on with
her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sue Grace, R-north central Phoenix, said that the issue has
received due process, and that the state should accept that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to move on. What we need to move on to is
investigating the leak, and making sure this never happens again,''
Grace said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This girl's life has been devastated by this leak.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Thomas A. Zlaket and Vice Chief Justice Charles E.
Jones dissented. Both the majority and dissenters will release a
more detailed order explaining their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Budoff said the court may not have made the decision based on
the abortion issue, but on procedural issues alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that this is more of a philosophical and moral
news event than it is a legal news event,'' Budoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank added that the high court may not have ruled on abortion
at all, but instead looked at a person's ``right to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   But Budoff, who has practiced in Arizona for 25 years, said
although the case may not pose significant legal issues, it brings
up other interesting issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a lawyer's standpoint, you're interested to see the
tugging that goes on between legal and political and moral and
ethical issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have planned to send the girl her to Kansas, where Dr.
George Tiller is the nation's leading practitioner of late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys reportedly focused their appeal, in part, on the
differences between Arizona's abortion law and the more liberal
guidelines in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Late-term abortions in Arizona are allowed only when the life or
health of the mother is in danger. An abortion is considered late
term if the fetus is able to survive outside the womb. In Arizona,
that determination is made by a doctor. No Arizona clinics
currently provide abortions after 20 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, exceptions are allowed for late-term abortions if the
mother's life is in danger or if there is danger of major bodily
impairment or loss of function, which some, including Tiller, have
interpreted to mean the mental health of the mother. &QL;

discretion,'' nor was his ruling ``clearly erroneous.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether opponents of the decision have remaining grounds for
appeal is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney John P. Frank, an expert on constitutional law, said
that if the girl has left the state, the issue is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's gone, it becomes simple,'' he said. ``It becomes
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to lay hands on her.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if she's still here, the state could still take the
case to federal District Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's some side that wants to attempt to challenge
legally the state court order, they would have to find a way to get
to federal court,'' said attorney Marc Budoff, another legal
expert. &UR; ``A district judge would have to determine that there's a
federal issue involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge William Sargeant
ordered that the girl be allowed to have the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Hull and the state attorney general questioned whether the fetus
was too advanced for an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The state also questioned the girl's competency, and had asked
Sargeant to reconsider his ruling and allow a doctor to determine
whether the fetus could survive outside the womb.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, Sargeant affirmed his earlier decision,
permitting the girl to seek an abortion. All the decisions have
been made in secret because the girl, who officials say was raped
or had sex with an adult, which is statutory rape, is a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   The state immediately took the case to the Arizona Court of
Appeals, which ordered the temporary stay.
</P>
<P>
   Without releasing an explanation Sunday, the Supreme Court
vacated that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Laura Knaperek, R-Tempe, and Rep. Jeff Groscost, R-Mesa,
say they are shocked that the Supreme Court sided with Sargeant's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chiseled on the walls of the state Supreme Court are the
words, `Where law ends, tyranny begins,' '' Groscost said. ``With
today's 3-2 court decision, tyranny began and our hopes ended.
Tonight we pray for the little girl and her unborn child.''
</P>
<P>
   Knaperek said she was unhappy that the decision was made over
the telephone and, she believes, didn't get the scrutiny it
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears there wasn't enough time for Supreme Court justices
to make right choices based on information,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Carolyn Gerster, chairwoman of Arizona Right to Life,
said she's outraged at the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This baby is no longer a fetus, this is now a premature
baby,'' she said. ``What crime did this baby commit to be sentenced
to death? We have just begun to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Miller, director of Arizona Right to Choose, said that
the Supreme Court made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have said, enough is enough _ this young woman had the
input of many more adults into her consideration of whether or not
to have an abortion than most teenagers do,'' according to a
release. ``We must respect her decision, and let her get on with
her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sue Grace, R-north central Phoenix, said that the issue has
received due process, and that the state should accept that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to move on. What we need to move on to is
investigating the leak, and making sure this never happens again,''
Grace said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This girl's life has been devastated by this leak.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Thomas A. Zlaket and Vice Chief Justice Charles E.
Jones dissented. Both the majority and dissenters will release a
more detailed order explaining their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Budoff said the court may not have made the decision based on
the abortion issue, but on procedural issues alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that this is more of a philosophical and moral
news event than it is a legal news event,'' Budoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank added that the high court may not have ruled on abortion
at all, but instead looked at a person's ``right to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   But Budoff, who has practiced in Arizona for 25 years, said
although the case may not pose significant legal issues, it brings
up other interesting issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a lawyer's standpoint, you're interested to see the
tugging that goes on between legal and political and moral and
ethical issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have planned to send the girl her to Kansas, where Dr.
George Tiller is the nation's leading practitioner of late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys reportedly focused their appeal, in part, on the
differences between Arizona's abortion law and the more liberal
guidelines in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Late-term abortions in Arizona are allowed only when the life or
health of the mother is in danger. An abortion is considered late
term if the fetus is able to survive outside the womb. In Arizona,
that determination is made by a doctor. No Arizona clinics
currently provide abortions after 20 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, exceptions are allowed for late-term abortions if the
mother's life is in danger or if there is danger of major bodily
impairment or loss of function, which some, including Tiller, have
interpreted to mean the mental health of the mother. &QL;

DEATH OF PITCHER MARS WINNING YEAR FOR ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Every Sunday, Lorrie Robinson buckles her
2-year-old son, Chase, into his car seat and drives to what he
calls ``the park.'' She follows the narrow road past the tall, old
trees with moss draping from the branches to the newest section of
the Oaklawn Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   On clear summer days, she can't help but think this is the
perfect final resting spot for her husband, Kenny: On a mound in
the bright sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   While the Diamondbacks pursue a pennant in just their second
year of existence, it's easy to forget that this season began with
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   A one-car rollover on a dark Tucson road. One Diamondbacks
pitcher, Kenny Robinson, dead. Another, John Rosengren, charged
with manslaughter after tests showed he had a blood-alcohol level
of 0.162, above Arizona's legal limit of 0.10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took two people's lives,'' Liz Robinson, Kenny's mother,
said of the Feb. 28 accident. ``It took John's life, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosengren was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder and
released on $75,000 bail. A grand jury later indicted him on the
manslaughter charge. If convicted, he faces a prison term of seven
to 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rosengren, whose trial is set for Sept. 28, has been out of
baseball since the accident and is living with his parents near
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Robinson family had dreamed this would be a breakthrough
year for Kenny. His injured shoulder was returning to health and
the Diamondbacks were in need of relief help.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed to care that Kenny wasn't the prototype major
league pitcher. On rosters, he was listed at 5-foot-9, but he was
really three inches shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my heart is 5-9,'' he liked to say.
</P>
<P>
   Lorrie and Kenny hoped that at 29, Kenny's career would be
reborn in Arizona. Dreaming he would spend the year with the
Diamondbacks, calling her twice a day, just as he did every day
they had been apart in their 8-year marriage. Telling her of the
excitement of a pennant race, asking about Chase, laughing together
at their $500 monthly phone bills. Still building their days around
those calls.
</P>
<P>
   Lorrie Robinson still can't bring herself to erase Kenny's voice
from the answering machine at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest thing I can't do yet,'' Lorrie said. ``I just
finally opened his suitcases from when they shipped them home.
That's been five months.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny's parents, Liz and Ken Sr., hoped to travel to their son's
games or watch them on satellite. Instead of driving to games now,
they take weekend trips to try to fill lonely hours. &QL; 
Player distraught &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosengren declined to comment, but he is distraught over the
accident, said his lawyer, Mike Piccarreta of Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``John felt it was inappropriate to discuss what he's going
through at this time, and that all thoughts and concerns should be
for the Robinson family,'' Piccarreta said.
</P>
<P>
   North Silverbell Road in Tucson is narrow and filled with gentle
curves and dips as it crosses desert washes. Running roughly
parallel to Interstate 10, which dissects the city, the road is
poorly lit in the 3000 block, where the accident occurred. It's not
a challenging drive, but it does require a clear, attentive mind.
</P>
<P>
   There are few details available about the events of that night.
The families aren't sure where the two men went, and authorities
won't say.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that in the early evening of Feb. 27, Kenny
called Lorrie as usual. He said Rosengren was coming over that
night to watch the North Carolina-Duke basketball game and that
they would probably make an early night of it.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports, the players were southbound on
Silverbell, a two-lane road at that point, about 1:40 a.m. They
were less than a mile from Robinson's apartment when Rosengren's
'97 Explorer drifted off the east side of the road onto a dirt
shoulder. It was estimated to be traveling at 55 mph, 10 mph over
the speed limit. The Explorer then came back on to the road and
turned over on the driver's side.
</P>
<P>
   Neither player was wearing a seat belt, and paramedics had to
use an ax to break out the front windshield, so they could pull the
two men from the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Robinson suffered a severe head injury and was pronounced
dead at the scene. He had a blood-alcohol level of 0.258, according
to the medical examiner's report. That figure surprised Robinson's
family and friends, who said he preferred staying home and playing
video games to drinking and night life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that was very out of character,'' Lorrie
Robinson said. ``We didn't even go out or anything like that when
he was home.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosengren, who wasn't seriously hurt, smelled of alcohol and his
speech was slurred, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Expletive), I was the one driving and it's all my fault,'' he
told police that night, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and Rosengren weren't the best of friends, having known
each only a month or so, but they were bound by similar
circumstances. &QL; 
Coming off injuries &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both were coming off arm injuries and hoped to make the
big-league roster. Both reported early to the Diamondbacks spring
training camp in Tucson to continue rehabilitation work.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are forever tied by the events of one horrible night.
</P>
<P>
   When two Jacksonville police officers rang her doorbell that
Sunday morning, Lorrie Robinson's first thought was that something
had happened to her parents, who live just a few minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is your husband Kenny Robinson?'' they asked.
</P>
<P>
   Her breath stolen away, Lorrie had one thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please tell me he's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   They told Lorrie that Kenny had been killed in a car accident.
They had no details. She called her parents, who were there when
Lorrie called Kenny's mom and dad, who live near Akron, Ohio, where
Kenny grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, the families still wonder about the events of
that night. Kenny was fanatical about wearing his seat belt, yet he
didn't have his on. He felt strongly about drinking and driving,
yet he was riding with an apparently impaired driver.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the Robinsons think they would like to talk to
Rosengren, to find out more about that night. Rosengren is
prevented by Arizona law from contacting the family until his case
has been adjudicated.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Lorrie Robinson thinks, the family would only be
getting one side of the story. She wonders if the entire truth will
ever be known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know him (Rosengren),'' Lorrie said. ``I just know how
I feel about drinking and driving. You could be the nicest person
in the world and still get behind the wheel of a car and something
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying Kenny was not at fault. Obviously, he got into
the truck. They could have called a cab. I just don't know. I'm
affected. He (Rosengren) is affected. We're both going through a
whole whirlwind of emotions. I can't say they are exactly the same,
but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   She would like people to know that Kenny was more than just a
journeyman pitcher and is hopeful that he will be remembered more
for how he lived than how he died.
</P>
<P>
   He was the kind of guy who called his parents five times while
driving across the country for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``What other 29-year-old man would do that?'' Liz asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ken once organized a baby shower for a minor-league teammate's
wife and thought nothing of covering a round of golf for a young
minor-league player strapped for cash. He could make people laugh
by imitating the checkout scanner at a grocery store, driving
clerks nuts in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Robinson affectionately calls her son ``a momma's boy.''
Kenny called his parents several times a week and always after he
pitched, no matter the time. The family's social life revolved
around sports and the games played by Kenny and his younger sister,
Christi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you this much, we lived Kenny's life with him, so
when he dies, that kind of dies too,'' Liz said.
</P>
<P>
   A big man &QL; 
Robinson was a rarity in baseball _ a short right-handed pitcher
who made it to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, it was always the taller kids who were tried first
at pitcher, even though Robinson was begging for the chance.
Eventually, coaches would let the little guy throw and then realize
their mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said, `I don't understand why all they want is
height, height, height,' '' Lorrie said. ``If somebody has the
talent, why does height have to factor into it?''
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson was in the minors, opposing fans could be brutal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could just hear people jawing at him from the stands.
`Don't you need your step-stool?' Or ``Hey, Tattoo, where's the
plane?' That was a cute one.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Robinson began to pitch and the ribbing stopped. He had a
fastball that reached the mid-90s, and he spent parts of three
seasons in the majors, two with Toronto and one with Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks claimed him off waivers from Toronto in 1998
and had him targeted as a middle reliever or closer until he was
sidelined by a shoulder injury suffered in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he worked hard all year to come back from his injury,''
said Joe Garagiola Jr., the Diamondbacks' general manager. ``And I
guess that's the principal thing I take away from our association
and time with Ken _ his competitiveness, his determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was hard-nosed on the mound, Robinson was soft-hearted
off of it. He would send his son flowers, balloons and chocolates
on Valentine's Day. He wrote poetry and short stories.
</P>
<P>
   Before important times in his life, he would write letters to
those close to him, telling them how much they meant to him.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, some close friends cleaned out Kenny's
apartment in Tucson to send things back to Lorrie. On a closet
shelf, Diana found a letter that Kenny had written to Lorrie and
Chase before he underwent shoulder surgery in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted them to know how he felt should something go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you see Chase smile, please see me smiling, too,
because I'll be there watching over you.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about me, I want you to think one thing _ that
I was a good person who worked my ass off and never gave in or
quit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year of Kenny's life, he was able to do so many
things he never had before, Lorrie said. The surgery kept him out
of baseball in 1998, and he spent the summer at home for the first
time in years. He took pride in his yard, and Lorrie would tease
him when neighbors would ask for tips.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny attended his 10-year high school reunion, bought a
Corvette, saw an old friend for the first time in years, shook
hands with President Clinton during his visit to spring training.
</P>
<P>
   A Major League Baseball pension and a life insurance policy are
allowing Chase and Lorrie to live comfortably in the home the
couple bought in Jacksonville just over two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She has a business degree from Florida State and plans to
returns to work once Chase is a little older.

ABC STRIKES GOLD WITH `MILLIONAIRE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Combine a Kathie Lee-less Regis Philbin, a reworking of a
British game show and the third-place network in the dead of summer
television and what do you get?
</P>
<P>
   A ratings monster. A return to the nostalgic days when game
shows fared well in prime time. Or further proof that people will
watch just about anything you put in front of them in August.
Depends upon your point of view.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an ABC executive, the answer is clear. During the
first week of its 13-day run, ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?''
was the second-, fifth-, sixth-, 12th- and 18th-most popular show
on television. Ratings for the latter part of the run _ which ended
Sunday night _ will doubtless climb even higher. Numbers like that
guaranteed that the show would return in some form, and it will,
for November sweeps. (Why not? How many countries can they send
Drew Carey to?)
</P>
<P>
   Even though no one actually won $1 million, ``Millionaire'' is a
certifiable phenomenon, a water-cooler topic. Who among us hasn't
mentally trashed the knucklehead from Richmond, Va., for not going
for the $1 million question last week? Doesn't everyone know that
Jethro Tull won the first Grammy for heavy metal? Sure, his
$500,000 winnings would have been whacked to $32,000 if he'd
missed, but you know you'd have gone for it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you also wouldn't have known Pope John Paul I's real
name, which this guy did to get to the $1 million question.
Details, details. This is television we're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   (A contestant on Thursday night missed a $64,000 question _
really _ when he thought the Keating Five was a group of bankers.
This bodes well for John McCain's presidential aspirations.)
</P>
<P>
   On the off chance that you recently defected to the United
States and have no idea what all the fuss is over, here's a quick
explanation (clip and save for the show's return):
</P>
<P>
   One contestant is chosen from a group of 10, who qualified for a
free trip to New York and the studio over the phone. Most had to
pay $1.50 for an area-code 900 call; lucky residents of nine states
(including Arizona) made free 800 calls.
</P>
<P>
   Once chosen, the contestant sits across from Philbin and answers
a series of questions, beginning at $100 and more or less doubling
in value every time. They also increase in difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds about as interesting as a root canal so far. But the
producers jack up the tension with a space-age set, smarmy music,
tricky lighting and annoying comments from Philbin, who squeezes as
much drama out of a trivia question as Bill Clinton does from an
apology. (But Regis doesn't cry.)
</P>
<P>
   Contestants see the question before deciding to continue. Plus,
they are allowed three ``Lifelines.'' They can eliminate two of the
four possible answers, giving them a 50-50 shot. They can ask the
audience for help (sort of an instant poll). Or they can make a
live phone call to a presumably smart friend, asking for the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just doubling the money, questions get a little more
intense,'' Philbin told TV critics earlier this summer. ``But the
production values surrounding this is what really is the icing on
the cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lighting gets a little more intense, the music gets a
little stronger, the guy gets up to a quarter million dollars,
suddenly you hear a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he calls his friend . . . and asks him the question
with the four possible answers, and that second hand is ticking,
you're down to 16 seconds, the music comes in _ I tell you, it's
really terrific television.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davies, the executive producer of the show, looked to an
old-time game-show host to explain the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monty Hall used to say that every great game show has one
moment where the contestant is going to win everything or lose
everything,'' Davies said. ``This program takes that moment,
heightens it with lighting and music and the intimacy of the set,
and plays that moment again and again and again. And it's a very,
very simple idea.''
</P>
<P>
   It really, really is. Much like the classic '50s game shows
were. Which is probably the real reason people watch the show _ it
seems so simple, you could see yourself winning. And answering
trivia questions is more work than buying a lottery ticket _ you
would feel like you earned your windfall.
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity is deceptive, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions are not impossible,'' Philbin said on a show
last week. ``It's the broad range that'll kill you every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you start naming your first-born son Regis, remember one
thing: It's August. ``Millionaire'' was up against the likes of
reruns of ``Jesse'' and ``Jag.'' That's not much of a test _ a
scrambled porno channel would probably do well in that competition.
</P>
<P>
   (Not to imply that anyone would really watch scrambled porno.
That was a hypothetical example. Besides, I was young.)
</P>
<P>
   So, in the spirit of the thing, when ``Millionaire'' returns,
will it: A) continue to kill in the ratings; B) suffer a huge drop;
C) torpedo ABC's season or D) send Regis scurrying back to Kathie
Lee with his tail between his legs?
</P>
<P>
   You have until November to answer. &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaac's Storm''By Erik Larson (Crown, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the turn of the century, a blustery time in an America
full of national pride and technical confidence. ``In this new
age,'' Larson writes, ``nature itself seemed no great obstacle.''
Then came tragedy in Galveston, Texas. On Sept. 8, 1900, the worst
hurricane ever to target America roared ashore from the Gulf of
Mexico, killing 8,000 men, women and children. The storm is still
the deadliest natural disaster in American history. Larson builds
his story around Isaac Monroe Cline, the chief meteorologist in
Galveston and the one man who might have saved the city. But
America's inflated self-image and rivalries among meteorologists
combined to downplay the storm's strength until it was too late
(Cuba's meteorologists, who had pioneered the art of hurricane
prediction, correctly judged the storm's scale and path, but their
warnings were ignored by the U.S Weather Bureau, which, Larson
says, ``wanted hurricanes all to itself''). Larson creates tension,
suspense and an ominous sense of impending tragedy as he follows
Cline through the days before the storm and then its ghastly
aftermath. The weatherman, who had thought of his own house as a
fortress, watched as water rose around it, first to his waist and
then to his neck, with tiny toads taking refuge on anything that
protruded above the surface. By the time the storm was over, Cline,
like thousands in Galveston, had lost someone he loved. ``This is
the story of Isaac and his time in America,'' Larson writes, ``the
last turning of the centuries, when the hubris of men led them to
believe they could disregard even nature itself.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The Last Survivor: In Search of Martin Zaidenstadt'' &QL; 
By Timothy W. Ryback (Pantheon, $21) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are jarring moments in this book when Ryback quietly
reminds us that Dachau today is a charming and prosperous community
in the rolling hills of Germany, that it has citizens and shops and
a downtown, that it is picturesque. But who can think of Dachau
without imagining its ghosts? In 1992, editors at ``The New
Yorker'' asked Ryback to write a report on the town and its people,
who, as Ryback notes, live in the shadow of the notorious
concentration camp and ``have DACHAU stamped on their birth
certificates, carry DACHAU on their drivers' licenses and in their
passports, pay DACHAU electric bills, DACHAU water bills and DACHAU
gas bills.'' Ryback wrote his story and went on to other work, but
two months later found himself back in Dachau, driven to further
explore the moral issues that permeate the very air there. It was
at the camp in 1996 that he encountered Martin Zaidenstadt.
Zaidenstadt was 87, a former inmate of the camp who after his
liberation made his home in Dachau _ he married a German woman, had
three children and for years ``discarded'' his Jewish identity. Now
Zaidenstadt kept a daily vigil outside the camp's crematorium,
accosting visitors and tour guides and violating cordoned-off areas
to give impassioned demonstrations of how mass death was carried
out. To the people of Dachau, he was a tortured soul, a madman. To
Rybeck, he was an eyewitness urged on by moral righteousness,
astonishing memories, his own demons and the vanity of firsthand
knowledge. This look at Dachau is as thought-provoking as the old
man who became its living ghost, haunting the camp and haranguing
people with what he knows. ``Who's going to kick him out?'' Ryback
asks.``Who is going to tell him he can't go in there? Martin was
supposed to be gassed in that chamber, burned in that crematorium.
But the Nazis are gone, and the ovens are cold, and Martin is still
there. He has an historic claim like no one else in the world.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The Nest: An Artist's Sketchbook''By Maryjo Koch (ST&AMP;C, $35) &QL; 
The oversize format of this pretty book accounts for much of its
appeal, because Koch renders many birds, nests, eggs and feathers
in their actual size. This might not seem like such an endeavor,
but consider a peacock's feather, with the eyespot that Charles
Darwin called ``the most beautiful object in the world.'' Stretched
across two pages, it is 28 inches long and 10 inches high _ lazy,
lanky and delightful. Among the other pleasures are an array of
wrens and jay eggs, a tanager nest built inside a hornet's nest,
and an American robin's nest that incorporates, along with the
traditional mud and grass, a gum wrapper, a Q-tip, a cigarette
paper and a scrap of duct tape. Our favorite rendering: a selection
of impossibly tiny hummingbird nests, accompanied by words that
botanist Nehemiah Grew wrote in 1693: ``I saw one of these nests
made of cotton wool, in form and bigness of the thumb of a man's
glove, with the taper end downwards wherein were two eggs of the
bigness of a pea of oval form. Who can but admire to see the whole
body and all the parts of a bird folded up in an egg little bigger
than a pepper-corn?'' With a forward by Gretel Ehrlich. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``I Just Kept Hoping''By Gloria Stuart (Little, Brown, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quick, call Celine Dion so she can put us in the mood. Stuart
became famous when at age 87 she played the ancient-but-cute ``Old
Rose'' in James Cameron's film ``Titanic.'' We weren't sure we
wanted to read 306 pages about her, but we now admit that there are
some interesting moments, as when Stuart reveals that she is
addicted to expletives and quotes herself screaming obscenities _
really, really bad ones _ at Cameron and other members of the film
crew. But not to worry. Stuart is 89, so Cameron still loves her,
and her memoir can be called ``irreverent'' by the people who write
the jacket copy. We call it chatty, and would be willing to
overlook all the exclamation points if we could just get Celine to
hum a few bars. &QL;

CONDOS MAKE COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Anna McDonald and her husband just put their
suburban Reseda condominium up for sale at $185,000, and they are
confident they won't have much trouble finding a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have talked to a few people who say the market is good right
now. I'm not in a hurry. If I don't sell this year I will just wait
until next year,'' she said on a recent Sunday while preparing the
tri-level, 1,600-square-foot unit for the parade of prospective
buyers she anticipates.
</P>
<P>
   Time and synergy could prove the McDonalds right.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers are definitely out there.
</P>
<P>
   And the longer the McDonalds wait to sell, the more money their
unit is likely to fetch.
</P>
<P>
   Locked in a slump from 1993 to 1997, the area's condominium
market has finally enlisted in the real estate recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to robust single-family home market _ in which both sales
and prices are rising _ condominiums are enjoying a renaissance of
sorts these days as well.
</P>
<P>
   While on average accounting for about one-third of all home
sales, the condominiums market now is showing the same trends
common for single-family homes.
</P>
<P>
   Sales and prices are rising on an annual basis. And condominiums
that are priced right and show well do not stay on the market for
very long.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that:
</P>
<P>
   _ During July, the most recent month for which figures are
available, escrow closed on 361 condominiums in the San Fernando
Valley, up 14.6percent from July 1998, according to the Southland
Regional Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   The median price, the point at which half the homes sold for
more and half for less, was $127,000, or an annual gain of
3.3percent.
</P>
<P>
   Condominium sales have increased for five of the first six
months of the year on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the Santa Clarita Valley, condominium sales boomed last
month, soaring 50 percent to 117 units. The median price was
$133,000, a gain of nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fierce competition for single-family homes in Santa Clarita is
credited with fueling condominium sales. Of the 1,268 properties
listed for sale, 381 were condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   _ Realtors also report that condominium sales are brisk in the
Conejo Valley as well. Pat Evans, a broker at Coldwell Banker in
Thousand Oaks, said activity is picking up in the condo market,
which in the Conejo Valley can mean homes as inexpensive as $90,000
and as pricey as $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acceptability of that type of property has increased
dramatically in the last few years. More people are now willing to
consider (condominiums) as well as a single-family home,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case for Northridge residents Kristin and Matthew
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   They are shopping for a condominium in the $175,000 price range
and focusing their search on the Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Right now they believe they can get more house for their money
in buying a condominium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of the home itself, if you are able to find it, is
much higher than the single-family home in the comparable price
range,'' Kristin Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Their house hunting has been a little bit frustrating in that
they have been looking on and off for about four months. Meanwhile,
prices and interest rates have been rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that the amount that are out there are decreasing
and the prices have been going up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchells are working with Prudential California Realty
brokers Judy and Gary Washburn, who say condominiums are moving
fast in today's market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A town home properly prepared for sale can be sold within the
first 45 days on the market if the price is good,'' Gary Washburn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Realtors say the sales pace can be even quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Miller, a broker at Paramount Properties, recalls quick
buyer response to a unit at the Northbrook complex on Vanalden
Street in suburban Winnetka that had no trouble attracting buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute the sign went in the window we had someone calling
making an offer on it,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden spike of interest _ and prices _ in the condo
market? Industry experts say that for much of the decade, condos
have trailed the single-family market at a greater pace than
normal.
</P>
<P>
   The recession of the early 1990s sent real estate into a tail
spin, with prices plunging along with sales. The median price for a
single-family home peaked at $245,000 three times 1989 but had
fallen to $155,000 by September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That meant there were lots of homes on the market with prices
less than the median. Since single-family home prices were so low,
first-time buyers were able to jump into this market, leapfrogging
the condominium market.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the local real estate market has finally returned
to normal, with condos positioned as a reachable stepping stone for
many first-time buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a portion of the overall market, condominiums went into
decline and now they are back today to where their natural position
is within the market,'' said John Karevoll, an analyst with
Acxiom/DataQuick, a market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor helping the condominium market is the tight
supply of single-family homes for sale. During July, 4,778
single-family homes were listed for sale in the San Fernando
Valley, just 1 percent ahead of last year's number and well below
what experts believe is an ample inventory for a community the size
of the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   So consumers who have been sitting on the fence likely will find
themselves paying more today for less house, whether it's a
condominium or single-family home, than six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of entry-level buyers who missed the
boat when it came to small homes so they are good candidates to buy
a condo,'' Karevoll said.

 LIFE IS JUST A BOWL OF MOLECULES  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woke up, got out of bed, dragged a comb across my head.
</P>
<P>
   But not in that order. Made a mental note to make myself a list
so I can get the sequence right next time, then forgot where I put
the note.
</P>
<P>
   Column not making sense yet? Good. It's supposed to be about
life, more or less, so if the column makes sense, something is
terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I don't feel like eating this early, so maybe I'll just snort
some food-flavored molecules.
</P>
<P>
   At Crabtree and Evelyn in the Stanford Shopping Center, Daryl
Glen came across aerosal sprays for the kitchen, in flavors such as
``Fresh Salad'' and ``Patisserie.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd pick some up, but they might clash with my Fresh Flautas
aftershave and my Cheeze Doodles deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   The spray is a great idea for dieters, though. An aerosal blast
of Patisserie in each nostril and a shot of Salad, and who needs
lunch? Don't do it while riding Muni, though, or you'll have to
pass the can around, give everyone a hit. Don't bogart that
Patisserie, my friend.
</P>
<P>
   For a more substantial breakfast, you might find something on
the junk e-mail I received, a list of the worst convenience foods.
No. 6 is Armour Pork Brains in Milk Gravy, which is not yet
available in aerosal aroma form.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, brains are served scrambled with eggs, but I'm an
optimist, I like my brains sunny-side up. You are what you eat, so
I don't eat scrambled brains. And to enhance creativity, I eat only
the left brain.
</P>
<P>
   And when I finish my pork brains, I always say, ``Th-th-that's
all, folks!''
</P>
<P>
   AFTER inhaling breakfast, I picked up the newspaper and read
that ``The Blair Witch Project'' is under attack from witches.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The movie) defames us and makes us less human,'' says a
spokeswitch in Salem. ``We still get people asking us if we fly on
brooms. ... (The movie) both exploits and reinforces negative
stereotypes about witches.' ''
</P>
<P>
   (In a related story, sharks angry over their species' portrayal
in ``Deep Blue Sea'' have been picketing off Stinson Beach.)
</P>
<P>
   It's sad, really, the yuppification of witches. They had a look
that worked _ the broom, pointy hat and nose wart. Effective, and
commercial. Nobody wants Halloween cutouts of witches in hip
hairstyles and Honda Civics.
</P>
<P>
   Now instead of frightening us, witches just come off as cranky
chicks, although I reserve the right to change my opinion if I wake
up tomorrow as a green frog.
</P>
<P>
   ``THANKS,'' I said to the man on the sidewalk as I took a
quarter out of the cup he thrust at me. I had just come up from
BART, where the trains offer cars in three temperatures: Cool, Warm
and Turkish Prison.
</P>
<P>
   Some cars are so hot that BART should give out tree branches so
passengers could sauna-flog one another.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the street it was cool and gray, and one thing you can
say about San Francisco is that we do summer, but we don't overdo
summer. A couple days of lukewarm sun, then on to fall. Sometimes
the only outward signs of summer are the Macy's Christmas displays.
</P>
<P>
   At Fifth and Mission streets in San Francisco Sunday, motorists
were leading lives of noisy desperation, playing a hornish
symphony. I'm changing my view of road rage. It's a good, healthy
outlet for anger and frustration: Blow it out your horn, hurl
curses and gestures. Rageaerobics. Arrive at your destination
refreshed, as if from a bracing game of racquetball or squash, then
find there's no parking.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I suggested alleviating the parking crunch, especially
when the Giants' new ballpark opens, by using mothballed aircraft
carriers for floating parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   One reader said that would be great, then if we get into another
war with Saddam, we could ship over a few carriers filled with our
SUVs and guzzle up all of his gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader also liked the carrier idea, with a twist: ``Fill
'em with cars, then sink 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' said Sue Kemp. ``Tow the carriers to the airport
between games so they can be used as those extra runways SFO says
it needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Flying commercial jets can get pretty boring, surely the pilots
would welcome the challenge and adrenalin rush of landing a jumbo
jet on an aircraft carrier. It would be a more exciting spectator
sport than baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Weirder still, it turns out that the idea of a carrier as
ballpark car lot was pitched to Mayor Willie Brown last year, and
reportedly he loved it and the idea is under study. The Navy would
be asked to donate a carrier to be converted to a naval museum and
parking lot for about 1,500 cars.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the point of presenting ludicrous ideas for their
alleged humor value when real life beats you to it?
</P>
<P>
   I'm making a mental note to forget the whole thing.

TRADE WAR ENTANGLES TRUFFLES, OTHER EUROPEAN DELICACIES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KIM SEVERSON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  By Thanksgiving, Roquefort cheese _ if you can find it _ will
probably double in price to about $30 a pound. That good French
mustard you like might be $6 a jar. And prized white European
truffles could cost a staggering $2,800 a pound.
<P>
   Damn politics.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the United States slapped a 100 percent retaliatory
tariff on selected imported European foods like Dijon mustard,
filled French chocolate bars, canned Italian tomatoes and foie
gras. And the United States is just beginning to feel its effects.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty was the latest chapter in a lengthy dispute over
beef. Since 1989, the 15-nation European Union has refused to
import U.S. beef treated with growth hormones. In July, the World
Trade Organization said the United States could collect millions of
dollars in customs tariffs on certain European food products as a
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The tariff promises to double the price of luxury foods
gourmands hold near and dear and, some in the food business
predict, cause a run on certain items.
</P>
<P>
   Enough pretariff shipments of nonperishable items like raspberry
jam and Italian biscotti are already in American warehouses that
consumers won't feel the pinch for a few months, importers and
specialty store owners say. But prices of perishable commodities
are starting to climb.
</P>
<P>
   Roquefort, a blue cheese produced only in a certain region in
France and the only cheese on the hit list, is one of the first
items to reflect the tariff.
</P>
<P>
   Some importers quickly flew in as much as they could to beat the
tariff, and passed only the extra shipping cost on to cheese
sellers. The real price hike on the cheese, which is selling for
about $14 to $16 a pound retail, will come once the warehouses are
empty _ which could be as soon as November or as late as January,
depending on demand.
</P>
<P>
   Truffle lovers are particularly worried. The season for fresh
European white truffles - most prized among lovers of the fungus -
begins in October. Last year, black truffles were about $500 a
pound and the best white truffles cost $1,400 a pound. Since the
base price is driven by the abundance of the harvest, no one knows
if the price will double this year.
</P>
<P>
   For chefs trying to price and sell advance reservations for
special holiday dinners in which truffles traditionally play a
starring role, the uncertainty is maddening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the millennium. People will be expecting foie gras and
truffles and caviar,'' says Roland Passot, owner/chef at La Folie,
one of San Francisco's top French restaurants, where 100 pounds of
truffles were consumed last season. He says that no matter the
price, he will buy truffles. But he doesn't know how it will affect
the price of the special New Year's Eve feast he has planned.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the items, like fresh or frozen pork and beef products,
are sent to meat processors and thus won't hit consumers as hard,
said Mike Conway, president of MJ Borelli and Co., a meat importer
in Emeryville that sells high-quality Italian pork and other raw
meat products to salami makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just bought extra hoping things will blow over,'' he said.
``It's just sort of in the hands of the government now.''
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, some products simply aren't making it to store
shelves. Dean Wilkinson, purchasing manager for International
Delicacies in Emeryville, had $17,000 worth of Italian toast and
bread products on a barge heading across the Atlantic when the
tariff hit. The supplier ordered the ship to turn around because
the Italian company wasn't about to absorb the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's grumbling about it,'' Wilkinson said of the
tariff. ``No one thought they'd do it. It could be years before
this thing is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Some importers predict that a strong dollar and deals by
European food manufacturers will combine to keep prices on some
items from doubling. And there's always good, old American
products. Some chefs say that the tariff will be a boost for
companies that process California tomatoes, domestic pork products
or the fatty goose livers called foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   But some things just can't be replaced, such as Italian or
French truffles or Roquefort cheese. And that's exactly why those
products were chosen, said Steve Gaddis, president of Pacific
Cheese in Hayward, the largest importer of Roquefort in the western
United States.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; `Highly Political'
</P>
<P>
   ``The selection of this cheese is highly political. The items
were selected to have an impact and help solve the problem as a
negotiation item.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics played a role in protecting another item from the list.
Prosciutto, a dense, salt-cured, air-dried ham made only in Parma,
Italy, and a constant in deli cases, was taken off the list after
intensive lobbying by importers.
</P>
<P>
   How long the tax will last is anybody's guess. Under the
agreement, the United States can only collect $116.8 million using
the luxury tariff. Some importers say the prices will drop once the
cap is reached. Others hope political pressure will force an
agreement sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Already, French farmers are fighting back. In the southwestern
region where Roquefort is produced, the local government earlier
this month imposed a 100 percent tax on bottles of Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   And the French press reported that last week the farmers in the
same region dumped fruit, vegetables and manure in front of
McDonald's outlets. The protests began earlier in the month when
farmers from a region known for its foie gras occupied a McDonald's
in the town of Gers.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of pressure might actually make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how it goes,'' said Henry Kaplan, president of De
Choix Specialty Foods, a company with offices in New York and San
Francisco. ``The Europeans are on vacation now. When they come back
and see how it affects their business they'll come to their
senses.''  &LR;

INTERNET HELPS CHECK VALUE OF STOCKS &HT;    By HARRY DOMASH
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It seems every time I see mutual fund managers
interviewed on television, they say that they only buy undervalued
growth stocks. That sounds great, but how do you know whether a
stock is undervalued or overvalued?
</P>
<P>
   You can use the Internet to find the answer.
</P>
<P>
   There are innumerable methods to measure a stock's worth. Most
calculate a fair value for the stock and then define companies with
share prices above fair value as overvalued, and those below fair
value as undervalued.
</P>
<P>
   One widely used approach involves comparing the company's
price-earnings ratio (stock price divided by annual earnings per
share) with its annual earnings growth rate, expressed in
percentages. Originally, the company's past earnings growth history
was used, but now most analysts use expected future earnings
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Motley Fool (www.fool.com) packaged the concept into a
formula the company named the Fool Ratio _ a stock's PE divided by
the expected earnings growth rate. The idea caught on, but the name
didn't stick, and now it's called the PEG (PE divided by Growth).
</P>
<P>
   The Motley Fool defines fair value to be the price where the
earnings growth rate and the PE are equal, and the PEG equals 1.
For example, if a company's shares are trading at 20 times earnings
and earnings are expected to grow 20 percent a year, the stock is
fairly valued. But given the market's current exuberance, some
analysts say fair value is when the PEG is 1.5 or even 2.0.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKSELECTOR: StockSelector (www.stockselector.com) gives an
easy way to find fair value using a variety of approaches. Type a
stock symbol into the box labeled Ticker, select Valuations from
the drop-down menu, click on Submit and you're done.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, you'll see fair values determined by PEG and
several other valuation methods. StockSelector displays the fair
value price determined by each method, and the difference between
the fair value price and the closing price expressed in dollars and
in percentage.
</P>
<P>
   I tested StockSelector's valuation methods Tuesday (August 24),
using Airborne Freight (ABF) as an example. Airborne currently is
on the outs with many analysts, and Tuesday's closing stock price,
$24.94, was about 40 percent below its recent high. Airborne's
earnings for the June quarter were below the year-ago quarter and
also below the consensus estimate of analysts. Airborne attributed
the shortfall to a ``lack of growth in domestic shipments.''
</P>
<P>
   StockSelector's PEG Value calculator compares next fiscal year's
expected earnings with the estimated long-term earnings growth
rate. It came up with a fair value of $33.86 for Airborne, 36
percent above Tuesday's closing price.
</P>
<P>
   StockSelector's other fair value calculators include:
</P>
<P>
   StockSelector Value: Based on the idea that a stock tends to
trade around a consistent PE ratio, this program calculates a
five-year average PE for the stock and multiplies it by next year's
estimated earnings. This method valued Airborne at $42.16 per
share.
</P>
<P>
   Present Value: This is a conservative method that uses a
combination of book value and inflation-adjusted earnings
forecasts. The fair value for Airborne using Present Value was
$39.54.
</P>
<P>
   Industry Value: This system uses the average PE for the
company's industry _ in this case, air delivery/ freight services _
and next year's earnings forecasts for the company. The rationale
is that in the long term, that a company's PE will approximate the
PE ratio for its industry. This approach came up with a fair value
of $40.18 for Airborne.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; D &LR; ividend Value: This formula uses the company's five-year
average dividend rate. It came up with $16 for Airborne's fair
value.
</P>
<P>
   QUICKEN'S APPROACH: The Quicken site (www.quicken.com) recently
added an ``intrinsic value'' calculator, which uses estimated
future earnings to determine the present value. Benjamin Graham,
who is considered the founder of fundamental analysis, first put
forth the concept of intrinsic value. It is a favorite tool of many
value investors.
</P>
<P>
   You can find intrinsic value on Quicken by first getting a
quote, then clicking on Evaluator and lastly selecting Intrinsic
Value. Quicken's program came up with an intrinsic value of an
incredible $525 per share for Airborne Freight. Quicken says its
evaluator still is in the test stage and that its result for
Airborne indicates that either Quicken has more testing to do or
Airborne Freight's share price has terrific upside potential. I
suppose time will give us the answer.
</P>
<P>
   VECTOR VEST: You'll find another view of fair value at Vector
Vest (www.vectorvest.com). We described Vector Vest in our column
on second opinions a few weeks ago. Select the Free Stock Analysis,
enter the stock symbol and click Get Stock Info for a report.
VectorVest calculates fair value using a proprietary formula based
on earnings, financial performance and interest rates. The result,
shown near the top of the report, showed a value of $27.10 per
share for Airborne Freight.
</P>
<P>
   We found a range of opinions for Airborne's fair value, but most
were in the $27 to $40 per share range, considerably above the
current price.
</P>
<P>
   I don't recommend buying any stock based solely on mathematical
calculations, but it's a starting point for further research.
</P>

SAN FRANCISCO LAWYER HELPS HACKERS, CRACKERS GET A BREAK &HT;    BY TOM STEIN
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hacker. It's an ominous term that, for most
people, conjures up images of oddly attired computer geeks
hell-bent on stealing our credit card numbers, shutting down city
power grids and destabilizing the government.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the way Jennifer Granick sees it. Granick is a
private-practice lawyer who defends people accused of
computer-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the word `hacker' carries a negative connotation,''
she said in a recent interview. ``There's a presumption of guilt
there that we need to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Granick takes pains to distinguish between law-abiding
hackers, and a more devious group of computer enthusiasts called
crackers. Hackers, she explained, are computer security whizzes who
may dress weird and have a rebellious streak but do not use their
technical skills to commit crimes. ``Just because you can break
into someone's computer system doesn't mean you will,'' said
Granick.
</P>
<P>
   But crackers, she said, are known for busting their way into,
say, a bank's computer system and wreaking havoc with the data they
gather.
</P>
<P>
   Since graduating from Hastings College of the Law school in
1993, Granick has defended nearly a half-dozen people charged with
cracking crimes.
</P>
<P>
   She became interested in this line of work about four years ago,
when news about legendary computer cracker Kevin Mitnick was
inundating the airwaves and print media.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old lawyer also admits to being something of a geek
herself, though this was not apparent during a visit earlier this
month to her San Francisco offices, where Granick talked
passionately about civil liberties, the explosive growth of the
Internet and the need for straightforward laws in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Her major battle cry is that the authorities often try to
portray computer-related crimes as much more horrendous than they
really are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement has an interest to play up the threat of
cyber-crime because it means an increased budget and more money for
them,'' she said. ``This is the new cops and robbers, and it makes
a great story for the media. Everyone works together to make these
stories seem more dangerous than they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, she cites a recent case in which her client _ a
young man whom she declined to name _ had used his Web browser to
hack into the Web server of an Internet service provider and
uncover the passwords of many of its members. The ISP reported the
incident to the FBI, which referred it to the Department of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided to make a federal case out of it,'' joked
Granick. ``I think there was something about the case that angered
the FBI. They thought it was more malicious than a typical Web site
hack.''
</P>
<P>
   Granick argued that her client merely was exposing a common flaw
on the ISP's Web server software and that his actions did not
constitute a legitimate cracking crime because he used a standard
Web browser _ and did not write any special code _ to access the
server.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case raised a lot of interesting legal issues, such as
whether it's illegal to access information through a flaw in
someone's system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many hackers think entering an unguarded site is not a crime as
long as they don't do any mischief.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the way the FBI sees it. ``The best analogy is an
individual walking down a street and trying the front door of every
house,'' said George Grotz, a special agent with the FBI in San
Francisco. ``The first door is locked, the second is locked, the
third is locked, and the fourth is open. He walks in, looks around.
Sometimes he takes something, and sometimes he doesn't. In the real
world, at a minimum, it is trespassing. Many hackers believe it is
not, but it is. To say computer hacking is not a crime is simply
not factual.''
</P>
<P>
   Granick said her client did not use the passwords to impersonate
the ISP's members or to raid their credit card information. Still,
the ISP was outraged. According to Granick, the company acted as if
it had been ``raped and burglarized.''
</P>
<P>
   Granick bristles at the graphic analogy. ``Breaking into
someone's computer is not rape and is not the same as burglarizing
their house,'' she said. ``Computer crimes do not present the same
kind of physical danger to victims. While it may be helpful for
prosecutors to talk in these terms, it is wrong for society to
treat these things as if they were the same kinds of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   After a complex round of pretrial negotiations, Granick was able
to knock her client's charge down from a felony _ and potential
jail time _ to a misdemeanor and probation.
</P>
<P>
   But the reduced charge may be the exception rather than the
rule. She said that because computer laws are so murky and
ill-defined, crackers commonly face stiff penalties that are out of
proportion to their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   David Banisar, a Washington, D.C., attorney and fellow at the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research organization that
strives to protect civil liberties in cyberspace, agrees. ``People
charged in computer cases face extra hurdles because of the lack of
technical sophistication on the part of prosectors, judges and
juries,'' he said. ``Often, what they end up being accused of is
much worse than what they actually did.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 83 computer cases prosecuted last year, 47 ended in
convictions. Another 10 cases resulted in not-guilty verdicts,
while the remaining cases are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say about 80 to 90 percent of all criminal cases
end in a conviction or a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Granick is concerned that defendants often have no choice but to
plead guilty. ``If I steal 100 credit card numbers and each has a
$5,000 limit, that is viewed as $500,000 of loss,'' she explained.
``That loss estimate represents a high category on the federal
sentencing guide and determines how much time I get, even if I
never used a single one of those credit cards.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that loss estimate is like a giant hammer hanging over
defendants. So when they are offered a plea bargain, they jump at
it.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Granick fears that the laws relating to computer
crimes are becoming more draconian and unjust. ``I'm saying the
guidelines are too severe, but the Clinton administration seems to
think they are not serious enough,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on August 6 President Clinton created a commission to
determine whether current laws are strong enough to combat computer
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the computer industry favor more stringent laws. ``There
are some instances where cyber-criminals get away because their
crimes are not even on the books yet,'' said Jacob Mutolah, a vice
president at Aladdin Knowledge Systems Ltd., a maker of computer
security systems. ``The law is still vague in many areas. The legal
system needs to do more to address these issues in order to protect
the public and punish criminals appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's Grotz agreed. ``Computer laws right now are a work in
progress and the authorities must continue to be vigilant,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Granick is determined to fight the good fight. As the Internet
becomes an integral part of our daily lives, she believes that
federal prosecutors are bound to take an even more aggressive
approach to computer crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new area of the law,'' she said. ``There are lots of
opportunities for things to go wrong, but there are lots of areas
where things could go well. I`m hoping that my involvement in some
of these cases will ensure that certain safeguards are
guaranteed.''

AMERICANS TO BE GUINEA PIGS IN DEBATE OVER OFF-LABEL DRUG USES &HT;    By TOM ABATE
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ American doctors and their patients are about to
become subjects in a national experiment that will determine
whether speed or safety is the best rule when it comes to promoting
experimental uses for new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment has been set in motion by a recent judicial
ruling that gives drug and biotech firms new ways to promote novel
uses of drugs that already are on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. law, no firm can sell a prescription remedy without
first performing tests aimed at persuading the Food and Drug
Administration that the drug or medical device is both safe and
effective.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA sets strict rules governing how a product should be
used. These rules are found in the fine print on every prescription
label.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors, especially those who treat life-threatening
diseases, often ignore those labels and use products in ways the
FDA hasn't approved. A doctor may decide that a drug approved to
fight one type of cancer could treat a related variety. In such
instances, the doctor will write what is called an off-label
prescription.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has never tried to stop doctors from writing off-label
prescriptions. But it has tried to stop companies from promoting
off-label uses for drugs and devices.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a nonprofit, conservative think tank called the
Washington Legal Foundation sued the FDA in federal court, saying
companies had a First Amendment right to send scientific
information about off-label uses to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   While that case was percolating through the courts, the FDA
softened its stand on off-label promotions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the agency said drug and biotech firms could send
doctors studies promoting off-label uses _ but only if the firms
promised to send out later evidence of contrary studies and agreed
to perform tests to get formal FDA approval for the new use.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth rejected that
compromise, saying the FDA had engaged in ``constitutional
blackmail'' by putting conditions on the exercise of commercial
free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge agreed with us that patients are best served when
doctors have more information,'' said Daniel Troy, a WLF attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about advertising to consumers,'' he said.
``This is scientific information sent to doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Dotzel, an FDA associate commissioner, said the agency has
another month to decide whether to appeal the ``disappointing''
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   She said the FDA fears that if companies can send out early
stage scientific studies of off-label uses, they won't spend the
time or money _ it can take three years and millions of dollars _
to do full FDA safety tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``These uses could be dangerous,'' Dotzel said. ``There are
famous off-label uses that became widespread and were harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent example involved the off-label use of
powerful drugs meant to control severe cases of arrhythmia, or
irregular heartbeat. Raymond Woosley, chairman of pharmacology at
Georgetown University, said doctors began writing off-label
prescriptions that used these drugs for mild arrhythmias. Only
after rigorous safety studies in the late 1980s did doctors learn
that the off-label use provoked heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``By some estimates, 50,000 may have died,'' Woosley said.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer activists want Lamberth's ruling overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a giant step backward,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the
Public Citizen Health Research Group in Washington, D.C., one of
the many appendages of the Ralph Nader organization.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry counters that off-label uses do more good than
harm, especially for patients with terminal diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, the standard of care is an off-label use,''
Troy said. Troy cited studies that show 56 percent of cancer
patients receive some off-label drug.
</P>
<P>
   James Wood, an Oakland attorney who represents biotech and
medical device manufacturers, said the public doesn't need the FDA
to protect them from off-label uses. He said doctors understand
that they're liable when they prescribe off label and that they
won't write reckless prescriptions just because a drugmaker sent
them a glossy scientific reprint.
</P>
<P>
   And although Wood was reluctant to say so, under
cross-examination he admitted that drug firms probably could be
sued if they promoted an off-label use that turned out to be
dangerous _ especially if it could be shown they knew of and failed
to publicize cautionary findings. Until now, strict FDA rules have
inoculated drugmakers against such liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly heading into an unknown area,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for the public at large. Lamberth's ruling substantially
could deregulate an important aspect of drug development. Getting a
drug on the market is so costly that once a firm is successful, it
invariably tries to find supplementary uses for the remedy.
</P>
<P>
   By using preliminary studies to promote off-label use,
drugmakers could turn the entire medical establishment _ patients,
doctors, journals _ into one continuing experiment. More docs will
write more off-label prescriptions for more new uses. We could
speed up discovery of life-saving advances, or promote practices
that later prove unsafe _ or both.
</P>
<P>
   It is a grand free-market experiment brought to you by the
Washington Legal Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Take two aspirin and call back in a decade. By then, we may know
how these new off-label promotions have worked.

   1. THE MILOSEVIC GENERATION Welcome to Belgrade, the capital of
Serbia. Here bureaucrats with bodyguards and blood on their hands
have become private club dandies; middle-class professionals have
been forced to choose between poverty or criminality; and feigned
lunacy is a sane way to stay safe. Four lost wars, international
isolation and gangster economics have combined to make Belgrade
especially cruel to the young people who have come of age during
the 12-year reign of Slobodan Milosevic. By Blaine Harden. From The
New York Times Magazine. Full-length (7,700 words) + edited article
available.

CAN B. SMITH BE MARTHA? An icon of the black professional class is
hoping to cross over - by mounting a three-fronted attack on Martha
Stewart's living. Barbara Smith, the restaurateur and cookbook
author, host of a nationally syndicated TV show in the U.S. and
editor-in-chief of an upcoming magazine that will bear her
brand-like name, is already a star in the black community. By Julia

WARHOL : SUBVERSION THROUGHOUT SEDUCTION Andy Warhol was the
greatest designer of the second half of the 20th century. He
invented a style, made it fashionable, applied it to a wide range
of products, publicised it on a large scale and caused it to be
hugely influential. If there is such a thing as a Warholian
modernity, it resides in his conception of the artist as producer,
distributor, publicist and actor rolled into one. Warhol has never
before been given such an effective and representative
retrospective as the exhibition now on in Brussels, Belgium, until
September 19. The title of the show says everything : ``Andy
Warhol, a Factory.'' By Philippe Dagen. From Le Monde. 1,500 words.
(English translation available.)

THE TIME FOR WAR IS OVER: AN INTERVIEW WITH GADHAFI Nearly five
months after the United Nations suspended its sanctions against
Libya, following Libya's belated agreement to turn over two Libyan
suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing for trial in the
Netherlands, Colonel Moammar Gadhafi has returned to the
international scene. In this exclusive interview, given under a
Bedouin tent in Tripoli, the Libyan leader whistles a somewhat
different tune than in the past. The time for war is over, he says,
and now is the time to work on national development. Increasingly
he is turning away from his erstwhile Arab comrades and toward
black Africa. By Pierre Prier. From Le Figaro. 2,750 words. English

   EAT THE RICH. By P.J. O'Rourke. Atlantic Monthly, $13.
</P>
<P>
   A political satirist and free-market enthusiast finds much to
zing in this animated tour of the global economy, from Sweden's
welfare wonderland to Albania's disastrous flirtation with
capitalism. The result is ``a delightful collection of anecdotes
and one-liners,'' Peter Passell wrote here in 1998.

   COLLECTED FICTIONS. By Jorge Luis Borges. Translated by Andrew
Hurley. Penguin, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986) was renowned
for his strange, knotty fiction; his jewel-like stories _ ripe with
labyrinthine imagery, arcane knowledge and mythological overtones _
often resemble cruel fairy tales in which magic is evil and bad
deeds routinely go unpunished. This collection, the first complete
translation into English of his work in a single voice (that of
Andrew Hurley, an English professor at the University of Puerto

   THREE CONTINENTS. By Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Counterpoint, $14.
</P>
<P>
   In this dark novel, wealthy American twins relinquish their
freedom and fortune when they come under the thrall of a
quasi-religious group called the Fourth World Movement and its
leader, a minor Indian king with grand ambitions. ``As a meditation
on the twin themes of inheritance and family, `Three Continents' is
a significant achievement,'' Peter Ackroyd wrote here in 1987. The
same publisher has reissued one of Jhabvala's earlier novels,
TRAVELERS ($14), which tracks the lives of four wanderers _ two
English, two Indian _ who meet, judge and fall in and out of love
with one another in India. In 1973 our reviewer, Dorothy
Rabinowitz, admired the author's ``grace of mind'' and said the
book ``compares well with the best social novels in contemporary
fiction.''

<P>
   LIFE: A NATURAL HISTORY OF THE FIRST FOUR BILLION YEARS OF LIFE
ON EARTH. By Richard Fortey. Vintage, $15.
</P>
<P>
   A British paleontologist combines his own experience with a
sweeping knowledge of the facts of life in the first popular but
scholarly account of life's history written by a professional. His
narrative, selected as one of the best books of 1998 by the editors
of the Book Review, ``is not a boring slog through the strata, but
an eclectic waltz among organisms at once extraordinary and
extinct,'' Jerry A. Coyne wrote here. AT THE WATER'S EDGE: FISH
WITH FINGERS, WHALES WITH LEGS, AND HOW LIFE CAME ASHORE BUT THEN
WENT BACK TO SEA, by Carl Zimmer (Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster,
$14), discusses the origin of tetrapods and whales, evolutionary
events involving creatures with backbones. ``Zimmer does a good job
of explaining how profoundly different are the physiological and
structural requirements of life in water compared to life on
land,'' Philip Gingerich wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   THE MOURNERS' BENCH. By Susan Dodd. Morrow, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This novel explores the tangled fortunes of two working-class
Southern women and the New England teacher with whom they become
involved; stung hard by misfortune, the characters rely on courage,
irony and humor to pull them through. ``The book finds its
considerable power in Dodd's patient excavation of the complex
aftereffects of tragedy on the lives of the people who emerge ...
on the other side,'' Elizabeth Graver said here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   LINDBERGH. By A. Scott Berg. Berkley, $16.
</P>
<P>
   This Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Charles Lindbergh,
drawing on newly accessible private papers, ``provides enough fresh
detail to trace the roots of Lindbergh's personality, its strengths
as well as its maddening flaws, all the way back to his turbulent
boyhood,'' Geoffrey C. Ward wrote here in 1998. IN UNDER A WING: A
MEMOIR, by Reeve Lindbergh (Delta, $12.95), Lindbergh's sixth and
youngest child recalls a loving, active father who sought a rigidly
ordered life and absolute control over events and people. Last year
in these pages, Ward called this a ``wonderful family memoir.''
</P>
<P>
   ZARAFA: A GIRAFFE'S TRUE STORY, FROM DEEP IN AFRICA TO THE HEART
OF PARIS. By Michael Allin. Delta, $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   In 1826 the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt sent a 12-foot giraffe to
King Charles X of France, and the beast's 550-mile trip from
Marseilles to Paris captivated the nation. ``Allin does a terrific
job of chronicling the giraffe's remarkable pilgrimage ... as well
as analyzing the profound effect the animal had on the French
people,'' Carolyn T. Hughes wrote here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   MY SISTER FROM THE BLACK LAGOON: A NOVEL OF MY LIFE. By Laurie
Fox. Scribner, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator of this unusual coming-of-age story is forced to
grow up in the shadow of her mentally ill older sister, whose
ravings torment her family. ``The novel is honest, entertaining
and, in parts, downright wacky,'' Valerie Frankel wrote here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   THE EXTRA MAN. By Jonathan Ames. Washington Square/Pocket Books,
$12.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Ives is an aspiring gentleman about town with a troubled
past who befriends a debonair but eccentric elderly playwright.
Last year our reviewer, Stephanie Zacharek, called this novel ``a
sure-footed exploration of sexual confusion and a loopily elegant,
surprisingly moving urban comedy of manners.''

for Sunday, Aug. 29, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.

</P>
<P>
   FOOD-GLOBALISM-REVIEW (Paris) _ The European forces gathering
this summer in protest against what is seen as U.S.-led
globalization have abruptly focused on food. Where it was once the
deployment of U.S. Pershing missiles that caused alarm, it is now
McDonald's, Coca-Cola, genetically modified American corn and
American beef fattened with growth hormones that have Europeans up
in arms. By Roger Cohen. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-SECONDCHANCES-REVIEW (Washington) _ As a golfer, Bill
Clinton is famous for mulligans, or hitting a second ball to
substitute for a previous shot gone awry. The mulligan may be the
perfect metaphor for his presidency. The voters have given the
Comeback Kid more than one mulligan. Clinton was granted a second
chance by the Senate in February after the House impeached him for
his behavior in the Monica Lewinsky matter. And it can be assumed
that Hillary Rodham Clinton has given Clinton a few mulligans too.
By Don Van Natta Jr. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   GUNS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Statistics show that gun violence is
declining, but highly publicized shootings can prompt people to buy
guns for self-protection, which actually increases the likelihood
that the buyer or a member of his or her family will be shot. More
often the carnage occurs in thousands of small tragedies too
mundane to make national headlines in a country where surveys have
indicated that half the households have at least one gun. By David
Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   LUTHERAN-EPISCOPAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ In recent years, the
prospects for the ecumenical movement among Protestant
denominations had seemed dim. But that view recently changed when
the nation's largest Lutheran denomination approved an agreement
for full communion with the Episcopal Church. Historically, the
U.S. has provided rich soil for a multitude of denominations. But
alongside the divisions, there has long been an impulse toward
unity. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   SWISSAIR-REMAINS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Finding and retrieving
the remains of the 229 people who died when a Swissair jet crashed
a year ago off Canada's Atlantic coast may have been the simple
part. The hardest part may have been deciding how to handle 23
coffins filled with remains so small they have not been identified.
Only in the last few weeks have Nova Scotia officials, religious
leaders of several faiths and the people of Halifax agreed on a
solution: a mass burial and funeral rites this week to mark the
anniversary of the Sept. 2 crash. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   INEPT-LAWS-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at some of the laws on
the books that have been enacted with the best of intentions but
that turned out to work at cross-purposes with government policy.
They have unintended consequences that outweigh whatever benefits
they may provide. For instance, a tax break called flexible
spending accounts encourages extra medical spending on
non-essentials while the government's goal is to hold down medical
costs. Government flood insurance emboldens people to build and
occupy homes in flood-prone areas, which the government is trying
to discourage. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   URBAN-ENVIRON-REVIEW (Albany, N.Y.) _ Minority leaders from
inner-city communities have found themselves in an unlikely
alliance with big business as part of a national campaign to make
it easier for industry to develop pollution-blighted properties,
commonly referred to as brownfields, by easing the costly clean-up
standards that currently exist. This new approach has created
something of a crisis for the environmental movement. By Raymond
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   GOLD-REVIEW (Undated) _ As the price of gold hits a 20-year low,
diehard gold bugs and others are rushing in to buy the precious
metal as a hedge against the day the bear wakes from his prolonged
hibernation on Wall St. A look at the pros and cons of this idea,
and the background of gold as a precious metal. By Dana Canedy.
</P>
<P>
   FOIE-GRAS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Smithsonian Institution in
Washington has canceled a celebration of foie gras, a delicacy
produced by the forced feeding of ducks and geese, after a torrent
of complaints from animal rights advocates. A look at some
statements about the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-QUAKE-CORRUPT-REVIEW (Istanbul) _ The earthquake that
killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey was more than a
natural disaster. Many of the victims would have survived if their
homes had been built in accordance with elemental safety standards.
Instead they were built with cheap materials by contractors who had
learned they could make up in corruption what they lacked in skill
and experience. By Steven Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-TIMOR-REVIEW (United Nations) _ If the East Timorese
vote Monday to sever ties with Indonesia and opt for independence,
where would this brand-new country rank among the United Nations'
188 members? Indonesians who argue that East Timor is too small to
be viable may be surprised to learn that there are indeed a number
of tiny countries that have been successful. By Barbara Crossette.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Aug. 21 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

   So Many Words, So Little Time &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The war of words in the ordinarily staid dictionary market
intensified with the publication of Microsoft's upstart new
reference guide, the Encarta World English Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   London's underground was plastered with Encarta posters of a coy
topless model who was strategically covered by the weighty
dictionary. Rival publishers like Merriam-Webster Inc. in the
United States came out with more subdued full-page advertisements
in People and Time featuring a beaming college student in
sunglasses: ``Will your performance this school year be inspired or
ignominious?''
</P>
<P>
   But the real skirmishes were taking place behind the scenes with
rival publishers collecting examples of mistakes, omissions and
preachiness in the seven-pound print version of Encarta that labels
words like ``handicapped'' or ``harridan'' as offensive terms.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insisted that all dictionaries have errors and any
mistakes would be corrected. But that didn't still the glee of
rivals who are so wary of Microsoft's financial resources that they
have turned to the weapons they know best: words.
</P>
<P>
   The competition whispered about the Encarta pronunciation of
Niagara Falls _ ``nigara falwz'' or Civil War general George Gordon
Meade, who was mistakenly described as a leader in the
Revolutionary War. There was the inclusion of a photograph of
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and the absence of a photo of John F.
Kennedy. And there was some bewilderment about the appearance of
Louise Veronica Ciccone, the pop singer, as the first definition of
Madonna, followed by the second, the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft editorial director Richard Bready noted that first
editions of dictionaries are known for errors. ``If you are a
lexicographer, it's possible to find this level of error in any
dictionary. This is not the result of haste to publish. This is the
result of publishing a dictionary.''

<P>
   The tombs of ancient Egypt have by no means exhausted their
power to astonish.
</P>
<P>
   Years may go by without an eye-popping discovery, but then
archaeologists stumble on something like the 2,000-year-old
cemetery at an oasis 230 miles southwest of Cairo. They gave the
first detailed descriptions of one of the most spectacular Egyptian
discoveries in decades. In the buried tombs were rows of mummies
lavishly prepared for the afterlife with masks and waistcoats
covered in gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have such a number of mummies been found in a
single site in Egypt,'' said Dr. Zahi Hawass, director of the
excavations at Bahariya Oasis in what is being called the Valley of
the Golden Mummies.
</P>
<P>
   In the first four tombs explored, archaeologists counted 105
mummies _ men, women and children _ all from the Roman period of
Egypt in the first two centuries A.D. Looking at the painted masks,
Hawass said, ``The eyes of some gazed at me as if they were
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists were delighted to find they had beaten looters to
the scene. They estimated that the entire cemetery, extending over
two square miles, might yield 10,000 mummies. The remains will be
examined for information on what the people ate, the diseases they
suffered, causes of their deaths and estimates of life expectancy.
They should also provide important insights into the art, religion
and funerary practices of a community of affluent wine makers in
Roman Egypt.

   The arrests of more than 50 American Airlines ramp workers and

gave a whole new meaning to flying high over Miami International
Airport.

   Federal investigators were first tipped off to the alleged drug
smuggling operation when a pilot was accidentally served a
coffee-heroin mixture in flight and complained that it tasted
funny. The workers also hid drugs in cargo holds and ceiling
panels, investigators said, and used Miami as a distribution point
to the Eastern seaboard for drugs coming from Latin America.

   The California state Supreme Court dealt a bad hand to Indian
gambling tribes, ruling that a ballot measure to allow expansion of
the $1.4 billion tribal casino business violated the state
constitution's ban on Las Vegas-style slot machines and card games.
The tribes are already collecting signatures to put a
constitutional amendment on the ballot next year to exempt tribal
gambling from the ban, and are hoping to work out a compromise with
Gov. Gray Davis. But federal prosecutors have threatened to shut
down the disputed games in six weeks.

   After six years of denials, Attorney General Janet Reno conceded
that pyrotechnic tear gas canisters were used at the Branch
Davidian compound in the 1993 assault that ended with the deaths of
some 80 Davidians near Waco, Texas. While the disclosure does not
alter experts' conclusions that the fire that killed many of the
members was set by them, Reno suggested that the FBI had misled
her. She ordered another inquiry into one of the worst law
enforcement debacles of modern times.

   China has reached the final stage of its campaign against Falun
Gong by revealing plans to prosecute the spiritual movement's top
leaders, who are expected to be charged soon with subversion and
sentenced to life in prison. The authorities are singling out 50 or
more leaders for punishment, while letting ordinary followers off.
The crackdown, intended as a sign of strong Communist Party
authority, is expected to wrap up before Beijing's huge Oct. 1
celebration of the 50th anniversary of Communist China.

   As a murderer, Samuel Sheinbein of Aspen Hill, Md., was an
amateur; after killing an acquaintance in 1997, the 19-year-old
left behind a handwritten note describing the murder plot. But in
manipulating the legal systems of two countries, he seemed like a
pro, fleeing to Israel and claiming citizenship on the basis of his
father's birth in British Palestine. Sheinbein worked out a plea
bargain to serve 24 years in prison, tough by Israeli standards. In
Maryland, he would have faced life in prison without hope of
parole.

   Blocking Vouchers  &QL;

   The nation's first program to use public money to send children
to religious schools was blocked when a federal judge said there
were strong indications that the 4-year-old Cleveland program
violated the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The action _ an injunction pending a more thorough review _ came
one day before the start of school. Some 4,000 Cleveland children
were to attend 56 private schools using tuition vouchers paid for
by taxpayers. The order, watched by similar programs elsewhere, has
been appealed and the case may end up before the U.S. Supreme
Court.

   Do as They Say  &QL;

<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has said, that under her
stewardship, the Justice Department would be more worker friendly,
but lawyers at the agency have filed a lawsuit accusing the
Department of knowingly cheating them out of millions of hours of
overtime pay. Internal documents show that even as officials told
lawyers they were ineligible for overtime, top personnel managers
knew otherwise. The Department even kept two sets of books: One
set, on which paychecks were based, credited lawyers with only the
official 40-hour work week; the other precisely tracked overtime
and was used to lobby Congress for bigger budgets _ but not to pay
overtime.

   Things Change  &QL;

<P>
   Chinua Achebe, the Nigerian author whose novel ``Things Fall
Apart'' has become one of the most widely read works of African
fiction in the United States, returned to visit his native country
after a nine-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   Achebe, 69, left Nigeria, which recently inaugurated its first
civilian government in 16 years, to seek medical treatment in
America after a car accident left him paralyzed from the waist
down. Though he is not considered an exile, Achebe's arrival was
seen as a positive development in a country whose military rulers
tolerated little criticism and became international pariahs in 1995
after hanging the writer and political critic Ken Saro-Wiwa.

   The arrests of more than 50 American Airlines ramp workers and
food contract workers, on a variety of drug and weapons charges,
gave a whole new meaning to flying high over Miami International
Airport.
</P>

   Federal investigators were first tipped off to the alleged drug
smuggling operation when a pilot was accidentally served a
coffee-heroin mixture in flight and complained that it tasted
funny. The workers also hid drugs in cargo holds and ceiling
panels, investigators said, and used Miami as a distribution point
to the Eastern seaboard for drugs coming from Latin America.

   The California state Supreme Court dealt a bad hand to Indian
gambling tribes, ruling that a ballot measure to allow expansion of
the $1.4 billion tribal casino business violated the state
constitution's ban on Las Vegas-style slot machines and card games.
The tribes are already collecting signatures to put a
constitutional amendment on the ballot next year to exempt tribal
gambling from the ban, and are hoping to work out a compromise with
Gov. Gray Davis. But federal prosecutors have threatened to shut
down the disputed games in six weeks.

   After six years of denials, Attorney General Janet Reno conceded
that pyrotechnic tear gas canisters were used at the Branch
Davidian compound in the 1993 assault that ended with the deaths of
some 80 Davidians near Waco, Texas. While the disclosure does not
alter experts' conclusions that the fire that killed many of the
members was set by them, Reno suggested that the FBI had misled
her. She ordered another inquiry into one of the worst law
enforcement debacles of modern times.

   China has reached the final stage of its campaign against Falun
Gong by revealing plans to prosecute the spiritual movement's top
leaders, who are expected to be charged soon with subversion and
sentenced to life in prison. The authorities are singling out 50 or
more leaders for punishment, while letting ordinary followers off.
The crackdown, intended as a sign of strong Communist Party
authority, is expected to wrap up before Beijing's huge Oct. 1
celebration of the 50th anniversary of Communist China.

   As a murderer, Samuel Sheinbein of Aspen Hill, Md., was an
amateur; after killing an acquaintance in 1997, the 19-year-old
left behind a handwritten note describing the murder plot. But in
manipulating the legal systems of two countries, he seemed like a
pro, fleeing to Israel and claiming citizenship on the basis of his
father's birth in British Palestine. Sheinbein worked out a plea
bargain to serve 24 years in prison, tough by Israeli standards. In
Maryland, he would have faced life in prison without hope of
parole.

<P>
   The action _ an injunction pending a more thorough review _ came
one day before the start of school. Some 4,000 Cleveland children
were to attend 56 private schools using tuition vouchers paid for

been appealed and the case may end up before the U.S. Supreme

   Attorney General Janet Reno has said, that under her
stewardship, the Justice Department would be more worker friendly,
but lawyers at the agency have filed a lawsuit accusing the
Department of knowingly cheating them out of millions of hours of
overtime pay. Internal documents show that even as officials told
lawyers they were ineligible for overtime, top personnel managers
knew otherwise. The Department even kept two sets of books: One
set, on which paychecks were based, credited lawyers with only the
official 40-hour work week; the other precisely tracked overtime
and was used to lobby Congress for bigger budgets _ but not to pay
overtime.

<P>
   It has not been difficult to find Protestants who believed that
the ecumenical movement among their churches had entered a season
of winter, where new initiatives for formal cooperation among
denominations were frozen like ice in January. But that idea waned
a few days ago when the nation's largest group of Lutherans
approved an agreement for full communion with the Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which is subject to approval by the Episcopalians next
year, is no merger; each church would keep its structure and ways
of worshiping. But it is remarkable for allying two major
Protestant denominations, the 5.2 million-member Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America and the 2.4 million-member Episcopal
Church. Fully accepting each other's members and sacraments, the
two could hold joint worship services, exchange clergy members
where needed and collaborate on social service projects.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious question is why it happened. Does the Lutheran vote
simply represent something from the past, the last of the
church-to-church agreements of the 20th century? Or does it point
to a new era of formal Christian cooperation in the 21st?
</P>
<P>
   The answer could be argued either way. On one hand, the
Lutheran-Episcopalian agreement has its roots in the 1960s, a more
optimistic era for this sort of venture, when discussions between
theologians on both sides started.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are reasons to think the future could
produce more pacts of this kind, given the needs of local
congregations, pressure for cooperation from Christian groups
overseas (globalization is an important concept in religion, too)
and the desire for a common front in the face of a somewhat
aggressive secular culture.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has provided rich soil for a multitude of
religious denominations. But along with the divisions, there has
long been a push toward unity. Supporters cite the prayer of Jesus
in the Gospel of John 17:11 that all his followers ``may be one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Evangelical Lutheran Church was itself formed 11 years ago
through the merger of three smaller Lutheran denominations. In
1991, it adopted a policy to move in ``multiple directions'' toward
agreements with churches in different traditions. That policy bore
fruit in 1997, when the Lutherans' biennial Churchwide Assembly
voted for full communion with three churches in Protestantism's
Reformed tradition _ the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the United
Church of Christ and the Reformed Church in America.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lutherans narrowly rejected a pact with Episcopalians,
after a number of voting members voiced concern about a provision
requiring their denomination to embrace the Episcopalian belief
that bishops possess an unbroken line of spiritual authority
extending back to Christianity's earliest days.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was two years of debate on whether this idea gave
bishops too much power at the expense of laypeople and pastors. On
Aug. 19, as the assembly met in Denver, proponents of the agreement
won out, 69 percent to 31.
</P>
<P>
   Although the process leading to the decision was long and
complex, at least three ideas involved in it seem important for the
ecumenical movement as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense for some congregations to pool their resources
across denominational lines. Financially hard-pressed congregations
in rural areas and inner cities could share a full-time pastor as
well as collaborate on good works, making their dollars and
energies go farther.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was also spurred by international pressures, said
the Rev. Daniel Martensen, the Lutherans' chief ecumenical officer.
Many American Protestant denominations belong to global
associations of churches that share theological and historical
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal Church, for example, belongs to Worldwide Anglican
Communion. The Evangelical Lutheran Church is a member (the
second-largest) of the Lutheran World Federation, an association of
churches with a total membership of nearly 60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Attending the Denver assembly, the federation's general
secretary, the Rev. Ishmael Noko of Zimbabwe, told voting members
that although the decision on full communion was theirs, whatever
they did would be felt in ``sister churches'' worldwide. He said he
expected full communion agreements between Lutherans and Anglicans
in Africa within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, too, there is the incentive of bringing similar faiths
together in a common stand, or ``witness,'' in the face of an
increasingly secular American culture.
</P>
<P>
   This point was made by the Rev. John Thomas, president-elect of
the United Church of Christ, an observer at the assembly.
``Certainly, among Christians, there's less and less legitimacy in
our mission to cling to competitive and isolationist models,'' he
said. ``I think unity itself is a kind of witness and a kind of
mission.''

IT MAY NOT FEEL TRUE, BUT GUNSHOT DEATHS ARE DOWN

 By DAVID JOHNSTON

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The images are grisly. Gunshot victims surrounded
by paramedics rushing to waiting ambulances outside a school, a
community center, an office building. Little wonder that people
worry that a gunman with an assault weapon and a grudge could loose
a reign of terror on anyone, any time, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Such incidents reinforce a widespread myth that the number of
shooting deaths in the United States is increasing. In fact, the
number dropped to 32,436 in 1997, the latest year for which
statistics are available, from a peak of 39,595 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But highly publicized shootings, no matter how rare, can prompt
people to buy guns for self-protection, an act that, many experts
say, actually increases the likelihood that the buyer or a member
of his or her family will be shot.
</P>
<P>
   More often the carnage occurs in thousands of small tragedies
too mundane to make national headlines in a country where surveys
have indicated that half the households have at least one gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds that a home will be the scene of a homicide are
substantially greater if there is a gun in the home,'' said Dr.
Arthur Kellerman, head of emergency medicine at Emory University in
Atlanta, who led a team that studied shootings in Memphis,
Galveston and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   And those homicides will have little to do with intruders. A
number of studies have concluded that very few people with guns in
the home ever use them to resist an attacker. In one study, fewer
than two crimes in a thousand were resisted with a gun. The most
likely explanation was that few homeowners have enough warning to
arm themselves with their own weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Even law enforcement personnel who routinely carry weapons are
often inadequately prepared to handle a shooting situation, said
Philip Hayden, a retired FBI supervisor who conducted the agency's
law enforcement training for safety and survival program at the FBI
academy in Quantico, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics on gun use offer cold comfort during what seems like
a summer of high-profile terror shootings. In Atlanta in July,
disgruntled day trader Mark Barton shot and killed nine people
after murdering his wife and two children. In Los Angeles earlier
this month, Buford O. Furrow Jr., a white supremacist, opened fire
at a Jewish community center, wounding five people, and later shot
and killed a postal worker.
</P>
<P>
   But most people are not shot by anti-social loners, assassins or
even by intruders breaking into a home.
</P>
<P>
   Gun violence, experts say, is overwhelmingly dependent on a
single factor: easy access to a weapon. ``On average, the gun that
represents the greatest threat is the one that is kept loaded and
readily available in a bedside drawer,'' Kellerman said. The vast
majority of shooting victims arrive at the hospital as a result of
a trivial altercations that turned deadly because the combatants
could easily resort to weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some facts: Most people are not shot with assault weapons, but
with handguns. Most people hurt or killed by guns are not shot at
schools, offices or their workplaces. In Kellerman's 1994 study of
shootings in Galveston, Memphis and Seattle, nearly half took place
on a street or in a parking lot, and nearly a third took place in
the victim's home. Seven percent were shot in a motor vehicle and
six percent in a bar or nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Of the cases for which the researchers had information about the
relationship, if any, between the shooter and victim, more than a
third knew each other. Eight percent were gang adversaries or
romantic rivals and seven percent of the victims were shot by a
spouse, close friend or family member.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with keeping guns for protection is that it is
far more difficult to hit a target than television dramas and
movies may lead people to believe. Even police officers under the
stress of an armed encounter hit their targets with only 17 percent
of their shots, Hayden said. This is true even though most
encounters occur at a range of less than seven feet.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the high number of misses by police reflects new gun
tactics taught by law enforcement agencies in response to higher
powered weapons carried by criminals. In the past, many law
enforcement agencies told recruits to aim deliberately and shoot
once or twice. Now, they teach trainees to aim deliberately, but
shoot until the threat no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   The average police officer, Hayden said, fires only 65 rounds a
year in training, a number that is probably far more than most
civilians are likely to shoot. Practice shooting and training
exercises on computer simulators are inadequate preparation for
real situations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the FBI's training program has gone to greater
lengths to provide what experts like Hayden said was the essential
ingredient to successful firearms training _ simulated scenarios
that build in the heavy stress, confusion and fear inherent in most
shooting situations when officers' heart rates skyrocket and their
ability to think clearly and act deliberately can diminish.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden introduced the use of guns that shoot paint pellets that
sting when they hit, and realistic shooting situations involving
``armed'' suspects in scenarios drawn from actual experience.
``It's fantasy vs. reality,'' Hayden said. ``If something happens,
you say, `This is how I'll respond.' But unless you're trained,
you're not going to respond the way you think you are.''

spouse, close friend or family member.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with keeping guns for protection is that it is
far more difficult to hit a target than television dramas and
movies may lead people to believe. Even police officers under the
stress of an armed encounter hit their targets with only 17 percent
of their shots, Hayden said. This is true even though most
encounters occur at a range of less than seven feet.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the high number of misses by police reflects new gun
tactics taught by law enforcement agencies in response to higher
powered weapons carried by criminals. In the past, many law
enforcement agencies told recruits to aim deliberately and shoot
once or twice. Now, they teach trainees to aim deliberately, but
shoot until the threat no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   The average police officer, Hayden said, fires only 65 rounds a
year in training, a number that is probably far more than most
civilians are likely to shoot. Practice shooting and training
exercises on computer simulators are inadequate preparation for
real situations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the FBI's training program has gone to greater
lengths to provide what experts like Hayden said was the essential
ingredient to successful firearms training _ simulated scenarios
that build in the heavy stress, confusion and fear inherent in most
shooting situations when officers' heart rates skyrocket and their
ability to think clearly and act deliberately can diminish.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden introduced the use of guns that shoot paint pellets that
sting when they hit, and realistic shooting situations involving
``armed'' suspects in scenarios drawn from actual experience.
``It's fantasy vs. reality,'' Hayden said. ``If something happens,
you say, `This is how I'll respond.' But unless you're trained,
you're not going to respond the way you think you are.''

TAKING SECOND CHANCES: PAR FOR CLINTON'S COURSE 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton stepped up to the first tee at
Farm Neck Golf Club on Martha's Vineyard the other day and shanked
the ball into the wrong fairway. ``Aw, I killed it,'' the president
blurted to himself. ``I need help.''
</P>
<P>
   Without hesitation, Clinton fished another ball out of his
pocket, placed it on the tee and lined up a second shot.
</P>
<P>
   In golf parlance, the do-over is known as a mulligan, a benign
term for a shot not endorsed by the U.S. Golf Association. The
mulligan is common among weekend duffers, who will gladly take one
or even a handful of do-overs if their fellow players assent.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton never asked the permission of anyone in his
foursome, which included Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. Apparently
being president means never having to say double bogey. His second
shot mimicked the crooked path of the first, veering onto an
adjacent fairway. ``Aw, I did it again,'' Clinton said, stomping
toward his golf cart.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the president does it again and again and again. He
grants himself bushels of mulligans _ off the tee, usually, but
presidential mulligans have also been witnessed while Clinton was
ankle-deep in sand or lost in a thicket of evergreen trees. Clinton
jokes that he gives ``presidential pardons'' to his errant golf
balls.
</P>
<P>
   As this vacation season draws to a close, and Clinton pursues
another interlude of golf and fund-raisers, the mulligan presents
itself as the perfect metaphor for his presidency. The voters have
given the Comeback Kid more than one mulligan. Clinton was granted
a second chance by the Senate in February after the House impeached
him for his behavior in the Monica Lewinsky matter. And it can be
assumed that Hillary Rodham Clinton has given Clinton a few
mulligans too.
</P>
<P>
   Most past presidents were golf purists who wouldn't contemplate
even asking for a mulligan (the term's derivation is obscure), let
alone taking one. President George Bush apparently never took a
do-over. For him, it was more important to put the game out of its
misery; he once bragged that he raced through 18 holes in 1 hour,
42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy, probably the best golfer to occupy the White
House this century, did not need to take mulligans. Richard M.
Nixon, on the other hand, was known to kick the ball out of the
rough to give himself a better lie.
</P>
<P>
   Golf was also a defining metaphor of Dwight D. Eisenhower's
presidency. Ike spent so much time puttering around the links that
his diversion symbolized his entire era of placid postwar
prosperity and conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's game symbolizes something else. Bob Woodward's new
book, ``Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1999), states that former President Gerald R.
Ford, an avid golfer, was disgusted after watching Clinton
repeatedly take mulligans during a round in Colorado in 1993. After
playing 18 holes with Ford and pro golf great Jack Nicklaus,
Clinton told reporters he had shot an 80.
</P>
<P>
   This claim apparently infuriated Ford and Nicklaus. Woodward
writes: ``Nicklaus leaned over to Ford and whispered in disgust,
`Eighty with 50 floating mulligans.'''
</P>
<P>
   A golfer who routinely takes mulligans is rarely taxed by the
game's cruelties. A handicap aided by second chances allows the
golfer to maintain an optimistic outlook on life. On the other
hand, one who never takes mulligans cannot help brooding about the
game's harshness and unfairness.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bob Dole, who does not play golf, attempted to
transform the mulligan into an issue during the waning days of his
losing presidential campaign in 1996. ``I don't know whether he
shot an 83 or a 283 or a 483,'' Dole growled in response to the
president's claim that he shot an 83 in Albuquerque, N.M. ``You'll
never really know.''
</P>
<P>
   On a glorious spring day in May, Clinton appeared incapable of
getting the kinks out of his swing on the first tee at the Andrew
Air Force Base course. He took one mulligan. Then another. And then
another. Each shot was spectacularly ugly, zig-zagging this way and
that. Finally, the president was satisfied with his fourth shot,
which managed to land in the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bedard, a writer with U.S. News &AMP; World Report who
witnessed the flurry of mulligans, called it ``the highest-ever
number of cheater's shots the First Duffer has taken before
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the first tee there are few witnesses. Reporters,
armed with scorecards and little pencils, are forbidden from
following the presidential foursome around the course. Thus, even
though Clinton is far along the back nine of his presidency, it has
been almost impossible to document how many mulligans he takes
during any single round.
</P>
<P>
   Terence McAuliffe, a friend and frequent golfing partner of
Clinton, vouched for the president's claim that he grants
presidential pardons only to balls hit from the first tee. ``And
only rarely,'' he added. McAuliffe said his matches with the
president are far too competitive for either one of them to indulge
in a multitude of mulligans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dogfight out there,'' he said. ``He is as competitive
about golf as he is about life. He doesn't like to lose, and
neither do I. Neither one of us will give the other guy a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such assurances, cynics in the gallery continue to
believe that the president's scores _ he claims to shoot around 80
and as low as 75 _ are enhanced by at least a half-dozen mulligans.
Sure, the president is a pretty good golfer, the cynics say. He's
just not  &UR; that &LR;  good.
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism is, of course, understandable. Clinton, after all,
claimed that he did not inhale, and that he did not have sexual
relations with that woman. Why wouldn't the president also put the
spin on his golf score?

   Rick Reilly, a senior writer for Sports Illustrated who played
with the president in 1996, recalled that Clinton took just one
mulligan at the Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Md., before
carding an impressive 82. ``He hit a lot of mad balls _ he'd chunk
one, or skull one, and he'd get mad and hit another shot, but then
he'd always play the first bad shot,'' said Reilly. ``He had a
reporter and a photographer with him, so he was really on his best
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   During his Martha's Vineyard vacation in August 1997, Clinton
hammered three straight tee shots into the woods near the first
fairway. Afterward, White House press secretary Mike McCurry
dutifully reported that the president had carded a seven-over-par
79. Journalists were aghast. They immediately demanded to know how
many mulligans the president had taken.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry, as they say, ``declined to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, John Omicinski, a commentator for the Gannett News
Service, admonished, ``In golf, as in life, he's got to learn to
take his punishment and learn from his mistakes, rather than
covering them up.'' That was five months before the world was
introduced to Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Clinton presented the Medal of Freedom to Jimmy
Carter and his wife, Rosalynn. Carter seized the opportunity to
inform Clinton about what to expect after he leaves the White House
in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be able to play golf without any telephoto lens
focusing on your stroke,'' Carter, a non-golfer, told the
president. ``But there is a downside: I understand golfing partners
don't give as many mulligans'' to ex-presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton smiled, but it was a slightly pained smile. Before long,
he will have to relinquish his job and all its privileges.

FEARFUL OVER THE FUTURE, EUROPE SEIZES ON FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PARIS _ Fist raised, mustache bristling, Jose Bove looked
defiant as he handed himself in to French police in the southern
town of Montpelier a few days ago. ``My struggle remains the
same,'' this farmer declared to an appreciative crowd, ``the battle
against globalization and for the right of people to feed
themselves as they choose.''
</P>
<P>
   A Parisian-turned-sheep-farmer who moved to southwestern France
20 years ago, Bove emerged this month as a sort of Subcomandante
Marcos of the French countryside, the leader of a self-styled,
anti-imperialist revolt over food. His crime, committed Aug. 12,
was to lead the ransacking and demolition of a McDonald's
restaurant nearing completion in the southwestern town of Millau.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the most conspicuous of a rash of recent protests
against McDonald's, targeted not so much for anything the company
has done but as a symbol of the United States and of what Bove has
called ``the multinationals of foul food.'' His efforts have struck
a chord. French labor unions, ecologists, Communists and farmers
have joined to demand his immediate release, burying other
differences in a shared politico-gastronomic outcry.
</P>
<P>
   An army, Napoleon noted, marches on its stomach, and the
European forces gathering this summer in protest against what is
seen as American-led globalization have abruptly focused on food.
Where it was once the deployment of U.S. nuclear missiles that
caused alarm, it is now McDonald's, Coca-Cola, genetically modified
American corn and American beef fattened with growth hormones that
have Europeans up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind all this lies a rejection of cultural and culinary
dispossession,'' said Alain Duhamel, a French political analyst.
``There is a certain allergy in Europe to the extent of American
power accumulated since the Cold War's end, and the most virulent
expression of that allergy today seems to be food.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not just culture or the kitchen that is at
stake. Enormous economic interests are also involved. Large
quantities of American corn and soybeans, to name just two crops,
have been genetically modified over the years _ that is, rendered
more productive, more hardy, less vulnerable to fungal and viral
pests through scientific alteration, including the addition of
genes.
</P>
<P>
   No discernible harm to Americans has occurred. But if Europe and
possibly other parts of the world reject or ban such products, the
economic consequences may be measured in the billions of dollars.
Already, a federal judge in Brazil has banned sales of Monsanto
Corp,'s Roundup Ready soybean seeds _ gene-altered to resist fungus
and weeds _ and Japan has announced that it will require labels on
genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe seems to be gripped right now by a kind of collective
madness, and we don't want that to spread to the rest of the
world,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the head of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, who was in Germany this month. ``In the
United States, we have not seen a scintilla of ill effects, and on
my farm alone we've been modifying corn and soybeans since the
1930s, raising productivity by a factor of three.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the ``madness'' several factors appear to lurk. The
specter of nature being rendered more uniform by scientists in
America has meshed with a wider fear of an increasingly
undifferentiated planet where national distinctions fade. Europeans
see on the horizon a uniform, global culinary culture dominated by
multinationals _ a Hollywood of the kitchen drowning any European
distinctiveness with sheer marketing muscle.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a rash of health scares _ including the
outbreak of mad cow disease in Britain in 1996, and the discovery
this year of dioxin-polluted chicken in Belgium _ has provoked
widespread fear of any tampering with nature. This mood clearly
lies behind Europe's refusal to drop a ban on American beef raised
with growth hormones _ a decision that prompted the United States
last month to impose a 100 percent tariff on some European food
products, including Roquefort and foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   That U.S. decision _ targeting foods that nestle very close to
the prickly French soul _ added fuel to a fire already raging.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks or complaints directed at American food and beverages
have been almost constant lately as American marketers move to
exploit what they see as an underserved European market. The
reasons for the attacks have differed, but not the common thread of
an American target.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, still reeling from the effects of a poorly handled
health scare that saw supposedly contaminated drinks removed from
shelves in Belgium and France, is now the object of a European
Commission investigation that involved dawn raids on offices in
Germany, Britain, Austria and Denmark last month. The company is
suspected of abusing a dominant market position to damage its
competitors. In Italy, where Coke has an 80 percent share of the
cola market, a separate national investigation was begun this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no anti-American conspiracy here,'' said Stefan
Rating, a spokesman for Europe's competition and antitrust policy
regulators in Brussels. ``That Coke is American is undisputed, but
not unlawful. What we are looking into are possible abuses.'' Coke
denies any wrongdoing, and is known to be piqued by the extent and
repetitiveness of its recent European travails.
</P>
<P>
   This month in Belgium, a McDonald's near Antwerp was destroyed,
the latest of several attacks, and a number of McDonald's
restaurants in France have had rotting fruit and vegetables dumped
on them since the Clinton administration's decision to apply
punitive duties to French products.

</P>
<P>
   It was only the most conspicuous of a rash of recent protests
against McDonald's, targeted not so much for anything the company
has done but as a symbol of the United States and of what Bove has
called ``the multinationals of foul food.'' His efforts have struck
a chord. French labor unions, ecologists, Communists and farmers
have joined to demand his immediate release, burying other
differences in a shared politico-gastronomic outcry.
</P>
<P>
   An army, Napoleon noted, marches on its stomach, and the
European forces gathering this summer in protest against what is
seen as American-led globalization have abruptly focused on food.
Where it was once the deployment of U.S. nuclear missiles that
caused alarm, it is now McDonald's, Coca-Cola, genetically modified
American corn and American beef fattened with growth hormones that
have Europeans up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind all this lies a rejection of cultural and culinary
dispossession,'' said Alain Duhamel, a French political analyst.
``There is a certain allergy in Europe to the extent of American
power accumulated since the Cold War's end, and the most virulent
expression of that allergy today seems to be food.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not just culture or the kitchen that is at
stake. Enormous economic interests are also involved. Large
quantities of American corn and soybeans, to name just two crops,
have been genetically modified over the years _ that is, rendered
more productive, more hardy, less vulnerable to fungal and viral
pests through scientific alteration, including the addition of
genes.
</P>
<P>
   No discernible harm to Americans has occurred. But if Europe and
possibly other parts of the world reject or ban such products, the
economic consequences may be measured in the billions of dollars.
Already, a federal judge in Brazil has banned sales of Monsanto
Corp,'s Roundup Ready soybean seeds _ gene-altered to resist fungus
and weeds _ and Japan has announced that it will require labels on
genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe seems to be gripped right now by a kind of collective
madness, and we don't want that to spread to the rest of the
world,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the head of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, who was in Germany this month. ``In the
United States, we have not seen a scintilla of ill effects, and on
my farm alone we've been modifying corn and soybeans since the
1930s, raising productivity by a factor of three.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the ``madness'' several factors appear to lurk. The
specter of nature being rendered more uniform by scientists in
America has meshed with a wider fear of an increasingly
undifferentiated planet where national distinctions fade. Europeans
see on the horizon a uniform, global culinary culture dominated by
multinationals _ a Hollywood of the kitchen drowning any European
distinctiveness with sheer marketing muscle.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a rash of health scares _ including the
outbreak of mad cow disease in Britain in 1996, and the discovery
this year of dioxin-polluted chicken in Belgium _ has provoked
widespread fear of any tampering with nature. This mood clearly
lies behind Europe's refusal to drop a ban on American beef raised
with growth hormones _ a decision that prompted the United States
last month to impose a 100 percent tariff on some European food
products, including Roquefort and foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   That U.S. decision _ targeting foods that nestle very close to
the prickly French soul _ added fuel to a fire already raging.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks or complaints directed at American food and beverages
have been almost constant lately as American marketers move to
exploit what they see as an underserved European market. The
reasons for the attacks have differed, but not the common thread of
an American target.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, still reeling from the effects of a poorly handled
health scare that saw supposedly contaminated drinks removed from
shelves in Belgium and France, is now the object of a European
Commission investigation that involved dawn raids on offices in
Germany, Britain, Austria and Denmark last month. The company is
suspected of abusing a dominant market position to damage its
competitors. In Italy, where Coke has an 80 percent share of the
cola market, a separate national investigation was begun this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no anti-American conspiracy here,'' said Stefan
Rating, a spokesman for Europe's competition and antitrust policy
regulators in Brussels. ``That Coke is American is undisputed, but
not unlawful. What we are looking into are possible abuses.'' Coke
denies any wrongdoing, and is known to be piqued by the extent and
repetitiveness of its recent European travails.
</P>
<P>
   This month in Belgium, a McDonald's near Antwerp was destroyed,
the latest of several attacks, and a number of McDonald's
restaurants in France have had rotting fruit and vegetables dumped
on them since the Clinton administration's decision to apply
punitive duties to French products.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We are attacked because we are a No. 1 global American
brand,'' said Alessandra di Montezemolo, a McDonald's spokeswoman
in Europe. ``But people should understand we are local partners in
the national economies.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's, which operates 750 restaurants in France, tried to
calm protests there by issuing a statement saying that ``80 percent
of the products we serve are made in France,'' adding that they
were ``cooked by local employees.''
</P>
<P>
   But la France profonde _ the heartland of the imprisoned Bove _
was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Culinary sovereignty is imperative,'' said Patrice Vidieu, the
secretary-general of Peasant Confederation, the growing farmers'
movement founded by Bove in 1987. ``What we reject is the idea that
the power of the marketplace becomes the dominant force in all
societies, and that multinationals like McDonald's or Monsanto come
to impose the food we eat and the seeds we plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Vidieu's movement derives much of its intellectual inspiration
and direction from Attac, an association founded last year in
France to fight globalization and to campaign for a tax on
international financial transactions that would be used to help the
world's poor and fight social inequality. Among the leaders of
Attac (the French acronym for the Association for Taxation of
Financial Transactions in Order to Aid Citizens) are Viviane
Forrestier, whose anti-globalization book ``The Economic Horror''
has had enormous sales in France, and editors of the prestigious Le
Monde Diplomatique.
</P>
<P>
   It is this merging of militants against global finance and
global food that has given the current outcry some of its curious
virulence. Lugar, who would like to see scientific testing of
genetically modified crops in Europe, confessed to being amazed.
His argument is simple. The population of the world will probably
grow to 9 billion from 6 billion by 2050. Available acreage for
planting has already been identified. So, unless food productivity
is increased _ which will not happen without scientific
intervention _ people are going to go hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans think they are protecting humanity,'' he said,
``but we think they want to starve the rest of the world. These are
big issues. I've been telling the Europeans that there's a big
difference between the Kosovo war and genetically modified corn:
For many Americans corn is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   But Philippe Folliot, the mayor of a St. Pierre-de-Trivisy, a
small town in the Roquefort-growing area, is unimpressed by such
arguments. He has imposed a symbolic 100 percent tax on Coca-Cola
sold in the town. ``Here we cannot make plastic cheeses and hormone
beef,'' he said. ``Roquefort is unique, a symbol of our battle
against the globalization of taste.''

IN SWISSAIR DISASTER, NEW TECHNOLOGY BRINGS NEW LAYERS OF GRIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In hindsight, finding the remains of the 229 people
who perished when a Swissair jet crashed a year ago and retrieving
them from the ocean floor off Canada's Atlantic coast may have been
the simple part.
</P>
<P>
   The harder part was deciding how to handle 23 coffins that will
be buried this week, mostly filled with remains so small they have
not been identified. Only in the last few weeks have Nova Scotia
officials and religious leaders of several faiths agreed on a
solution: a mass burial and funeral rites to mark the anniversary
of the Sept. 2 crash.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the families support the decision, but the wrangling
over how much effort should have been devoted to identification and
how best to remember the dead illustrates the difficulty of meeting
the needs of people who in many cases have little in common besides
their grief.
</P>
<P>
   To some people involved in the investigation, it was also a case
of technology creating possibilities and problems faster than
ethics, religion or the human heart could deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Swissair McDonnell Douglas MD-11 caught fire in flight, for
reasons not yet determined, and virtually disintegrated when it hit
the water some 40 miles south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Yet because
of modern engineering and science, including what Canadian
officials say is the largest use of DNA testing thus far, about 90
percent of the recovered remains were identified. The family of
every victim was given at least a fragment to honor in individual
ceremonies, as their feelings or religious traditions dictated.
</P>
<P>
   But in at least five cases, families held funerals and then got
another call from the medical examiner's office saying that more
pieces of their relatives had been identified. Some families said
they could not face it; as a result, some of what will be going
into the mass grave has been identified.
</P>
<P>
   So thousands of fragments _ some 2,300 pounds of flesh and bone
_ are still in Halifax. Burial has been complicated in part by the
conflicting traditions and rites of the many faiths represented on
Flight 111, bound from New York's Kennedy International Airport to
Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   DNA analysis could probably be used to identify virtually all
the fragments, and there was considerable pressure to do just that.
In this crash and that of TWA Flight 800 off New York's Long Island
three years ago, searchers have gone to heroic lengths to recover
every scrap of the airplane and the people on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capacity to do extraordinary things,'' said John
O'Donnell, the director of administration at the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Halifax, reflecting on the DNA analysis and marine
salvage technology. ``Then there's this relentless, inevitable
trudging on to complete things as fully as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nova Scotia Medical Examiner John Butt said that with divers
recovering fragments by the thousands, he had to draw the line well
short of analyzing everything. Otherwise, he said, the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police would have faced a backlog of cases and
been unable to solve rapes and murders or to identify victims of
other crashes and crimes. And burial of the Swissair remains could
have been delayed for years.
</P>
<P>
   Most families supported Butt's decision to stop the DNA testing,
but some families were distraught.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's disgraceful that there was no further attempt to
identify the remains,'' said Barbara Featherolf of Haverford, Pa.,
whose 16-year-old daughter Tara was on the flight. Ms. Featherolf
hired a lawyer to push for more DNA analysis; she argued that only
money was at issue, and that Swissair should pay.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the mass burial have created problems, too. O'Donnell
helped design a service with a committee of Anglican, Muslim, Greek
Orthodox, Presbyterian and Jewish clergy members, whose burial
rites are often incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Romano, of Goldens Bridge, N.Y., whose husband, Ray, was on
the plane, called the mass burial plan ``an atrocity.''
</P>
<P>
   All that is needed to identify more of the remains is ``time and
money,'' she said, and Swissair has a moral obligation to help do
the work.
</P>
<P>
   Butt said there was no Canadian law to guide him in deciding
when to cease identification, but he did find one relevant
religious rule. Rabbis advising him said the Talmud, which predates
the discovery of DNA by more than 1,000 years, specifies that body
fragments too small for their source in the body to be determined
do not have to be linked to a specific person.
</P>
<P>
   Butt drew a similar line at human remains too small to identify
anatomically, but he said, ``Moral issues are tough to deal with in
the law, and tough to deal with administratively.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not unique to Halifax. The Armed Forces Institute
of Pathology in Bethesda, Md., intermittently receives shipments of
100 or 200 fragments of bone from 30-year-old plane wrecks in
Vietnam, often involving cases where the records indicate there
were two crewmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do DNA on the first 15 or 20 pieces, and it indicates
they're all from the same person,'' said Lt. Col. Brion Smith, the
chief deputy medical examiner. ``So you do another 15 or 20, and
it's still from one person. How long do you keep on going, using
your resources, to look for that second person who may not be
there?''
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the Swissair crash added to the problems in
Halifax. Unlike the TWA Flight 800 crash, which also occurred at
sea, the Swissair crash caused extensive fragmentation. The TWA
plane, a Boeing 747, broke up in flight. While many bodies were
mangled, they remained mostly intact because of the speed and angle
at which the plane entered the water, according to people involved
in the accident investigation. Frank Carven, a vice president of
the Families of the TWA Flight 800 Association, said that as a
result the recovery of unidentified body parts was less of an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the crash of a USAir 737 near Pittsburgh in 1994, which also
involved virtual disintegration, the airline buried several coffins
of mixed parts without notifying the families. The incident was one
reason that Congress put the National Transportation Safety Board
in charge of coordinating the treatment of families in crashes in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   In Halifax, Butt used fingerprints, jewelry, dental records and
tattoos to identify many body fragments and then DNA to match other
fragments to them. More than 100 people were identified by DNA
alone, and about 1,400 body fragments were analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell of the archdiocese said many Christians assumed that
the remains would be cremated, but the Muslim and Jewish clergy
members objected. ``I backed off,'' he said. ``We have to do this
in a way to respect as many people as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffins were another issue. Jewish tradition is to use only
wood, unadorned and without nails. Such coffins eventually
deteriorate. Nova Scotia officials insisted on metal coffins that
could be exhumed later if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Several memorial events will be held in Halifax this week,
including one in which relatives can meet the people who aided in
the recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But it will not end there. The Transportation Safety Board of
Canada, still investigating the crash, plans to carry out several
more days of dredging, looking for more pieces of the cockpit.
That, Butt expects, will turn up more remains.

   The Smithsonian Institution in Washington last week canceled a
celebration of foie gras, a delicacy produced by the forced feeding

BROWNFIELDS: RETHINKING THE CLEANUP RULES FOR POLLUTED SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Environmental activist Aaron Maier surveyed the
abandoned industrial plant that blights his poor neighborhood here
on the banks of the Hudson River. The lot, vacant but for an
abandoned factory building, was overrun by weeds, and the soil was
soaked with toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, he would have called for the standard
environmentalist's prescription: Clean up the property thoroughly,
no matter what the cost to business or government. But today, Maier
is convinced that that approach has frightened off potential
developers and left old industrial tracts like the one here
orphaned. He believes it would be easier to attract a developer if
the law didn't require that the land be cleaned to a pristine
condition, but rather just enough for another industrial plant.
</P>
<P>
   His conversion may sound like heresy to some environmentalists,
but it is easy enough to explain. Like many civic leaders in poor,
largely minority communities across the country, Maier has
concluded that decades of aggressive environmental policy have
failed to solve pollution problems and have contributed to economic
woes.
</P>
<P>
   So Maier, who is black, and some other minority leaders from
poor urban communities have found themselves in an unexpected
alliance with big business as part of a national push by business
interests to ease the cleanup standards for pollution-blighted
properties commonly referred to as brownfields.
</P>
<P>
   This new approach has created something of a crisis for
environmentalists. For two decades, they have courted black and
Hispanic leaders under the banner of ``environmental justice,'' a
movement rooted in the notion that poor communities are burdened
with an unfair share of polluted properties.
</P>
<P>
   But many minority leaders are now saying that while they are
still committed to safeguarding the environment, that objective
should not be achieved at the expense of economic opportunities for
poor urban neighborhoods. They point out that in many poor
neighborhoods, brownfields are neither cleaned up nor put to
productive use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goals should be to promote economic development in these
communities while protecting the environment,'' said Vernice Miller
Travis, a former resident of New York City's Harlem who used to
head the Environmental Justice Initiative at the Environmental
Resources Defense Council. ``Those two concepts are not
diametrically opposed. But it requires some different thinking than
what we are used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are about 450,000 brownfields with varying
levels of contamination, according to private and public estimates.
Roughly three dozen states, including New Jersey, Connecticut and
Massachusetts, have adopted new regulations to expedite the cleanup
of such sites as long as they are not deemed so dangerous that they
require extensive work under either state or federal Superfund
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But strict cleanup laws adopted during the 1980s in the wake of
Love Canal still exist in other states, including New York and
California. Environmentalists have argued that abandoned industrial
properties should be cleaned to a relatively high standard, and
that the current owners should pay for the cleanup, even if they
did not cause the pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But business leaders counter that a high cleanup standard is
unnecessary in many cases, particularly when a brownfield will be
used for a factory and not for, say, a home or playground. More
than that, though, they say that holding property owners
responsible for cleanup costs has led many potential investors to
shun brownfields and look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Bruder is one of those investors. His company, the Brookhill
Group, redevelops roughly 35 brownfields a year across the country,
constructing shopping malls, office buildings and the like. But he
has avoided states like New York, where, he says, environmental
laws discourage brownfield use. ``We'd love to do something in New
York,'' he said. But the economics and the legislation don't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Partnership, a business group, has been
pushing to relax the cleanup standards in New York. ``If you set up
cleanup standards that are unachievable, you end up in a no-man's
land, and that's not good for anybody,'' said Jody Kass, an
environmental expert with the group.
</P>
<P>
   Even the staunchest environmentalists concede that more must be
done to help poor urban communities clean up and re-develop
brownfields. But the answer, they insist, is not to do away with
current cleanup standards, particularly those intended to insure
that the most dangerously polluted sites are cleaned up, no matter
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brodsky, a Democrat who is chairman of the New York
state Assembly's Environmental Committee, says he is disturbed that
poor communities are being asked to surrender environmental
protections in exchange for the promise of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that business leaders are using the notion of
redeveloping polluted inner-city sites as a way of gutting existing
public health standards for all sites, now matter how dangerous
they are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a way to redevelop minority inner-city
communities,'' he added, ``or it could turn into a way to re-poison
minority inner-city communities. The jury is still out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maier, the environmental activist from Albany, says the
failures of current environmental policy are etched all over the
bleak and empty industrial landscape of his neighborhood. He
believes a change is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not talking about surrendering,'' Maier said. ``I am
talking about an honest appraisal of what can be done. Urban
environmentalists like myself have been forced to rethink the old
polices that have left the inner cities behind.''

   Ron Bruder is one of those investors. His company, the Brookhill
Group, redevelops roughly 35 brownfields a year across the country,
constructing shopping malls, office buildings and the like. But he
has avoided states like New York, where, he says, environmental
laws discourage brownfield use. ``We'd love to do something in New
York,'' he said. But the economics and the legislation don't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Partnership, a business group, has been
pushing to relax the cleanup standards in New York. ``If you set up
cleanup standards that are unachievable, you end up in a no-man's
land, and that's not good for anybody,'' said Jody Kass, an
environmental expert with the group.
</P>
<P>
   Even the staunchest environmentalists concede that more must be
done to help poor urban communities clean up and re-develop
brownfields. But the answer, they insist, is not to do away with
current cleanup standards, particularly those intended to insure
that the most dangerously polluted sites are cleaned up, no matter
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brodsky, a Democrat who is chairman of the New York
state Assembly's Environmental Committee, says he is disturbed that
poor communities are being asked to surrender environmental
protections in exchange for the promise of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that business leaders are using the notion of
redeveloping polluted inner-city sites as a way of gutting existing
public health standards for all sites, now matter how dangerous
they are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a way to redevelop minority inner-city
communities,'' he added, ``or it could turn into a way to re-poison
minority inner-city communities. The jury is still out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maier, the environmental activist from Albany, says the
failures of current environmental policy are etched all over the
bleak and empty industrial landscape of his neighborhood. He
believes a change is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not talking about surrendering,'' Maier said. ``I am
talking about an honest appraisal of what can be done. Urban
environmentalists like myself have been forced to rethink the old
polices that have left the inner cities behind.''

   WASHINGTON _ Toward the end of every year, millions of Americans
go on medical shopping sprees. They get their teeth cleaned and
their eyes checked. They buy designer eyeglasses, orthopedic shoes
and long-term supplies of birth-control pills. Some even make extra
appointments with their analysts.
</P>
<P>
   These people are taking advantage of a tax break called flexible
spending accounts that hardly anyone believes is good public
policy. While the government's goal is to hold down medical costs,
this part of the tax law encourages extra medical spending.
</P>
<P>
   There are probably dozens of other such laws on the books _ laws
that may have been enacted with the best of intentions but that
turned out to work at cross-purposes with government policy.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Butler at the Heritage Foundation says, for example, that
it makes no sense for buildings across the country to remain
dilapidated because the historic preservation law makes it too
costly to restore them.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hevener, a tax lawyer, says nothing could be more absurd
than tax-subsidized parking, which encourages commuters to drive,
thus consuming fuel and worsening pollution.
</P>
<P>
   John Frydenlund at Citizens Against Government Waste believes
the most ridiculous laws are the federal subsidies for the domestic
sugar, peanut and dairy industries, which cost Americans billions
of dollars in higher food prices.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those is a candidate for a list of laws with unintended
consequences that outweigh whatever benefits exist. But here are
one reporter's favorites:
</P>
<P>
   FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS. Since 1984, the tax law has allowed
employers to offer these accounts to workers. More than 50,000
employers, including almost all large companies and many states and
municipalities, offer the benefit to more than 6 million workers.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the year, employees declare how much money
they want withheld from their pay to cover out-of-pocket medical
expenses _ not just insurance deductibles and copayments but also
expenses not covered by insurance. Since the workers do not pay
federal or state income or payroll taxes on this money, they can in
effect save 30 to 50 percent on their medical expenses. The richer
they are, the more they save.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that at the end of the year they must forfeit to
their boss all the money in their account that has not been spent.
This use-it-or-lose-it aspect leads participants to go on spending
binges at the end of every year to clean out their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Employers Council on Flexible Spending, the lobby behind the
law, would like to eliminate the use-it-or-lose-it rule, but that
would cost more than politicians are willing to allocate. Others
would like to abolish the accounts altogether on the ground that
people who are well off and work for large employers should not get
a tax benefit unavailable to those who are less affluent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two words by which you can characterize this _
venal and stupid,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a health-care economist at
Princeton. He has such an account himself, and last December, he
discovered he had money left in it. So he and his wife went to the
doctor on Christmas Eve and got colonoscopies.
</P>
<P>
   FLOOD INSURANCE. The original idea was to give subsidized
insurance to people in areas that often flooded. In return, the
communities were required to enact strict controls on land use and
building codes that would reduce the likelihood of flood damage.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, this has worked. But in many others, a study by
the National Wildlife Federation found, the availability of
inexpensive insurance ``encourages development and rebuilding in
areas with a predictably high risk of future catastrophic loss.''
The federation found 32,000 insured properties in 300 communities
that had been flooded and repaired at least twice. A house in
Houston worth about $100,000 was flooded 16 times, with $800,000 in
insurable repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Pasterick, a spokesman for the Federal Insurance
Administration, said it was a ``misperception'' that cheap
insurance led people to build in flood-prone locales. But he
conceded that federally subsidized premiums on new structures
averaged less than 40 percent of what private insurance would cost.
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. When Congress created the Consumer Product
Safety Commission in 1972, the law specified that the new agency's
mission was ``to assist consumers in evaluating the comparative
safety of consumer products.'' But the law added a zinger. It
prohibited the agency from making public any consumer complaint
about a product without first getting permission from the
manufacturer. It is the only regulatory agency that has such a
restriction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows companies to control the information flow,'' said
Ann Brown, the head of the commission. ``Those who ought to control
the flow are consumers. Our hands are tied.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said that, in fact, only a handful of
companies take advantage of their ability to block publicity. Which
companies are those?
</P>
<P>
   It is against the law, the officials said, for them to reveal
that information.

AS GOLD PRICES FALL, THE CACHET PREVAILS

<P>
   As the price of gold hits a 20-year low, diehard gold bugs and
others are rushing in to buy the precious metal as a hedge against
the day the bear wakes from his prolonged hibernation on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always advise our clients to invest a portion of their
portfolios in gold-related investments because gold is a contrarian
investment in that it has a negative correlation to stocks and
bonds,'' said Harry Bingham, president of Van Eck Institutional
Advisers in New York City, which has been urging clients to take
advantage of declining prices.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine for those dabbling in bullion or gold futures, but
what about the rest of America? Haven't the collective contents of
jewelry boxes taken a nose dive? The price an ounce has slid 11
percent since January alone. Wouldn't people be better off buying
Beanie Babies than bracelets and belly rings?
</P>
<P>
   The market value for gold has been declining for several years
as global economies have collapsed and central banks have sold off
tons of bullion in a time of low inflation. The Bank of England,
the latest to sell, in July unloaded 25 tons of 415 tons it plans
to sell to raise money to invest in U.S., European and Japanese
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Gold once traded for nearly $500 an ounce, but the influx of
bullion on the market has depressed the price to about $255 an
ounce from $325 a year ago. Mine operators in South Africa and
elsewhere have shut down or laid off workers.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, consumers' demand for gold is at an all-time
high. U.S. retail sales last year increased more than 8 percent to
$13.7 billion, according to the World Gold Council, which
represents the seventh consecutive year of revenue increases.
</P>
<P>
   Synonymous with status and self-expression for millenniums,
adorning the heads of royalty, the fingers of newlyweds and the
necks of fashion victims, gold historically rises and falls in
cycles like the stock market. When it comes to the price of jewelry
relative to gold values, consumers are ``just oblivious,'' said
Judith Langer, president of Langer Associates, a market research
and trend consulting firm in New York City. ``It's sort of like
fur. When fur becomes less expensive, consumers consider it an
affordable status symbol rather than thinking it's cheap and,
therefore, worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   Although jewelry accounts for 80 percent of the gold demand
worldwide, consumers won't see any devaluation soon. Retail prices
can take up to six months to reflect market fluctuations; merchants
may take that long to sell off their old inventories. This year's
holiday sale prices may be very low because retailers are
restocking at cheaper rates.
</P>
<P>
   But all that glitters is not not marked down. Craftsmanship
counts. ``It's kind of like weighing an Escada silk blouse and
saying `how much silk is in it,''' said Mark Seelig, vice president
of sales for Ourafin Llc., a large gold jewelry manufacturer and
importer.
</P>
<P>
   As an investment, ``gold is insurance against economic,
financial and political uncertainty,'' said Richard Scott Ram,
chief portfolio strategist at the World Gold Council, who has been
advising pension fund managers to include more gold as a part of a
diverse portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, though, sees much value in purchasing gold for
more than its snob appeal. ``If somebody wants to have precious
metals in their portfolio, we want them to keep it at a small
portion,'' said Ray Russolillo, director of personal financial
services for PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``One of the big reasons is
there is no current income generated from it, there is often a cost
to holding the metal and typically it has been a long-term hedge
against inflation.'' Russolillo prefers cushions that are more
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over whether gold and gold futures are an investment
bargain these days may make stimulating conversation on the
cocktail circuit, but jewelry lovers, it seems, have little sense
of what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the research we've done about who knows about the gold
price, 15 percent state that they knew what the price was,'' said
Anne DiNuzzo, jewelry manager for the World Gold Council, ``and
half that 15 percent were wrong.''

TURKISH QUAKE'S SECRET ACCOMPLICE: CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ It is common to refer to earthquakes as
natural disasters, but the one that took thousands of lives in
Turkey this month was more than that. Many of the victims would
have survived if their homes had been built in accordance with
basic safety standards. Instead they were built with cheap
materials by contractors who had learned they could make up in
corruption what they lacked in skill and experience.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is home to some of the world's most respected
construction companies, which have built hotels, airports and
housing projects not only here but across Asia, North Africa and
the former Soviet Union. The earthquake showed, however, that there
are also many ignorant and unscrupulous contractors. They have made
their way to success through bribery and other forms of dishonesty,
and the system that brought them wealth must now share the blame
for the tragedy that has brought Turkey to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption in Turkey is not as pervasive as it is in many nearby
countries. Government jobs are not for sale to the highest bidder,
as they are in Azerbaijan. Teachers and doctors do not demand
payoffs for their services, as they do in Georgia. Theft is still
uncommon, and there have been remarkably few cases of looting in
the aftermath of the quake. This reflects a culture in which
murderers are sometimes esteemed because they are presumed to have
acted in defense of family honor, while thieves are despised for
violating one of God's most elemental laws.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the kind of corruption that has crippled
many nations' development efforts has begun to take hold in Turkey.
It is a trend this country will have to confront and reverse if it
hopes to join the European Union and become a fully trusted partner
of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey was for years an inward-looking country where foreign
travel was discouraged, possession of many imported items was a
crime and private enterprise was choked by a host of regulations.
These restrictions effectively cut Turkey off from the world, but
they also insulated the country against worldwide trends like
corruption. National leaders valued propriety above economic
growth, and most ordinary people followed their example.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed in the mid 1980s with the emergence of Turgut
Ozal, a giant political figure who proved to be the most
revolutionary leader Turkey had seen since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk
half a century before. As prime minister and later as president,
Ozal flung open doors and windows that had been tightly shut for
decades, freeing what proved to be the enormous energies of Turkish
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   It was a profoundly important step, and it brought Turkey into
the international mainstream in a very short time. But as Ozal
urged Turks to free themselves from the outmoded rules that had
held them back for so long, he also seemed to send a subtle message
that rules in general were bad. Some ambitious Turks understood him
to say that getting rich was such an important and wonderful goal
that it didn't matter how one accomplished it.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of business could an unschooled and capital-poor Turk
launch to propel him on the road to wealth? Thousands chose to
start construction companies, relying on the help of friends in
local politics to win contracts. In a wide-open economy that was
growing at an astonishing rate, many of these contractors quickly
became rich.
</P>
<P>
   The price that society paid for their rise to wealth became
tragically clear when this month's earthquake struck. The
contractors had built countless apartment blocks with sandy
concrete and reinforcing rods far too weak to withstand the forces
of nature that regularly shake the country.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the blame must be apportioned to a social system in
which everything is negotiable and friends always help each other.
If a mayor or other public official has a friend or relative who
owns a construction company, tradition dictates that they make some
arrangement so both can prosper. To allow such deals to founder
simply because the contractor lacks capital or experience or
training would seem hard-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   In the days following the earthquake, furious survivors sought
to lynch several contractors who had made careers of building poor
housing that collapsed like cards when the ground began to shake.
But the contractors, realizing that they would become targets, had
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors are not the only guilty parties. Buyers of homes
are also complicit in the system that led to the unnecessary deaths
of so many people. Turkey has suffered great social dislocation
over the last two decades, with millions of migrants streaming out
of the impoverished and war-torn southeast to prosperous western
towns. Many were eager to buy new apartments for $15,000 or less,
and didn't worry about safety. Inspectors were never around to
spoil the party, and as a result, many of those apartments became
tombs.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries, the popular anger that this quake has
produced might have led the government to fall. But in Turkey,
everyone realizes that it is not simply the current government that
is responsible. It is the state itself, and the culture of
irresponsibility it has fostered.
</P>
<P>
   Turks have traditionally maintained an exaggerated respect for
the state and its institutions. That respect began to crumble in
1996, when a spectacular scandal revealed the state's involvement
with gangsters, assassins and drug smugglers. Now it has suffered
another blow, which deeply disturbs some senior political and
military leaders because it weakens their psychological hold on
their people.
</P>
<P>
   But if the earthquake leads Turks to recognize the need to
accept and obey rules in order to promote the general good, if it
leads them to demand more accountability from their leaders instead
of assuming that ``devlet baba'' _ Daddy State _ always knows best,
it may turn out to be a turning point for this highly dynamic but
still unformed country.

   UNITED NATIONS _ The East Timorese are voting Monday on whether
to sever ties with Indonesia, and if they opt for independence,
where would this brand-new country rank among the U.N.'s 188
members? For those Indonesians who argue that East Timor, occupying
only a half of one of Indonesia's 13,000 islands, is too small to
be viable, the facts may be surprising.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor, with 871,000 people and an area of 7,336 square
miles, is bigger in population and size than the three newest
members of the United Nations. The newcomers, which are expected to
take their seats in the General Assembly this fall, are all Pacific
island nations: Tonga, with a population of about 98,000 and 268
square miles of land; Nauru, with 11,000 people and 8.1 square
miles; and Kiribati, with 82,000 people scattered over 316 square
miles of islands.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at least three dozen members of the United Nations,
many created in the decades of anti-colonialism that shattered
European empires after World War II, have populations smaller than
East Timor's. Most are island nations in the Caribbean, Pacific or
Indian Ocean, but there are also a few in Central and South
America, including Guyana, Suriname and Belize. Among older
countries, Iceland's population is smaller, as are those of
Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. So is the population of Brunei, with
its collection of oil wells at the edge of Borneo in the South
China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Many small nations struggle because they do not have oil or
other money-earning natural resources. But there are believed to be
petroleum reserves in the ocean south of East Timor. A decade ago,
Australia and Indonesia agreed to explore the area jointly.
Political pressure on the Australian government could insure that
money earned there in the future flows at least in part to the East
Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   Nauru has thrived on something less often talked about: the
phosphates derived from the dung of sea birds. Other small nations
fight to stay economically solvent on fish. Or foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, which abandoned East Timor as a colony in 1974, has
offered to finance the nation's budget for five years, and other
countries have also offered aid. Independence will not be instant,
though, even if voters back it resoundingly. Indonesia will wait
for a new parliament and a new president to take office late in the
year before making a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   But other nations must be wondering: If East Timor makes it into
the United Nations, who's next? Other territories with aspirations
to independence _ among them Kashmir, Kosovo and Tibet _ are
watching closely this week as the United Nations, which is
organizing and monitoring the elections, helps East Timor take this
important step.

TURKISH QUAKE'S SECRET ACCOMPLICE: CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 By STEPHEN KINZER

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ It is common to refer to earthquakes as
natural disasters, but the one that took thousands of lives in
Turkey this month was more than that. Many of the victims would
have survived if their homes had been built in accordance with
basic safety standards. Instead they were built with cheap
materials by contractors who had learned they could make up in
corruption what they lacked in skill and experience.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is home to some of the world's most respected
construction companies, which have built hotels, airports and
housing projects not only here but across Asia, North Africa and
the former Soviet Union. The earthquake showed, however, that there
are also many ignorant and unscrupulous contractors. They have made
their way to success through bribery and other forms of dishonesty,
and the system that brought them wealth must now share the blame
for the tragedy that has brought Turkey to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption in Turkey is not as pervasive as it is in many nearby
countries. Government jobs are not for sale to the highest bidder,
as they are in Azerbaijan. Teachers and doctors do not demand
payoffs for their services, as they do in Georgia. Theft is still
uncommon, and there have been remarkably few cases of looting in
the aftermath of the quake. This reflects a culture in which
murderers are sometimes esteemed because they are presumed to have
acted in defense of family honor, while thieves are despised for
violating one of God's most elemental laws.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the kind of corruption that has crippled
many nations' development efforts has begun to take hold in Turkey.
It is a trend this country will have to confront and reverse if it
hopes to join the European Union and become a fully trusted partner
of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey was for years an inward-looking country where foreign
travel was discouraged, possession of many imported items was a
crime and private enterprise was choked by a host of regulations.
These restrictions effectively cut Turkey off from the world, but
they also insulated the country against worldwide trends like
corruption. National leaders valued propriety above economic
growth, and most ordinary people followed their example.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed in the mid 1980s with the emergence of Turgut
Ozal, a giant political figure who proved to be the most
revolutionary leader Turkey had seen since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk
half a century before. As prime minister and later as president,
Ozal flung open doors and windows that had been tightly shut for
decades, freeing what proved to be the enormous energies of Turkish
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   It was a profoundly important step, and it brought Turkey into
the international mainstream in a very short time. But as Ozal
urged Turks to free themselves from the outmoded rules that had
held them back for so long, he also seemed to send a subtle message
that rules in general were bad. Some ambitious Turks understood him
to say that getting rich was such an important and wonderful goal
that it didn't matter how one accomplished it.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of business could an unschooled and capital-poor Turk
launch to propel him on the road to wealth? Thousands chose to
start construction companies, relying on the help of friends in
local politics to win contracts. In a wide-open economy that was
growing at an astonishing rate, many of these contractors quickly
became rich.
</P>
<P>
   The price that society paid for their rise to wealth became
tragically clear when this month's earthquake struck. The
contractors had built countless apartment blocks with sandy
concrete and reinforcing rods far too weak to withstand the forces
of nature that regularly shake the country.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the blame must be apportioned to a social system in
which everything is negotiable and friends always help each other.
If a mayor or other public official has a friend or relative who
owns a construction company, tradition dictates that they make some
arrangement so both can prosper. To allow such deals to founder
simply because the contractor lacks capital or experience or
training would seem hard-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   In the days following the earthquake, furious survivors sought
to lynch several contractors who had made careers of building poor
housing that collapsed like cards when the ground began to shake.
But the contractors, realizing that they would become targets, had

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Hamburgers embroiled in world politics
 &HT;    (For release Sept. 1, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's newest political prey is the hamburger stand,
principally McDonald's and Burger King. An outlash at McDonald's is
an outlash against American foreign policy, and a deep-rooted
battle in the Middle East has Burger King cringing.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than beefing up U.S. forces in front of our embassies,
perhaps they ought to be watching the drive-through line.
</P>
<P>
   Unconventional Gen. George S. Patton once fantasized World War
II being determined by a one-on-one battle between himself and
German Field Marshall Erwin Rommel. They never sat down and had a
hamburger together before shaking hands and heading off to their
respective tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, there have been new ways created to settle
differences. When the U.S. bombs somewhere in the world, either
intentionally or accidentally, the hamburger joints in those places
take the brunt of the resident response.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's, more than Burger King, has been targeted _ perhaps
because the Golden Arches have become some sort of gastronomic
symbol of American influence. Besides, if you can't shoot down the
plane doing the bombing, busting up an American hamburger stand
will suffice.
</P>
<P>
   Our errant projectiles in Yugoslavia, in the war to let
Albanians kill Serbs for a change, resulted in McDonald's
restaurants being attacked in Belgrade as well as in China.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. losses over Yugoslavia amounted to one plane shot down and
about 2,000 pounds of hamburger destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when the hamburger chains are not being attacked
overseas, they pillage each other in American markets.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, both hamburger giants took nasty hits. Near Millau,
France, citizens there ransacked a still-not completed McDonald's
to protest U.S. tariffs and genetically modified food. (Aren't the
French the ones who eat snails and creamed brains? Yes, I thought
so.)
</P>
<P>
   Similar attacks took place elsewhere in France and even in
Antwerp, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the democratic-leaning Russians did to Lenin's statue
in Moscow, the Millau protesters knocked Ronald McDonald off his
pedestal and onto his back amid a sea of apples dumped in front of
the shop. The French lead the world in unique protests and labor
actions. In the past, they have blocked the runways at airports,
left their produce out to rot, created immense traffic jams on the
expressways and shut down their museums during the height of
tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King, meanwhile, got its toes burned in the Middle East
when Palestinians discovered one of BK's new establishments was in
a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, considered by the
Palestinians to be occupied territory since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab League got in on this one by presenting a resolution,
to be voted upon next month, to boycott Burger King in Arab
countries if the hamburger giant did not back down. In the U.S., a
coalition of American Muslims called for a worldwide boycott of
Burger King. Also in the U.S., Jewish groups called for a boycott
of Burger King if it knuckles under. Much like any other Middle
East issue, emotion takes control of sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King has squeamed out of this one by withdrawing
franchise rights to the West Bank establishment, but also saying it
had no idea it was in a controversial Jewish settlement in the West
Bank. I cannot imagine Burger King granting a franchise anywhere in
the world without knowing where it was, but if you want to believe
that cop-out, have it your way.
</P>
<P>
   There is no support here of Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
Other than a determination on the future of Jerusalem, prevention
of Jewish West Bank settlements is the biggest issue between Arabs
and Israel. Putting a Burger King in the midst of it just begs for
overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   And it came.
</P>
<P>
   I only can assume that refusal by Burger King to accede to the
Muslim demands might have widened the War of the Edibles. While
Burger King is headquartered in Miami, it is owned by a British
corporation, one that also owns, among other worldwide products,
Haagen-Dazs ice cream, Green Giant foods and Smirnoff vodka; lots
to boycott.
</P>
<P>
   So elated was the terrorist group Hamas with the backing down of
Burger King that it issued a statement of praise for the company,
then likely went back to planning attacks on Israeli civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the fast-food chains ought to be asking for a seat on
the president's national security council. Getting tagged for U.S.
foreign policy is no way to have to sell hamburgers.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Babies no smarter
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, it turns out on closer examination, listening to Mozart
doesn't make you smarter, except a little bit and maybe for a
nanosecond. Mozart's music is merely a pleasure _ but for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that good enough? It's kind of disappointing to hear that
you can't see a baby's IQ zooming like an animated bar chart as the
kid lies there listening to Mozart. That's just a symbol of our
culture. We expect big paybacks on almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people who saw the movie ``Amadeus'' bought the idea
that Mozart was a world-class simpleton, the lucky and inexplicable
recipient of God's gift. It was a fun idea to play with, but it
wasn't true, either. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a smart,
enlightened guy of his time. OK, he was a little, well, different.
Who else took us on a ride from ``Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star'' to
the Requiem?
</P>
<P>
   What we wanted was not the pleasure of his company, but a bunch
of IQ points on the cheap. The record companies did very nicely,
thank you. The kids got to hear a lot of Mozart. Maybe it turned
out all right, after all.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: School vouchers are unconstitutional and unwise
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're a long way from a definitive ruling on whether using tax
money to send kids to religious schools is constitutional, but the
finding by a federal district court in Ohio that there's probable
cause to suspect a church-state violation in Cleveland's program
may hint at what's to come.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of vouchers are reacting as if the very idea of
judicial review were novel to the point of abomination. Clint
Bolick, litigation director of the Institute of Justice, which
argued for the Cleveland program, called the ruling by Judge
Solomon Oliver Jr. ``an outrageous abuse of judicial power.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, instead, a perfectly ordinary, indeed predictable,
finding. It was inevitable that the constitutionality of vouchers
would be tested in federal courts, and Judge Oliver's ruling
follows one in Maine earlier this year that barred the use of
public money to pay tuitions at a Roman Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, mainly, have rallied to vouchers not only as a
cure-all for any- and everything wrong with public schools but as
the sole allowable fix. Even a proposed national program to repair
dilapidated schools has flopped in Congress partly out of a dug-in
ideological dismissal of public education on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Hyped now as an educational nostrum, vouchers were created as a

speaker, he attracts support from the West as well as Serbia's
middle-classes, but doesn't appeal to the masses like the
emotional, mercurial Draskovic. He and Draskovic conduct a running,
bitter public quarrel at the expense of democratic unity, which
turns off
</P>
<P>
   younger democrats. He has vowed to quit politics if Milosevic is
still in power next year.
</P>
<P>
   GEN. MOMCILO PERESIC
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's former army chief, Gen. Peresic was fired by
Milosevic last year after accusing the government of pushing the
country into war with NATO and manipulating the army for political
gain. Not officially a candidate, Peresic retains close ties with
important military figures and is speaking out for democratic
changes. He is allied with the Movement for Democratic Serbia, an
umbrella for reformers and democrats formed only two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He is seen as a thorough professional with little personal
ambition who talks of averting ``a new catastrophe'' _ meaning
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   VELIMIR ILIC
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Cacak, a central Serbian city where Milosevic's
socialists have always been unpopular, ``Velja'' Ilic is a
firebrand from a family of ``Chetniks,'' World War II guerrillas
who felt betrayed when the West threw its support to Tito's
Communist partisans. Forced into hiding during the NATO bombing for
``treasonous'' statements criticizing the Yugoslav army, he has
founded his own political party, New Serbia, and is confident that
democracy's _ and his _ time has come to oust ``the last of
Europe's communists.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Although NATO's devastating air
bombardment re-arranged entire landscapes of this capital city, a
couple of salient facts important to Serbia's beleaguered and
frustrated democratic opposition remain firmly in place.
</P>
<P>
   First, the leftist-nationalist coalition of their nemesis,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, still rules. He has even
begun taunting his foes with talk of early elections in November or
December, which _ without international supervision _ most
opposition parties believe would only extend his regime and sap
their energy and resources.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Clinton administration's policy of using economic
isolation and bare humanitarian assistance to force Milosevic's
removal hasn't budged. That means little or no financial help for
the pro-democracy forces just as they are gearing up for a fall
campaign of rallies, civil disobedience and even a general strike
beginning in late September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a small window of opportunity, but no money,'' says
Miodrag Peresic, a Democratic Party founder. He is also a
strategist for the Council of Democratic Changes, an umbrella
organization trying to link Serbia's democratic activists,
politicians and intellectuals with the Serb-American diaspora in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial help is urgent. Our budgets are at an end,'' says
Maja Tasic of the Civic Alliance of Serbia, who believes one
pressing _ and expensive _ need is marketing a new image for
Serbia's democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Voters need to be convinced ``there are lots of new leaders and
heroes'' gaining ground here, she says, with a ``common goal'' of
setting bitterness (at NATO's intervention) aside and standing up
to Milosevic without the compromises and in-fighting of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Velimir Ilic, mayor of the anti-Milosevic stronghold of Cacak in
central Serbia and one of the opposition's new faces, is funding
his fledgling party, New Serbia, out of his own pocket. Hounded by
federal authorities during the bombing after accusing the Yugoslav
army of deliberately parking tanks in civilian areas, he was
well-received at an August 19 rally here that drew an estimated
150,000 protestors.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stage rental alone was 14,000 (German) marks,'' Ilic said
(about US$10,000). The entire rally _ posters, leaflets, music,
buses, gasoline, etc. _ ran between US$20,000 and US$35,000. He and
the other two main sponsors split it three ways.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for fall is to hold such rallies every day, in a replay
of continuous protests over Milosevic's refusal to recognize
victories by democrats in local elections a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs money to engage in politics,'' says Ilic, ``even in a
country that's now officially the poorest in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Tasic and Ilic were among a group of pro-democracy leaders who
met last week(CQ) in Montenegro with James Dobbins, the new U.S.
State Department point man for the Balkans. Ilic and other
opposition mayors want assistance from the West funneled directly
to their cities, to repair war-damaged bridges, factories and
services and help feed and house an estimated 200,000 ethnic Serbs
who've fled Kosovo province to escape ethnic Albanian
revenge-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   They are working from a target list of 32 cities and urban
districts represented by Serb opposition parties _ basically the
membership of the Association of Independent Cities _ but details
of how much aid and when it might arrive are still under
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Even the $100 million the U.S. Congress has discussed furnishing
to U.S. non-governmental organizations _ little of which Serbian
democrats expect to ever see _ looks like a pittance to independent
economists here. They have gathered data on nearly $30 billion in
damages to the infrastructure of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic, from the alliance's 78-day bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of help isn't good enough,'' says economist Milko
Stimac. ``We need a half-billion (dollars) in direct aid, followed
by foreign investment that stays in the country'' to create an
economic environment where democracy can flourish.
</P>
<P>
   As for the U.S. policy of denying aid and maintaining sanctions
until the Serbs remove Milosevic, Stimac argues that ``it sounds
good, sounds pure . . . but it's really demagoguery. We didn't
elect Milosevic. He's a dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the new parties and alliances like the Council for
Democratic Changes that sprang up in the wake of the NATO
intervention, there is growing sentiment that the Serb opposition's
traditional standard-bearers _ Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal
Party and Democratic Party president Zoran Djindjic _ have put
ambition above ideology. Further, many here worry that they have
spent their power to shake the regime or to inspire enough citizens
to march, speak out and organize against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main problem for us is that the opposition became part of
the government,'' said Lyuba Tadic, a popular actor and activist in
the Movement for Democratic Serbia, which has also recruited Gen.
Momcilo Peresic, the Yugoslav army chief of staff fired by
Milosevic for opposing his campaign to rid Kosovo of ethnic
Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 10 years, the regime destroyed this country, and
the opposition didn't do enough to stop them,'' Tadic said.
</P>
<P>
   Tadic's group is an example of post-modern political thinking
here. It is a ``movement,'' not a party, ``because people don't
like parties and there are already too many of them,'' said
Alexander Marinko, a former Democratic Party executive now working
in the Movement. And Gen. Peresic, the movement's president, is
``not a candidate saying he wants to be president'' because that is
seen as craven ambition, not democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   A decade of political struggle and tribal clashes among
opposition leaders, all apparently futile, has brought an air of
desperation to the democratic ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the final moment,'' Marinko said. But as badly as he
wants to see Milosevic depart, the issue of how, and with whose
help, is still important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think democracy should be brought from inside the country,''
he said. Any suggestion that U.S. money was responsible for
undermining the current regime is ``very sensitive,'' and would
certainly be used to tar brush the democrats who accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Civic Alliance's Maja Tasic, who gets credit for
finally removing Milosevic isn't important _ even if it's an
American president who started the air campaign that took the lives
of some 1,500 Serb civilians, and kept the nighttime skies over her
country filled with bombs and Tomahawk missiles.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic is ousted while Clinton is still in office, ``I
know the Democrats in America can say, 'See, that was always our
plan.'''
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't care if they do, ``because here it's not
politics anymore. Here, it's a matter of life or death.''

 &HT;    Truth is plain to see
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``Disciples used to gather in the name of Christ
to nap . . .''
</P>
<P>
   As I boldly sang those words at church recently, my husband
stopped in mid-verse and stared at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sup, not nap!''
</P>
<P>
   Either I've been spending too much time in the recliner, or
something is seriously wrong with my eyes. ``What about Peter? He
napped,'' I whispered back.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't improve during the responsive reading, when I
confidently intoned, ``Create in us a clear part, O God, and renew
a fight spirit within us!''
</P>
<P>
   With that, my husband elbowed me in the ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's clear heart and right spirit,'' he said. ``Put on your
glasses already.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, vanity of vanities. It's no secret I have terrible eyesight.
I have had since I was 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   How mortified I was with that first pair of glasses. They were
terrible wing-tip, sparkly things that cursed a generation of
vision-impaired girls who grew up in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever self-esteem I had managed to muster in those first
years of life slipped completely away when I put those frames upon
my freckled little nose.
</P>
<P>
   Today, children have wonderful choices in frames and can make a
serious fashion statement with their selection. But in my childhood
days, the only choices were ugly and uglier.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to my childhood home, I pulled out the photo
albums. As I flipped through them, I came upon the pages where my
mother had put our school pictures every year. There they were, the
sparkly frames and then the black, dweeb frames. It was a sorry
succession of years that no one should have to remember, much less
have memorialized in a photo album.
</P>
<P>
   My youngest son came over to see what I was looking at.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is that?'' he asked, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's your beloved mother,'' I said, my voice full of
warning.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly aghast, he looked from the album page to me and back
again, unable to believe this awful truth in his lineage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez, Mom. You had some pretty rough years in there, huh?'' he
said sympathetically.
</P>
<P>
   I got contacts as soon as I could and stayed in them for decades
to come. And I have contacts now. The truth is, though, at this
``certain age'' I now enjoy, the contacts alone can't do the job
when I'm reading.
</P>
<P>
   So I carry glasses with me, which I use constantly at work. But
when I'm in a public place, such as church or a restaurant, I still
like to pretend I can actually, you know, see.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't just in public, though. At home, I can't see
the washing instructions on tags in clothes or the baking
directions on boxes or the measurements in recipes. The
consequences can be disastrous: a silk blouse that now could fit a
Barbie doll; a solidified lump of stove-top stuffing that needed 1
1/2 cups of water, not 1/2 cup; inedible cookies that only needed
3/4 cup of sugar instead of the 1 3/4 cups I put in them . . .
actually, I did manage to eat those, just to avoid waste, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Pride is a terrible thing. How could I suddenly be looking down
my nose through magnifying glasses like my parents? I remember well
the jokes betwen them and their friends when we'd go out to eat at
a restaurant and one would hold the menu up across the table for
the other to read. Poor old geezers, I thought . . . just
yesterday, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   But on this Sunday morning, with my ribs bruised and tender from
my husband's admonitions, I sat mutely in the pew and took heart
from the only thing I could:
</P>
<P>
   If faith, as the Bible tells us, is believing in what we cannot
see, then my faith is growing abundantly.

 &HT;    Mozart effect too good to last
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Any scientific theory that brings soft
music to nurseries, induces state legislators to praise the great
composers and moves classical music product off the shelves is a
good thing. Not necessarily a true thing, but a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I was sorry to read that scientists had debunked the
so-called ``Mozart effect.'' Perhaps someone will re-bunk it.
</P>
<P>
   The Mozart effect is the theory that listening to Mozart's music
can make folks smarter. It is based on a 1993 study that found
college students who listened to Mozart's music _ specifically
``Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major'' _ demonstrated improved
thinking skills.
</P>
<P>
   Combine those results with the idea that most of our learning
happens in the first three years of life and the result is a
widespread certainty that playing Mozart for infants and toddlers
makes them smarter.
</P>
<P>
   In no time schools, day care centers and state policy makers
responded. The Florida Legislature showed a surprising new
appreciation for improved thinking skills by requiring day care
centers to play classical music. Georgia Gov. Zell Miller had free
Mozart CDs sent to new mothers in that state. Other states followed
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, anxious to give their children an intellectual edge,
searched out the classical music shelves of the CD stores,
abandoning Raffi and cute singing dinosaurs in favor of Mozart. A
quick search of Amazon.com finds 13 CDs with the phrase ``Mozart
effect'' in the title.
</P>
<P>
   The news spread faster than the allegro movement of ``Eine
Kleine Nachtmusik.'' For once, society seemed to be on the
threshold of realizing an impossible dream _ raising a batch of
kids that wouldn't turn out quite so dumb 15 years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   This discovery became known too late to help me with my kids.
Already entering elementary school, they were, developmentally
speaking, over the hill. Once again, I was behind the curve and a
failure as a parent. I had played Bach to them in the nursery, not
Mozart. My children would be doomed to low SAT scores, second-rate
universities and juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, just as might have been predicted, no comforting
cantatas come from the CD players in their rooms these days. I
brace my bedroom door against the harsh electronic grind of Atari
Teenage Riot and the Beastie Boys. If only, if only I had known and
not let myself get stuck in the Baroque. But then, if I had played
Stravinsky, things might have turned out even worse.
</P>
<P>
   I can, however, take new comfort in a new study in the latest
issue of the journal Nature. It declares that Mozart listeners
don't get any smarter after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom-line message is that there is either no Mozart
effect or a very small Mozart effect,'' Harvard researcher
Christopher Chabris told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Harsh words. He must have listened to Berg as an infant.
</P>
<P>
   But this reassessment shouldn't be too big a surprise. Although
I'm sure the new generation of Mozart-babies will be better in some
way for their exposure, the idea that you could buy your kids a
point or two of IQ for $12.99 in the record-and-tape section of
Wal-Mart does seem just a little too easy.
</P>
<P>
   We are a society that will mobilize its resources to put Mozart
in every nursery but six years later will plop the same bunch of
kids in front of the TV for hours at a time. And for good measure,
we will eliminate their junior-high school music program at the
first hint of a tight school budget.
</P>
<P>
   Our commitment to higher IQs through music begins to get iffy as
the cost rises above $15 and the kids get older than 10.
</P>
<P>
   Even if holding cribside Mozart concerts doesn't raise kids' IQ,
at least it doesn't hurt. And maybe it has other beneficial
effects, ones that don't show up on standardized tests. Perhaps it
makes little kids less grumpy, a little nicer. (Testing this would
require psychologists to develop a standardized Niceness Quotient.
High NQ children could be tested, identified and then hit up for
their lunch money.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps playing Mozart for toddlers does nothing more than keep
their parents from freaking out. If that's true, it would be well
worth $12.99. Even if the kids don't get any smarter.

 &HT;    Search engines refining `pathfinder' services
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the big changes on the Web over the last few
years has been the addition of truly useful services.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the World Wide Web was more of a curiosity _ a
pig that could sing _ but nowadays many of us use the Web in daily
life. Today, we'll take a look at some sites that can help you find
a good barber, locate the nearest grocery store or help you
navigate to a new friend's home.
</P>
<P>
   Let's travel to our first of these ``pathfinder'' sites. It's
called AltaVista Connections and is located at www.zip2.com/.
AltaVista, as you probably know, is one of the best known of the
search engines. But _ as is true of most of these places _ it has
diversified into other services.
</P>
<P>
   When you go to that page, you'll see a list of services and
businesses such as dining, home and real estate, health, and sports
and recreation. Clicking on any of these broad topics brings up
other lists of specific kinds of businesses. Once you select the
exact type of business you want to find, the search engine will ask
you for your home address.
</P>
<P>
   Now the site can really go to work. It'll give you a list of
businesses in that category _ let's say barber shops _ that are
near your home. You'll be told how far away each is, its address
and its phone number. If you wish, you can get a map and driving
directions to that location.
</P>
<P>
   The next site today is maintained by another search engine,
Yahoo, and it's located at yp
</P>
<P>
   .yahoo.com/. This site works very much like the one from
AltaVista. The mechanics of how you go about it are a little
different, but the end result will be the same sort of a list of
businesses, addresses and phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, one nifty thing about the Yahoo site may surprise you or
frighten you (since some people have an almost obsessive fear that
computers are somehow invading their privacy). The Yahoo site uses
a cookie (a tiny text file it sends to your computer) that will
identify you the next time you try the service. So, on subsequent
visits from the same computer, you can simply select the business
category and Yahoo will automatically assume that your home address
is the same as it was last time. It gets all that information from
the cookie.

 &HT;    SimCity 3000 more intellectually challenging than its
predecessors
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``SimCity'' always has been a thing of intellectual
beauty. This computer game is so well thought out, so full of
nuances in its understanding of modern urban life, that you can
play it again and again and still be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   This tradition continues with the latest version, ``SimCity
3000.'' The PC version has been out for more than a year. The Mac
version has now been released.
</P>
<P>
   ``SimCity 3000'' is even more sophisticated and complex than its
two predecessors, making game play not only addictive but much more
challenging. I built a city of 180,000 and watched it collapse in
financial ruin. You never can let your guard down in this version
of ``SimCity.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you'll notice about ``SimCity 3000'' is the
stunning new look. There are hundreds of new buildings, and you can
study them at street level. You'll see people walking your streets
and all kinds of traffic: buses, cars, firetrucks and police cars,
to name a few. In ``SimCity 2000,'' the only representation of
traffic was a flowing river of little blue dots.
</P>
<P>
   ``SimCity 3000'' has added lots of new special buildings given
as awards. For instance, if you reach a certain population level
you'll receive a university, a golf course, a medical research
complex and many more.
</P>
<P>
   The game includes replicas of scores of famous buildings from
around the world. There's the United Nations complex, Westin
Peachtree Plaza and Notre Dame, to name a few. You can add up to 10
of these landmark buildings in any city.
</P>
<P>
   With this additional detail comes added complexity. In addition
to traffic, development, power and water, you now must manage
waste. Left unmanaged, it will litter your streets and pollute your
water. This is a major new challenge to master in developing a
successful city.
</P>
<P>
   Another big new challenge is deal-making with neighbors. You can
sell them your garbage, for example, or take the garbage of others
for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   These added elements make ``SimCity 3000'' more difficult to
play and less forgiving of mistakes, even at the easiest levels. In
earlier versions, with a city of 180,000, I pretty much would have
been home free.
</P>
<P>
   While ``SimCity 3000'' is stunning, it does have a few
weaknesses. A big one is the huge amount of computing power needed.
You have to set virtual memory, for example, at a minimum of 128
megabytes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the functions appear to need tweaking. It's very hard _
in some cases impossible _ to build bridges. Nor does the game
recognize basic Mac key commands such as Command W to close a
window.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, this is a great new version of a great game.

 &HT;    Music sales on net not same old song
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's always something when it comes to the new
frontier of downloading and paying for music from the Internet.
Atlantic Records put a bold foot forward and decided to market the
new Tori Amos song ``Bliss'' as a secure downloadable track for
sale over the Internet. About 10 minutes later, somebody hacked the
song so it could be downloaded for free. This is essentially the
online equivalent of shoplifting, and nobody's too happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   However, instead of the record companies blaming the Web and the
Web blaming the record companies, everyone seems to regard the Tori
experiment as a learning experience, and this is good news for
consumers. Instead of backing away, retailers and artists are
thinking hard not just about security but pricing and making
digital music something mainstream consumers will want to buy as
often as CDs from the local record store.
</P>
<P>
   All this is a far cry from the olden days of digital downloading
that existed about six months ago. Downloading music from the
Internet was confusing, complicated and often illegal. Web sites
blamed the record companies for not providing music. Record
companies blamed the Web. Many people in the record business see
the Web as an uncivilized, unethical and just plain nasty place
created for the sole purpose of ripping them off.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic apparently took a hard look at the Internet and decided
that if you can't beat them, you might as well join them. The Tori
Amos single was priced at $1.59 and provided free to any retailer
on the Web that wanted to sell it. Some chose to give it away,
others priced it slightly higher, but the point was it was out
there, people would download it and if the gods are smiling,
Atlantic and Tori Amos might make some money selling music on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Group co-Chairman/co-Chief Executive Officer Val Azzoli
applauded his label's fearlessness and vision in a press release:
``The time has clearly arrived for online downloads to become
another readily available retail format, alongside the familiar CD,
cassette and vinyl,'' he said. ``With the for-sale download release
of `Bliss,' we are taking another major step in the rapid
development of secure digital music distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Also dipping its toe into the uncharted waters of digital music
is CDNow. Ted Hooban, the company's director of digital products,
says this is the first time CDNow is offering digital music for
sale. He says the challenge for any online retailer is to present
digital downloads in a user-friendly format.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's going to be a long time before record labels and
online music retailers walk off hand-in-hand into the sunset.
Although CDNow says its goal is to be the No. 1 destination for
downloading music over the Internet, the company admits almost too
many obstacles exist to bringing music downloads to great numbers
of consumers any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Hooban says it's imperative for CDNow to understand all sides of
the digital download dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that in order for us to continue to be a leading
commerce site for music, we have to dive down and deal with all
these issues head-on,'' he says. ``What are the dominant formats?
Where are the record labels going? What do the artists want? We
have to work with them, but we have to build systems that are
friendly and make it something that is easy for consumers to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Both record labels and online retailers are concerned about
piracy, theft and security but don't know if they have the
technology or the industry clout to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really turns everybody upside down,'' Hooban says.
``Everyone is trying to figure out how the world should look, and
the customer doesn't know how the world should look. You don't know
what customers will or will not do or what record companies will or
will not do. Everybody's in there trying to understand how to
manage all the copyrights and keep things secure.''
</P>
<P>
   One answer to the security debacle is to have songs that
eventually ``time out,'' or won't play after a certain date. ``We
have no data on how people react,'' he says, ``but from a consumer
perspective, any time you lose something like that _ and this is
just my theory _ you almost paid a price to get it. You downloaded
a player, you installed the player and you waited 20, 30 or 40
minutes to download the track. You did pay a price to get that
song. So I question the value of having someone take it away from
you. To leave it on the desktop will drive more sales than to have
it time out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooban says the ins and outs of digital music distribution are
hard to explain because there are so many parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules aren't written,'' he says. ``I don't think this
industry is going to make this easy for the customer.'' CDNow, as
one of the earliest online music retailers, understands the online
music-buying consumer and what he or she will and will not put up
with when it comes to buying music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing our focus groups and an incredible amount of
research and looking at how people interact with digital downloads.
The stuff we have up there right now is a big experiment,'' he
says. ``We want to find out what people will go through and what
they will pay for a digital download. We want to make it a clean
and easy experience and figure out how to put marketing muscle
behind it. Right now it's a complicated process. We're just trying
to learn.''

 &HT;    POWERUSER: Springing for better monitor can be an eye-saver
 &HT;    (EDS: Can run with TECHNOBUDDY31.)
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since the first time I ventured into a dungeon and
reduced a monster to a pile of fur and gore, I've had this
half-baked notion that it would be really cool to get one of those
60-inch TV sets, hook it to a computer, turn off all the lights and
scare myself silly playing a life-size version of ``Hexen.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, re-creating the putrid tones of the dank walls of
``Hexen'' or the eerie red glow of a ``Doom'' burial chamber in the
living room is much easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   In my quest for the techno-chops to see what it would take to be
able to creep down a dungeon hallway on a giant-screen TV, I
learned a good deal about monitors, video cards and how they work
together.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things I learned is that a computer won't work
very well with a TV set. Without getting too technically obtuse,
about the best resolution I could hope for, even using specialized
_ and expensive _ converter equipment, is 640 pixels by 480 pixels,
which would look terrible ... especially on one of those monster TV
sets.
</P>
<P>
   These days, with computer manufacturers practically giving away
their machines, it makes sense to build a system around your
monitor as opposed to the CPU. Especially for people who use their
machines primarily to surf the Net, send e-mail, write letters and
play solitaire.
</P>
<P>
   It's not going to make too much difference whether the computer
you buy for those uses is a 166-MHz or a 500-MHz machine _ unless
you are using some kind of whiz-bang 3-D solitaire game. But there
is a significant difference between a 15-inch, a 17-inch, a 19-inch
and a 21-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   It makes even more sense for heavy gamers and artistic types
using complex imaging software to invest extra in a monitor because
they will be spending even more time in front of a machine.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you look at it, your eyes do most of the heavy
lifting when it comes to computers. In the long run, the money you
invest in a good monitor may save you the price of a pair of
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Like most things related to computers, there is enough
information on monitors and video cards to fill several thick
books, but a good enough understanding of how video works to make
informed choices is not so hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to know is that two things are involved that
work together but should be considered separately: the monitor and
the video card.
</P>
<P>
   In a simplified explanation, the card tells the monitor what to
display. The monitor is responsible for the display quality _
sharpness, brightness, resolution and stability. The card transfers
the data between the computer and monitor.
</P>
<P>
   So you can buy the biggest, baddest, fastest video card out
there, but if your monitor is a piece of junk, the picture will be
poor. On the other hand, a high-end monitor used with a standard
video card would most likely yield pretty decent results for casual
home users.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a whole lot to the monitor side of things. What you
see, is, um, what you get. The primary considerations when
purchasing a monitor are the refresh rate and the screen size.
</P>
<P>
   Because of cost, the most common screen size was 15 inches as
recently as a year ago, when they cost between $300 and $350. But
17-inch monitors have since fallen to around $200 and are quickly
becoming the screen size of choice, and a 19-inch monitor now costs
what a 15-inch used to cost. Don't forget, too, that screen sizes
are measured diagonally. The viewing area on a 15-inch screen is
actually about 13 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The refresh rate is measured in megahertz _ standard speeds on
new monitors these days are around 65-75 MHz _ and it is the speed
the screen is redrawn, which happens every time the cursor blinks
or moves. A lesser factor is dot pitch _ a measure of the distance
between pixels _ but anything 0.28 mm or less is good, although the
lower the dot pitch, the better.
</P>
<P>
   The most common monitors are cathode ray tube (that's the
familiar picture tube, called the CRT) and liquid crystal display
(LCD) monitors, which use liquid crystals between two polarizing
plates. The flat-panel monitors use the LCD technology and are only
a few inches thick, but they are new to the market and still priced
extremely high. Consider a flat-panel screen if space or design is
a factor _ and you have a couple of hundred spare dollars _ but a
CRT should be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   It's when you start playing games that video gets serious.
Upgrading a video card can enhance every aspect of your computer's
imaging processes.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, your computer has a card that can handle 2-D
display (or else you wouldn't be able to see anything). Systems
from a year or two ago, like my Pentium 166, have cards that handle
2-D and 3-D, albeit in a limited capacity, with 1 or 2 megabytes of
video memory. New systems these days normally come with video cards
that handle 2-D and 3-D display and have at least 4 MB _ if not 8
MB _ of video RAM.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of RAM on a card serves two purposes: the number of
colors that can be processed _ i.e., 8-bit (256 colors) or 24-bit
(16.7 million colors) _ and the speed at which images can be
rendered. Some cards _ like the S3 ViRGE in my computer _ can be
upgraded simply by adding more RAM. Different types of RAM can be
used on video cards, so check the manufacturer's info on your card
to see what it takes. In other cases. it makes more sense to add a
3-D graphics accelerator card, either in addition to or instead of
your VGA card.
</P>
<P>
   The way accelerators work is fairly straightforward. A VGA card
has no processor on it, and all graphics commands to the monitor
come from your CPU. Video accelerators have processors built onto
the card that handle most of the graphics commands and leave your
CPU and video bus free to do other things. Obviously, the more
memory on your video card, the higher the performance. When I
bought my computer a year and a half ago, 1 megabyte of video
memory was cutting edge. Nowadays it's not unusual to see several
different cards available with 16 MB or 32 MB of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   It would be great if video accelerators were no more complex
than that, but, alas, that's not the case. (We are talking about
computers, after all.)
</P>
<P>
   The processors on video cards are proprietary, which means that
each has its own set of commands. Consequently, a game _ or any
other program _ used under one type of card may perform differently
under another video accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   Another quirk to consider: No matter how much you soup up your
video card, it is limited to the top speed of your computer's video
bus. Although there seems to be some debate whether the new video
bus _ called AGP for advanced graphics port _ is really that much
better than the older PCI bus, AGP has become the standard in new
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers generally make video accelerators in both flavors
for those of us who have PCI graphics ports and don't have an AGP
slot on the motherboard. Naturally, AGP and PCI are not compatible.
</P>
<P>
   So it shouldn't seem like too big a deal to rig the TV to the
computer, right? Unfortunately, U.S. TVs are only capable of 525
vertical lines of resolution, hence the 640x480 I mentioned
earlier. The advent of HDTV, which will have about double the
resolution capabilities, undoubtedly will change the video picture
(sorry again).
</P>
<P>
   Then again, blowing the life-sized undead into little bits of
decayed flesh at that resolution might be a bit much to stomach.

 &HT;    Dorms easily outfitted on site
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you've spent any time in a Target or Wal-Mart or
Office Depot in the past few weeks, you probably have a decent idea
why CollegiateMall.com might get a few looks on the Web this year.
</P>
<P>
   The site is designed to be a place for college students to flesh
out their dorm rooms. Need a scallop-shaped trash can? How about a
bathrobe rack to hang over your bedroom door? Or maybe a nightstand
or a dresser or a backpack? CollegiateMall.com even has
partnerships with Amazon.com and VarsityBooks.com that let the site
sell music CDs and textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston-based site, started in 1998 by a Boston University
student, bills itself the one-stop college shop.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site even has a form to fill out for students interested
in becoming campus reps for CollegiateMall.com (which is also the
address for the site on the Web).
</P>
<P>
   Bankers, brokers vie for online trust
</P>
<P>
   One of the main things online bankers and brokerages hope to do
is become the place on the Web where you make your money decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The logic works something like this: If you trust one company to
handle your checking account online, you're more likely to trust
them with other financial decisions, such as buying insurance and
trading stock.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Synergistics Research looks at the idea of
cross-selling from the customer's perspective. The study found that
the Web offers tremendous opportunities for banks to sell things to
their customers that they would not ordinarily sell.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of people polled said they would be interested
in handling their investments and getting life, car and homeowners
insurance from the company that handles their checking account.
</P>
<P>
   Synergistics Research asked about 1,000 people in May. The
survey also found that younger people are more interested in the
idea. Most banks are not taking advantage of the interest yet, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   Two more DVDs from Panasonic
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic Consumer Electronics has two more DVD products on the
market, starting in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Panasonic DVD-A7 sells for about $1,000, the Technics
DVD-A10 for about $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Both devices can be incorporated into your home entertainment
system. The DVD players take conventional CDs.
</P>
<P>
   DVD-Audio recordings will be reproduced with higher quality
sound. When hooked up to a television, a DVD also can reproduce
video, including graphics, text and music videos. The audio DVD
player works with DVD video discs as well, which means you can play
DVD movies.
</P>
<P>
   The two-channel DVD-Audio uses a sampling frequency of 192
kilohertz, more than four times the frequency used by a CD, to
extend the playback response to 96 kilohertz.
</P>
<P>
   Higher frequency reproduction is expected to give the audio DVD
a much better sound quality than a CD.

 &HT;    Nature: Virtual Serengeti a little brutal for children
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new CD-ROM from Grolier, by way of the television
series ``Nature,'' entitled ``Nature: Virtual Serengeti,'' is aimed
at children, and it has a great many strengths. But it will require
a certain amount of strength from the youngsters who get into it.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than just link together a series of video clips or still
shots, the producers turned out a self-contained education package.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that a researcher sent to the East African plains
has wandered off to study baboons, and your youngster is recruited
to take his place, finish his research and put together a film for
Nature magazine.
</P>
<P>
   This is less preposterous than it might seem, since from the
frequent e-mails and the stuff he wrote in the research journal,
the original researcher is no more than 10 years old himself.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the new researcher has a base camp, a Land Rover
and a plane to use in studying wildlife from the Mara River to
Amboseli.
</P>
<P>
   The all-important video is based on nodes in each area to be
visited. Each node allows a full 360-degree view by swinging the
cursor to one side of the screen or the other. By clicking on the
horizon or somewhere around it at the proper place, one moves to
another node.
</P>
<P>
   There are animals to be found at virtually every node, but they
aren't obvious. Their presence is indicated by sudden animal
noises, at which point you click around the screen until the view
zeroes in on the animal in question. The animal, and the behavior
observed, are recorded automatically in a long file. These records
can then be used to complete the research simply by connecting the
right picture to the right question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtual Serengeti'' is lavishly produced; the video and audio
are very good; and most of it really does shed interesting light on
the behavior and traits of the animals in question. But a major
slip seems to have occurred between the production and the
packaging.
</P>
<P>
   The program comes in a large, multicolored box, inside which is
the usual heavy cardboard stiffener box. When you open all this up,
all that falls out is one shrink-wrapped pasteboard CD-ROM jacket.
</P>
<P>
   There are no instructions, a rather unsettling state of affairs
that seems to be gaining momentum in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, this would be all right, because ``Virtual
Serengeti'' is not a difficult program, and it has a sort of
prelude to orient the user. Unfortunately, some of the finer points
of this prelude don't seem to be quite accurate.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it indicates that when you see a forward arrow,
you can go forward. You can't. It says you're supposed to sweep the
cursor around each view and when animals are located, it will
change to a sort of box. In practice, animals can't be located
until they make noises, and then the cursor will turn into a box at
a dozen places on the screen, some of which take you to the beast
and some of which don't. In addition, there are about a half-dozen
other cursors that pop up that are entirely unexplained and that
don't seem to do anything most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   All this is going to require a certain amount of patience on the
part of kids.
</P>
<P>
   The second caveat I'm going to issue may or may not be a
problem, depending on your attitude. I don't see it as a problem,
but I tend to put a premium on realism. ``Virtual Serengeti'' is
realistic. Animals die, often violently, which is usually the way
death comes in this part of the world, where the food chain is
plain for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nature shows on television now don't bat an eye at
this sort of thing, and kids who'd be interested in this program
have probably seen a lot of such shows. But you'll have to be the
judge of that.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    TECHNOBUDDY: Accelerator card, more RAM can make PC game-ready
 &HT;    (EDS: Can run in conjunction with POWERUSER-COLUMN about video
cards/gaming.)
 &HT;    By Bill Husted

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I had a friend who claimed she quit school in the
third grade because of recess. She said: I don't play games.
</P>
<P>
   When I first began using computers _ back when the Appalachian
Mountains were young _ games fascinated me. The graphics in some of
the earliest games were literally little dots on the monochrome
screen. If there was sound at all, it was no more than a beep that
came from the PC's built-in speaker.
</P>
<P>
   I continued playing through the advent of the color monitor and
saw games become increasingly complicated. I saw the day when games
(as they are now) were the most demanding application run on most
home PCs. You need more processing power and better video
performance for ``Mutant Martian Unwed Mothers'' than for your word
processor, to check e-mail or even to mess with the
graphics-intensive Web.
</P>
<P>
   While my home computer is an OK machine (a 350-megahertz Pentium
II), it wasn't in shape to play games when I got the urge to try
them again. Finding a game was not a problem. Since I write about
computers, there are usually plenty of review copies to try. But _
for most new games _ I needed more oomph than my PC could deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Since I was determined to try a game, I spent some time (and
money) getting my PC game-capable. I pay my own way when it comes
to my home PC. I don't take free machines or hardware _ that would
create a conflict of interest when it comes to writing about the
various companies. So it was out of the question to buy a new PC
already up to the task. It also meant I couldn't wander the aisles
of the computer stores and ignore the price tags.
</P>
<P>
   Serious gamers will get nothing from my adventure. They use
top-of-the-line machines and spend hours reading about and
discussing the latest hardware. But if you are a typical home PC
user and just looking to play an occasional game, maybe what I
learned can help.
</P>
<P>
   The most important (and expensive) part of the game upgrade was
to replace my old plain vanilla video card with a 3-D accelerator
card. Since I'm writing this for the real PC novice, let's stop and
explain some things. The hardware device that connects your monitor
to the PC is a video card. Like your computer, it has memory chips
of its own. For most applications _ word processing, home finance
programs, Web browsing, spreadsheets and the like _ any video card
with 4 to 8 megabytes of RAM works fine. Most modern games profit
(and some require) a video card that uses a special accelerator
chip that makes game graphics come alive.
</P>
<P>
   You simply pull out your old video card and replace it with the
new one (the accelerator card will work fine for your regular
computing chores, too; you don't need both). Before you go
shopping, check your computer manual to see if your video card uses
the Advanced Graphics Port connection. That's a special slot in
your PC designed for these cards (they'll say AGP on the box). Get
the AGP video accelerator card if your computer supports that
standard, and get the regular one if it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   If you're curious, I bought the Voodoo 3D card with 16 megabytes
of memory. There are plenty to choose from, and it would be smart
to read reviews in a computer gaming magazine before you buy. I
paid around $130 for the card. There are plenty that are much more
expensive and have twice that amount of memory. But those are for
heavy-duty gamers. My 16-megabyte card worked fine. And Voodoo is a
popular brand, so almost any game you find will work fine on that
card.
</P>
<P>
   Since my computer, probably like yours, already had a halfway
decent sound system, the only other upgrade I needed was memory.
Memory is a great investment. Adding RAM _ unlike an accelerator
card _ speeds everything you do. If you have 32 megabytes, you
definitely need to bump the memory up to 64 megabytes. I already
had 64 megabytes, and I upgraded to 128 megabytes and saw a
performance increase. But, if you are frugal, you can get by fine
with 64 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a relatively modern PC, that's all you need to play
a game or two. I did everything for about $200. So, if you want to
play games, there is no need to quit school and get a job.

 &HT;    Search engines refining `pathfinder' services
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the big changes on the Web over the last few
years has been the addition of truly useful services.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the World Wide Web was more of a curiosity _ a
pig that could sing _ but nowadays many of us use the Web in daily
life. Today, we'll take a look at some sites that can help you find
a good barber, locate the nearest grocery store or help you
navigate to a new friend's home.
</P>
<P>
   Let's travel to our first of these ``pathfinder'' sites. It's
called AltaVista Connections and is located at www.zip2.com/.
AltaVista, as you probably know, is one of the best known of the
search engines. But _ as is true of most of these places _ it has
diversified into other services.
</P>
<P>
   When you go to that page, you'll see a list of services and
businesses such as dining, home and real estate, health, and sports
and recreation. Clicking on any of these broad topics brings up
other lists of specific kinds of businesses. Once you select the
exact type of business you want to find, the search engine will ask
you for your home address.
</P>
<P>
   Now the site can really go to work. It'll give you a list of
businesses in that category _ let's say barber shops _ that are
near your home. You'll be told how far away each is, its address
and its phone number. If you wish, you can get a map and driving
directions to that location.
</P>
<P>
   The next site today is maintained by another search engine,
Yahoo, and it's located at yp
</P>
<P>
   .yahoo.com/. This site works very much like the one from
AltaVista. The mechanics of how you go about it are a little
different, but the end result will be the same sort of a list of
businesses, addresses and phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, one nifty thing about the Yahoo site may surprise you or
frighten you (since some people have an almost obsessive fear that
computers are somehow invading their privacy). The Yahoo site uses
a cookie (a tiny text file it sends to your computer) that will
identify you the next time you try the service. So, on subsequent
visits from the same computer, you can simply select the business
category and Yahoo will automatically assume that your home address
is the same as it was last time. It gets all that information from
the cookie.

 &HT;    SimCity 3000 more intellectually challenging than its
predecessors
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``SimCity'' always has been a thing of intellectual
beauty. This computer game is so well thought out, so full of
nuances in its understanding of modern urban life, that you can
play it again and again and still be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   This tradition continues with the latest version, ``SimCity
3000.'' The PC version has been out for more than a year. The Mac
version has now been released.
</P>
<P>
   ``SimCity 3000'' is even more sophisticated and complex than its
two predecessors, making game play not only addictive but much more
challenging. I built a city of 180,000 and watched it collapse in
financial ruin. You never can let your guard down in this version
of ``SimCity.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you'll notice about ``SimCity 3000'' is the
stunning new look. There are hundreds of new buildings, and you can
study them at street level. You'll see people walking your streets
and all kinds of traffic: buses, cars, firetrucks and police cars,
to name a few. In ``SimCity 2000,'' the only representation of
traffic was a flowing river of little blue dots.
</P>
<P>
   ``SimCity 3000'' has added lots of new special buildings given
as awards. For instance, if you reach a certain population level
you'll receive a university, a golf course, a medical research
complex and many more.
</P>
<P>
   The game includes replicas of scores of famous buildings from
around the world. There's the United Nations complex, Westin
Peachtree Plaza and Notre Dame, to name a few. You can add up to 10
of these landmark buildings in any city.
</P>
<P>
   With this additional detail comes added complexity. In addition
to traffic, development, power and water, you now must manage
waste. Left unmanaged, it will litter your streets and pollute your
water. This is a major new challenge to master in developing a
successful city.
</P>
<P>
   Another big new challenge is deal-making with neighbors. You can
sell them your garbage, for example, or take the garbage of others
for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   These added elements make ``SimCity 3000'' more difficult to
play and less forgiving of mistakes, even at the easiest levels. In
earlier versions, with a city of 180,000, I pretty much would have
been home free.
</P>
<P>
   While ``SimCity 3000'' is stunning, it does have a few
weaknesses. A big one is the huge amount of computing power needed.
You have to set virtual memory, for example, at a minimum of 128
megabytes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the functions appear to need tweaking. It's very hard _
in some cases impossible _ to build bridges. Nor does the game
recognize basic Mac key commands such as Command W to close a
window.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, this is a great new version of a great game.

 &HT;    Music sales on net not same old song
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's always something when it comes to the new
frontier of downloading and paying for music from the Internet.
Atlantic Records put a bold foot forward and decided to market the
new Tori Amos song ``Bliss'' as a secure downloadable track for
sale over the Internet. About 10 minutes later, somebody hacked the
song so it could be downloaded for free. This is essentially the
online equivalent of shoplifting, and nobody's too happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   However, instead of the record companies blaming the Web and the
Web blaming the record companies, everyone seems to regard the Tori
experiment as a learning experience, and this is good news for
consumers. Instead of backing away, retailers and artists are
thinking hard not just about security but pricing and making
digital music something mainstream consumers will want to buy as
often as CDs from the local record store.
</P>
<P>
   All this is a far cry from the olden days of digital downloading
that existed about six months ago. Downloading music from the
Internet was confusing, complicated and often illegal. Web sites
blamed the record companies for not providing music. Record
companies blamed the Web. Many people in the record business see
the Web as an uncivilized, unethical and just plain nasty place
created for the sole purpose of ripping them off.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic apparently took a hard look at the Internet and decided
that if you can't beat them, you might as well join them. The Tori
Amos single was priced at $1.59 and provided free to any retailer
on the Web that wanted to sell it. Some chose to give it away,
others priced it slightly higher, but the point was it was out
there, people would download it and if the gods are smiling,
Atlantic and Tori Amos might make some money selling music on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Group co-Chairman/co-Chief Executive Officer Val Azzoli
applauded his label's fearlessness and vision in a press release:
``The time has clearly arrived for online downloads to become
another readily available retail format, alongside the familiar CD,
cassette and vinyl,'' he said. ``With the for-sale download release
of `Bliss,' we are taking another major step in the rapid
development of secure digital music distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Also dipping its toe into the uncharted waters of digital music
is CDNow. Ted Hooban, the company's director of digital products,
says this is the first time CDNow is offering digital music for
sale. He says the challenge for any online retailer is to present
digital downloads in a user-friendly format.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's going to be a long time before record labels and
online music retailers walk off hand-in-hand into the sunset.
Although CDNow says its goal is to be the No. 1 destination for
downloading music over the Internet, the company admits almost too
many obstacles exist to bringing music downloads to great numbers
of consumers any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Hooban says it's imperative for CDNow to understand all sides of
the digital download dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that in order for us to continue to be a leading
commerce site for music, we have to dive down and deal with all
these issues head-on,'' he says. ``What are the dominant formats?
Where are the record labels going? What do the artists want? We
have to work with them, but we have to build systems that are
friendly and make it something that is easy for consumers to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Both record labels and online retailers are concerned about
piracy, theft and security but don't know if they have the
technology or the industry clout to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really turns everybody upside down,'' Hooban says.
``Everyone is trying to figure out how the world should look, and
the customer doesn't know how the world should look. You don't know
what customers will or will not do or what record companies will or
will not do. Everybody's in there trying to understand how to
manage all the copyrights and keep things secure.''
</P>
<P>
   One answer to the security debacle is to have songs that
eventually ``time out,'' or won't play after a certain date. ``We
have no data on how people react,'' he says, ``but from a consumer
perspective, any time you lose something like that _ and this is
just my theory _ you almost paid a price to get it. You downloaded
a player, you installed the player and you waited 20, 30 or 40
minutes to download the track. You did pay a price to get that
song. So I question the value of having someone take it away from
you. To leave it on the desktop will drive more sales than to have
it time out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooban says the ins and outs of digital music distribution are
hard to explain because there are so many parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules aren't written,'' he says. ``I don't think this
industry is going to make this easy for the customer.'' CDNow, as
one of the earliest online music retailers, understands the online
music-buying consumer and what he or she will and will not put up
with when it comes to buying music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing our focus groups and an incredible amount of
research and looking at how people interact with digital downloads.
The stuff we have up there right now is a big experiment,'' he
says. ``We want to find out what people will go through and what
they will pay for a digital download. We want to make it a clean
and easy experience and figure out how to put marketing muscle
behind it. Right now it's a complicated process. We're just trying
to learn.''

   If I Cross My Eyes, Will They Really Stick?
</P>
<P>
   By Jan R. Ledford
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You're eating in the school lunchroom. Everyone's
doing stunts. The kid across from you entertains the crowd by
bending his thumb back to his wrist.
</P>
<P>
   It's your turn.
</P>
<P>
   You cross your eyes in toward your nose. Everyone shrieks.
</P>
<P>
   But the teacher sees you. ``Stop it!'' she says. ``Your eyes
will stick like that!''
</P>
<P>
   Will they really?
</P>
<P>
   No. The muscles that move your eyes around are designed to move
smoothly. They are attached to the skull at the back of the eye
holes (called orbits). Then the muscles run forward and attach to
the eyeball. There's nothing for them to get stuck on!
</P>
<P>
   Then why are some people cross-eyed?
</P>
<P>
   The medical term for crossed eyes is ``strabismus.'' The most
common cause of strabismus is that a person is born with it. One
muscle might be too weak and is unable to pull the eye straight. Or
a muscle might be too strong and pull the eye out of line.
</P>
<P>
   A crossed eye might be turned in or out. It might not even be
crossed all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Strabismus in adults is often caused by a problem with a nerve
that goes to an eye muscle. A nerve is like an electric line that
runs from the brain to the muscle. The nerve tells the muscle what
to do. If the ``electric line'' isn't working right, then the
muscle can't work right, either. In that case, the muscle won't
pull when it should. Then it can't keep up with the other eye, and
crossing occurs.
</P>
<P>
   If you are talking to someone with a crossed eye, it can be hard
to tell if they're looking at you. But chances are, one of their
eyes is looking at you. Just look the person in that eye!
</P>
<P>
   How your eyes move
</P>
<P>
   Each eye has six muscles attached to it. Not only do your eyes
move side to side, they also move up, down and to every position in
between. But that's not all. The eye muscles also keep the eyes
from rotating when you tilt your head. You can watch this happen.
Have a friend sit facing you. Ask him to keep looking at an object
over your shoulder. Now tell him to tilt his head toward the right
shoulder. Now the left. Did you see that? The head moved, but the
eyes didn't. Cool!
</P>
<P>
   A crossing checklist
</P>
<P>
   Have a friend sit facing you. Ask him or her to look at items in
the following checklist. Do the eyes cross? Or not?
</P>
<P>
   Write YES or NO.
</P>
<P>
   1. Look over my shoulder at the farthest thing you can see.
</P>
<P>
   2. Look over my shoulder at something about 20 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   3. Look over my shoulder at something about 10 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   4. Look at my ear.
</P>
<P>
   5. Look at my finger. (Hold it about 12 inches away.)
</P>
<P>
   6. Watch my fingertip. (Slowly move your finger closer. STOP at
2 inches.)
</P>
<P>
   7. Look at my finger (hold it 12 inches away); now look over my
shoulder, far away.
</P>
<P>
   Did you notice that the eyes crossed more when they looked at
closer objects? It's normal for the eyes to cross inward when
looking at something close up. Such crossing usually starts once an
object is closer than 20 feet, although it may be hard to notice at
first.

 &HT;    New school? Don't panic! Follow our tips to make friends
 &HT;    By Theresa W. Giarrusso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Walking into a crowded school bus or cafeteria is a
little scary for anyone. If you're at a new school, it can be extra
nerve-racking.
</P>
<P>
   This month, thousands of kids around Atlanta are trying to make
friends and get comfortable in new surroundings. We asked students
and teachers to tell us ways to break the ice. Here are their five
best tips:
</P>
<P>
   1. Look outside the classroom: Getting involved in your
neighborhood, church and clubs are great ways to meet kids from
your school.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Leverett, 13, tackled his first-day-of-school jitters on the
field. ``When I transferred to Marist last year, I was worried that
I wouldn't find any people I liked, so I wanted to meet some kids
with interests like mine.'' Jay joined the football team, which
started practicing before the school year began. ``So on the first
day I knew a bunch of people.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Concentrate on finding a buddy: Don't try to meet every
student at once. Home in on one or two kids who seem friendly and
hang with them on the bus or in the lunchroom _ both can be lonely
places.
</P>
<P>
   3. Just smile: ``It's hard to do when you're nervous,'' says
Dominique Hearnes, a seventh-grade teacher. But kids are more
likely to talk to you if you don't look like you'll bite.
</P>
<P>
   4. Be helpful to others: Offer to sharpen someone's pencil, push
them on a swing or wait with them in the lunch line. But don't take
it too far, advises Shelly Savage, a first-grade teacher. She found
a student lying on the ground, letting another student stand on her
back to reach the monkey bars. ``She was trying to be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Be curious: Hearnes says take advantage of the
get-to-know-you activities your teacher leads. Listen to what the
kids say they're into and ask them about it later. Ask about
favorite teams, Pokemon characters and video games. You can also
wonder aloud why the bus smells or offer a compliment, if it's
sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember how it feels to be new. When new students
start in the middle of the year, offer to show them around. Be the
friendly face you'd wished for earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>

Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga. Sarah Austin, 14, of Decatur
High School in Atlanta, contributed to this report. She
participated in the summer writing program at VOX, a newspaper for
teenagers.

 &HT;    POWERUSER: Springing for better monitor can be an eye-saver
 &HT;    (EDS: Can run with TECHNOBUDDY31.)
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since the first time I ventured into a dungeon and
reduced a monster to a pile of fur and gore, I've had this
half-baked notion that it would be really cool to get one of those
60-inch TV sets, hook it to a computer, turn off all the lights and
scare myself silly playing a life-size version of ``Hexen.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, re-creating the putrid tones of the dank walls of
``Hexen'' or the eerie red glow of a ``Doom'' burial chamber in the
living room is much easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   In my quest for the techno-chops to see what it would take to be
able to creep down a dungeon hallway on a giant-screen TV, I
learned a good deal about monitors, video cards and how they work
together.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things I learned is that a computer won't work
very well with a TV set. Without getting too technically obtuse,
about the best resolution I could hope for, even using specialized
_ and expensive _ converter equipment, is 640 pixels by 480 pixels,
which would look terrible ... especially on one of those monster TV
sets.
</P>
<P>
   These days, with computer manufacturers practically giving away
their machines, it makes sense to build a system around your
monitor as opposed to the CPU. Especially for people who use their
machines primarily to surf the Net, send e-mail, write letters and
play solitaire.
</P>
<P>
   It's not going to make too much difference whether the computer
you buy for those uses is a 166-MHz or a 500-MHz machine _ unless
you are using some kind of whiz-bang 3-D solitaire game. But there
is a significant difference between a 15-inch, a 17-inch, a 19-inch
and a 21-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   It makes even more sense for heavy gamers and artistic types
using complex imaging software to invest extra in a monitor because
they will be spending even more time in front of a machine.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you look at it, your eyes do most of the heavy
lifting when it comes to computers. In the long run, the money you
invest in a good monitor may save you the price of a pair of
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Like most things related to computers, there is enough
information on monitors and video cards to fill several thick
books, but a good enough understanding of how video works to make
informed choices is not so hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to know is that two things are involved that
work together but should be considered separately: the monitor and
the video card.
</P>
<P>
   In a simplified explanation, the card tells the monitor what to
display. The monitor is responsible for the display quality _
sharpness, brightness, resolution and stability. The card transfers
the data between the computer and monitor.
</P>
<P>
   So you can buy the biggest, baddest, fastest video card out
there, but if your monitor is a piece of junk, the picture will be
poor. On the other hand, a high-end monitor used with a standard
video card would most likely yield pretty decent results for casual
home users.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a whole lot to the monitor side of things. What you
see, is, um, what you get. The primary considerations when
purchasing a monitor are the refresh rate and the screen size.
</P>
<P>
   Because of cost, the most common screen size was 15 inches as
recently as a year ago, when they cost between $300 and $350. But
17-inch monitors have since fallen to around $200 and are quickly
becoming the screen size of choice, and a 19-inch monitor now costs
what a 15-inch used to cost. Don't forget, too, that screen sizes
are measured diagonally. The viewing area on a 15-inch screen is
actually about 13 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The refresh rate is measured in megahertz _ standard speeds on
new monitors these days are around 65-75 MHz _ and it is the speed
the screen is redrawn, which happens every time the cursor blinks
or moves. A lesser factor is dot pitch _ a measure of the distance
between pixels _ but anything 0.28 mm or less is good, although the
lower the dot pitch, the better.
</P>
<P>
   The most common monitors are cathode ray tube (that's the
familiar picture tube, called the CRT) and liquid crystal display
(LCD) monitors, which use liquid crystals between two polarizing
plates. The flat-panel monitors use the LCD technology and are only
a few inches thick, but they are new to the market and still priced
extremely high. Consider a flat-panel screen if space or design is
a factor _ and you have a couple of hundred spare dollars _ but a
CRT should be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   It's when you start playing games that video gets serious.
Upgrading a video card can enhance every aspect of your computer's
imaging processes.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, your computer has a card that can handle 2-D
display (or else you wouldn't be able to see anything). Systems
from a year or two ago, like my Pentium 166, have cards that handle
2-D and 3-D, albeit in a limited capacity, with 1 or 2 megabytes of
video memory. New systems these days normally come with video cards
that handle 2-D and 3-D display and have at least 4 MB _ if not 8
MB _ of video RAM.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of RAM on a card serves two purposes: the number of
colors that can be processed _ i.e., 8-bit (256 colors) or 24-bit
(16.7 million colors) _ and the speed at which images can be
rendered. Some cards _ like the S3 ViRGE in my computer _ can be
upgraded simply by adding more RAM. Different types of RAM can be
used on video cards, so check the manufacturer's info on your card
to see what it takes. In other cases. it makes more sense to add a
3-D graphics accelerator card, either in addition to or instead of
your VGA card.
</P>
<P>
   The way accelerators work is fairly straightforward. A VGA card
has no processor on it, and all graphics commands to the monitor
come from your CPU. Video accelerators have processors built onto
the card that handle most of the graphics commands and leave your
CPU and video bus free to do other things. Obviously, the more
memory on your video card, the higher the performance. When I
bought my computer a year and a half ago, 1 megabyte of video
memory was cutting edge. Nowadays it's not unusual to see several
different cards available with 16 MB or 32 MB of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   It would be great if video accelerators were no more complex
than that, but, alas, that's not the case. (We are talking about
computers, after all.)
</P>
<P>
   The processors on video cards are proprietary, which means that
each has its own set of commands. Consequently, a game _ or any
other program _ used under one type of card may perform differently
under another video accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   Another quirk to consider: No matter how much you soup up your
video card, it is limited to the top speed of your computer's video
bus. Although there seems to be some debate whether the new video
bus _ called AGP for advanced graphics port _ is really that much
better than the older PCI bus, AGP has become the standard in new
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers generally make video accelerators in both flavors
for those of us who have PCI graphics ports and don't have an AGP
slot on the motherboard. Naturally, AGP and PCI are not compatible.
</P>
<P>
   So it shouldn't seem like too big a deal to rig the TV to the
computer, right? Unfortunately, U.S. TVs are only capable of 525
vertical lines of resolution, hence the 640x480 I mentioned
earlier. The advent of HDTV, which will have about double the
resolution capabilities, undoubtedly will change the video picture
(sorry again).
</P>
<P>
   Then again, blowing the life-sized undead into little bits of
decayed flesh at that resolution might be a bit much to stomach.

 &HT;    Build Civilization that stands Test of Time
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Civilization'' is one of the most popular strategy computer
games of all time, and now a new version has been released. Called
``Civilization II: Test of Time,'' the latest release expands on
the original game by adding two new worlds. You can build your
civilization in a fantasy-based or sci-fi-based world. Or you can
use the original map of Earth. The game also has added new sounds
and special effects. ``Civilization II: Test of Time'' is available
only for PCs running Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more popular education software has been Knowledge
Adventure's Blaster series of titles for reading and math. The
company has released two new titles in this series. One is aimed at
first-graders, the other at kindergartners. The titles work on both
Macs and PCs.

 &HT;    Dorms easily outfitted on site
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you've spent any time in a Target or Wal-Mart or
Office Depot in the past few weeks, you probably have a decent idea
why CollegiateMall.com might get a few looks on the Web this year.
</P>
<P>
   The site is designed to be a place for college students to flesh
out their dorm rooms. Need a scallop-shaped trash can? How about a
bathrobe rack to hang over your bedroom door? Or maybe a nightstand
or a dresser or a backpack? CollegiateMall.com even has
partnerships with Amazon.com and VarsityBooks.com that let the site
sell music CDs and textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston-based site, started in 1998 by a Boston University
student, bills itself the one-stop college shop.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site even has a form to fill out for students interested
in becoming campus reps for CollegiateMall.com (which is also the
address for the site on the Web).
</P>
<P>
   Bankers, brokers vie for online trust
</P>
<P>
   One of the main things online bankers and brokerages hope to do
is become the place on the Web where you make your money decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The logic works something like this: If you trust one company to
handle your checking account online, you're more likely to trust
them with other financial decisions, such as buying insuranctrading stock.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Synergistics Research looks at the idea of
cross-selling from the customer's perspective. The study found that
the Web offers tremendous opportunities for banks to sell things to
their customers that they would not ordinarily sell.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of people polled said they would be interested
in handling their investments and getting life, car and homeowners
insurance from the company that handles their checking account.
</P>
<P>
   Synergistics Research asked about 1,000 people in May. The
survey also found that younger people are more interested in the
idea. Most banks are not taking advantage of the interest yet, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   Two more DVDs from Panasonic
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic Consumer Electronics has two more DVD products on the
market, starting in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Panasonic DVD-A7 sells for about $1,000, the Technics
DVD-A10 for about $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Both devices can be incorporated into your home entertainment
system. The DVD players take conventional CDs.
</P>
<P>
   DVD-Audio recordings will be reproduced with higher quality
sound. When hooked up to a television, a DVD also can reproduce
video, including graphics, text and music videos. The audio DVD
player works with DVD video discs as well, which means you can play
DVD movies.
</P>
<P>
   The two-channel DVD-Audio uses a sampling frequency of 192
kilohertz, more than four times the frequency used by a CD, to
extend the playback response to 96 kilohertz.
</P>
<P>
   Higher frequency reproduction is expected to give the audio DVD
a much better sound quality than a CD.

 &HT;    (EDS: Moving on (a) General news and (l) Lifestyle categories.)
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: The headlights of sport utility vehicles shine in my eyes!
Who do I complain to? _ G.P.A: The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration at (800) 424-9393. Headlight standards were set more
than 30 years ago by the Society of Automotive Engineers. A height
margin of 22 to 54 inches above the road surface is allowed for all
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say they (SUVs) are too big, too tall, and in
a crash, the short vehicle gets the worse of it,'' says NHTSA
spokesperson Liz Neblett. The NHTSA and SUV manufacturers have been
researching safety issues with special attention to the rollover
factor. In 1996, SUVs had the highest rate of fatal crashes
involving rollovers (37 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the criteria for getting your name on the Hollywood
Walk of Fame and how do you find out the list of names? _ Barry
Winkle
</P>
<P>
   A: The walk is a program of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
Criteria include longevity, professional achievement, community
contributions and a guarantee the star will attend the ceremony.
Want to nominate someone? Send a stamped, self-addressed envelope
to: Walk of Fame, Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, 7018 Hollywood
Blvd., Hollywood, CA 90028. To receive a complete roster (star
names, locations on the walk) send $4 to the same address.
</P>
<P>
   The first recipient? Joanne Woodward in 1960. Once a star is
selected, someone (the star, the nominator, an organization) pays
the chamber a sponsorship fee of $15,000 before the unveiling and
traditional print making.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Although I pay at least the minimum requested of my credit
card, I get every month an ``overlimit fee'' of $29 even when I
have made no other purchases in the transaction period. And they
call this $29 overlimit fee a ``purchase,'' the only one I made
during this period. Is this legal? _ P. Bailey
</P>
<P>
   A: Perfectly. Oh dear. It is legal to call the overlimit fee
(charged when customers exeed their approved credit card limit) a

   Q: I have never seen any information about when you can legally
stop using a car seat. At what point is it legal not to use a car
seat and use seat belts instead? _ Nannette Rodriguez
</P>
<P>
   A: Seat belts are designed for adults, not children.
</P>
<P>
   Car seats should be appropriate for a child's weight and size.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommends older
kids over 40 pounds ride in booster seat-- until lap and shoulder
belts fit correctly. Some booster seats are constructed for
children up to 70 or 80 pounds. The lap belt must fit low and snug
on their hips. The shoulder belt must not cross their face or neck.
Never put the shoulder belt behind a child's back or under his arm.

   Q: The headlights of sport utility vehicles shine in my eyes!
Who do I complain to? _ G.P.A: The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration at (800) 424-9393. Headlight standards were set more
than 30 years ago by the Society of Automotive Engineers. A height
margin of 22 to 54 inches above the road surface is allowed for all
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say they (SUVs) are too big, too tall, and in
a crash, the short vehicle gets the worse of it,'' says NHTSA
spokesperson Liz Neblett. The NHTSA and SUV manufacturers have been
researching safety issues with special attention to the rollover
factor. In 1996, SUVs had the highest rate of fatal crashes
involving rollovers (37 percent).

   Q: What are the criteria for getting your name on the Hollywood
Walk of Fame and how do you find out the list of names? _ Barry
Winkle
</P>
<P>
   A: The walk is a program of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
Criteria include longevity, professional achievement, community
contributions and a guarantee the star will attend the ceremony.
Want to nominate someone? Send a stamped, self-addressed envelope
to: Walk of Fame, Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, 7018 Hollywood
Blvd., Hollywood, CA 90028. To receive a complete roster (star
names, locations on the walk) send $4 to the same address.
</P>
<P>
   The first recipient? Joanne Woodward in 1960. Once a star is
selected, someone (the star, the nominator, an organization) pays
the chamber a sponsorship fee of $15,000 before the unveiling and
traditional print making.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Although I pay at least the minimum requested of my credit
card, I get every month an ``overlimit fee'' of $29 even when I
have made no other purchases in the transaction period. And they
call this $29 overlimit fee a ``purchase,'' the only one I made
during this period. Is this legal? _ P. Bailey
</P>
<P>
   A: Perfectly. Oh dear. It is legal to call the overlimit fee
(charged when customers exeed their approved credit card limit) a
purchase, says Steve Rhode, president of the nonprofit Debt
Counselors of America. To get off the merry-go-round, make more
than the minimum payment. For credit and debt counseling, contact

 &HT;    Nature: Virtual Serengeti a little brutal for children
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new CD-ROM from Grolier, by way of the television
series ``Nature,'' entitled ``Nature: Virtual Serengeti,'' is aimed
at children, and it has a great many strengths. But it will require
a certain amount of strength from the youngsters who get into it.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than just link together a series of video clips or still
shots, the producers turned out a self-contained education package.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that a researcher sent to the East African plains
has wandered off to study baboons, and your youngster is recruited
to take his place, finish his research and put together a film for
Nature magazine.
</P>
<P>
   This is less preposterous than it might seem, since from the
frequent e-mails and the stuff he wrote in the research journal,
the original researcher is no more than 10 years old himself.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the new researcher has a base camp, a Land Rover
and a plane to use in studying wildlife from the Mara River to
Amboseli.
</P>
<P>
   The all-important video is based on nodes in each area to be
visited. Each node allows a full 360-degree view by swinging the
cursor to one side of the screen or the other. By clicking on the
horizon or somewhere around it at the proper place, one moves to
another node.
</P>
<P>
   There are animals to be found at virtually every node, but they
aren't obvious. Their presence is indicated by sudden animal
noises, at which point you click around the screen until the view
zeroes in on the animal in question. The animal, and the behavior
observed, are recorded automatically in a long file. These records
can then be used to complete the research simply by connecting the
right picture to the right question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtual Serengeti'' is lavishly produced; the video and audio
are very good; and most of it really does shed interesting light on
the behavior and traits of the animals in question. But a major
slip seems to have occurred between the production and the
packaging.
</P>
<P>
   The program comes in a large, multicolored box, inside which is
the usual heavy cardboard stiffener box. When you open all this up,
all that falls out is one shrink-wrapped pasteboard CD-ROM jacket.
</P>
<P>
   There are no instructions, a rather unsettling state of affairs
that seems to be gaining momentum in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, this would be all right, because ``Virtual
Serengeti'' is not a difficult program, and it has a sort of
prelude to orient the user. Unfortunately, some of the finer points
of this prelude don't seem to be quite accurate.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it indicates that when you see a forward arrow,
you can go forward. You can't. It says you're supposed to sweep the
cursor around each view and when animals are located, it will
change to a sort of box. In practice, animals can't be located
until they make noises, and then the cursor will turn into a box at
a dozen places on the screen, some of which take you to the beast
and some of which don't. In addition, there are about a half-dozen
other cursors that pop up that are entirely unexplained and that
don't seem to do anything most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   All this is going to require a certain amount of patience on the
part of kids.
</P>
<P>
   The second caveat I'm going to issue may or may not be a
problem, depending on your attitude. I don't see it as a problem,
but I tend to put a premium on realism. ``Virtual Serengeti'' is
realistic. Animals die, often violently, which is usually the way
death comes in this part of the world, where the food chain is
plain for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nature shows on television now don't bat an eye at
this sort of thing, and kids who'd be interested in this program
have probably seen a lot of such shows. But you'll have to be the
judge of that.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Serengeti costs $30, and if you can't find it locally
you can order it from gi.grolier.com.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: School vouchers are unconstitutional and unwise
 &HT;    (Eds: Fixes garble.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're a long way from a definitive ruling on whether using tax
money to send kids to religious schools is constitutional, but the
finding by a federal district court in Ohio that there's probable
cause to suspect a church-state violation in Cleveland's program
may hint at what's to come.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of vouchers are reacting as if the very idea of
judicial review were novel to the point of abomination. Clint
Bolick, litigation director of the Institute of Justice, which
argued for the Cleveland program, called the ruling by Judge
Solomon Oliver Jr. ``an outrageous abuse of judicial power.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, instead, a perfectly ordinary, indeed predictable,
finding. It was inevitable that the constitutionality of vouchers
would be tested in federal courts, and Judge Oliver's ruling
follows one in Maine earlier this year that barred the use of
public money to pay tuitions at a Roman Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, mainly, have rallied to vouchers not only as a
cure-all for any- and everything wrong with public schools but as
the sole allowable fix. Even a proposed national program to repair
dilapidated schools has flopped in Congress partly out of a dug-in
ideological dismissal of public education on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Hyped now as an educational nostrum, vouchers were created as a
political device to slip a nice little payoff to new Republican
constituencies _ first to the blue-collar Democrats,
disproportionately Catholic and with kids in parochial schools, who
went with Ronald Reagan, then to the Protestant fundamentalists of
the religious right, with their growing number of Christian
academies.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that competition for students might incite better
schools is not without promise, but tellingly, most voucher backers
have been indifferent to proposals for open-enrollment competition
among public schools or to plans that would limit vouchers to
private nonsectarian schools.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's endorsement of public-school vouchers has
been left on the table untouched for six years. The voucher
movement gets much of its oomph from an unacknowledged animus
toward secular education. It is not happenstance that, as Judge
Oliver noted, the overwhelming majority of schools benefiting from
the Cleveland vouchers are religious.
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers drain funds from public schools, which are then
supposed, somehow, to improve themselves. Broadly adopted, they
would create a huge new entitlement program and let private schools
raise tuitions in confidence that parents would demand that voucher
values keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's that absolutely basic constitutional issue.
</P>
<P>
   If using tax money to encourage the creation of sectarian school
systems is not an unconstitutional ``establishment'' of religion,
little will be left of church-state separation.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools have been bringing Americans together for over
100 years. Do we really want, instead, to divide ourselves by
religion and then fight over the money?

talking about nothing. Now they do the same thing on a computer _
with as many friends, near and far, as their young brains can
juggle at once without exploding. Teens today spend hours at a
sitting shooting the electronic breeze with online buddies,
sometimes five or six at a time, no matter if they're across the
street or across an ocean. ``It's hot beyond belief. Young kids can
be in touch with their group at any time. And they can be talking

   WALKER-COLUMN _ LONGVIEW, Texas _ ``If you don't have anything
in your car, you don't have anything to worry about.'' That's what
a Texas state trooper told a friend of my daughter's after he was
stopped on Interstate 20 and for the third time in three months
told that an officer needed to search his car for drugs. (Walker,
Longview News-Journal). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ So, it turns out on closer examination,
listening to Mozart doesn't make you smarter, except a little bit
and maybe for a nanosecond. Mozart's music is merely a pleasure _
but for a long time. Isn't that good enough? (Rosenfeld, Cox News

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio. Most mornings I take my first
cup of coffee and the laptop to the front porch and settle into the
old wicker swing, pretending to work. I manage to fool everyone but
myself. Folks walking by wave and ask if I'm writing about them. I
assure them their darkest secrets will be headlines by Tuesday.
They grin and keep going. (Schuett, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   KABAT-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Oh, vanity of vanities. It's no
secret I have terrible eyesight. If faith, as the Bible tells us,
is believing in what we cannot see, then my faith is growing
abundantly. (Kabat, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Any scientific theory that
brings soft music to nurseries, induces state legislators to praise
the great composers and moves classical music product off the
shelves is a good thing. Not necessarily a true thing, but a good
thing. That's why I was sorry to read that scientists had debunked
the so-called ``Mozart effect.'' Perhaps someone will re-bunk it.

   TECH-INSTANT _ Until just a few years ago _ eons by today's
cyber standards _ teen-agers used to spend hours on the phone just
talking about nothing. Now they do the same thing on a computer _
with as many friends, near and far, as their young brains can
juggle at once without exploding. Teens today spend hours at a
sitting shooting the electronic breeze with online buddies,
sometimes five or six at a time, no matter if they're across the
street or across an ocean. ``It's hot beyond belief. Young kids can
be in touch with their group at any time. And they can be talking
to multiple groups at once,'' said Roger Carlsen, a University of
Dayton professor who is an instructor and consultant in educational
technology. (DeBrosse, Dayton Daily News) MOVED FRIDAY.

   NETWATCH _ Personal information is rapidly becoming the Web's

that information is the Internet's most valuable currency. (Katz,

   TECHNOBUDDY_ ATLANTA _ Serious gamers will get nothing from my
adventure. They use top-of-the-line machines and spend hours

MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-TOOLS _ ATLANTA _ A new CD-ROM from Grolier, by way of the
television series ``Nature,'' entitled ``Nature: Virtual
Serengeti,'' is aimed at children, and it has a great many
strengths. But it will require a certain amount of strength from
the youngsters who get into it. (Warner, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH _ ATLANTA _ It's always something when it comes to the
new frontier of downloading and paying for music from the Internet.
Atlantic Records put a bold foot forward and decided to market the
new Tori Amos song ``Bliss'' as a secure downloadable track for
sale over the Internet. About 10 minutes later, somebody hacked the
song so it could be downloaded for free. This is essentially the
online equivalent of shoplifting, and nobody's too happy about it.

<P>
   ARMY-ADS (San Antonio) _ The Army's famed jingle, ``Be all that
you can be,'' may be history. Army Secretary Louis Caldera said his
service will take a hard look at the future of slogan, which was
introduced in 1981. The slogan was listed by Advertising Age
magazine as the century's No. 2 commercial tune, beaten out only by
McDonalds' theme, ``You deserve a break today.'' By SIG
CHRISTENSON.
</P>
<P>
   BREWER-PROFILE (Bryan, Texas) _ Lawrence Russell Brewer, the
quiet son of fundamentalist Christians, became a thief. When he
landed in prison for burglary at age 19, and later returned for
cocaine possession and parole violations, he seemed to embrace
inmate life. This week, Brewer becomes the second man to stand
trial for the capital murder of James Byrd Jr., the black man
dragged to death last year in Jasper. Jury selection begins
Tuesday. By PATTY REINERT.
</P>
<P>
   CRIMES-TEXAS (Del Rio, Texas) _ A federal mandate to prosecute
more drug and immigration crime is straining the federal courts in
Texas and setting justice on a collision course with the
constitutional rights of the accused. There has been a 74 percent
increase in the number of criminal cases filed in the federal court
in the Southern District of Texas _ the bulk of which are petty
drug possession or illegal entry/re-entry into the country. By
DEBORAH TEDFORD.
</P>
<P>
   DESIGNER-DRUGS (Houston) _ In this day of premanufactured
pharmaceuticals there is still a need for medications made the
old-fashioned way _ with mortar and pestle. Called compounding,
this specialty is a small but growing field that's filling a
valuable medical service. By LISA DAVIS.
</P>
<P>
   PERFECT-STORM (Corpus Christi, Texas) _ Could Hurricane Bret
have been the ``perfect storm?'' Marine researchers think so. Major
tropical storms are the best way to unclog some of the Gulf coast's
silt-filled, brown-tide-damaged bays and estuaries. The storm,
which caused little damage and no deaths when it hit Texas, may
have helped restore the natural balance of fresh and salt water
necessary for many forms of coastal wildlife. By JAMES PINKERTON.

   BOOK-STORM-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at Erik Larson's book,
``Isaac's Storm,'' which tells the story of the 1900 hurricane that
destroyed Galveston, Texas. By BOB TUTT.
</P>
<P>
   AUDIO-BOOKS (Undated) _ Vince Flynn's ``Transfer of Power'' is a
significant improvement over his political thriller ``Term
Limits.'' Sure, ``Transfer'' contains some roll-your-eyes plot
developments and capitalizes on well-worn stereotypes. But Flynn is
clearly working harder this time out. By DOUG BLACKBURN.
</P>
<P>
   TV-REVIEW-PARKERS (Undated) _ Give UPN credit for launching one
of the few TV shows this season that has an African American cast.
Then subtract points for airing yet another sitcom that's as
predictable and rim-shot rote as they come. ``The Parkers'' is a
spinoff from one of UPN's longest-running hits, ``Moesha.'' But any
resemblance _ especially to quality _ ends there. By TIM GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-HOLLY-FLAP (Undated) _ A look at the flap over the annual
Labor Day music festival in Lubbock, Texas, honoring rock 'n' roll
legend Buddy Holly. His widow, Maria Elena Holly of Dallas, has

the event to Holly with licensing rights. By JIM HENDERSON.

<P>
   AMPUTEE-INVENTOR (Brazoria, Texas) _ After losing a hand in an
industrial accident, Ron Farquharson got a prosthesis on that arm
with a hook on the end. But years of frustration at trying to use
tools and kitchen implements with the hook led him and a co-worker
to design and make a ``terminal device'' _ a receptor attachment
for the end of a prosthetic arm. All kinds of specially adapted
tools can be snapped onto the end and turned to 45-degree angles or
rotated 360 degrees. By STEVE OLAFSON. (Photo available on NYT
database).
</P>
<P>
   BARLOW-COLUMN (Houston) _ Cellular phones and driving just don't
mix. It's dangerous to drive while talking on the phone. A Toronto
study concludes that people who talk and drive are moving about as
well as someone who has quaffed the legal limit of alcohol. Three
countries _ Brazil, Israel and Australia _ have banned the use of
telephones while driving. Don't expect similar legislation in the
United States. By JIM BARLOW.
</P>
<P>
   CONVEX-MIRRORS (Troy, N.Y.) _ Convex mirrors became the fashion
in the late 18th and early 19th century. The mirrors, also called
``bull's-eye,'' were popular in the neoclassical era, the Federal
period and with Hepplewhite furnishings, which have graceful
curves. One type, the girandole looking glass, often features a
branched candleholder. By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS.
</P>
<P>
   TREASURES-JUNK (Houston) _ Van Goghs in the garage, Rembrandts
in the attic? Here's how to tell if your family's long-neglected
collectibles actually might be worth something in today's art and
antique market. By PATRICIA C. JOHNSON.
</P>
<P>
   BIKE-TRAILS-HOUSTON (Houston) _ Deep in the urban heart of
Houston _ a place known for its relentless flatness _ lies a
near-wilderness startling in its verticality. Now, the park and its
proper use are at the center of a shrill debate between thousands
of youthful off-road mountain bikers and the park's traditional
defenders, the Memorial Park Advisory Board. The 1,500-acre park is
a haven for weary city-dwellers. By ALLAN TURNER. (Photo available
on NYT database).
</P>
<P>
   DORM-TEXAS (College Station, Texas) _ Hart Hall, traditionally
an all-male bastion of stoics at Texas A&AMP;M University, is now coed.
The dormitory, the cheapest housing on campus, is also without air
conditioning. Now women can sweat it out with their male
counterparts. Oh boy! By PATTY REINERT.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ A reader asks, ``Branches are breaking
off the pecan trees in my neighborhood. The limbs do not seem to
have any insect damage and seem healthy. Is it because of the
earlier summer rains that are causing the limbs to be too heavy to
support the heavy pecan load? Is there anything that can be done to
prevent further damage to the trees?''Assorted Q&AMP;As. By KATHY
HUBER.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   DRILLING-TECHNOLOGY (Houston) _ Deepwater drilling is on the
cusp of huge technological advances, says Marshall Adkins, an
energy service analyst in Houston for Raymond James &AMP; Associates,
an institutional research firm. Most technologies to date have been
evolutionary, according to Adkins. The revolutionary ones will be
in fiber optics, in deepwater drilling, underbalanced drilling and
in seismic data collection, he predicts. ``We are on the edge.'' By
NELSON ANTOSH.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL (``t'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-COLUMN (Houston) _ He seemed perfectly sane when he
stopped by the office some time ago. Polite. Soft-spoken.
Articulate. Feet planted firmly on the floor. So why does Doug
Lansky insist on lassoing reindeer above the Arctic Circle in
Sweden? Playing underwater hockey in Australia? Participating in
the world's largest tomato fight in Spain? And why is he now on a
five-month honeymoon that began last week with stops in Uganda,
Rwanda and Kenya and will continue at sumo wrestling school in
Japan? By HARRY SHATTUCK.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-REDRIVER (Undated) _ In the Red River Valley, which hugs
the Texas-Oklahoma border, the legends are larger, the fish seem
bigger and the days are filled with delightful discoveries. When
not pausing to watch the light shimmer on an area lake, take time
to savor the nostalgia of an authentic town square. Here beside the
courthouse or on Main Street, the personality of the region _ and
its people _ is best defined. By SYD KEARNEY. (Photos available on
the NYT database).
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-REDRIVER-GIMMICKS (Undated) _ You gotta have a gimmick,
young Gypsy Rose Lee was advised in the popular musical ``Gypsy.''
Those words of wisdom ring true for tourist-hungry towns as well as
entertainers, and towns in the Red River Valley tout attractions as
diverse as an Eiffel Tower (in Paris) to a two-state post office
(in Texarkana). By SYD KEARNEY. (Photos available on the NYT
database).
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ California's best places in
the great outdoors are a mystery. Hell Hole Reservoir, set deep on
the west flank of the Sierra Nevada, is much like this. I became
transfixed by this long, narrow lake set in a granite gorge. The
lake was obviously remote, yet accessible by car, with a paved road
all the way in. By TOM STIENSTRA.
</P>
<P>
   RATTO-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The story was floated deftly, so
that it would sort of stick to the back of your brain rather than
hit you flush in the face. Plus, there were no fingerprints to lead
the reader anywhere. The story was that there have been some
backchannel discussions among baseball executives about buying out
a few of the straggling teams, presumably to save their cities the
shame of having to tolerate underfunded baseball any longer. The
four cities mentioned were Minnesota, Kansas City, Montreal and
Oakland. By RAY RATTO.
</P>
<P>
   GLF-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Golf is an old game, but its fans
may be younger than ever. And one 23-year-old is sounding almost
fatherly in expressing concern about where this may lead. Tiger
Woods was talking specifically about next month's Ryder Cup in
Brookline, Mass., in light of the boisterousness of the fans during
his battle with Sergio Garcia at the PGA Championship two weeks
ago. By SUSAN FORNOFF.

<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Yet another newspaper columnist
was fired last week for allegedly making up people and quotes. Now
I've decided to come clean. After all, this column is nearly 12
years running; that's a tanker truck full of material that The San
Francisco Examiner could investigate and find bogus. By STEPHANIE
SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) _ It was almost refreshing last
week when the federal health experts at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention renewed debate over the tobacco settlements
negotiated by Texas and other states. The CDC's No. 1 concern is
whether Texas and other states are making the best possible use of
their tobacco dollars to fight smoking, the single most preventable
cause of death and disease in the United States and, supposedly,
the main reason the states sued cigarette companies in the first
place. By CLAY ROBISON.
</P>
<P>
   DYING (Medford, N.J.) _ Americans take dying much too seriously.
Death is serious, but dying is just a step on the way, a place
where you can choose, by the way you think, to be very much alive.
Unfortunately, once other people know you're dying, they think they
have to say things like, ``I'm so sorry,'' when what you really
wish they would do is tell you a good joke. By DALE O'REILLEY.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Small steps across life's big intersection
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Most mornings I take my first cup of coffee
and the laptop to the front porch and settle into the old wicker
swing, pretending to work. I manage to fool everyone but myself.
Folks walking by wave and ask if I'm writing about them. I assure
them their darkest secrets will be headlines by Tuesday. They grin
and keep going.
</P>
<P>
   This morning a pretty blonde lady on an old balloon-tire bicycle
and her two young daughters, each on a miniature of mom's bike, are
out for an early ride. They have a system. Mom pedals up to the
intersection and raises her arm. The chicks lined up behind her go
for their brakes. Then, Mom wheels her bike to the middle of the
street, looks both ways before declaring it safe for the girls to
cross. She stays there, on guard, until the tots are out of harm's
way. They pedal on. The little girls are pleased about crossing a
big street. I can hear them chatter excitedly as they ride away.
</P>
<P>
   One spring afternoon, shortly after I'd moved here 15 years ago,
a very young boy climbed the big front stairs to my porch and asked
me if I wanted to buy some ``stuff'' to help out his ball team. He
wasn't sure what it was he was selling, but insisted it was really
good stuff and that I probably needed some. He was so cute and his
sales pitch so earnest, I purchase some just to be sure I never ran
out of ``stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   As I filled in the order form, I asked him how business was. He
looked at me, shook his head, and explained that it wasn't too bad
but would have been a whole lot better if only his mom would let
him cross the street. He was four.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, the young salesman was in one of my English
classes. Now he's a sophomore at the university, crossing big
streets and everything. Whatever his mama taught him worked.
</P>
<P>
   The year I began kindergarten, my mother walked me to and from
school every day because there were two streets to cross. They were
just little neighborhood streets, but the way my mother carried on,
you would have thought it was Chicago's Dan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   By first grade I was feeling pretty grown up _ I had school
supplies _ pencils, paste, and a bag to carry it all in. I asked to
be allowed to walk to school with the other kids - without my
mother. No way!
</P>
<P>
   Second grade, I tried again and got the same answer. I argued
there was a war on and since gas was rationed there would be fewer
cars on the road. Mother reminded me that old Mr. Kelly had a ``B''
sticker and was still racing around the neighborhood in second gear
(he'd forgotten how to shift, Daddy said), and until he parked his
old Ford I was not crossing a street alone.
</P>
<P>
   Third grade the major threat to my safety was Herman Preefer, a
mean kid who wore striped T-shirts and corduroy knickers. Still, my
mother made ready to walk me to school. This time I had a fit and
sat my backside on the sidewalk insisting the only way she was
going to take me to school would be to drag me. So she did.
</P>
<P>
   That evening at dinner Mother described the scene to my father.
He frowned and made me eat peas. That's when I began to suspect my
mother would be walking me to school until I was old enough to
drive _ or vote _ whichever came first.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, my father was moved by logic _ when I explained his
wife was ruining my social life by not letting me walk alone with
my friends he suggested I let her follow at a distance. I was
adamant. He said we'd give it a try my way, but if ever I should be
observed behaving recklessly at a crossing, I would be tossed into
the car and driven to school for the rest of my life. I was
ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, I took off on my own. First, I hid my green
leggings in the Bartel's hedge (big kids didn't wear those baby
things), then I joined my friends. Man, was I cool or what! Then
Arthur Corbett kissed me.
</P>
<P>
   I went screaming home, begging my mother to walk me to school
until Arthur got over it. She refused.
</P>
<P>
   That was when I began to suspect being grown up isn't all it's
cracked up to be.

BOSTON'S WATERFRONT COMES CLEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN HOLDER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   BOSTON _ It's cold. The wind is
blowing. And it has been raining, on and off, all morning. The kind
of morning when you wake up and say, ``What a great day to visit a
wastewater treatment plant!''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deborah Burwick might have thought so, but most of her charges
didn't. They didn't show up.
</P>
<P>
   Only three students from Burwick's class for displaced workers
made it out to the Deer Island Treatment Plant in Boston Harbor.
They missed seeing the $3.8 billion plant and learning what an
important role it has played over the last few years in the
incredible cleanup of Boston Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never ate a lobster from Boston Harbor the last few years
because I knew the harbor was dirty,'' said tour guide Bernie
Devlin, an operations liaison for the Massachusetts Water Resources
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   That's no longer true. The harbor is safe again for lobsters and
other ocean life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing rumors of aquatic life they haven't seen in years
out there,'' Devlin said. Healthy lobsters. Harbor seals. And
people.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago that Boston Harbor was a laughingstock. In
the 1988 presidential campaign George Bush embarrassed rival
Michael Dukakis, Massachusetts' governor at the time, when he
called Boston Harbor the dirtiest in America.
</P>
<P>
   Now gleaming new hotels welcome well-heeled guests to the
waterfront. The Temptations, Willie Nelson and Donna Summer brought
yuppie suburbanites to a summer pavilion in the Seaport District. A
federal courthouse opened on Fan Pier last year, and plans call for
a $695 million convention center. Construction is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Curtis, director of communications for the year-old Seaport
Hotel and nearby World Trade Center, points enthusiastically to
what will be.
</P>
<P>
   On Fan Pier, she said, two Hyatt hotels are to be built. Retail,
office and residential developments are in the works. Charter boats
and water taxis already launch from the area.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the concert series at the 5,000-seat Bank Boston
Pavilion, a Boston radio station sponsored a series of ``Smooth
Jazz'' cruises every Friday night this summer. And earlier this
month the Celebrate Seaport Festival brought people in for canoeing
and kayaking, antiques and a farmers market. A new line of the
``T,'' Boston's subway system, is under construction, leading to an
eventual Seaport station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waterfront is the area for development,'' says Vivien Li,
executive director of the Boston Harbor Association. ``This mayor
(Thomas M. Menino) has decided that his legacy will be development
along the waterfront.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Harbor Association was founded in 1973 by the Boston
Shipping Association and the League of Women Voters. For the last
eight years, Li has been executive director of the group, now
primarily made up of business people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first years, cleaning was the key to us,'' she said,
pointing out that the state has spent $30 million on that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Beaches are monitored daily. ``The water is significantly
cleaner,'' she said. ``You can actually swim in it, unless it rains
more than half an inch.'' Even then swimmers can generally return
after 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Now cleanup is just one concern, evidenced by the abundance of
construction projects. The harbor area has proved an attractive
place to live for a lot of very successful people, Li said,
particularly empty nesters in their 50s and 60s. Condominiums in
the area sell for $450,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   But that kind of success isn't what drives Li, a longtime
activist and environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto is a clean, alive and accessible harbor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Accessibility is key to her. The harbor association has been
instrumental in the development of the HarborWalk, a half-completed
project that eventually will become a 43-mile continuous walkway
around the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   She points with pride to certain businesses that have been
particularly welcoming, and not just to paying clients.
</P>
<P>
   - On Rowes Wharf, for example, Foster's Rotunda in the Boston
Harbor Hotel is an elegant retreat, offering its space for free at
midday for people to sit and watch the harbor's activities through
its large windows.
</P>
<P>
   - The historic Marriott's Custom House, built in 1847, offers
free historical tours at 4 p.m. daily. You can peer into the inner
workings of the tower's famous clock, 221/2 feet in diameter. And
the observation deck offers a magnificent view from the 26th
floor..MDNM/
</P>
<P>
   - Even the Marriott Long Wharf hotel, which Li had long
criticized for its lack of public access, now offers public
restrooms and tables, seating for public use and water
transportation connections.
</P>
<P>
   Access will be crucial to the long-term success of the harbor as
a destination. Right now it's tough even to get there because of
the Big Dig, a $10.8 billion project that, among other things, is
sending 71/2 miles of Boston's Central Artery underground. Eight to
10 lanes of expressway will be hidden below 27 acres of new park
land.
</P>
<P>
   That's still five years away. And even though Bostonians are
used to congested and busy roads, traffic can be a nightmare if
you're anywhere close to the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Go anyway. The promises of what the harbor will be shouldn't
deter you from seeing what's already there. You might even start at
the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   Just across from the New England Aquarium, the Big Dig Visitor
Center puts everything in perspective. Displays help explain the
reasons behind the project _ 200,000 cars a day. They tell what has
already taken place and what's happening now, and a model of the
project puts everything into perspective. The kids can even dig
into a mini-construction site.
</P>
<P>
   If the Big Dig center is a brief diversion, the aquarium on
Central Wharf is a destination. It centers on a four-story, 200,000
gallon circular tank surrounded by a penguin rookery. As you walk
the spiraling ramp to the top, watch out for the sand tiger sharks,
moray eels, sea turtles and hundreds of tropical fish. Check out
the Aquarium Medical Center, a working animal care laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Boston advertises itself as America's Most Walkable City, and
it's especially true along the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes south of the aquarium, just across the Congress
Street Bridge, you'll see a huge inflated Arthur, the cartoon
aardvark. He's welcoming kids to the Children's Museum. Inside,
they'll find more of ``Arthur's World,'' plus a giant's desktop and
an 800-gallon replica of the Fort Point Channel scene outside the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Next, stop at the Boston Tea Party Ship &AMP; Museum, on the
Congress Street Bridge, where you might think you've wandered into
a comedy club.
</P>
<P>
   The history is serious here, aboard a replica of the Brig
Beaver, one of three ships from which patriot tax protesters dumped
342 crates of tea from nearby Griffin's Wharf in December 1773. But
this place also recognizes the potential for silliness. As an
actress explains how the tea party came about, she encourages
visitors to shout ``Fie!'' on taxes and ``Dump the Tea! Into the
Sea!''
</P>
<P>
   Willing participants can re-enact the tea party, wearing
``simple but effective'' day-glo blue ``Mohawk'' feathers. They can
even dump crates into the harbor (don't worry, they're roped to the
ship). Best of all, perhaps, is a cup of tax-free tea.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you'd want to, it's virtually impossible to ignore the
history in Boston. Head north along the harbor past Christopher
Columbus Park, and you'll quickly find yourself in the North End,
one of Boston's oldest working neighborhoods and among the most
historic.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a good chance to wander inland just a few blocks (OK,
maybe we're cheating, but the North End is too good to pass up).
See that red painted line snaking along the sidewalk? It means
you're on the Freedom Trail, which connects 16 historic sites
throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   One stop is Paul Revere's house, built in 1680 and one of the
few pieces of 17th-century architecture remaining in Boston. Here
you'll learn that Revere's midnight ride was partly myth. He didn't
ride through the streets yelling, ``The British are coming!''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1774 we had not declared independence, so technically
everybody was British,'' a guide says. Moreover, to avoid arrest
``most likely he stopped at individual doors to alert people.''
</P>
<P>
   It's comforting to learn, then, that your schoolbooks were a
little more accurate when it comes to the Old North Church, an
active Episcopal congregation a few blocks away. A plaque in front
of the 1723 building reads: ``The signal lanterns of Paul Revere
displayed in the steeple of the church April 18, 1775, warned the
country of the march of the British troops to Lexington and
Concord.''
</P>
<P>
   Historic or not, the North End is a fascinating place to spend
an afternoon. It's the kind of neighborhood where old men sit on
benches, chewing on cigar stubs, and white-haired women lean out
their windows, watching the cigar-chewing men (and the tourists).
Where Mom-and-Pop groceries and Italian restaurants nestle among
the apartment buildings and the churches and ball fields.
</P>
<P>
   But the harbor calls. Just a few blocks and you're back on the
water, across the Charlestown Bridge from the USS Constitution,
which first launched in 1797 and gained its nickname, ``Old
Ironsides,'' in the War of 1812.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's still a commissioned warship (with a crew of 71
officers and seamen), the Constitution is more of a museum than
anything else these days. Sailors offer free guided tours, during
which you'll learn, among other things, that ``Old Ironsides'' is a
misnomer; the ship got its nickname because of the strength of its
oak sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution also offers a pretty good place to survey the
Boston skyline. Peer past that ship's masts, and you can see the
American history. Keep looking and you can see city's future.
</P>
<P>
   Out on Deer Island, Bernie Devlin sees it every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago,'' he said, ``I could count the number of
boats in the harbor. Now I guarantee you won't be able to count
them all.''

When the harbor isn't enough ...
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the developing harborfront, Boston is a virtual must-do
list. A few choices:
</P>
<P>
   1. Find pleasure in the Common. Boston Common, covering 50 acres
in the city's heart, is reported to be the country's oldest public
park. It's still a great place to find a park bench, rest your feet
and people-watch. Or ...
</P>
<P>
   2. Make your way to the ducklings. Bronze sculptures of Mrs.
Mallard and her eight ducklings _ made famous in Robert McCloskey's
children's book Make Way for Ducklings, waddle through Boston
Common near Beacon and Charles streets.
</P>
<P>
   3. Or ride a duck. Boston Duck Tours offers narrated excursions
on renovated World War II amphibious landing vehicles. You'll get a
view of Boston 1) by land and 2) by sea. Call (617) 723-DUCK.
</P>
<P>
   4. Pay your respects at the Holocaust Memorial. Six five-story
green glass columns are filled on all sides with identification
numbers representing the Jews who were killed during the Holocaust.
The memorial is at Union Park across from City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   5. Have lunch at Fanueil Hall. In the 18th century, Fanueil Hall
(between Congress Street and Merchants Row) was a food market, as
well as a meeting hall. It serves much the same purpose today, with
dozens of food stalls and shops. Hint: To find the meeting hall
where the revolutionary patriots met, look for the center doors and
head upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   6. Look for Norm's bar stool. The Bull &AMP; Finch, 84 Beacon St.,
is the place where everybody knows your name, the inspiration for
the TV series ``Cheers.'' Truth is, there's a lot more ``Cheers''
here than there is ``Bull &AMP; Finch.'' Call (617) 227-9605.
</P>
<P>
   7. Find time for Fenway. The Red Sox's days are numbered in
historic old Fenway Park, where Babe Ruth, Ted Williams and Carl
Yastrzemski played (not to mention Pedro Martinez and Nomar
Garciaparra), but there's still time to see the Green Monster. The
Sox hope to move into a new Fenway by 2003. Call (617) 482-4SOX or
visit www.redsox.com
</P>
<P>
   8. Visit the Oval Office. Besides exhibits on the president and
an Oval Office replica, the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum (at
Columbia Point in the Dorchester neighborhood) features displays on
first lady Jacqueline Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy, who served his
brother as attorney general. Call (617) 929-4500 or visit
www.cs.umb.edu//jfklibrary/main.html
</P>
<P>
   9. Take in a show. Boston has a lively theater district, with
several Broadway-style venues and stars. Check out the booth at
Fanueil Hall for half-price tickets the day of the show. Or call
(617) 482-BTIX.
</P>
<P>
   10. Say ``I went to Harvard'' (if only for the afternoon).
Cambridge, the home of Harvard University, is just across the
Charles River. You can soak up plenty of atmosphere, if not
education, here.

IN COLORADO, YMCA ACREAGES ARE NEW PLACES FOR FAMILY REUNIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN UHLENHUTH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   ESTES PARK, Colo. _ Somewhere,
somehow, a rocking-chair rumor got started about this place.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There are no rocking chairs on our porch,'' Dave Thomas told
me over the phone with a finality that left no room for hope.
``That's a figment of someone's imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Benches and Adirondack chairs they do have at the YMCA of the
Rockies meeting center here. And an awesome view to go with them.
And a cafeteria that seats 600. And an auditorium with chairs for
800. And 530 lodge rooms. And 205 cabins set back in the fringes.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the facilities were built decades ago to
accommodate conferences of church members and young people, school
and recreational groups, in more recent years this has become a
magnet for grannies and grandpas, aunts and uncles, siblings,
grandchildren and cousins.
</P>
<P>
   The YMCA's Estes Park Center, and its sister center, Snow
Mountain Ranch near Winter Park, Colo., now find themselves in the
family-reunion business. And a booming business it has proven to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say they certainly are right up there at the top in
terms of number of reunions they hold,'' said Edith Wagner, editor
of Reunions magazine, based in Milwaukee. ``The YMCA does recruit
reunions and really does an excellent job.''
</P>
<P>
   In an average year, the two Colorado Y centers, which more or
less flank Rocky Mountain National Park on the east and southwest
sides, play host to about 650 family reunions, according to Thomas,
the marketing director for both of them. They've become such
popular sites for big family get-togethers that for extremely
popular times of the year, such as the Fourth of July, ``you'd
better say you want it in the year 2020,'' Wagner jokingly said.
</P>
<P>
   The Y's have much to offer to far-flung extended families.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're less expensive than a lot of other places,'' Wagner
said. ``They offer a lot of options. You can eat there or not eat
there. They have dorms, they have places like motels, they have
lodges, they have cabins and they're adjacent to camping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their location is spectacular. There's so much happening
around them. The land they cover is huge, too. This is not a tiny
little place like a hotel. It's humongous.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, she said, ``They have anything you would want to do
right on site.'' The options include horseback riding, swimming,
golf and the miniature version, arts and crafts, hiking and biking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lends itself to families that want to do a couple of
different things,'' Wagner said, and to parents who'd like a wee
bit of time away from their children. The Y's offer day camp for
children and adolescents from 3 through 17, setting their parents
free to pursue their own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Henderek, communications assistant for the centers, said
that the facilities' relative isolation gives many parents ``a
sense of safety. They don't feel that they have to take their kids
everywhere. They let their kids walk to the program office and the
pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is a Christian presence at the centers _ both
have a chapel and a chaplain and strive to provide service that is
infused with Christian values _ Henderek said there is no
proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't push it. You don't have to be a Christian to come
here. We have Jewish groups, Muslim groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Swinton heard about the Y from her son, who was a pastor
for a time in a church in nearby Littleton, Colo. Over the years,
one or another of her husband's cousins occasionally proposed a
reunion, and Swinton figured that a place where the guests wouldn't
have to cook, and with a mountain backdrop, would be just the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The location is ``an extra inducement to get people to come,''
said her husband, Jerrold Swinton, a Methodist minister in their
hometown of Waterloo, Iowa. ``The second and third generations need
an extra inducement. To get people to leave California ... they're
not sure there is civilization beyond. Tcome to the
Rockies.''
</P>
<P>
   And come they did, from as far away as North Carolina, Texas
and, yes, California. It was a relatively short trip for Bruce
Giddings and his wife, Melissa, who live in Logan, Utah. They
appreciated the freedom and the multitude of options provided by
the Estes Park Center and by Bruce's relatives, who persuaded about
60 members of the Giddings clan to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many things to do here,'' Melissa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice in that it's not structured all day long,'' Bruce
said. He and his wife felt free to spend the days on their own,
especially hiking next door at Rocky Mountain National Park, and
returning for the nightly reunion get-together from 7 to 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Giddingses were an unmistakable presence at the Estes Park
Center in late July, with their color-coded T-shirts that said,
``Giddings Family Reunion _ Estes Park, Colo. _ July 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Descendants of Jerrold's mother and her four siblings were
present. Each of the five branches had its own T-shirt color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I'd recognize them without their shirts on,''
said Bruce, who recalls meeting just a few of his relations when he
was a boy three decades ago. ``It's pretty much strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   The entourage had a block of rooms in a hotel-type building, as
well as the use of a common area where they had a get-together each
evening amid tables with displays of family
me.MDBO/.MDSD/.MDNM/mentos.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors find a variety of uses for their meeting space,
Henderek said. Some families set up a family tree. Some work on
quilts.
</P>
<P>
   Having been to a reunion of the other side of his family in
which things were a bit less orderly and there wasn't enough food
to go around, Bruce had praise for the way in which this one
unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good place. We are all in the same place. It's
fairly easy. I'm impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Y's Estes Park Center opened for business in 1909, and
the Snow Mountain Ranch about opened 60 years later, they were
geared toward conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably 20 years ago, we began to see a lot of family
reunions,'' said Thomas, the marketing director. ``They said they
wanted the same services conferences wanted _ lodging, meals,
meeting space, recreation. Since we had that in place, we began to
see a lot of family reunions coming to both centers. We began to
book them more or less as fill-in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reunions have grown like crazy. I don't want to say
they've crowded out conferences, but they have filled in more
vacancies than we ever thought they might.''
</P>
<P>
   The two centers have some distinct differences. Snow Mountain,
which can accommodate about 2,000 people, is situated on 5,100
acres about 12 miles from the town of Winter Park. Estes Park
Center can house about 4,000 people and is situated on 860 acres
just a short walk from the town of Estes Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people like going into town, they'll have more access at
Estes Park,'' Henderek said. ``We've had family groups go to both
places. Some love Snow Mountain Ranch, some like Estes Park. It's
an emotional thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow Mountain has an extensive network of trails for hiking,
biking and cross-country skiing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be biking and not see a car at all,'' Henderek said.
The Estes Park Center has much more ``hustle and bustle,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Snow Mountain resort is on the west side of the
Continental Divide, within easy reach of major downhill ski
resorts. The Estes Park Center is on the east side of the divide,
much farther from Alpine skiing opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Both centers, however, are structured in a way that encourages
family togetherness. Take the room furnishings, for example: You
could probably count on two hands the number of televisions at both
centers combined. It's partly a response to poor reception and
partly aimed at fostering family togetherness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The YMCA philosophy is to encourage family interaction, so the
rooms have no TV or radio,'' said Holly Dugan, assistant conference
director at Snow Mountain Ranch. ``Some people are surprised by
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A few televisions and videocassette recorders are available for
rent by those experiencing withdrawal symptoms, however.
</P>
<P>
   And the sleeping arrangements are cozy, to say the least. Rooms
with bunk beds sleeping six or even eight are not at all uncommon.
That keeps the price down, Dugan said. At the same time, ``it
really tests them to see if they can get along.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Estes Park's most popular accommodations is a 9-year-old,
16-bedroom manse known as the Pattie Hyde Barclay Reunion Lodge. It
has its own hostess on the grounds, sleeps 72 people and has four
long dining tables to accommodate the maximum crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Family groups staying anywhere on the grounds may make use of
picnic shelters, fire pits and large barbecue grills. And the Y
staffs are willing to organize all manner of family activities for
those who don't wish to bother with the details.
</P>
<P>
   If a family wants to have a campfire, for example, a staff
member ``will get the fire going, bring the marshmallows and bring
songs,'' Henderek said. They'll organize relay games or educational
sessions on outdoor survival or Native American heritage.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no pressure on guests to take part. They may take in
all of it or none of it. They can spend their entire visit just
watching _ the mountains, the slam dunks on the volleyball court
and the adolescents promenading along the little avenue that serves
as a main street.
</P>
<P>
   But they won't be watching from a rocking chair.
</P>

CLASSICAL WAYS TO SPEND THE LAZY, HAZY DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANTRELL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   Summertime, when in most cities the
concert schedule slows to a crawl, is a good time for settling into
an easy chair, enjoying the air conditioning and catching up on
recordings. Here's a rundown of recent CDs of note, including
several outstanding reissues.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Orchestral
</P>
<P>
   - Beethoven: Symphony No. 9. Ruth Ziesak, soprano; Birgit
Remmert, alto; Steve Davislim, tenor; Detlef Roth, bass; Swiss
Chamber Choir, Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra, conducted by David Zinman
(Arte Nova, distributed by BMG).
</P>
<P>
   If I could have only one recorded cycle of Beethoven symphonies,
it would be John Eliot Gardiner's ear-opening period-instruments
survey (on DG Archiv). But those who can't give up the plushness of
the modern orchestra now have an excellent alternative from David
Zinman and his Swiss charges. In the Ninth Symphony Zinman tracks
Beethoven's oft-ignored metronome markings pretty closely _ except
in the middle of the scherzo and the finale's tenor solo, where
scholars largely agree that the composer's nephew Karl wrote down
the wrong note values.
</P>
<P>
   The results fairly crackle with excitement, and even the
``slow'' movement really moves. The soloists, although hardly
big-name, are as fine as you'll find anywhere, and the chorus is
superb. Sonics could be a little more transparent, but at Arte
Nova's superb budget price who could complain?
</P>
<P>
   - Gershwin: Rhapsody in Blue; Concerto in F; An American in
Paris; Variations on ``I Got Rhythm.'' Earl Wild, piano; Boston
Pops Orchestra, conducted by Arthur Fiedler (RCA Victor Red Seal).
</P>
<P>
   Not even record companies are immune to the current rage for
'50s design _ including the cover art that RCA is recycling on
current CD repackagings of its early stereo recordings. The pretty
little woman on this Earl Wild//Boston Pops Gershwin release has
plenty of reason to smile: These are ebullient and suave
performances not to be outdone anywhere. Newly remastered, the
40-year-old recordings _ big, bright and spacious _ sound better
than plenty of brand-new ones.
</P>
<P>
   - Mahler: Symphony No. 4. Amanda Roocroft, soprano; City of
Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sir Simon Rattle (EMI
Classics).
</P>
<P>
   For years I wondered what all the fuss was about Simon _ now Sir
Simon _ Rattle; his recorded performances kept sounding turgid and
overindulgent. But his recent Mahler Ninth Symphony, with the
Vienna Philharmonic (also on EMI), suggests a new depth and
subtlety, and here he lays quite a sensitive hand on the vernal
Fourth. One might have wished a soprano soloist more girlish than
Amanda Roocroft, but the Birmingham orchestra plays with a finesse
I've not heard before. (Too bad the strings and sleigh bells don't
coordinate their ritardando at the beginning.) And, working in
Birmingham's acoustically resplendent Symphony Hall, the EMI
engineers offer state-of-the-art transparency and atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   - Mahler: Symphony No. 5. New Philharmonia Orchestra, conducted
by Sir John Barbirolli (EMI Classics).
</P>
<P>
   Recorded in 1969, only a year before Barbirolli's death, this is
a justifiably legendary performance. One may quibble about the
slowish second-movement tempo, but Barbirolli persuasively uses
force rather than speed to realize Mahler's ``with greatest
vehemence'' direction. By contrast, surprisingly, his Adagietto is
one of the fastest on record _ and one of the closest to timings of
Mahler's own performances.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, this is intensely personal music-making of
life-and-death commitment. Sonics are superb, too _ a tribute to a
golden age of EMI engineering but also to the best present-day
remastering technology.
</P>
<P>
   - Ravel: Piano Concerto in G major; Concerto for the Left Hand;
Gaspard de la nuit. Samson Francois, piano; Paris Conservatoire
Orchestra, conducted by Andre Cluytens (EMI Classics).
</P>
<P>
   Wasted by high living, the French pianist Samson Francois was
only 46 when he was felled by a heart attack in 1970. Even in his
heyday he could be maddeningly uneven as a performer. But listen to
these Ravel performances _ the concertos from 1959, ``Gaspard de la
nuit'' from 1967 _ and you'll know why Samson's countrymen were
willing to forgive his ``off'' days.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Martha Argerich so grippingly captures the demonic side
of these scores, and Cluytens and the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra
occasionally struggle to keep up. Yet Francois brings a
breathtaking vulnerability to the G major Concerto's slow movement.
Apart from a bit of brassiness in the concertos, the recordings
sound fine.
</P>
<P>
   - Stravinsky: Orpheus; Danses concertantes. Orpheus Chamber
Orchestra (Deutsche Grammophon).
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky was at pains to emphasize the objectivity of his
music, particularly in his neoclassical period. But to hear these
incisive yet suave performances of two of the composer's
masterpieces in the idiom is to realize that Stravinsky couldn't
turn off the charm even when he pretended to. This is music of
worldly elegance _ and humanity, too _ and the conductorless
Orpheus Chamber Orchestra has its measure. And DG's sonics are
almost startlingly lifelike.
</P>
<P>
   Chamber music
</P>
<P>
   - Prokofiev: String Quartets Nos. 1 and 2. Nadarejshvili: String
Quartet No. 1. St. Petersburg String Quartet (Delos).
</P>
<P>
   The most electrifying performances at the recent Strings of the
Future string quartet festival in Ottawa, Canada, came from this
Russian foursome. Their intensity and razor-edged acuity fairly
leap from the loudspeakers on this new CD, too: There can't be
finer performances anywhere of Prokofiev's irresistible quartets.
The 1985 Quartet No. 1 by the Georgian composer Zurab Nadarejsvili
is an important addition to the repertory, mingling out-of-body
hypnosis a la Arvo Paert with stylized folk dances (complete with
percussive thumpings and slappings). It, too, is compellingly
played, and Delos supplies typically vivid reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   - Reger: Violin Sonatas Nos. 1 and 5. Ulf Wallin, violin; Roland
Poentinen, piano (CPO, distributed by Naxos).
</P>
<P>
   Organists sometimes trot out Max Reger's fist-busting hymn
fantasias, but otherwise the German composer _ of the remarkable
generation including Scriabin, Ravel and Vaughan Williams _ has
been largely relegated to footnote status. Reger composed some
superb orchestral tone poems, though, and these violin sonatas are
worthy successors to Brahms'.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, their nobility and their subtle rhythmic and harmonic
elusiveness audibly pick up where Brahms left off; the
throbbing-piano opening of the Fifth Sonata, in F sharp minor, is a
striking echo of the older composer's D minor Sonata. These skilled
and ardent performances, superbly recorded, should win Reger new
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Keyboard
</P>
<P>
   - Bach: Goldberg Variations. Christine Schornsheim, harpsichord
(Capriccio, two discs).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the ``Goldbergs'' were conceived for harpsichord, but,
alas, most modern harpsichord recordings treat the work with the
earnestness you'd expect from your dental technician. Here, though,
the German harpsichordist Christine Schornsheim captures the
dancing rhythms and sheer elegance that otherwise you'll find only
on Andras Schiff's piano recording _ plus all the repeats. Brava!
</P>
<P>
   - Great Pianists of the 20th Century: Ignaz Friedman. Music by
Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, others (Philips, two discs).
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the gems of Philips' 100-volume survey of
20th-century pianists. Trained in his native Poland, and in Vienna
under the formidable Theodor Leschetizky, Friedman was one of the
last of the larger-than-life interpretive personalities that
fortunately flourished into the early decades of recorded sound.
(He lived from 1882 to 1948.)
</P>
<P>
   Sheer impetuousness gets the better of a couple of the Chopin
etudes, and even the ``Berceuse'' (a lullaby, after all) is too
hurried. But in general these are compellingly personable, often
freewheeling interpretations to be placed alongside those of Cortot
and Benno Moiseiwitsch. And having danced mazurkas as a lad,
Friedman has a wonderfully idiomatic _ and quite daring _ way with
teasing the rhythms of Chopin's essays. Not even 60- and
70-year-old recordings can detract from music-making like this.
</P>
<P>
   - Byron Janis: True Romantic. Music by Chopin and Liszt. Byron
Janis, piano (EMI Classics).
</P>
<P>
   Just when one's prepared to declare the art of Chopin-playing
all but dead _ with the exception of Ivan Moravec _ here comes the
American pianist Byron Janis with exquisite performances of a
potpourri of both Chopin and Liszt. Janis' recent return to the
recording studio, after a period of health problems, is one of the
happiest developments on the piano scene in a long time. And if the
previous issue (``Byron Janis Plays Chopin,'' also EMI) favored
less challenging pieces, this one suggests that the once-renowned
Janis' virtuosity isn't just a memory. And we have veteran engineer
Max Wilcox to thank for utterly natural sound.

earphones on, reveling in the solitary world of a personal stereo.
</P>
<P>
   To believe Sony's marketing pitch, of course, is to come away
thinking only fire, the wheel and electricity rival the Walkman in
societal impact. On Sept. 23, the company is holding a 20th
anniversary party at New York's Roseland Ballroom to announce new
products and celebrate just what the company sees as the Walkman's
influence on everything from exercise to fashion to how we relate.
While their claims are naturally hyped, they're not without merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Walkman, young people always had the opportunity to
carry radios along with them,'' said anthropologist Michael
Schiffer, a professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson and
author of The Portable Radio in American Life. ``But what the
Walkman did is give them the chance to play just what they wanted,
when they wanted, where they wanted without commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   Classical. Jazz. Blues. Rock. And it didn't appeal only to
younger people.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' Schiffer said, ``the real change has been the way it
rapidly spread to all segments of the population, like the way you
see older citizens out in the garden with a Walkman. It also made
it more socially acceptable to be in your own little cocoon,
whereas decades ago that was regarded as anti-social.''
</P>
<P>
   As a piece technology, of course, the original Walkman was far
from revolutionary. Portable transistor radios with little
earpieces had been around for decades. And home stereophiles
wishing to listen to their favorite tapes or albums in solitude
always had their headphones.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliance behind the Walkman was in melding the
technologies. As the story goes, the Walkman came to be after
Masaru Ibuka, Sony's co-founder, expressed frustration at not being
able to carry or play his favorite music while on airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1978, a Sony engineer named Shizuo Takashino took a
Sony Pressman, a tape recorder often used by reporters, removed the
recording machinery and speaker and added a stereo amplifier. A
pair of lightweight headphones with spongy earpieces came from the
laboratory next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry considered it a ludicrous idea,'' said Tracy
Farrington, the Park Ridge, N.J.-based marketing manager for Sony's
Walkman Personal Stereos. ``People enjoyed that kind of music in
their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   To bring it outside, to make it public, yet at the same time
make it a private solitary activity by employing earphones, was
unheard of. Sony's designers, in fact, were so anxious about the
solitary nature of the device that when the original model, the
TPS-L2, hit the market (in the United States it was first sold
under the name ``Soundabout'') it came with an extra set of
earphones, an extra earphone jack and an orange button which, when
pushed, allowed two people at once to listen to the same tape.
</P>
<P>
   Sony had no idea how well the machine would sell. Initial unit
sales were projected at 5,000 a month. But in Japan _ where the
device was released under the name ``Walkman'' six months before
coming to the United States _ sales in the first two months
exceeded expectation by 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hit. That, and the easy ability to listen to anything,
anywhere at anytime. By 1983, with the help of the Walkman, sales
of cassette tapes in the United States (236 million) for the first
time in history surpassed sales of vinyl records. Close to 100
million Sony Walkmans of all varieties have since been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Today the name Walkman is as synonymous with portable music as
Kleenex is with facial tissues, Jell-O is with wiggly gelatin and
Coke is with soda pop. In 1987 the first Walkman was permanently
installed in an exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution. The term
Walkman is even listed in the Oxford English Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today,'' Farrington said, ``it is just a part of our culture
as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Walkman itself has evolved since its introduction. When it
first came to the United States (Sony quickly dropped the name
``Soundabout'') it was made of blue-black plastic, weighed 14
ounces, played tapes only and provided eight hours of play with two
AA batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time more than 1,200 Walkman models have be produced.
Sony's most basic tape-only Walkman not only is lighter and plays
far longer than the original, but at $18 to $23, also costs a
fraction of the original $200 price.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 Sony added AM//FM tuners to some of their Walkmans and
made them recordable. Then in 1984 came Discmans, portable compact
discs players. Digital audio tape players and mini compact disc
players followed. The lightest Walkman now weighs less than 5
ounces and can play 60 hours on one AA battery. Its smallest
MiniDisc recorder//players, a $400 gizmo known as the Sony MZ-R55,
is less than an inch thick and fits in a shirt pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, millions of similar machines have been sold by a
score of other companies from G.E. to Aiwa, but virtually all of
them are known by one name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first,'' said Sony's Farrington.
</P>
<P>
   The name is Walkman.

<P>
   No one ever recognizes him, although he is arguably one of the
most important scientists of the century.
</P>
<P>
   On campus he's the predictable physics professor, emerging from
the science building at Union College with his hands deep in his
pockets. But you can blow his cover with a single question: Where
did we come from?
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Alpher knows the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1948, Alpher wrote a Ph.D. dissertation that gave birth
to the scientific theory known as the Big Bang. He revealed
mathematically how the universe began in a superhot explosion 14
billion years ago. But in 1948, these were loony ideas, and radio
astronomy was a very young science.
</P>
<P>
   The years rolled by and everyone forgot about Ralph Alpher. Then
one day in 1964, two radio astronomers from Bell Labs stumbled on
the evidence that Alpher was right. Except they had never heard of
him. They got the Nobel Prize, and he got bupkis.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly the kind of injustice Ralph Alpher is used
to.
</P>
<P>
   Rewind to 1937 when Alpher, a 16-year-old prodigy, is offered a
full-time scholarship by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The scholarship is good only if Alpher attends full-time and does
not work. This is the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   He talks with an alum, hoping to find a way to make this work.
But the guy keeps turning the conversation back to religion and
asks Alpher about his religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I was Jewish,'' Alpher says.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, a second letter comes. The scholarship is withdrawn,
without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Alpher had earned that scholarship. Just as he had earned the
right to get credit for his Big Bang theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two reasons you do science,'' Alpher explains. ``One
is an altruistic feeling that maybe you can contribute to mankind's
store of knowledge about the world. The other and more personal
thing is you want the approbation of your peers. Pure and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to college: Alpher works by day and takes classes
at George Washington University by night. His thesis adviser is a
hulking Soviet defector named George Gamow who tosses Alpher a
dissertation problem dear to his own heart: the origin of the
elements.
</P>
<P>
   Eamon Harper, a GWU physicist and science historian, has spent
years researching Gamow's biography.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for laymen, even scientists today, to realize how
visionary their work was,'' Harper says. ``The whole idea of
suggesting that you can, on the basis of science, explain the
distribution of elements _ the material we're all made of, how we
came to be _ that was not a suitable question for scientists. It
was mystical, theological.''
</P>
<P>
   The day Alpher comes to defend his dissertation before the
faculty to get his Ph.D., he discovers the auditorium is packed
with 300 people. Top physicists. Newspaper reporters. Science
writers. Hundreds have come to see the kid who thinks he knows how
the universe was born.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long the entire process of primordial nucleosynthesis
had taken, Alpher answers 300 seconds. The press goes crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to get letters from people saying novenas to save my
soul because I had dared to trample on their concept of Genesis,''
Alpher says.
</P>
<P>
   Alpher follows up his original paper by publishing 18 research
reports with another scientist Robert Herman, a wiry New Yorker.
Alpher and Herman's first paper together predicts what astronomers
could find in space to prove the Big Bang actually happened. It
says: Look, the radiation from the primeval explosion still exists.
It's been bouncing around in space for 14 billion years and has
cooled to a temperature of 5 degrees Kelvin.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1948 astrophysicists tell Alpher and Herman there's no
way to measure background radiation in space. Alpher and Herman
can't do it themselves _ they're not radio astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   They don't give up. They give talks. Alpher publishes more
papers with Herman and Gamow. They buttonhole radio astronomers
wherever they go. They even give a press conference. Nonetheless,
they come up with a cosmic goose egg. So they let it drop.
</P>
<P>
   The two men have growing families to support. In 1955, Alpher
heads for General Electric in Schenectady. Herman goes to General
Motors. They stay in touch and write four more papers together.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1965, the world turns around. The Astrophysical Journal
hits Alpher's desk, featuring two articles: Item 1: Arno Penzias
and Robert Wilson, two radio astronomers using an ultrasensitive
radio telescope at Bell Labs in Holmdel, N.J., unexpectedly detect
unwavering radiation of 3.5 degrees K bathing the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Item 2: Working independently, a research team, led by physicist
Robert Dicke at Princeton University, pegs the finding as radiation
left over from a primordial fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Alpher feels ecstatic until he pages through the reports looking
for his name. He finds one single line indicating that in the
1940s, he, Herman, and Gamow had envisioned a nucleosynthesis
process like the one mentioned in the report.
</P>
<P>
   But there is not a single mention of Alpher and Herman's 1948
prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Several months before, the editor of the Physical Review had
sent a paper from the Princeton team to Alpher and Herman, asking
that they review it, a common practice in technical journals. The
two men told the editor that the Princeton team had duplicated
their work. They suggested rejecting it.
</P>
<P>
   The editor sent a second version of the paper to Alpher and
Herman. It still didn't credit them. Alpher and Herman sent it back
again, citing references. Nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Princeton paper and the Bell Labs paper have appeared in
a different journal. Alpher is appalled. Why didn't they give him
credit for the prediction?
</P>
<P>
   Left out of the glory, Alpher and Herman and Gamow hit their
typewriters in 1965 and never stop. Finally in 1971, James Peebles,
the key author of the controversial Princeton paper and today
Albert Einstein Professor of Science at the university, sets the
record straight in his book, ``Physical Cosmology.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alpher and Herman keep writing letters. Stephen Hawking gets
one in the late '80s, after he credits the Princeton team _ and
Gamow alone _ in ``A Brief History of Time.''
</P>
<P>
   The next insult: In 1978, Penzias and Wilson win the Nobel Prize
for physics. While Penzias is working on his acceptance speech, he
invites Alpher to come by for a visit. Penzias plans to delineate
the history of the origin of the elements, citing the work of
Gamow, Alpher and Herman in his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a day and a half with him in which I gave him a crash
course on cosmology, and he didn't know a damned thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Alpher suffers a heart attack. He blames it
partly on that visit.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1989, when NASA launched the Cosmic Background
Explorer, or COBE (pronounced KO-bee), a $150-million, 2.5-ton
satellite designed to investigate the questions raised in Alpher
and Herman's papers, the two aging scientists watched it go up as
guests of NASA.
</P>
<P>
   COBE subsequently detected cosmic background radiation at 2.7
degrees K.
</P>
<P>
   Today Alpher wants to leave the past behind. He's involved in
local activities: tutoring kids, mentoring scouts, chairing the
board of the local public TV station. And he's busy finishing a
book about cosmology.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy Alpher often sneaked off to peek through a telescope at
the U.S. Naval Observatory on public viewing nights. Today he is
the administrator of the Dudley Observatory and its library, housed
in a local senior center.

<P>
   The human body is an infuriating mix of fallibility and
intolerance. When vital organs wear out and break down, the immune
system stubbornly fights attempts to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60,000 Americans are waiting for transplants. Those
lucky enough to receive a donor organ will still face a daunting
fight for survival, forced to swallow a daily dose of
immunosuppressive drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But in years to come patients may be able to bypass the waiting
lines and overcome problems of organ rejection by getting spare
body parts made from their own cells.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Langer of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other
bioengineers envision a time when all replaceable organs will be
grown in the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to say we were crazy'' Langer says. ``Our progress
will depend on a more general understanding of tissues and
tailoring the environment of every cell.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of growing an organ resembles the construction of a
building. Bioengineers begin with a blueprint of the organ, and
from it build a frame, or scaffold.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the addition of cells _ the walls, floor and ceiling
of the organ _ and finally the installation of an energy source or
a blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Langer and other leading researchers have grown skin,
cartilage, a few nerves, some fingers and bladders.
</P>
<P>
   Their eventual aim is to custom-tailor a complete organ using
the patient's own cells as raw materials, artificial polymers as
scaffolding and enzymatic enticements to persuade the blood system
to supply nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   Bioengineer Linda Griffith of MIT has turned organ blueprinting
into an advanced art. A human liver consists of dense tissue filled
with minuscule nooks and crannies. It is composed of at least six
types of cells and performs multiple functions, from storing
vitamins to filtering toxins from the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith captured some of this complexity in a three-dimensional
blueprint, using computer technology developed to design airplane
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Once an organ exists on a computer screen, it requires a
three-dimensional support structure. That's Langer's specialty. He
and transplant surgeon Joseph Vacanti of Harvard Medical School
forge plastic organ scaffolds that are porous and inviting to human
cells. The tiny holes riddling the polymer provide homes for cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can trap the cells physically inside the polymer,'' Langer
says. ``Or we can trap them chemically.''
</P>
<P>
   As the cells grow, the polymers dissolve. The structure that
remains consists almost entirely of human cells, and hence stands a
better chance of evading the body's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Nephrologist David Humes of the University of Michigan has taken
on an even more elaborate engineering challenge: developing a
bioartificial kidney.
</P>
<P>
   As blood courses through a kidney, it filters out urea, an
ammonia-based compound that is excreted in urine.
</P>
<P>
   With the urea, a healthy kidney removes valuable sugars, salts
and water, substances that it then returns to the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Dialysis separates out the same constituents but doesn't replace
those that aren't toxic. So Humes constructed an external
blood-filtering device _ similar to a dialysis machine _ but one
that uses cellular parts.
</P>
<P>
   Humes' invention, tested only on dogs, first separates the urea
and other substances from the blood, and then routes the filtrate
through dozens of tubes as fine as fishing wire and lined with
kidney cells.
</P>
<P>
   Those cells reabsorb sugars and salts and pass them back through
the tubing's porous walls into the dog's blood. The cells also
manufacture cytokines, proteins that signal the immune system and
help avert deadly bacterial infections, which are the primary cause
of death among people who experience acute kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   Humes hopes for authorization from the Food and Drug
Administration early this winter so he can begin testing the device
on humans. And eventually he hopes to use the same biotechnology to
build an implantable kidney
</P>
<P>
   Keeping an implanted organ nourished poses yet another
challenge. Bioengineer Craig Halberstadt, of Carolina Medical
Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, designs and grows breast
tissue, which may one day replace saline implants.
</P>
<P>
   Developed with funding from a company called Reprogenesis, the
tissue grows from cells taken from the patient's own fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could take them out with liposuction _ most of us have a
couple of extra liters of fat,'' Halberstadt says.
</P>
<P>
   The scaffold of the breast tissue consists of sodium alginate, a
spongy, seaweed-derived substance mostly used as ice-cream
thickener.
</P>
<P>
   To the alginate, Halberstadt attaches a peptide that will signal
the vascular system that the tissue is blood-vessel friendly. Then
he seeds the alginate with cells, which multiply and break down the
scaffold.
</P>
<P>
   Once implanted, the tissue will be infiltrated by blood vessels
carrying nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstadt has successfully tested the technique only in rats
but has high hopes for its success in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Other organs are in the pipeline. Bladders built by bioengineer
Anthony Atala have worked in dogs in his Harvard lab, where he also
develops replacement kidneys and windpipes. In addition to his
scaffolds, MIT's Langer has begun crafting a polymer that conducts
electricity. When placed between two ends of a severed nerve, the
polymer provides a trellis for nerve tissue to grow along and can
carry the neuron's connective electrical impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Corneas, the transparent surface of the eye, have been
painstakingly constructed from layers of human cells by tissue
engineers Francois Auger and Lucie Germain of Laval University in
Quebec City, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   These may be closest to successful implantation because the
engineers bypassed an artificial scaffold by cajoling the cells
into producing their own collagen, which is what normal human cells
do. Their strategy may allow doctors to avoid any inflammation
triggered by artificial scaffolds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bioengineers offer only cautious time lines when
asked when their organ of choice will be ready. The estimates of 10
or 20 years are discouraging for those waiting on transplant lists.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the scientists are doing their best to coax
Mother Nature along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk to our cells,'' Auger says. ``We are nice to them.
Then they build the environment in which they are happy.''

   The human body is an infuriating mix of fallibility and
intolerance. When vital organs wear out and break down, the immune
system stubbornly fights attempts to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60,000 Americans are waiting for transplants. Those
lucky enough to receive a donor organ will still face a daunting
fight for survival, forced to swallow a daily dose of
immunosuppressive drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But in years to come patients may be able to bypass the waiting
lines and overcome problems of organ rejection by getting spare
body parts made from their own cells.

   No one ever recognizes him, although he is arguably one of the
most important scientists of the century.
</P>
<P>
   On campus he's the predictable physics professor, emerging from
the science building at Union College with his hands deep in his
pockets. But you can blow his cover with a single question: Where
did we come from?
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Alpher knows the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1948, Alpher wrote a Ph.D. dissertation that gave birth
to the scientific theory known as the Big Bang. He revealed
mathematically how the universe began in a superhot explosion 14
billion years ago. But in 1948, these were loony ideas, and radio
astronomy was a very young science.
</P>
<P>
   The years rolled by and everyone forgot about Ralph Alpher. Then
one day in 1964, two radio astronomers from Bell Labs stumbled on
the evidence that Alpher was right. Except they had never heard of
him. They got the Nobel Prize, and he got bupkis.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly the kind of injustice Ralph Alpher is used
to.
</P>
<P>
   Rewind to 1937 when Alpher, a 16-year-old prodigy, is offered a
full-time scholarship by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The scholarship is good only if Alpher attends full-time and does
not work. This is the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   He talks with an alum, hoping to find a way to make this work.
But the guy keeps turning the conversation back to religion and
asks Alpher about his religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I was Jewish,'' Alpher says.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, a second letter comes. The scholarship is withdrawn,
without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Alpher had earned that scholarship. Just as he had earned the
right to get credit for his Big Bang theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two reasons you do science,'' Alpher explains. ``One
is an altruistic feeling that maybe you can contribute to mankind's
store of knowledge about the world. The other and more personal
thing is you want the approbation of your peers. Pure and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to college: Alpher works by day and takes classes
at George Washington University by night. His thesis adviser is a
hulking Soviet defector named George Gamow who tosses Alpher a
dissertation problem dear to his own heart: the origin of the
elements.
</P>
<P>
   Eamon Harper, a GWU physicist and science historian, has spent
years researching Gamow's biography.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for laymen, even scientists today, to realize how
visionary their work was,'' Harper says. ``The whole idea of
suggesting that you can, on the basis of science, explain the
distribution of elements _ the material we're all made of, how we
came to be _ that was not a suitable question for scientists. It
was mystical, theological.''
</P>
<P>
   The day Alpher comes to defend his dissertation before the
faculty to get his Ph.D., he discovers the auditorium is packed
with 300 people. Top physicists. Newspaper reporters. Science
writers. Hundreds have come to see the kid who thinks he knows how
the universe was born.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long the entire process of primordial nucleosynthesis
had taken, Alpher answers 300 seconds. The press goes crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to get letters from people saying novenas to save my
soul because I had dared to trample on their concept of Genesis,''
Alpher says.
</P>
<P>
   Alpher follows up his original paper by publishing 18 research
reports with another scientist Robert Herman, a wiry New Yorker.
Alpher and Herman's first paper together predicts what astronomers
could find in space to prove the Big Bang actually happened. It
says: Look, the radiation from the primeval explosion still exists.
It's been bouncing around in space for 14 billion years and has
cooled to a temperature of 5 degrees Kelvin.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1948 astrophysicists tell Alpher and Herman there's no
way to measure background radiation in space. Alpher and Herman
can't do it themselves _ they're not radio astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   They don't give up. They give talks. Alpher publishes more
papers with Herman and Gamow. They buttonhole radio astronomers
wherever they go. They even give a press conference. Nonetheless,
they come up with a cosmic goose egg. So they let it drop.
</P>
<P>
   The two men have growing families to support. In 1955, Alpher
heads for General Electric in Schenectady. Herman goes to General
Motors. They stay in touch and write four more papers together.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1965, the world turns around. The Astrophysical Journal
hits Alpher's desk, featuring two articles: Item 1: Arno Penzias
and Robert Wilson, two radio astronomers using an ultrasensitive
radio telescope at Bell Labs in Holmdel, N.J., unexpectedly detect
unwavering radiation of 3.5 degrees K bathing the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Item 2: Working independently, a research team, led by physicist
Robert Dicke at Princeton University, pegs the finding as radiation
left over from a primordial fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Alpher feels ecstatic until he pages through the reports looking
for his name. He finds one single line indicating that in the
1940s, he, Herman, and Gamow had envisioned a nucleosynthesis
process like the one mentioned in the report.
</P>
<P>
   But there is not a single mention of Alpher and Herman's 1948
prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Several months before, the editor of the Physical Review had
sent a paper from the Princeton team to Alpher and Herman, asking
that they review it, a common practice in technical journals. The
two men told the editor that the Princeton team had duplicated
their work. They suggested rejecting it.
</P>
<P>
   The editor sent a second version of the paper to Alpher and
Herman. It still didn't credit them. Alpher and Herman sent it back
again, citing references. Nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Princeton paper and the Bell Labs paper have appeared in
a different journal. Alpher is appalled. Why didn't they give him
credit for the prediction?
</P>
<P>
   Left out of the glory, Alpher and Herman and Gamow hit their
typewriters in 1965 and never stop. Finally in 1971, James Peebles,
the key author of the controversial Princeton paper and today
Albert Einstein Professor of Science at the university, sets the
record straight in his book, ``Physical Cosmology.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alpher and Herman keep writing letters. Stephen Hawking gets
one in the late '80s, after he credits the Princeton team _ and
Gamow alone _ in ``A Brief History of Time.''
</P>
<P>
   The next insult: In 1978, Penzias and Wilson win the Nobel Prize
for physics. While Penzias is working on his acceptance speech, he
invites Alpher to come by for a visit. Penzias plans to delineate
the history of the origin of the elements, citing the work of
Gamow, Alpher and Herman in his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a day and a half with him in which I gave him a crash
course on cosmology, and he didn't know a damned thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Alpher suffers a heart attack. He blames it
partly on that visit.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1989, when NASA launched the Cosmic Background
Explorer, or COBE (pronounced KO-bee), a $150-million, 2.5-ton
satellite designed to investigate the questions raised in Alpher
and Herman's papers, the two aging scientists watched it go up as
guests of NASA.
</P>
<P>
   COBE subsequently detected cosmic background radiation at 2.7
degrees K.
</P>
<P>
   Today Alpher wants to leave the past behind. He's involved in
local activities: tutoring kids, mentoring scouts, chairing the
board of the local public TV station. And he's busy finishing a
book about cosmology.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy Alpher often sneaked off to peek through a telescope at
the U.S. Naval Observatory on public viewing nights. Today he is
the administrator of the Dudley Observatory and its library, housed
in a local senior center.

</P>
<P>
   Alpher had earned that scholarship. Just as he had earned the
right to get credit for his Big Bang theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two reasons you do science,'' Alpher explains. ``One
is an altruistic feeling that maybe you can contribute to mankind's
store of knowledge about the world. The other and more personal
thing is you want the approbation of your peers. Pure and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to college: Alpher works by day and takes classes
at George Washington University by night. His thesis adviser is a
hulking Soviet defector named George Gamow who tosses Alpher a
dissertation problem dear to his own heart: the origin of the
elements.
</P>
<P>
   Eamon Harper, a GWU physicist and science historian, has spent
years researching Gamow's biography.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for laymen, even scientists today, to realize how
visionary their work was,'' Harper says. ``The whole idea of
suggesting that you can, on the basis of science, explain the
distribution of elements _ the material we're all made of, how we
came to be _ that was not a suitable question for scientists. It
was mystical, theological.''
</P>
<P>
   The day Alpher comes to defend his dissertation before the
faculty to get his Ph.D., he discovers the auditorium is packed
with 300 people. Top physicists. Newspaper reporters. Science
writers. Hundreds have come to see the kid who thinks he knows how
the universe was born.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long the entire process of primordial nucleosynthesis
had taken, Alpher answers 300 seconds. The press goes crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to get letters from people saying novenas to save my
soul because I had dared to trample on their concept of Genesis,''
Alpher says.
</P>
<P>
   Alpher follows up his original paper by publishing 18 research
reports with another scientist Robert Herman, a wiry New Yorker.
Alpher and Herman's first paper together predicts what astronomers
could find in space to prove the Big Bang actually happened. It
says: Look, the radiation from the primeval explosion still exists.
It's been bouncing around in space for 14 billion years and has
cooled to a temperature of 5 degrees Kelvin.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1948 astrophysicists tell Alpher and Herman there's no
way to measure background radiation in space. Alpher and Herman
can't do it themselves _ they're not radio astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   They don't give up. They give talks. Alpher publishes more
papers with Herman and Gamow. They buttonhole radio astronomers
wherever they go. They even give a press conference. Nonetheless,
they come up with a cosmic goose egg. So they let it drop.
</P>
<P>
   The two men have growing families to support. In 1955, Alpher
heads for General Electric in Schenectady. Herman goes to General
Motors. They stay in touch and write four more papers together.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1965, the world turns around. The Astrophysical Journal
hits Alpher's desk, featuring two articles: Item 1: Arno Penzias
and Robert Wilson, two radio astronomers using an ultrasensitive
radio telescope at Bell Labs in Holmdel, N.J., unexpectedly detect
unwavering radiation of 3.5 degrees K bathing the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Item 2: Working independently, a research team, led by physicist
Robert Dicke at Princeton University, pegs the finding as radiation
left over from a primordial fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Alpher feels ecstatic until he pages through the reports looking
for his name. He finds one single line indicating that in the
1940s, he, Herman, and Gamow had envisioned a nucleosynthesis
process like the one mentioned in the report.
</P>
<P>
   But there is not a single mention of Alpher and Herman's 1948
prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Several months before, the editor of the Physical Review had
sent a paper from the Princeton team to Alpher and Herman, asking
that they review it, a common practice in technical journals. The
two men told the editor that the Princeton team had duplicated
their work. They suggested rejecting it.
</P>
<P>
   The editor sent a second version of the paper to Alpher and
Herman. It still didn't credit them. Alpher and Herman sent it back
again, citing references. Nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Princeton paper and the Bell Labs paper have appeared in
a different journal. Alpher is appalled. Why didn't they give him
credit for the prediction?
</P>
<P>
   Left out of the glory, Alpher and Herman and Gamow hit their
typewriters in 1965 and never stop. Finally in 1971, James Peebles,
the key author of the controversial Princeton paper and today
Albert Einstein Professor of Science at the university, sets the
record straight in his book, ``Physical Cosmology.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alpher and Herman keep writing letters. Stephen Hawking gets
one in the late '80s, after he credits the Princeton team _ and
Gamow alone _ in ``A Brief History of Time.''
</P>
<P>
   The next insult: In 1978, Penzias and Wilson win the Nobel Prize
for physics. While Penzias is working on his acceptance speech, he
invites Alpher to come by for a visit. Penzias plans to delineate
the history of the origin of the elements, citing the work of
Gamow, Alpher and Herman in his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a day and a half with him in which I gave him a crash
course on cosmology, and he didn't know a damned thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Alpher suffers a heart attack. He blames it
partly on that visit.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1989, when NASA launched the Cosmic Background
Explorer, or COBE (pronounced KO-bee), a $150-million, 2.5-ton
satellite designed to investigate the questions raised in Alpher
and Herman's papers, the two aging scientists watched it go up as
guests of NASA.
</P>
<P>
   COBE subsequently detected cosmic background radiation at 2.7
degrees K.
</P>
<P>
   Today Alpher wants to leave the past behind. He's involved in
local activities: tutoring kids, mentoring scouts, chairing the
board of the local public TV station. And he's busy finishing a
book about cosmology.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy Alpher often sneaked off to peek through a telescope at
the U.S. Naval Observatory on public viewing nights. Today he is
the administrator of the Dudley Observatory and its library, housed
in a local senior center.

<P>
   The human body is an infuriating mix of fallibility and
intolerance. When vital organs wear out and break down, the immune
system stubbornly fights attempts to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60,000 Americans are waiting for transplants. Those
lucky enough to receive a donor organ will still face a daunting
fight for survival, forced to swallow a daily dose of
immunosuppressive drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But in years to come patients may be able to bypass the waiting
lines and overcome problems of organ rejection by getting spare
body parts made from their own cells.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Langer of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other
bioengineers envision a time when all replaceable organs will be
grown in the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to say we were crazy'' Langer says. ``Our progress
will depend on a more general understanding of tissues and
tailoring the environment of every cell.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of growing an organ resembles the construction of a
building. Bioengineers begin with a blueprint of the organ, and
from it build a frame, or scaffold.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the addition of cells _ the walls, floor and ceiling
of the organ _ and finally the installation of an energy source or
a blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Langer and other leading researchers have grown skin,
cartilage, a few nerves, some fingers and bladders.
</P>
<P>
   Their eventual aim is to custom-tailor a complete organ using
the patient's own cells as raw materials, artificial polymers as
scaffolding and enzymatic enticements to persuade the blood system
to supply nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   Bioengineer Linda Griffith of MIT has turned organ blueprinting
into an advanced art. A human liver consists of dense tissue filled
with minuscule nooks and crannies. It is composed of at least six
types of cells and performs multiple functions, from storing
vitamins to filtering toxins from the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith captured some of this complexity in a three-dimensional
blueprint, using computer technology developed to design airplane
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Once an organ exists on a computer screen, it requires a
three-dimensional support structure. That's Langer's specialty. He
and transplant surgeon Joseph Vacanti of Harvard Medical School
forge plastic organ scaffolds that are porous and inviting to human
cells. The tiny holes riddling the polymer provide homes for cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can trap the cells physically inside the polymer,'' Langer
says. ``Or we can trap them chemically.''
</P>
<P>
   As the cells grow, the polymers dissolve. The structure that
remains consists almost entirely of human cells, and hence stands a
better chance of evading the body's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Nephrologist David Humes of the University of Michigan has taken
on an even more elaborate engineering challenge: developing a
bioartificial kidney.
</P>
<P>
   As blood courses through a kidney, it filters out urea, an
ammonia-based compound that is excreted in urine.
</P>
<P>
   With the urea, a healthy kidney removes valuable sugars, salts
and water, substances that it then returns to the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Dialysis separates out the same constituents but doesn't replace
those that aren't toxic. So Humes constructed an external
blood-filtering device _ similar to a dialysis machine _ but one
that uses cellular parts.
</P>
<P>
   Humes' invention, tested only on dogs, first separates the urea
and other substances from the blood, and then routes the filtrate
through dozens of tubes as fine as fishing wire and lined with
kidney cells.
</P>
<P>
   Those cells reabsorb sugars and salts and pass them back through
the tubing's porous walls into the dog's blood. The cells also
manufacture cytokines, proteins that signal the immune system and
help avert deadly bacterial infections, which are the primary cause
of death among people who experience acute kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   Humes hopes for authorization from the Food and Drug
Administration early this winter so he can begin testing the device
on humans. And eventually he hopes to use the same biotechnology to
build an implantable kidney
</P>
<P>
   Keeping an implanted organ nourished poses yet another
challenge. Bioengineer Craig Halberstadt, of Carolina Medical
Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, designs and grows breast
tissue, which may one day replace saline implants.
</P>
<P>
   Developed with funding from a company called Reprogenesis, the
tissue grows from cells taken from the patient's own fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could take them out with liposuction _ most of us have a
couple of extra liters of fat,'' Halberstadt says.
</P>
<P>
   The scaffold of the breast tissue consists of sodium alginate, a
spongy, seaweed-derived substance mostly used as ice-cream
thickener.
</P>
<P>
   To the alginate, Halberstadt attaches a peptide that will signal
the vascular system that the tissue is blood-vessel friendly. Then
he seeds the alginate with cells, which multiply and break down the
scaffold.
</P>
<P>
   Once implanted, the tissue will be infiltrated by blood vessels
carrying nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstadt has successfully tested the technique only in rats
but has high hopes for its success in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Other organs are in the pipeline. Bladders built by bioengineer
Anthony Atala have worked in dogs in his Harvard lab, where he also
develops replacement kidneys and windpipes. In addition to his
scaffolds, MIT's Langer has begun crafting a polymer that conducts
electricity. When placed between two ends of a severed nerve, the
polymer provides a trellis for nerve tissue to grow along and can
carry the neuron's connective electrical impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Corneas, the transparent surface of the eye, have been
painstakingly constructed from layers of human cells by tissue
engineers Francois Auger and Lucie Germain of Laval University in
Quebec City, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   These may be closest to successful implantation because the
engineers bypassed an artificial scaffold by cajoling the cells
into producing their own collagen, which is what normal human cells
do. Their strategy may allow doctors to avoid any inflammation
triggered by artificial scaffolds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bioengineers offer only cautious time lines when
asked when their organ of choice will be ready. The estimates of 10
or 20 years are discouraging for those waiting on transplant lists.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the scientists are doing their best to coax
Mother Nature along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk to our cells,'' Auger says. ``We are nice to them.
Then they build the environment in which they are happy.''

HOMETOWN OF FIRST VIETNAMESE-AMERICAN NFL PLAYER RAISES FUNDS FOR
BILLBOARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FULTON, Texas _ Now that Hurricane Bret has become a soggy
nuisance to inland farmers, residents of the Rockport-Fulton area
near Corpus Christi can turn their attention to more pressing
matters.
</P>
<P>
   They are about $5,000 short of the funds needed to raise a
billboard on the area's western edge. The billboard will
acknowledge Rockport-Fulton as the home of Dat Nguyen, the first
Vietnamese-American player to wear a National Football League
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, a 5-foot-11, 231-pound linebacker, was taken as a
third-round draft choice by the Cowboys. As the team's training
camp closed last week, Nguyen was the second-team middle
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could mean more fans for the Dallas Cowboys,'' said Diane
Probst, executive director of the Rockport-Fulton Area Chamber of
Commerce. ``When he was playing for Texas A&AMP;M, everybody here
watched him very closely. The whole town was in tune; everyone was
talking about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Probst said, the Rockport area is heavily populated by
retirees from other parts of the country. They might not have been
Cowboys fans when they got here, but having someone from this area
playing for Dallas might cause a shift in allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of them knew about Texas A&AMP;M when they got here, but
they quickly adopted the Aggies as their team,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen was a 1998 Lombardi Trophy winner for the Aggies. He also
was a Dick Butkus Award finalist and a Big 12 Conference and
national defensive player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the kinds of achievements that will be noted on the
billboard, which will be installed on Texas 35 west of Rockport
near Aransas Pass.
</P>
<P>
   Probst said the billboard will cost about $10,000. Half has been
raised through private donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locals here are very proud of their Dat Nguyen,'' Probst
said.
</P>
<P>
   As Nguyen's athletic ability and popularity rose, so did
interest in his story _ conceived in Vietnam and born in the United
States after his family endured a frightening and dangerous boat
trip out of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The family moved from a relocation center at Fort Chaffee, Ark.,
to Kalamazoo, Mich., had a short stay in Fort Worth, and then moved
to New Orleans and eventually to Fulton in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen's name is prominent in this coastal area. His family
operates a marine supply business, a crab company and a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, called Hu-Dat's for both Dat and his brother
Hung, is painted white with maroon trim. Inside, the walls are
covered with plaques and pictures of Nguyen's athletic triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner rests a glass case with a signed football and his
Texas A&AMP;M jersey.
</P>
<P>
   It is a shrine of sorts, speaking both to Nguyen's athletic
ability and to the assimilation of the Vietnamese people into the
Texas Gulf Coast lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Cultures mix freely in the restaurant. If there were any scars
of racial bias, or hardship, they have been erased. Hu-Dat's is a
gathering place to enjoy Vietnamese and Chinese food, and an
information center for locals who want to know how Nguyen is doing
with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he would call,'' said Nguyen's cousin Canh, who works
at the restaurant. ``We have people coming in here every day
wanting to know about him, but we haven't heard from him in a
couple of weeks. He called his mom, but he didn't call here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen was home earlier this summer and signed autographs at the
restaurant. Also, during a ``Dat Nguyen Day'' he spent several
hours at the high school athletic complex signing autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Canh Nguyen said his cousin was always popular in town. He was
the first Vietnamese-American to do a lot of things here: the first
to play on the soccer team, the first to play football.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been pretty popular. He's always been a nice
guy,'' Canh Nguyen said.
</P>
<P>
   Canh Nguyen said the restaurant is not only a gathering place
for Aggies and former Aggies in the area, but also a meeting spot
for Texas Longhorn fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Longhorns come down here on fishing trips, and they
stop by to hear about Dat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Probst said the chamber of commerce gets two to three inquiries
a week about the location of the family restaurant. They also field
weekly telephone calls from various news media outlets asking about
Nguyen.
</P>
<P>
   ``ABC News was recently here doing a documentary on Dat and the
acceptance of the Vietnamese in this community,'' she said. ``A lot
of people ask us about the Vietnamese culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Probst said that there about 100 Vietnamese-American families in
the Rockport-Fulton area and that they are ``people of very good
moral character and values.''
</P>
<P>
   Canh Nguyen said his family is used to the inquiries. He is only
sorry that his cousin's Cowboys jersey isn't displayed in the
restaurant alongside the maroon and white Aggie jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought his Cowboys jersey once,'' Canh Nguyen said. ``It was
No. 90, and I think I paid about $80 or $90 for it. Then he changed
numbers. His brother told me Dat was going to change again before
the season starts, so I've decided to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could get expensive.''

QUIET SUSPECT IN BRYAN FOR SECOND DRAGGING DEATH TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRYAN, Texas _ High school held no interest for Lawrence Russell
Brewer, so he didn't bother showing up for his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the quiet, rather unremarkable son of fundamentalist
Christians gained fame in the small East Texas town of Klondike by
becoming a thief. Half-heartedly targeting even his own family, he
lifted a few car parts here, some stereo speakers there.
</P>
<P>
   But when he landed in prison for burglary at age 19, and later
returned for cocaine possession and parole violations, he seemed to
embrace inmate life. Tattooing his arms with racist symbols, he
joined a fringe gang affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan and
proclaimed himself a ``peckerwood,'' a white prisoner willing to
fight to avoid being robbed or raped.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Brewer's friends insist that whole thing was only prison
posturing _ doing what he had to do to survive in a violent
environment. The real Russell Brewer, they say, is a loving man who
married a Hispanic woman and became a father, who later entertained
his girlfriend's children by making festive meals, and who showed
up for a hearing last spring wearing a smile and flashing a message
hastily scrawled on a manila envelope, wishing a Happy Mother's Day
to moms everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But as jury selection begins in Brewer's capital murder trial in
Bryan this week, prosecutors plan to prove that on June 7 last
year, Russell Brewer accompanied two other white men to a clearing
in the woods outside Jasper. There, they say, he smoked a cigarette
and drank a Bud Light before stripping a black man, chaining him to
a pickup and dragging him three miles to his death.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, neighbors on their way to church discovered
the decapitated body of James Byrd Jr., 49, in the middle of Huff
Creek Road, just outside the gates to a black cemetery. His head,
right shoulder and arm lay in a ditch a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   The hideous crime shocked the town of 8,000 _ and the nation _
into a new dialogue on race relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Ku Klux Klan marched on Jasper and black militant leaders
carried shotguns through the streets, offering to arm the
community's black residents. Local leaders responded with prayer
services and town meetings to address their own prejudices, and
Byrd's relatives urged their neighbors to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, a Jasper jury of 11 whites and one black
convicted Brewer's prison buddy and fellow white supremacist John
William ``Bill'' King, 24, and sentenced him to death. Another
defendant, 24-year-old Shawn Berry of Jasper, sits in the Jasper
County Jail awaiting trial in late October.
</P>
<P>
   This week, though, it's Brewer's turn. If convicted, the
32-year-old will face either life in prison or death by injection.
</P>
<P>
   Although King was tried in his hometown, Brewer's lawyers sought
to move his trial out of Jasper, saying local jurors would
improperly try to redeem their town's good name by securing a
conviction without fully considering the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Monte Lawlis at first ruled against a
change, but later relented, when prosecutors asked that the trial
be moved because they feared handing the suspect a reason for
appeal. The trial will be held at the Brazos County Courthouse in
Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer to be right here at home sleeping in my own bed and
working out of my own office, talking to Jasper jurors,'' Jasper
County District Attorney Guy James Gray said recently, ``but I
think it was the smart thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, authorities in Bryan prepared for the onslaught of
media and spectators, installing metal detectors and security
cameras at the courthouse, processing credentials for 150
journalists from more than 30 news organizations and converting a
former barbecue restaurant into a makeshift press room
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bracing ourselves, because it just so happens that the
trial falls when all the Aggies come back to school,'' said Joe
Brown, public information officer for the city that is next door to
College Station, home of Texas A&AMP;M University. ``There's always a
lot of chaos whenever the Aggies are in town, and the hotels are
scarce because of home football games.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the added tension, though, Brown says he's proud of
Brazos County for stepping forward to help Jasper officials when
more than two dozen other counties shunned the racially charged
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't something we asked for,'' he said, ``but sometimes
you have to do what's right instead of what's easiest. We're ready
to get this on the ground and get it over with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as a responsibility to our fellow Texans,'' he
added. ``This is something that we owe them because they would do
it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection, which begins Tuesday, is expected to last about
two weeks, with lawyers questioning 12 prospective jurors per day
and testimony tentatively scheduled to start Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he doesn't anticipate any problem seating a jury in
Brazos County, even though the murder made headlines around the
world and the local Bryan Eagle carried daily stories during the
trial of Bill King.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Jasper, about 50 percent of the jurors were qualified, and
I'm hopeful that in Bryan we'll get a higher percentage,'' Gray
said. ``People there know generally that there was a dragging case
out of Jasper, but they don't know a lot of the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray declined to say much about his trial strategy, and Brewer's
court-appointed attorney, Doug Barlow of Beaumont, did not return
phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   But during King's trial last winter, Jasper County jurors heard
testimony so gruesome it drove the victim's family and the
defendant's father from the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was King's own writings that convicted him, as
prosecutors produced racist letters he'd penned from prison to
girls in Jasper and letters to the media that placed him in the
pickup the night of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Also entered into evidence were a recruiting letter,
``constitution'' and bylaws for King's own personal hate group, a
chapter of the Confederate Knights of America, which he intended to
call Texas Rebel Soldiers. He wanted to launch the group in Jasper
on July 4, 1998, and even outlined plans to kidnap a black person,
take him to the woods and kill him.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote a ``kite,'' or jailhouse note, which he passed to
Brewer, who was being held in a separate cell.
</P>
<P>
   The note, delivered by an inmate trusty who first turned it over
to jailers for photocopying, discussed bloodstained clothing at
King's apartment and explained that he and Brewer could escape the
death sentence if prosecutors failed to prove the kidnapping
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously though, bro, reguardless (sic) of the outcome of
this, we have made history and shall die proudly remembered if need
be,'' King wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It killed us,'' King's court-appointed attorney, C. Haden
``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr., later said of the jailhouse writings and the
kite _ the only piece of evidence jurors asked to see before
announcing their guilty verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said jurors in Brewer's trial will see four or five kites
that Brewer passed to King. The prosecutor declined to reveal their
contents, except to say that they refer to Brewer's thoughts and
feelings after the murder, but apparently offer no hint of his
alleged role in planning Byrd's murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brewer wrote some, but he was not as prolific a writer as
King,'' Gray said. ``This trial will have a little more prison gang
life flavor than the first case because we need to use other
evidence to establish his motive and what he was thinking before
the murder.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, prosecutors have subpoenaed more than 30 witnesses,
including several prisoners expected to testify about Brewer's gang
activities and racist beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors previously have theorized that King and Brewer, who
met while both were inmates at the Beto I prison unit in Tennessee
Colony, may have planned Byrd's murder as a ``blood-in'' ceremony
that would guarantee them membership in a free world hate group. An
alternative theory suggests that the murder was an initiation rite
for the Texas Rebel Soldiers' first recruit: King's high school
friend and fellow defendant, Shawn Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Brewer's alleged motive or role in Byrd's death,
prosecutors will likely have little trouble placing him at the
crime scene. Physical evidence and testimony during King's trial
put Brewer in Berry's pickup the night that three white men were
seen picking up an intoxicated Byrd, who was walking down Martin
Luther King Boulevard on his way home from a party.
</P>
<P>
   A DNA expert from the FBI also testified that Brewer's genetic
blueprint showed up on a cigarette butt and a beer bottle found in
the woods where Byrd was chained to the pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's tennis shoe _ recovered from King's apartment, where
the men were staying the weekend of the killing _ was stained with
Byrd's blood.

THE BIG ONE: STORY OF 1900 GALVESTON STORM ALSO TALE OF ERRING
METEOROLOGIST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (``Isaac's Storm''; by Erik Larson; Crown, $25.) 
 
By BOB TUTT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the dawning of the 20th century neared, Isaac Cline, chief of
the U.S. Weather Bureau station at Galveston, confidently forecast
no dangerous hurricane would ever ravage that thriving Texas port
city.
</P>
<P>
   Wicked hurricanes in 1875 and 1886 had dealt ultimately fatal
blows to the once up-and-coming town of Indianola on Matagorda Bay
120 miles farther down the Texas coast, but Cline contended natural
features would protect Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   If any regretted that a proposed sea wall to protect Galveston
hadn't materialized, he may well have put their minds at ease. And
civic leaders could go on dreaming that their city might someday
rank with Baltimore, New Orleans and San Francisco and far surpass
the rival town of Houston 50 miles inland.
</P>
<P>
   But as Erik Larson recounts in ``Isaac's Storm,'' the monster
hurricane that struck without warning in 1900 and devastated
Galveston also shredded Cline's analysis. So there is an element of
irony in the book's title.
</P>
<P>
   In an article Cline wrote for the Galveston News in 1891, he
theorized that ``the shallow slope of the seabed off Galveston
would wear down incoming seas before they struck the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, he contended that low-lying mainland areas north
of Galveston Bay would serve as basins to capture whatever flood
waters a storm did manage to drive ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Larson notes how the national office of the Weather Bureau
quickly distanced itself from Cline's prognosis in its October 1900
Monthly Weather Review. One of its top meteorologists wrote that,
in fact, Galveston's natural setting rendered it ``in the presence
of severe storms, peculiarly subject to inundation.'' That's a
classic understatement.
</P>
<P>
   And in the wake of this nation's deadliest natural disaster,
claiming more than 8,000 lives, Galveston proceeded not only to
construct a sea wall but also to elevate the whole city.
</P>
<P>
   Larson isn't the first writer to vividly dramatize the storm's
mounting fury and movingly bring to life many of the resulting
human dramas.
</P>
<P>
   For example, John Edward Weems' ``A Weekend in September,''
first published in 1957 and reprinted in 1980, also splendidly
accomplished that. What distinguishes Larson's work is his delving
into Cline's character as well as his exposing the hubris and
shenanigans of the Weather Bureau's top brass.
</P>
<P>
   Cline, 38 at the time of the storm, clearly was highly
intelligent, possessing doctorates in both meteorology and
medicine. He prided himself on being a conscientious scientist
despite a possible lapse into civic boosterism when he proclaimed
Galveston immune to serious hurricane damage.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, he was a loving husband and father, a Sunday
school teacher, a strait-laced man who paid his debts in cash, an
avid hunter. And like all meteorologists, Larson observes, he was a
lover of electrical storms. Cline once confided, with a touch of
humor, that he was drawn to the study of weather because he wanted
``some field where I could tell big stories and tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Upon first meeting Isaac,'' Larson writes, ``men found him to
be modest and self-effacing, but those who came to know him well
saw a harshness and confidence that verged on hubris.''
</P>
<P>
   Larson divines evidence of ``a persistent, low-grade rivalry''
between Cline and his brother Joseph Cline, who was nine years
younger and also a meteorologist on his staff. It seems the
brothers frequently differed in their interpretations of weather
phenomena; after the hurricane they became totally estranged.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, meteorology then was far from the science it is now.
More accurate understanding of the workings of weather lay many
years in the future, as did the technology to track hurricanes such
as the recent Bret literally hour by hour.
</P>
<P>
   Larson adds a dimension to the Galveston storm's story by
describing how toward the end of the 19th century a dispute over
weather predictions sprouted between American and Cuban weather
forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   So it came as no surprise that American meteorologists based in
Cuba and in the States would scoff when Cuban weathermen in August
1900 predicted that a weather system heading north across their
newly independent island nation gave indications of growing into a
hurricane and that it was likely to take a westward turn.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were sure it would be no more than a tropical
storm. They forecast it would take a turn to the east, cross over
Florida, then enter the Atlantic without significant consequences.
They stuck to that prediction as the storm did just what the Cubans
forecast. Some ships encountered this burgeoning piece of weather,
but in those pre-radio days there was no way they could send a
warning.
</P>
<P>
   The storm grew into a powerful hurricane. With a gigantic
low-pressure zone in North America drawing it like a magnet, it
traveled unobstructed over open waters for 800 miles. It slammed
into Galveston head-on Saturday, Sept. 8, 1900. It appears to have
packed winds that at their worst may have ranged from 150 to 200
mph.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the storm ``had set a course for Galveston soon
after leaving Cuba,'' Larson writes, and ``Galveston became
Atlantis.''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the day the storm struck, Cline wrote,
mounting ``storm swells'' signaled him ``as though it was a written
message that great danger was approaching.''
</P>
<P>
   He claimed he drove his horse-drawn cart up and down the
beachfront warning Galveston residents and visitors to seek shelter
on the mainland. He estimated he saved ``some 6,000 lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Larson seeks to set the record straight on this. He says that in
reviewing hundreds of reminiscences of the storm in archives of
Galveston's Rosenberg Library, he found no mention of Cline's
giving such a warning. Additionally, he says, means of
transportation to safety for so many people weren't available.
</P>
<P>
   Later that terrible day about 45 people joined Cline; his wife,
Cora; their three young daughters; and Cline's brother in taking
refuge in the Clines' home. Only 18 of those assembled were thought
to have survived the house's destruction and the storm's later
perils. Cora Cline, pregnant and ill in bed, was among those lost.
</P>
<P>
   Larson explains how, despite personal grief, Cline strove to
write a dispassionate, scientific report on the hurricane for his
agency's national headquarters. But for the first time in his
career, he wrote in the first person. He advised Willis Moore, the
bureau's director, to omit personal references he might think
inappropriate. Moore released Cline's report as written, including
a description of Cline's wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   Larson notes how the Houston Post newspaper castigated the
Weather Bureau for providing no warning of the storm's approach.
``With the weather bureau saying that Saturday would be `fair,
fresh, possibly brisk, northerly winds on the coast' of East
Texas,'' the paper asked rhetorically, ``who would have looked for
the most destructive hurricane of modern times on the coast on that
date?''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by this criticism, Moore sent out a release falsely
stating his agency had warned Galveston the storm was coming.
Larson found that some papers, not doubting the official's word,
responded by praising the weather service for a job well done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaac's Storm'' flows admirably except for some historical
detours early in the book. These occur first when Larson, in
considerable detail, fills readers in on how power struggles dogged
Christopher Columbus during New World explorations. Larson should
have limited his narrative to weather events that shaped things for
the great explorer but couldn't resist including such details as
how at one point a rival had Columbus locked in chains.
</P>
<P>
   Then Larson launches into a survey of pioneering weather-related
scientific study. It ranges over Galileo's experiment that
determined air had weight; research by Evangelista Torricelli and
Robert Boyle that led to the barometer's development; William
Dampier's descriptions of ``lurid atmospheric colors'' seen before
storms; and Daniel Defoe's chronicles of the destructive storm that
battered the British Isles in 1703.
</P>
<P>
   This was probably intended to inform readers on the then still
limited meteorological knowledge available to Isaac Cline, but it
comes across as a pedantic detour.
</P>
<P>
   From there on Larson plunges unstintingly into the story of a
monumental tragedy, bringing Cline to life and reminding us of the
complex factors underlying our fates, from bureaucratic bungling to
pure chance.

ENDURING MUSIC GIVES BLONDIE A POP LEGACY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Forgive and forget,'' Debbie Harry coos seductively on a
burbling electro-pop track from ``No Exit,'' the first album of
fresh material from original new-wavers Blondie in almost two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, that simple phrase seems a fitting mantra of sorts
for the group, whose slew of enduring pop tunes, including No. 1
hits ``Heart of Glass,'' ``Call Me,'' ``Rapture`` and ``The Tide is
High,'' made Blondie an icon for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   The group found U.K. success with its 1976 self-titled debut
album and its follow-up, ``Plastic Letters,'' but it was Blondie's
third effort, 1979's ``Parallel Lines,'' that got U.S. audiences
grooving to the mix of rock, rap, disco and reggae.
</P>
<P>
   Harry released a solo album ``KooKoo,'' in 1982, which also
marked the release of ``The Hunter,'' Blondie's sixth album.
Sluggish sales and building tensions, however, caused Blondie to
lose some of its shimmer. Fist fights often broke out among the
group's male members _ including keyboardist Jimmy Destri, drummer
Clem Burke and guitarist Chris Stein. (Bassist Nigel Harrison and
lead guitarist Frank Infante joined the group in the late '70s, but
are not part of the reunion.)
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Stein was diagnosed with pemphigus in
1981, a potentially fatal disease that caused him to break out in
blisters all over his body. (It was the inspiration for ``Screaming
Skin,'' a track on ``No Exit.'') Harry, who was romantically
involved with Stein at the time, spent the next two years nursing
him back to health, but Blondie was no more _ at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Harry released a number of tepidly received solo albums in the
late '80s and early '90s, and the other members busied themselves
with families and side projects. Seventeen years later, however,
Blondie is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not as much acrimony as we once had. We all chose to
do this now. We got this up and running,'' said Burke, 43, calling
recently from a tour stop in Cleveland. ``We all put a lot of time,
energy and emotion into doing this. We realize there's a lot of
history amongst us, obviously. It almost kind of feels like a
family _ a dysfunctional one. I think we all respect one another,
and we're having a good time with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No Exit,'' Blondie's seventh album, marks a fine return to
form for the group. It was released in February and brims with
dark, edgy instrumentation and power-pop grooves and catchy
choruses. Harry is as coolly seductive as ever, weaving
effortlessly through rock, electronica and doo-wop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of hard to put your finger on (the album's sound),''
said Harry, 54. ``I guess that's just sort of intrinsic to our
nature. The old Blondie records have some of that, too. I think
primarily (I just wanted) to do a good record, the best record that
we could do. After not having worked together for such a long time,
just to sort of try to be cool and work with everybody and make the
best of what we were and what we are today.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``No Exit`` is indeed awash in the sounds and styles of
the '90s, it does seem a logical follow-up to the albums and
singles that have made Blondie one of pop music's most enduring
acts. Even during the band's 17-year absence, its music popped up
everywhere _ in movies, on dance floors, at parties _ and
consistently draws an enthusiastic response from fans of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they're good songs, you know? We were concerned with
writing songs ... not just sort of riffs,'' Harry said. ``I think
that the songs are complete thoughts in a way, and that sort of
stays with you. I can't attribute it to anything more than a lot of
good luck, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke offers a more concrete theory on the long-running success
of the group's classic tracks, which he called Blondie's
``legacy.'' He believes those past successes are enabling Blondie
to re-emerge and continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we stopped performing, I really don't think the music
went away,'' Burke said. ``Especially in places like the U.K., we
had a lot of success there in the late '70s. We laid a lot of roots
down in places like that, as well as the States. We're sort of part
of the musical fabric at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   That staying power ensured immediate radio play for ``Maria,''
the first single off ``No Exit.'' The wistful song about a mystery
woman did receive considerable airplay and press in the United
States, but it failed to make a significant impact on the charts.
In the United Kingdom, however, Blondie remains as icy-hot as ever.
The song entered the charts overseas at No. 1, making Blondie the
first group to have No. 1 singles in the U.K. in each of the past
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can ever predict what's gonna happen with
a record,'' Harry said of the song's disparate levels of success.
``We did have a very good fan base over there and quite a
reputation for pop singles. I think that song really fit into ...
their kind of market for singles. I don't know if ``Maria`` is
exactly sort of an American-style song for right now, but we did
get some airplay on it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Blondie has enjoyed widespread success with its new
material, it would have been easy for the supergroup to package a
greatest hits collection with a few new tracks and hit the
reunion-tour circuit, a la Fleetwood Mac. Boom _ instant success,
without the pressure of a show full of new material that may or may
not sit well with longtime fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of obvious when a band is just kinda doing
one or two new songs with a greatest hits type of thing. It doesn't
really seem as though they wanna be a band, maybe. With us, we
wanted to be a band again,'' Burke said, adding that the group
hopes to record another album next year. ``We wanted to be around
each other again, and we wanted to create music with each other.
God knows there have been enough Blondie greatest hits things as
well. We wanted to see if the chemistry was still there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No Exit`` also finds Harry trading rap licks with Coolio on
the album's title track. It's a return to familiar ground for the
singer, who introduced rap music to a whole new audience on
Blondie's early '80s hit, ``Rapture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's always attracted me to rap is that it was a
breakthrough event,'' Harry said. ``What it did for young black
artists, and for the black audience, was it gave them a voice that
was kin to folk music. Rap just really had to happen, ... and when
it did happen it was so exciting and so obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry and the other members of Blondie took the rap connection a
step further this past January at the American Music Awards, where
the band performed ``No Exit`` with Coolio, Wu-Tang Clan and Mobb
Deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really say that I am the penultimate rap fan, that I
follow doggedly at the heels of rappers, but ... I've met Foxy
Brown, and I like Lil' Kim and Missy Elliott,'' Harry said. ``I
think the stuff is fantastic. It's beautifully written, it's
clever, it's rhythmically interesting. There's so much going on.
It's good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In between her musical careers as both a solo artist and as a
member of Blondie, Harry has built a varied and steady career as an
actress. She was recently seen in the indie film ``Six Ways to
Sunday.'' Her most notable roles include Velma Von Tussle in John
Water's ``Hairspray`` and bitter waitress Delores (her strongest
big-screen performance to date) in ``Heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it very challenging to assume different characters and
to work in the technical world of film,'' Harry said. ``It's a real
discipline, and I like that kind of work. That's what gets me off.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain degree, I think I've always approached Blondie as
acting _ sort of a discipline or event or challenge or whatever.
Not to say that it's impersonal, but sort of the way that I develop
the character. To work it onstage is sort of like acting in some
ways. It's sort of weird. It's this sort of gray area, or crossover
area, between some kind of performance art and becoming somebody
else entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   When the band finally does hit the stage, expect the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``First there's a dog act. Then we bring on the topless dancers,
and then ...'' Harry pauses and lets out a laugh. ``No, no. Just
doing some of our old stuff and a lot of the new stuff. It sounds
really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the group's enduring and ever-growing track record, it
would be hard to argue with that statement.

SPELLING RELISHES SHOWING A DIFFERENT SIDE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Oh my God _ I didn't know you could act!''
</P>
<P>
   According to Tori Spelling, that's the usual reaction from
people who see her touchingly funny, scene-stealing performance in
the movie ``Trick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great, thanks. I've been working since I was 5,`` said
Spelling recently. She was on her way home after a day of shooting
in Los Angeles for the 10th season of ``Beverly Hills, 90210.``
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been doing good acting on (90210) for 10 years,
but they dismiss that because it's my father's (TV guru Aaron
Spelling) show,'' she said. ``People's perception is really weird.
No one wants to see you get ahead, but all of a sudden you do one
thing that's completely different and has nothing to do with your
dad, and all of a sudden they're like, `Oh wow, now she's good.'
I've had to deal with it my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine, Spelling's character in ``Trick,'' shows up at
precisely the wrong times throughout the film. It's a charming
romantic fluff about two guys, Gabriel and Mark, whose plans for a
one-night stand in New York City are constantly thwarted by
annoying interruptions. One moment Katherine is printing out 150
resumes in best friend Gabriel's (Christian Campbell, Neve's
brother) apartment, the next she's yakking it up at a late-night
diner where Gabriel finally thinks he can be alone with go-go
dancer Mark (John Paul Pitoc).
</P>
<P>
   It's in these scenes that Spelling deftly balances the
caricature aspects of aspiring actress Katherine with her
deep-rooted insecurities, sometimes without even saying a word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm most proud of this part, I really am. I made that
character my own,'' Spelling said. ``That's the personality I chose
to give her. I also wanted to make sure that I made her vulnerable
so that people wouldn't be just plain annoyed by the character. I
don't know. With my big eyes and everything, I always look
vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Those characteristics have also helped her craft a sympathetic
portrait of rich girl Donna Martin for the past decade on
``90210.'' Spelling has become an integral part of the show's
success, despite harsh criticism in the beginning because her
father was the show's creator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been dealing with it for so long that I kind of just got
hardened to it,'' Spelling said. ``At first it hurt, and it was
hard to deal with. Then I kind of got the attitude like, `I'm gonna
just try really hard and do really great work, and then they won't
be able to say it anymore.' Now I'm over it. I don't care what
people say.''
</P>
<P>
   Spelling saw ``Trick`` as another opportunity to show people
what she can do. Besides being charmed by the romantic storyline,
the actress was attracted to the role of Katherine because of its
comedic possibilities, skills she doesn't get to showcase on
``90210`` or in TV movies like ``Co-ed Call Girl`` and ``A Friend
to Die For.'' Spelling auditioned for director Jim Fall, who was
already interested in her during initial talks, and won the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to choose characters that are completely different from
what people would think of me as doing or what I've done in the
past to challenge myself,'' Spelling said. ``We all have that
Broadway star inside of us that's bursting to get out, so I related
to that part. I've always wanted to be that character _ that
vibrant, outgoing character that would do anything at any time. It
was fun ... to be crazy and loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Singing and dancing were required of Spelling who, as Katherine,
accompanies Gabriel to a musical writing workshop early in the
film. It was Katherine's time to shine, but for Spelling, it was a
new (and somewhat exhausting) experience. She took two weeks of
singing lessons to prepare for her debut vocal performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I'd been tone deaf, so I was freaking out
(when I got the part). When I got to New York, they're like, `Oh
and by the way, you're gonna have to tap now.' I learned this whole
choreographed routine in a week. I was kinda nervous,'' Spelling
admitted. ``The room of people was sitting there watching me. We
were in this little classroom building that had no air
conditioning, and I had to do it, like, 20 times. I was sweating.
Ugh. My makeup was pouring off.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with 1997's ``The House of Yes,'' Spelling has
concentrated her big-screen career on supporting roles in edgy,
independent films. (Her parody of herself in ``Scream 2`` doesn't
really count.) While it's made for a surprisingly interesting
addition to her resume, Spelling admits that it wasn't necessarily
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the fact that I didn't get a big Hollywood
movie,'' she said with a laugh. ``But I haven't minded it because I
think more of the interesting roles and scripts are independents
anyway. Big-budget features usually have to follow a certain
formula because they're banking on it. For women, it's really hard
to find those interesting roles that are really different, and I
didn't wanna be, like, the token girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the latest developments on ``Beverly Hills, 90210,''
Spelling was vague, only offering that this year, like always, will
bring lots of ``love transitions.'' She did admit, though, that
this will likely be the last hurrah for Kelly, David, Donna and the
rest of the gang, which will give Spelling more time for films and
a possible sitcom, where she can showcase her affinity for physical
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even know if the (90210) pilot would get picked up.
It was, at the time, such a new venue _ the teen drama. There
really weren't any others like it. Every year we thought, `Who
knows? It might be the last year,' but it's been going on and on
and on. I'm pretty sure this is the final year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, however, that this isn't the end for Spelling. If
she keeps up her current pace, she'll be tapping her way into
interesting and varied roles for a while longer.

ROCKER'S NAME ON LUBBOCK FESTIVAL? THAT'LL BE THE DAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lubbock, Texas, will celebrate its most famous son next weekend,
and Buddy Holly will be there in spirit, if not in name.
</P>
<P>
   A music festival that has borne the late singer's name for the
past three years, and sporadically for several previous years, will
still be held, but this year it will be called the Crossroads of
Texas Music Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Holly's widow, Maria Elena Holly of Dallas,
turned down the city's offer of $50,000 and 15 percent of the
profits for the right to use his name.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said she wanted more money, but Holly blamed them
for the collapse of negotiations. She did not return phone calls
this week, but in June she told The Associated Press, ``I am tired
of being used as a scapegoat. I am tired of city officials who
don't know how to put a festival together saying bad things about
me.''
</P>
<P>
   She reportedly threatened to sue the city if the festival were
held even under a different name, claiming it would benefit from
proximity to Holly's birthday, Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Holly has given her approval to the Buddy Holly
Center, whose opening next weekend will coincide with the music
festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been very supportive,'' said Connie Gibbons, director of
the Holly Center, a 12,000-square-foot train depot turned cultural
arts center that will house a permanent exhibit of Holly
memorabilia. ``She has given permission to name a building after
him, and she has given us licensing agreements and loaned some
artifacts for the exhibit.''
</P>
<P>
   Holly's band, the Crickets, which includes two of the original
members, will perform with the Lubbock Symphony as part of the
three-day opening of the center.
</P>
<P>
   Holly's blend of country, rock 'n' roll and rhythm and blues
made him a sensation in the 1950s, and songs such as ``Peggy Sue``
and ``That'll Be The Day`` are still considered classics of that
era.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, he was killed in a plane crash that also took the lives
of rock icons Richie Valens and J.P. ``The Big Bopper'' Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Since his death, his family has fought to maintain control over
royalties and licensing of his name and likeness. Legal battles
have been waged over a guitar company's marketing of Holly's
silhouette on its instruments and a record company's marketing of
red suede shoes like the ones he wore.
</P>
<P>
   The family prevailed in both disputes.
</P>

A SAFER WAY TO USE A CELLULAR PHONE AND DRIVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM BARLOW 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Cellular phone use is growing 40 to 50 percent a year.
By next year, it's estimated there will be 80 million cell phone
users in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it seems that every one of those people are sharing
the streets and highways with me.
</P>
<P>
   They yak away, driving 20 to 30 miles below the speed limit.
They wander into other lanes as they become engrossed in their
conversations. They are a menace.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I know that cell phones are great timesavers. They allow
people to keep in touch on the road. In case of an emergency, they
can be lifesavers. I'm glad that my spouse carries a cell phone for
that reason. At times, I've even been guilty of calling her in her
car, although I do try to keep the conversation as brief as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   But they are dangerous. Here's news to all you people using your
cell phones in your car. You're snockered. You are driving just
about as well as someone who has quaffed the legal limit of
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   That's the conclusion of a Toronto study published in the
prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MORE ACCIDENT-PRONE WITH PHONES? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at people who had car accidents and also had
car phones. Then it looked at billing records of those car phones
to see if the persons were talking on the phone at the time of the
collision.
</P>
<P>
   The study had several holes. The authors noted that people who
were talking a lot on car phones might also have been under
emotional stress at the time. So that stress, rather than car phone
use, might have contributed to the accident. However, it also noted
that they had to receive permission from people in the accident to
examine their car phone records. Those worried about legal
liability might have refused access. So, the relationship between
car phone use and accidents might be higher than the study found.
The study also excluded drivers injured in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   There also are plenty of other distractions drivers suffer.
Those can include everything from the children screaming in the
back seat to someone riding with you who insists on holding a
conversation at the worst possible time.
</P>
<P>
   Distraction is, after all, distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the study concluded that those talking on car phones are
four times more likely to have an accident than those not using
them. That's the same rate of people who are driving while mildly
intoxicated, but beyond the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   So, what about different styles of car phones? Is it safer to
have a hands-free model, rather than holding up the phone with your
hand or raising a shoulder and tilting your head to the side to
hold the phone against your ear?
</P>
<P>
   Hands-free, says the conventional wisdom, is safer. The Toronto
study found no difference in the accident rate. It's the
distraction of carrying on a conversation rather than the way you
do it that causes the mischief.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DWR or DWC? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People with hands-free cell phones do make it more difficult to
spot people guilty of DWR _ or driving while raving. Those are the
ones holding animated conversations while alone in the car. These
people should be avoided at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Although, come to think of it, in view of the Toronto study,
there's no difference between DWR and DWC _ driving while celling.
</P>
<P>
   Three countries, Brazil, Israel and Australia, have banned the
use of telephones while driving. Don't expect similar legislation
in the United States. There are just too many cell phone users and
they tend to be people who not only vote but give money to
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, the car insurers also aren't willing to address the
problem _ saying there's not enough evidence that having a car
phone means you must pay a higher rate for insurance because of the
increased danger.
</P>
<P>
   There's standard advice on car phone use from safety experts _
which few people follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't use it while driving. Park.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you call while driving, program frequently called numbers
so you have to hit one or two buttons instead of 10.
</P>
<P>
   _ In heavy traffic, let a voice messaging service pick up the
call.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't engage in emotional, frustrating or stressful calls
while driving.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you use a portable phone, secure it so you won't be
grabbing at it during sudden stops.
</P>
<P>
   _ When talking on the phone, end the call when driving
conditions deteriorate so you can put all your attention on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone users should develop a standard phrase like,
``Whoops, gotta go. Bad traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   And then use it.
</P>

PULLING TREASURE FROM THE TRASH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATRICIA C. JOHNSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The proverbial van Gogh in the attic and Rembrandt in the cellar
have become more than proverbs as the millennium draws to a close.
More than 200 news stories about lost art rediscovered have been
printed in the past 24 months, snaring attention from Dublin to
Houston, Singapore to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The key words are almost always the same: lost, masterpiece,
attic, anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't stories about works of art looted from
pre-Columbian archaeological sites or stolen by the Nazis during
World War II. Nor are they about art theft from museums.
</P>
<P>
   They are about discovering that the unidentified thing stashed
irreverently in a corner somewhere is not a piece of junk but a
treasure that makes headlines when its anonymous owner sells it for
a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other object, artworks get misplaced or mislabeled.
Some are damaged or forgotten. Taste and context change over time,
as does scholarship, all of which can affect the desirability and
market value of an artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these classic examples of treasures recovered:
</P>
<P>
   A painting by the 16th-century Italian master Caravaggio was
found in a Dublin monastery during a remodeling project. In the
mid-1800s, the painting had been mistakenly attributed to Gerrit
von Hothorst, a Dutch follower of the Italian master; at auction in
1921, it failed to reach the minimum bid of $50, and it soon
disappeared from view. For decades it hung in the dining room of
the Society of Jesus, until a restorer for the National Gallery of
Dublin was recently assigned to clean the dark old painting. It was
``The Taking of Christ,'' valued in the tens of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, announced the
acquisition of a painting by the 19th-century American naturalist
and artist Martin Johnson Heade, a leading exponent of the Luminist
movement. The painting of two magnolias on gold cloth was valued at
an estimated $1.25 million. An unidentified man had bought it for a
few bucks at a rummage sale and taken it to a dealer in New York,
who then contacted the MFA. Just a month before, another Heade
painting of magnolias, bought for $29 in the late 1980s, had sold
at auction for $882,500.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a passer-by retrieved a badly damaged painting from a
Manhattan trash bin. It turned out to be a portrait of Andrew
Foster, an influential businessman of the 19th century whose
descendants included Henry Francis du Pont. Its condition was
described as ``deplorable,'' with punctures and flaking paint, but
it was the work of Samuel Lovett Waldo and William Jewett, whose
renowned New York studio specialized in portraiture of the rich and
famous. After restoration, the painting went to the Museum of the
City of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Such headlines _ reinforced by the enormously popular PBS series
``Antiques Roadshow'' _ have people scouring houses, barns and
garages looking for hidden treasure. They grab hold of our
imagination, like the dream of winning the lottery _ but with a
more active, challenging role for the dreamer.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know whether your Aunt Martha's vase is purely
ornamental or a Tiffany worth $100,000? Or whether that smudgy old
portrait could be the work of a 17th-century Dutch master?
</P>
<P>
   Take your find to an expert, say those who know, but do some
legwork first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find out what it is first,'' said David Lackey of Houston's
David Lackey Antiques. People often don't know the difference
between a reproduction and a painting, for example, or between
glass and porcelain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then look for more specific information, Lackey added. Is the
work signed? Is it dated? If it's framed, look at the back for
labels that may tell you where it was bought, framed, maybe even
exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can be older than the style (of featured clothing or
architecture, for example), but it can be newer,'' Lackey said. ``A
lot of it is just plain logic. It can't possibly have been painted
in 1885 if there is a Model T in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other clues include materials such as oil-based paint, which was
not readily available until after 1870, said Houston art dealer
John ``Sandy'' Parkerson.
</P>
<P>
   In porcelain, a stamp on the bottom identifying the country of
origin means it dates from after 1890. In 1891, Lackey explained,
the United States required that all products entering this country
be so identified.
</P>
<P>
   The more you narrow the field, the easier and more fruitful your
research will be. Then you may want an expert to help.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Cavanaugh, Houston representative for the Christie's
international auction house, says her office gets an average of 25
calls a week, of which 10 sound promising and four may actually pan
out.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``Antiques Roadshow'' has raised the number of inquiries
and ``the level of curiosity,'' Cavanaugh said, although at the
high end, collectors have always been there.
</P>
<P>
   When people call, she said, she asks for basic information _ a
photograph of the object, details such as a signature or hallmark,
dimensions, condition and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all sorts of criteria we look for,'' Cavanaugh said.
``There's a form on our Web site you can fill in and send to us in
Houston or New York (www.christies.com/sell/index.html).''
</P>
<P>
   If the object seems to warrant it, a visit by an expert can be
arranged. Frequently, of course, the hoped-for treasure is not
treasure at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get tricked,'' Cavanaugh said. ``There are a lot of
photo reproductions and synthetic stones, so we deliver bad news,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People also bring you everything they bought at a garage sale
which they hope is worth more than what they paid for it,''
Parkerson added.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases his response is something like: ``It's very nice,
but it doesn't have a collectible value. It has a decorative
value.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Parkerson still tells the story of a phone call about 20
years ago, when he worked for Sotheby's in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A couple had inherited a scene of Yellowstone and didn't know
whether it was a print or an original, Parkerson said. It turned
out to be an original _ by American master landscape artist Thomas
Moran. It was a view of a geyser dated 1872, done as part of the
Hayden Survey of a year earlier (named for its leader, Ferdinand V.
Hayden).
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always a bit skeptical,'' Parkerson said, ``but this
turned out to be a watercolor with perfect provenance (history). It
had been sent to this couple's ancestor, a U.S. senator from
Vermont, as a lobbying effort to make Yellowstone a national
park.''
</P>
<P>
   Parkerson recalled that the work sold at auction for $24,000. It
was a fortune to the sellers, who had to be notified by mail
because they had no telephone. Last year, the piece resurfaced and
sold for more than $650,000.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, fame and monetary value play no role in happy
endings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a plot in a movie: Buy an old house, enter its
attic and stumble across treasure,'' Irene Ng wrote in the Straits
Times of Singapore in March. Greg and Joo Mee Seow had bought a
house in the capital last October. Several months later, while
checking on the condition of the roof, they discovered that the
house had an attic. There they found a cache of some 30 paintings
by Chen Wen Hsi, one of Singapore's pioneer artists of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The Seows gave the entire collection to the artist's son.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the millennium, with our global press,
international sales rooms and worldwide Internet access, things as
valuable and well-known as the Caravaggio or as historically
interesting as Foster's portrait can no longer simply disappear.
Can they?
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent van Gogh's ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' at $82.5 million
the most expensive painting ever sold at auction, has done just
that.
</P>
<P>
   It was bought by Japanese businessman Ryoei Saito in 1990 and
stored in a vault; it has not been seen in public since. When Saito
died in 1996, the painting's whereabouts increased in mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Was it destroyed? (Saito said at one time that he wanted it
cremated with him.) Is it stored in a Tokyo warehouse? Was it sold
to an unidentified private collector in America, as a German
television network reported last month?
</P>
<P>
   If it turns up someday, will people praise and covet it as they
did in 1990? Because there's no such thing as absolute quality, and
market value is subject to changing tastes, how will future
generations perceive the notorious portrait of the faintly amused
physician, painted by an artist on the edge of a mental breakdown?
</P>
<P>
   'Tis indeed the proverbial van Gogh in the attic.

LOSS OF TRAILS PUTS BUMP IN THE PATH OF HOUSTON CYCLING
ENTHUSIASTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Photo available on NYT database) 
 
By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Deep in the urban heart of Houston _ a place known for
its relentless flatness _ lies a near-wilderness startling in its
verticality. Hills erupt from the trail bed at 70-degree angles;
paths trace the rims of ravines that plunge 30 feet to the bayou
below.
</P>
<P>
   Thrill-seekers who probe its shadowed subtropical recesses give
it names like Cambodia, Laos and Ho Chi Minh _ labels that bespeak
impenetrable jungles fraught with danger.
</P>
<P>
   Picnickers, golfers, bird-watchers and others of the sedate set,
though, know it as Memorial Park, an unthreatening 1,500-acre haven
for weary city-dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the park and its proper use are at the center of a shrill
debate between thousands of youthful off-road mountain bikers and
the park's traditional defenders, the Memorial Park Advisory Board.
</P>
<P>
   Board members, whose recommendations led the city this summer to
close about six of 12 miles of mountain bike trails, claim the
low-slung bicycles with their studded tires accelerate devastating
erosion along Buffalo Bayou. Bikers, they say, additionally have
vandalized the park by ripping down ``trail closed'' signs hours
after they were posted.
</P>
<P>
   Bikers counter that board members are affluent snobs whose
efforts to close the Memorial Park trails are based on class bias.
``They never did want us back in their park,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle, parks director Oliver B. Spellman Jr. has
called a series of meetings to obtain additional comment on the
closings. Ultimately, he hopes, better mountain bike trails can be
established inside and outside Memorial Park.
</P>
<P>
   Although all decisions in the matter ultimately are his, the
opinion of the park advisory board traditionally has carried great
weight. Other park-support groups have called upon the city to
stand by its original decision.
</P>
<P>
   Among mountain bikers _ as many as 2,000 Houston off-road
cyclists use the park _ the charms of Memorial are legendary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Aspen, Colo.,'' said local bicyclist Phillip Mount,
30, ``and a guy was saying, `You've got a killer trail system down
in Houston.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a gem,'' added biker Dave Calvo, 36, who has ridden
the trails since 1994. ``I'd venture to say that most metropolitan
areas just don't have anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston business owner and biker Dave Parker, 35, said, ``The
trails are one of the few things that keep me from moving to
another part of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lured by the trails' ``technicals'' _ challenging twists, hills
and tree roots _ a number of Houston riders who have gone on to
national and international celebrity have relied on Memorial for
training. In coming weeks, an Italian road bike team will arrive to
begin off-road training in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Without access to Memorial, bikers say, they must drive at least
100 miles to find challenging trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've taken out some of the best trails,'' Calvo said of the
closures. ``I don't know if it was by design or not, but the city
has taken the fun out of ridership.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the trails now closed is a nerve-sapping segment dubbed
``The Widow Maker.''
</P>
<P>
   Off-road bikers first began using the park's back trails about a
decade ago, and their presence in an area previously used largely
by hikers and equestrians generated almost instant concern.
</P>
<P>
   At least one rider has met his death on the back-park trails,
but most official concern is directed to injury to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cut their own trails in many cases, and the results have
not been good for the park,'' said Glenda Barrett, a member of the
Memorial advisory board and executive director of Park People, a
nonprofit group supporting Houston parks. ``There has been a great
deal of ecological damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett is among those calling on the city to resist biker
efforts to get trails reopened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of Houston Parks and Recreation Department is
besieged by these mountain bikers,'' she wrote Mayor Lee Brown.
``One group of citizens must not be permitted to abuse a public
park, destroying its fragile ecosystem for other citizens and for
generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'90s, the advisory board _ an oversight body
established by philanthropist Ima Hogg after her family sold the
city the property in the mid-1920s _ began seeking ways to limit
the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Although riding bicycles on park trails is illegal by city
ordinance, board chairwoman Claire Caudill said her group began
negotiating with the Houston Area Mountain Bicycle Riding
Association, or HAMBRA, then the only such group in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, we were very happy to get a compromise,'' said
Larry Pruitt, a HAMBRA board member who was active in the
discussions. ``There was a good deal of bouncing back and forth,
and it finally came up with what we have today. We got about 60
percent of the trails and agreed to close about 40 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also provided for user fees of up to $50 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was signed in December 1996, but almost two years
elapsed before the parks department approached City Council for
$60,000 to improve or close trails.
</P>
<P>
   When city crews began erecting barricades and blocking trails
with brush earlier this summer, many riders were shocked. That
surprise gave birth to a new, strident biker group called the
Memorial Park Mountain Biking Association.
</P>
<P>
   While group leadership has been reluctant to make public
comments on the controversy, individual members have expressed
dismay with the older HAMBRA group's negotiated agreement. ``No one
has ever sanctioned HAMBRA as the negotiating committee,'' one
biker complained.
</P>
<P>
   It was the new group's agitation that led parks director
Spellman to reopen the issue for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Case, spokeswoman for the new mountain biking group,
charged that the city ``closed three-fourths of the biking/hiking
trails to mountain bikes and runners by installing barricades and
cutting live trees down to block the trails.''
</P>
<P>
   Other biking association members said they had seen live trees
bent across the trails and tied to block passage. ``It's ironic,''
said one, ``that they trashed the trails in order to close them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some bikers have criticized the city for failing to undertake a
scientific examination of the erosion problem, and they have
suggested that erosion is purely a natural result of the bayou's
periodic flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of the guys, they won't admit it,'' said biker
Calvo, ``but they're really tree huggers. If there's a reasonable
environmental study that says, `Sure enough, bikers are trashing
trails and causing damage,' I think 75 (percent) to 95 percent
would say, `Fine, we'll stay off the trails and find another place
to ride.'''
</P>
<P>
   Calvo said, however, that most of the discussion about the cause
of the erosion seems to be imprecise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see parts of the area being eroded away,'' he said, ``and
they see mountain bikers. They put one and one together whether
they're right or wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what has everybody up in arms,'' said fellow biker
Parker. ``They have closed down the trails using the reasons that
it's damaging the ecosystem. Yet they have no studies and no
evidence. I would say, in general, there is a reason. But no one
can figure out why. Everyone has an opinion, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisory board chairwoman Caudill admitted that no formal
scientific study has been conducted. But she said, ``You can pretty
much see what the situation is by looking.''
</P>
<P>
   A tour of some of the closed trails reveals areas where ravines
have eroded to a depth of about 15 feet. A number of areas are
scarred by abandoned, eroded trails that have been replaced by new
trails a short distance away.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this was as flat as the rest of Houston at one time,''
said Don Gray, a retired geologist and advisory board member.
``These are just ravines.''
</P>
<P>
   Horse hooves or even human hikers could damage the trails and
set the stage for erosion. But, Caudill said, ``we don't have 2,000
hikers coming through here.''
</P>
<P>
   Caudill disputed Case's claim that the trails now are impassable
to runners, but noted that closing the damaged trails for all uses
might be advisable. ``Some of them just would benefit from being
rested for a while,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bikers argued that the closure of trails may lead to unsafe
conditions on those that remain open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very unfortunate situation,'' said Mount. ``You've cut
the existing trails by more than half, and you'll still have the
same amount of traffic. You'll still have runners and hikers using
those trails. There's a real probability that someone will get
hurt.''

STUDENTS NOT SWEATING LIFE IN GENERAL AT TEXAS A&AMP;M'S COED DORM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Whoever said ladies don't sweat was
flat out lying.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the new residents of Hart Hall.
</P>
<P>
   One of only two Texas A&AMP;M University dormitories with no air
conditioning, Hart has traditionally been an all-male bastion of
stoics who cope with the heat by stripping to their underwear,
throwing open their doors and cranking up the window fans.
</P>
<P>
   It's an Aggie pride thing.
</P>
<P>
   Shared misery is their bond.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and it's the cheapest housing on campus.
</P>
<P>
   This year though, Hart Hall is going coed, giving 24 women the
equal opportunity to swelter and save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting it to be worse than it really is,'' said Becky
Howard, a senior in history who is a member of the hall staff.
``People have told me, `It's so small and the guys will be mean to
you,' but it's not like that. Most of the guys have been
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she's already lived in the nicer, newer,
air-conditioned halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was kind of boring, quiet,'' she said. ``Here there is
a lot more bonding. The doors are open because you want the
ventilation, and the heat drives everybody out of their rooms so
it's easier to meet people.''
</P>
<P>
   The hall's director, Mark Chaszer, a graduate student from
Spring, Texas, said that when women seeking a low-cost housing
option proposed making Hart coed two years ago, some of the hall's
276 male residents voiced ``serious displeasure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And of course, some sexist attitudes popped up,'' he said.
``But last year, everything came together. Some of the guys who
were opposed to it graduated or moved and since then, all I've
heard is, `When are the women coming? When are the women coming?'''
</P>
<P>
   Vic Romero, a university staffer who supervises seven residence
halls, said the 68-year-old Hart building has one of the highest
return rates on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is economic. Hart and Walton Hall, the
campus' only other dorm without air conditioning, cost $612 per
semester. That compares with fees up to $2,500 a semester for newer
halls with bigger rooms, private baths and better carpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the freshmen are moving in, well, it's usually the
mothers who have a problem with them being in a non-air-conditioned
building and the building being so old,'' Chaszer said. ``But by
the end of the day, their kids have already met two or three people
who will be their friends, and most college students are successful
if they can make a connection with someone within three weeks of
being on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   The real test of the women's integration, though, will be the
Aggie bonfire, said Ryan Locker, a political science major who
serves on the hall staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the women have been very active in their former
halls,'' he said, so it will be interesting to see how fully they
are included in the hall's annual participation in building the
bonfire. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; And both men and women are anxious to see how the newly coed
hall will vote on the issue of visiting hours. If 90 percent of the
residents vote in favor, visitation could be expanded from the
current 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. to 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   A few other changes are likely in the works as well, as the
overwhelmingly male hall attempts to accommodate two dozen women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rather testosterone-filled dorm, with a lot of guys
going around in their boxers,'' Locker said. ``They still do that,
though I was hoping they wouldn't.''

STRESS, BUGS CAUSE BRANCHES TO DROP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Branches are breaking off the pecan trees in my neighborhood.
The limbs do not seem to have any insect damage and seem healthy.
Is it because of the earlier summer rains that are causing the
limbs to be too heavy to support the heavy pecan load? Is there
anything that can be done to prevent further damage to the trees?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some years pecans produce too many nuts for the trees to
support the entire load. This, coupled with the fact that the trees
can become weak and brittle when stressed, increases the likelihood
of breaking branches.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's drought and the recent long, hot and dry period have
weakened many trees. Keep pecans well watered. Water slowly and
deeply so that the soil is moist 8 to 12 inches down. A good layer
of organic mulch will help modify soil temperatures and moisture.
</P>
<P>
   It's sometimes beneficial to reduce a tree's load by knocking
some of the nuts to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Also, pecan branches are sensitive to lack of sunlight. When
branches shade others, those limbs that receive insufficient light
die, and the trees self-prune. This usually is not worth the worry.
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, we also get questions about what causes
smaller limbs and twigs to fall. The culprit is usually twig
girdler beetles. These pests cause pecans, oaks, mimosas and other
trees to drop branches. Twig girdlers lay their eggs in the twigs
of these trees, then chew around the twigs, and the girdled
branches die and drop. The eggs in these fallen pieces hatch, and
the larvae mature.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing to do in this situation is to gather the fallen
pieces of wood. I find myself removing such wood from beneath our
red oak each year.
</P>
<P>
   All trees are suffering from the extremes of recent years. Last
year's drought weakened many, making it easier for pest invasions.
We have lost many large pines that became vulnerable to pine bark
beetles. We did get rain earlier this summer, but it's been
terribly dry in the past six weeks. When so stressed, trees can
drop what they can't support. Our red and post oaks are dropping
leaves like crazy, even though I work hard to provide adequate
moisture. About all I can do at this point is hope for a break.
</P>
<P>
   Q: For five years I've been battling two vines in my beds. Could
you tell me what they are and how I can eliminate them without
destroying existing flowers and shrubs? The first twines around
azaleas, oleander _ everything. It seems to ``choke'' some of my
plants. Is this wild morning glory? The second vine is thorny with
a variegated leaf.
</P>
<P>
   A: The thorny vine with the variegated, heart-shaped leaves is
one of the species of Smilax, commonly called greenbriar. It is
difficult to eradicate since this member of the lily family
reproduces from an underground tuber. If you can't get a hold on
the tuber, keep cutting the vine back to the ground. Eventually,
the roots will die since there will be no top growth to replenish
and support the underground system.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbriar (``Smilax spp.'') also goes by the common names bull
briar and cat briar. The vines have green woody stems that are
armed with sharp spines that easily tear your clothes and you.
</P>
<P>
   The other vine with the simple, three-lobed leaves appears to be
one of the morning glories. Thanks to a mild winter, those got a
running start this spring. From time to time, I set aside a weekend
morning and go after the vines. This heavy-duty removal lasts for
several weeks, but I do have to repeat the process.
</P>
<P>
   You can CAREFULLY apply a systemic herbicide for some possible
relief of these vines. But be sure this chemical does not come in
contact with valued plants. I'm afraid some things just grow well
when others are dying in the heat and drought.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is a biblical story about the passionflower, that each
part is symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   A: The passionflower vine (``Passiflora spp.'') is one of our
most exotic blooms. It is steeped in Christian symbolism. The five
blood-colored anthers at the center of the bloom suggest the five
wounds of Christ, and the fringed corona represents the crown of
thorns. The stamens resemble a cross, the stigmas are symbolic of
the nails that impaled Christ to the cross and the petals represent
the apostles at the crucifixion.

ABC STRIKES GOLD WITH `MILLIONAIRE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Combine a Kathie Lee-less Regis Philbin, a reworking of a
British game show and the third-place network in the dead of summer
television and what do you get?
</P>
<P>
   A ratings monster. A return to the nostalgic days when game
shows fared well in prime time. Or further proof that people will
watch just about anything you put in front of them in August.
Depends upon your point of view.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an ABC executive, the answer is clear. During the
first week of its 13-day run, ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?''
was the second-, fifth-, sixth-, 12th- and 18th-most popular show
on television. Ratings for the latter part of the run _ which ended
Sunday night _ will doubtless climb even higher. Numbers like that
guaranteed that the show would return in some form, and it will,
for November sweeps. (Why not? How many countries can they send
Drew Carey to?)
</P>
<P>
   Even though no one actually won $1 million, ``Millionaire'' is a
certifiable phenomenon, a water-cooler topic. Who among us hasn't
mentally trashed the knucklehead from Richmond, Va., for not going
for the $1 million question last week? Doesn't everyone know that
Jethro Tull won the first Grammy for heavy metal? Sure, his
$500,000 winnings would have been whacked to $32,000 if he'd
missed, but you know you'd have gone for it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you also wouldn't have known Pope John Paul I's real
name, which this guy did to get to the $1 million question.
Details, details. This is television we're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   (A contestant on Thursday night missed a $64,000 question _
really _ when he thought the Keating Five was a group of bankers.
This bodes well for John McCain's presidential aspirations.)
</P>
<P>
   On the off chance that you recently defected to the United
States and have no idea what all the fuss is over, here's a quick
explanation (clip and save for the show's return):
</P>
<P>
   One contestant is chosen from a group of 10, who qualified for a
free trip to New York and the studio over the phone. Most had to
pay $1.50 for an area-code 900 call; lucky residents of nine states
(including Arizona) made free 800 calls.
</P>
<P>
   Once chosen, the contestant sits across from Philbin and answers
a series of questions, beginning at $100 and more or less doubling
in value every time. They also increase in difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds about as interesting as a root canal so far. But the
producers jack up the tension with a space-age set, smarmy music,
tricky lighting and annoying comments from Philbin, who squeezes as
much drama out of a trivia question as Bill Clinton does from an
apology. (But Regis doesn't cry.)
</P>
<P>
   Contestants see the question before deciding to continue. Plus,
they are allowed three ``Lifelines.'' They can eliminate two of the
four possible answers, giving them a 50-50 shot. They can ask the
audience for help (sort of an instant poll). Or they can make a
live phone call to a presumably smart friend, asking for the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just doubling the money, questions get a little more
intense,'' Philbin told TV critics earlier this summer. ``But the
production values surrounding this is what really is the icing on
the cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lighting gets a little more intense, the music gets a
little stronger, the guy gets up to a quarter million dollars,
suddenly you hear a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he calls his friend . . . and asks him the question
with the four possible answers, and that second hand is ticking,
you're down to 16 seconds, the music comes in _ I tell you, it's
really terrific television.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davies, the executive producer of the show, looked to an
old-time game-show host to explain the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monty Hall used to say that every great game show has one
moment where the contestant is going to win everything or lose
everything,'' Davies said. ``This program takes that moment,
heightens it with lighting and music and the intimacy of the set,
and plays that moment again and again and again. And it's a very,
very simple idea.''
</P>
<P>
   It really, really is. Much like the classic '50s game shows
were. Which is probably the real reason people watch the show _ it
seems so simple, you could see yourself winning. And answering
trivia questions is more work than buying a lottery ticket _ you
would feel like you earned your windfall.
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity is deceptive, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions are not impossible,'' Philbin said on a show
last week. ``It's the broad range that'll kill you every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you start naming your first-born son Regis, remember one
thing: It's August. ``Millionaire'' was up against the likes of
reruns of ``Jesse'' and ``Jag.'' That's not much of a test _ a
scrambled porno channel would probably do well in that competition.
</P>
<P>
   (Not to imply that anyone would really watch scrambled porno.
That was a hypothetical example. Besides, I was young.)
</P>
<P>
   So, in the spirit of the thing, when ``Millionaire'' returns,
will it: A) continue to kill in the ratings; B) suffer a huge drop;
C) torpedo ABC's season or D) send Regis scurrying back to Kathie
Lee with his tail between his legs?
</P>
<P>
   You have until November to answer. &QL;

SPENDING ON SMOKING-PREVENTION EFFORTS LAGGING IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was almost refreshing last week when the
federal health experts at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention renewed debate over the tobacco settlements negotiated
by Texas and other states.
</P>
<P>
   It was refreshing in the sense that they didn't have a single
word to say about the fees awarded the lawyers who won the
settlements, a worn-out dispute that should have gone away a long
time ago.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC people have their priorities straight. Their No. 1
concern is not whether a few rich lawyers get richer but whether
Texas and other states make the best possible use of their tobacco
dollars to fight smoking, the single most preventable cause of
death and disease in the United States today and, supposedly, the
main reason the states sued cigarette companies in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Not so refreshing was that the CDC, in a new report, found
smoking-prevention efforts in Texas and most other states woefully
lacking, despite their settlement windfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad fact remains that most states have not earmarked
significant settlement funds for tobacco control,'' Dr. Jeffrey P.
Koplan, the CDC director, told the National Conference on Tobacco
and Health, which met in Kissimmee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Texas was one of the first states to sue the tobacco industry
over cigarette marketing practices and public health-care costs
related to smoking. And it was one of the first states to settle,
negotiating an agreement under which cigarette makers are to pay
Texas $17.3 billion over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the Legislature budgeted Texas' first $1.8 billion
in tobacco payments. And, under an agreement that chief budget
writers had with former Attorney General Dan Morales, who won the
settlement, they earmarked all of the $1.8 billion for health care.
</P>
<P>
   The money was either placed in endowments or appropriated
outright for the next two-year budget period.
</P>
<P>
   The largest single outright expenditure was about $180 million
for a health insurance program for low-income children. Hundreds of
millions of dollars were set aside in numerous endowments for
medical schools, and a $200 million endowment was created for an
anti-smoking education program to be development by the Texas
Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Most health-care providers and advocates supported the
Legislature's approach. But the American Cancer Society of Texas,
the American Lung Association's Texas division and the Campaign for
Tobacco Free Kids protested that not enough was being spent on
anti-smoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the $200 million health department endowment will
generate only about $10 million a year that can actually be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Although that is a significant increase over the $1 million to
$2 million a year the health department had been spending to
discourage people from smoking, the dissenting groups said it was
woefully inadequate for developing effective anti-smoking programs
for a state as large as Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And, in its new report, the CDC agrees. The CDC said Texas
should be spending (not endowing) at least $103 million a year and,
optimally, more than twice that much. Part of the money, the CDC
said, should be spent on programs to help adults quit smoking. But
much of it would be earmarked for programs in the schools and local
communities _ including television commercials _ to convince
teen-agers not to start smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people begin using tobacco in early adolescence,
typically by age 16; almost all first use occurs before high school
graduation,'' the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   Koplan said that comprehensive tobacco control programs already
tried in California and Massachusetts have been successful.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco control efforts, however, are still untested in Texas
because they have been virtually nonexistent here. That's one
reason legislators took a conservative spending approach. They said
they wanted to be sure the health department can come up with
programs that work.
</P>
<P>
   But with only $10 million a year, the health department won't be
able to develop a statewide program. So health officials will
probably concentrate their efforts on only one region of the state
and try to demonstrate some effective results there, said Dr. Phil
Huang, chief of the agency's bureau of disease, injury and tobacco
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Let us hope they do.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature will be spending billions of dollars in tobacco
money for years to come and can re-evaluate its commitment to
smoking prevention. Spending money to treat cancer and other
smoking-related health problems is important. But it would be more
cost-effective _ and humane _ to prevent many of those illnesses in
the first place.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaac's Storm''By Erik Larson (Crown, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the turn of the century, a blustery time in an America
full of national pride and technical confidence. ``In this new
age,'' Larson writes, ``nature itself seemed no great obstacle.''
Then came tragedy in Galveston, Texas. On Sept. 8, 1900, the worst
hurricane ever to target America roared ashore from the Gulf of
Mexico, killing 8,000 men, women and children. The storm is still
the deadliest natural disaster in American history. Larson builds
his story around Isaac Monroe Cline, the chief meteorologist in
Galveston and the one man who might have saved the city. But
America's inflated self-image and rivalries among meteorologists
combined to downplay the storm's strength until it was too late
(Cuba's meteorologists, who had pioneered the art of hurricane
prediction, correctly judged the storm's scale and path, but their
warnings were ignored by the U.S Weather Bureau, which, Larson
says, ``wanted hurricanes all to itself''). Larson creates tension,
suspense and an ominous sense of impending tragedy as he follows
Cline through the days before the storm and then its ghastly
aftermath. The weatherman, who had thought of his own house as a
fortress, watched as water rose around it, first to his waist and
then to his neck, with tiny toads taking refuge on anything that
protruded above the surface. By the time the storm was over, Cline,
like thousands in Galveston, had lost someone he loved. ``This is
the story of Isaac and his time in America,'' Larson writes, ``the
last turning of the centuries, when the hubris of men led them to
believe they could disregard even nature itself.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The Last Survivor: In Search of Martin Zaidenstadt'' &QL; 
By Timothy W. Ryback (Pantheon, $21) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are jarring moments in this book when Ryback quietly
reminds us that Dachau today is a charming and prosperous community
in the rolling hills of Germany, that it has citizens and shops and
a downtown, that it is picturesque. But who can think of Dachau
without imagining its ghosts? In 1992, editors at ``The New
Yorker'' asked Ryback to write a report on the town and its people,
who, as Ryback notes, live in the shadow of the notorious
concentration camp and ``have DACHAU stamped on their birth
certificates, carry DACHAU on their drivers' licenses and in their
passports, pay DACHAU electric bills, DACHAU water bills and DACHAU
gas bills.'' Ryback wrote his story and went on to other work, but
two months later found himself back in Dachau, driven to further
explore the moral issues that permeate the very air there. It was
at the camp in 1996 that he encountered Martin Zaidenstadt.
Zaidenstadt was 87, a former inmate of the camp who after his
liberation made his home in Dachau _ he married a German woman, had
three children and for years ``discarded'' his Jewish identity. Now
Zaidenstadt kept a daily vigil outside the camp's crematorium,
accosting visitors and tour guides and violating cordoned-off areas
to give impassioned demonstrations of how mass death was carried
out. To the people of Dachau, he was a tortured soul, a madman. To
Rybeck, he was an eyewitness urged on by moral righteousness,
astonishing memories, his own demons and the vanity of firsthand
knowledge. This look at Dachau is as thought-provoking as the old
man who became its living ghost, haunting the camp and haranguing
people with what he knows. ``Who's going to kick him out?'' Ryback
asks.``Who is going to tell him he can't go in there? Martin was
supposed to be gassed in that chamber, burned in that crematorium.
But the Nazis are gone, and the ovens are cold, and Martin is still
there. He has an historic claim like no one else in the world.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The Nest: An Artist's Sketchbook''By Maryjo Koch (ST&AMP;C, $35) &QL; 
The oversize format of this pretty book accounts for much of its
appeal, because Koch renders many birds, nests, eggs and feathers
in their actual size. This might not seem like such an endeavor,
but consider a peacock's feather, with the eyespot that Charles
Darwin called ``the most beautiful object in the world.'' Stretched
across two pages, it is 28 inches long and 10 inches high _ lazy,
lanky and delightful. Among the other pleasures are an array of
wrens and jay eggs, a tanager nest built inside a hornet's nest,
and an American robin's nest that incorporates, along with the
traditional mud and grass, a gum wrapper, a Q-tip, a cigarette
paper and a scrap of duct tape. Our favorite rendering: a selection
of impossibly tiny hummingbird nests, accompanied by words that
botanist Nehemiah Grew wrote in 1693: ``I saw one of these nests
made of cotton wool, in form and bigness of the thumb of a man's
glove, with the taper end downwards wherein were two eggs of the
bigness of a pea of oval form. Who can but admire to see the whole
body and all the parts of a bird folded up in an egg little bigger
than a pepper-corn?'' With a forward by Gretel Ehrlich. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``I Just Kept Hoping''By Gloria Stuart (Little, Brown, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quick, call Celine Dion so she can put us in the mood. Stuart
became famous when at age 87 she played the ancient-but-cute ``Old
Rose'' in James Cameron's film ``Titanic.'' We weren't sure we
wanted to read 306 pages about her, but we now admit that there are
some interesting moments, as when Stuart reveals that she is
addicted to expletives and quotes herself screaming obscenities _
really, really bad ones _ at Cameron and other members of the film
crew. But not to worry. Stuart is 89, so Cameron still loves her,
and her memoir can be called ``irreverent'' by the people who write
the jacket copy. We call it chatty, and would be willing to
overlook all the exclamation points if we could just get Celine to
hum a few bars. &QL;

DEATH OF PITCHER MARS WINNING YEAR FOR ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Every Sunday, Lorrie Robinson buckles her
2-year-old son, Chase, into his car seat and drives to what he
calls ``the park.'' She follows the narrow road past the tall, old
trees with moss draping from the branches to the newest section of
the Oaklawn Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   On clear summer days, she can't help but think this is the
perfect final resting spot for her husband, Kenny: On a mound in
the bright sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   While the Diamondbacks pursue a pennant in just their second
year of existence, it's easy to forget that this season began with
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   A one-car rollover on a dark Tucson road. One Diamondbacks
pitcher, Kenny Robinson, dead. Another, John Rosengren, charged
with manslaughter after tests showed he had a blood-alcohol level
of 0.162, above Arizona's legal limit of 0.10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took two people's lives,'' Liz Robinson, Kenny's mother,
said of the Feb. 28 accident. ``It took John's life, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosengren was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder and
released on $75,000 bail. A grand jury later indicted him on the
manslaughter charge. If convicted, he faces a prison term of seven
to 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rosengren, whose trial is set for Sept. 28, has been out of
baseball since the accident and is living with his parents near
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Robinson family had dreamed this would be a breakthrough
year for Kenny. His injured shoulder was returning to health and
the Diamondbacks were in need of relief help.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed to care that Kenny wasn't the prototype major
league pitcher. On rosters, he was listed at 5-foot-9, but he was
really three inches shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my heart is 5-9,'' he liked to say.
</P>
<P>
   Lorrie and Kenny hoped that at 29, Kenny's career would be
reborn in Arizona. Dreaming he would spend the year with the
Diamondbacks, calling her twice a day, just as he did every day
they had been apart in their 8-year marriage. Telling her of the
excitement of a pennant race, asking about Chase, laughing together
at their $500 monthly phone bills. Still building their days around
those calls.
</P>
<P>
   Lorrie Robinson still can't bring herself to erase Kenny's voice
from the answering machine at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest thing I can't do yet,'' Lorrie said. ``I just
finally opened his suitcases from when they shipped them home.
That's been five months.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny's parents, Liz and Ken Sr., hoped to travel to their son's
games or watch them on satellite. Instead of driving to games now,
they take weekend trips to try to fill lonely hours. &QL; 
Player distraught &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosengren declined to comment, but he is distraught over the
accident, said his lawyer, Mike Piccarreta of Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``John felt it was inappropriate to discuss what he's going
through at this time, and that all thoughts and concerns should be
for the Robinson family,'' Piccarreta said.
</P>
<P>
   North Silverbell Road in Tucson is narrow and filled with gentle
curves and dips as it crosses desert washes. Running roughly
parallel to Interstate 10, which dissects the city, the road is
poorly lit in the 3000 block, where the accident occurred. It's not
a challenging drive, but it does require a clear, attentive mind.
</P>
<P>
   There are few details available about the events of that night.
The families aren't sure where the two men went, and authorities
won't say.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that in the early evening of Feb. 27, Kenny
called Lorrie as usual. He said Rosengren was coming over that
night to watch the North Carolina-Duke basketball game and that
they would probably make an early night of it.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports, the players were southbound on
Silverbell, a two-lane road at that point, about 1:40 a.m. They
were less than a mile from Robinson's apartment when Rosengren's
'97 Explorer drifted off the east side of the road onto a dirt
shoulder. It was estimated to be traveling at 55 mph, 10 mph over
the speed limit. The Explorer then came back on to the road and
turned over on the driver's side.
</P>
<P>
   Neither player was wearing a seat belt, and paramedics had to
use an ax to break out the front windshield, so they could pull the
two men from the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Robinson suffered a severe head injury and was pronounced
dead at the scene. He had a blood-alcohol level of 0.258, according
to the medical examiner's report. That figure surprised Robinson's
family and friends, who said he preferred staying home and playing
video games to drinking and night life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that was very out of character,'' Lorrie
Robinson said. ``We didn't even go out or anything like that when
he was home.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosengren, who wasn't seriously hurt, smelled of alcohol and his
speech was slurred, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Expletive), I was the one driving and it's all my fault,'' he
told police that night, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and Rosengren weren't the best of friends, having known
each only a month or so, but they were bound by similar
circumstances. &QL; 
Coming off injuries &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both were coming off arm injuries and hoped to make the
big-league roster. Both reported early to the Diamondbacks spring
training camp in Tucson to continue rehabilitation work.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are forever tied by the events of one horrible night.
</P>
<P>
   When two Jacksonville police officers rang her doorbell that
Sunday morning, Lorrie Robinson's first thought was that something
had happened to her parents, who live just a few minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is your husband Kenny Robinson?'' they asked.
</P>
<P>
   Her breath stolen away, Lorrie had one thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please tell me he's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   They told Lorrie that Kenny had been killed in a car accident.
They had no details. She called her parents, who were there when
Lorrie called Kenny's mom and dad, who live near Akron, Ohio, where
Kenny grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, the families still wonder about the events of
that night. Kenny was fanatical about wearing his seat belt, yet he
didn't have his on. He felt strongly about drinking and driving,
yet he was riding with an apparently impaired driver.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the Robinsons think they would like to talk to
Rosengren, to find out more about that night. Rosengren is
prevented by Arizona law from contacting the family until his case
has been adjudicated.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Lorrie Robinson thinks, the family would only be
getting one side of the story. She wonders if the entire truth will
ever be known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know him (Rosengren),'' Lorrie said. ``I just know how
I feel about drinking and driving. You could be the nicest person
in the world and still get behind the wheel of a car and something
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying Kenny was not at fault. Obviously, he got into
the truck. They could have called a cab. I just don't know. I'm
affected. He (Rosengren) is affected. We're both going through a
whole whirlwind of emotions. I can't say they are exactly the same,
but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   She would like people to know that Kenny was more than just a
journeyman pitcher and is hopeful that he will be remembered more
for how he lived than how he died.
</P>
<P>
   He was the kind of guy who called his parents five times while
driving across the country for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``What other 29-year-old man would do that?'' Liz asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ken once organized a baby shower for a minor-league teammate's
wife and thought nothing of covering a round of golf for a young
minor-league player strapped for cash. He could make people laugh
by imitating the checkout scanner at a grocery store, driving
clerks nuts in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Robinson affectionately calls her son ``a momma's boy.''
Kenny called his parents several times a week and always after he
pitched, no matter the time. The family's social life revolved
around sports and the games played by Kenny and his younger sister,
Christi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you this much, we lived Kenny's life with him, so
when he dies, that kind of dies too,'' Liz said.
</P>
<P>
   A big man &QL; 
Robinson was a rarity in baseball _ a short right-handed pitcher
who made it to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, it was always the taller kids who were tried first
at pitcher, even though Robinson was begging for the chance.
Eventually, coaches would let the little guy throw and then realize
their mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said, `I don't understand why all they want is
height, height, height,' '' Lorrie said. ``If somebody has the
talent, why does height have to factor into it?''
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson was in the minors, opposing fans could be brutal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could just hear people jawing at him from the stands.
`Don't you need your step-stool?' Or ``Hey, Tattoo, where's the
plane?' That was a cute one.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Robinson began to pitch and the ribbing stopped. He had a
fastball that reached the mid-90s, and he spent parts of three
seasons in the majors, two with Toronto and one with Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks claimed him off waivers from Toronto in 1998
and had him targeted as a middle reliever or closer until he was
sidelined by a shoulder injury suffered in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he worked hard all year to come back from his injury,''
said Joe Garagiola Jr., the Diamondbacks' general manager. ``And I
guess that's the principal thing I take away from our association
and time with Ken _ his competitiveness, his determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was hard-nosed on the mound, Robinson was soft-hearted
off of it. He would send his son flowers, balloons and chocolates
on Valentine's Day. He wrote poetry and short stories.
</P>
<P>
   Before important times in his life, he would write letters to
those close to him, telling them how much they meant to him.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, some close friends cleaned out Kenny's
apartment in Tucson to send things back to Lorrie. On a closet
shelf, Diana found a letter that Kenny had written to Lorrie and
Chase before he underwent shoulder surgery in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted them to know how he felt should something go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you see Chase smile, please see me smiling, too,
because I'll be there watching over you.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about me, I want you to think one thing _ that
I was a good person who worked my ass off and never gave in or
quit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year of Kenny's life, he was able to do so many
things he never had before, Lorrie said. The surgery kept him out
of baseball in 1998, and he spent the summer at home for the first
time in years. He took pride in his yard, and Lorrie would tease
him when neighbors would ask for tips.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny attended his 10-year high school reunion, bought a
Corvette, saw an old friend for the first time in years, shook
hands with President Clinton during his visit to spring training.
</P>
<P>
   A Major League Baseball pension and a life insurance policy are
allowing Chase and Lorrie to live comfortably in the home the
couple bought in Jacksonville just over two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She has a business degree from Florida State and plans to
returns to work once Chase is a little older.

ARIZONA HIGH COURT LIFTS BLOCK TO 14 YEAR-OLD'S ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINA LEONARD AND JANELLE COWGILL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Arizona Supreme Court on Sunday cleared the way
for a 14-year-old girl to fly to Kansas for a late-term abortion by
overturning a state appeals judge's ruling that had temporarily
blocked it.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull and other state officials declined to comment,
but law experts say state appeals may be exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday, it was unclear when the 14-year-old ward of the
state would leave for Kansas, where abortion laws are more liberal,
or whether she was already there.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conference early Sunday, the high court voted 3-2
to overturn appellate Judge Michael Ryan's decision Saturday, which
temporarily blocked the foster child from aborting her 24-week-old
fetus.
</P>
<P>
   In making the decision, however, the court did not spell out its
reasoning, saying it would release a more detailed order later. The
order released Sunday concluded that the original trial judge who
ruled that the abortion could proceed had not ``abused his
discretion,'' nor was his ruling ``clearly erroneous.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether opponents of the decision have remaining grounds for
appeal is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney John P. Frank, an expert on constitutional law, said
that if the girl has left the state, the issue is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's gone, it becomes simple,'' he said. ``It becomes
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to lay hands on her.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if she's still here, the state could still take the
case to federal District Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's some side that wants to attempt to challenge
legally the state court order, they would have to find a way to get
to federal court,'' said attorney Marc Budoff, another legal
expert. &UR; ``A district judge would have to determine that there's a
federal issue involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge William Sargeant
ordered that the girl be allowed to have the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Hull and the state attorney general questioned whether the fetus
was too advanced for an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The state also questioned the girl's competency, and had asked
Sargeant to reconsider his ruling and allow a doctor to determine
whether the fetus could survive outside the womb.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, Sargeant affirmed his earlier decision,
permitting the girl to seek an abortion. All the decisions have
been made in secret because the girl, who officials say was raped
or had sex with an adult, which is statutory rape, is a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   The state immediately took the case to the Arizona Court of
Appeals, which ordered the temporary stay.
</P>
<P>
   Without releasing an explanation Sunday, the Supreme Court
vacated that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Laura Knaperek, R-Tempe, and Rep. Jeff Groscost, R-Mesa,
say they are shocked that the Supreme Court sided with Sargeant's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chiseled on the walls of the state Supreme Court are the
words, `Where law ends, tyranny begins,' '' Groscost said. ``With
today's 3-2 court decision, tyranny began and our hopes ended.
Tonight we pray for the little girl and her unborn child.''
</P>
<P>
   Knaperek said she was unhappy that the decision was made over
the telephone and, she believes, didn't get the scrutiny it
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears there wasn't enough time for Supreme Court justices
to make right choices based on information,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Carolyn Gerster, chairwoman of Arizona Right to Life,
said she's outraged at the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This baby is no longer a fetus, this is now a premature
baby,'' she said. ``What crime did this baby commit to be sentenced
to death? We have just begun to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Miller, director of Arizona Right to Choose, said that
the Supreme Court made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have said, enough is enough _ this young woman had the
input of many more adults into her consideration of whether or not
to have an abortion than most teenagers do,'' according to a
release. ``We must respect her decision, and let her get on with
her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sue Grace, R-north central Phoenix, said that the issue has
received due process, and that the state should accept that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to move on. What we need to move on to is
investigating the leak, and making sure this never happens again,''
Grace said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This girl's life has been devastated by this leak.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Thomas A. Zlaket and Vice Chief Justice Charles E.
Jones dissented. Both the majority and dissenters will release a
more detailed order explaining their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Budoff said the court may not have made the decision based on
the abortion issue, but on procedural issues alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that this is more of a philosophical and moral
news event than it is a legal news event,'' Budoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank added that the high court may not have ruled on abortion
at all, but instead looked at a person's ``right to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   But Budoff, who has practiced in Arizona for 25 years, said
although the case may not pose significant legal issues, it brings
up other interesting issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a lawyer's standpoint, you're interested to see the
tugging that goes on between legal and political and moral and
ethical issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have planned to send the girl her to Kansas, where Dr.
George Tiller is the nation's leading practitioner of late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys reportedly focused their appeal, in part, on the
differences between Arizona's abortion law and the more liberal
guidelines in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Late-term abortions in Arizona are allowed only when the life or
health of the mother is in danger. An abortion is considered late
term if the fetus is able to survive outside the womb. In Arizona,
that determination is made by a doctor. No Arizona clinics
currently provide abortions after 20 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, exceptions are allowed for late-term abortions if the
mother's life is in danger or if there is danger of major bodily
impairment or loss of function, which some, including Tiller, have
interpreted to mean the mental health of the mother. &QL;

IMMIGRATION, DRUGS NOW 70 PERCENT OF TEXAS CASES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ U.S. District Judge Fred Biery raps his gavel
in a high-tech video center in San Antonio, signaling that court is
in session in this border town more than 100 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Defendant Arturo Olvera Barrera positions himself in front of
Biery's video image to make a last-ditch plea for leniency. A dozen
other defendants sit out of camera range awaiting their cues to
appear in a two-way video drama spurred by the sharp increase in
drug and immigration cases filed along the Southwest border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be better if Del Rio had a permanent, resident judge
_ or if peace, love and harmony broke out,'' said Biery. ``But
until that happens this is the way we handle an increased volume of
cases with few resources. This year, I expect to see 1,000 criminal
defendants in Del Rio alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal crime initiatives along the Southwest border pushed the
number of cases filed to a high of 57,691 last year. With
California and Texas logging the biggest increases in criminal
filings, both statistics and geography underscore a definite shift
in emphasis from catching bank robbers and white-collar criminals
to prosecuting illegal immigrants and small-time drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution of drug and immigration crime _ mostly illegal entry
into the United States _ accounted for a staggering 70 percent of
criminal filings in Texas alone during the 1998 fiscal year that
ended Sept. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement agencies in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona
and California began cracking down on illegal immigration and drug
crime in unison five years ago as part of the Southwest Border
Initiatives _ a national strategy aimed at closing the borders to
illegal immigration and drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Operating under a congressional mandate and with increased
funding, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has
stationed 1,000 additional agents along the border each year for
the past three years and will continue doing so until 2001. And in
rural South and West Texas, heat-sensing devices, infrared cameras
and floodlights augment the efforts of agents who patrol vast
expanses of ranch land in four-wheel-drive vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   From Brownsville, Texas, to San Diego, the immigration service
is using its INS and Border Patrol agents in dual roles, as
gatekeepers and drug warriors, doubling the agency's filings
between 1993 and 1997 in the process, according to INS statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the federal courts in Texas posted a 69 percent
increase in the number of drug cases filed and a 58 percent
increase in the number of immigration cases. The increases have
strained resources and personnel in the sparsely populated border
areas, said Western District Clerk Bill Putnicki.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest strain has been in the Western and Southern
districts, where 84 percent of the state's criminal cases were
filed last year. The Western District includes San Antonio and El
Paso, while the Southern District stretches from Houston to
Brownsville to Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   On the border, ``triage'' has become a legal term.
</P>
<P>
   Biery begins most days by 5 a.m., balancing a load of 841
pending cases _ roughly twice the national average caseload for
federal judges. Sentencings are often done en masse, and a bus with
barred windows doubles as a holding cell on busy Monday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   And Putnicki said years of squirreling away extra funds paid off
last year when he added eight court positions _ in the midst of a
hiring freeze _ to handle the nearly 300 percent increase in
criminal filings in El Paso and Del Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Biery decided to try video teleconferencing last year in an
effort to save time and money, but defendants must first agree to
waive their hearing in the same location as the judge. Most do, but
Biery and his staff still make the 1 1/2-hour drive from San
Antonio to Del Rio at least one week out of each month, at times
squeezing 50 sentencings and various hearings onto his crowded
border docket.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Jimenez of Houston, director of the American Friends
Service Committee, said the trend toward prosecuting
border-crossers instead of simply deporting them robs immigrants of
their human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have a human right to search for jobs, to lift
themselves out of poverty, to make a better life for themselves and
their families,'' she said. ``But this push for criminalizing
illegal immigration is increasing their risk of being abused and
exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez said most illegal immigrants are not criminals and
should not be treated as such. The majority cross the border in
search of jobs, while others _ like Olvera _ come to visit family
members who are legal residents of the United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted to do is just to see my son,'' Olvera tells Biery
during his sentencing. ``It was my only motivation to come over
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that Olvera has no serious criminal history, the illegal
re-entry conviction means he is now a felon. Federal sentencing
guidelines mandate that he will serve nine to 15 months in federal
prison, and Biery gives him the lightest sentence allowed. But the
veteran judge warns Olvera that he could serve 20 years if he is
picked up again.
</P>
<P>
   Olvera's attorney is certain that won't happen. The son Olvera
crossed the Rio Grande to see was killed in an automobile accident
in Dallas while Olvera was awaiting sentencing. Olvera didn't get
to go to the funeral because the U.S. Marshal's Service was
stretched so thin there was no one to escort him.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez blamed the shift in law enforcement priority on
widespread anti-immigrant sentiment, which had its roots in
California. She and others believe Congress is using the law as a
stopgap for the social problems of drug abuse and poverty, instead
of looking for a solution. She and other critics of the Southwest
Border Initiatives said the federal authorities should focus on
``real crime.''
</P>
<P>
   During 1994, violent and white-collar crime made up 37 percent
of the total criminal filings by federal prosecutors in Texas. But
that number shrank to 24 percent last year, even as the total
number of filings mushroomed to 8,168 _ a 41 percent increase over
1997.
</P>
<P>
   John Scalia, with the Bureau of Justice Statistics, said the
priorities of federal law enforcement are often set by the politics
of the time. Ire over the anti-war protests during the Vietnam War
fueled the prosecution of large numbers of draft evaders during the
1970s, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Woods, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Texas
1990-93, said his tenure was dominated by the prosecution of bank
officials after the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. ``It was
the No. 1 crime problem in the mid- to late '80s and early '90s,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods, who is in private practice in Houston, said the
federal authorities are now pursuing the less complex cases that
were once reserved for the state courts. Prosecutors once
concentrated the almost limitless resources of the federal
government on bringing down drug trafficking organizations; now
they go after small-time cases involving a half-pound of marijuana,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``White-collar crime (in federal court today) is a bank teller
who embezzles $2,000, gets caught by bank security and admits to
it. The U.S. attorneys used to have a cutoff of $50,000-$100,000,
but it's easier to do the smaller cases than to put 10 agents on a
complicated case for a year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a numbers game. The administration likes to point to the
number of indictments and say they're up. They're tough on crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers no one likes to tally are the cost of
prosecution and incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the courts and the U.S. Bureau of Prisons said
they do not have estimates of the increased operating costs since
the Southwest Border Initiatives began. But elected officials in
Texas and other border states have complained that the resulting
shortage of bed space in federal prisons means the states are being
asked to foot the bill for imprisoning illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   During 1998 and 1999, Congress reimbursed less than 60 percent
of the cost of housing federal prisoners convicted of violating
immigration laws, according to a letter from the U.S.-Mexico Border
Counties Coalition, which is seeking reparation from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Congress originally committed to fund the State Criminal Alien
Assistance Program with $650 million a year, but that number has
dwindled to $100 million for fiscal 2000, said the letter signed by
El Paso County Commissioner Carlos Aguilar III and others.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Kesselbrenner, an attorney with the liberal National
Immigration Project of the Lawyers Guild in Boston, questioned the
priorities reflected in the new policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a misallocation of federal resources,'' he said,
``to devote this much time, money and resources to crimes where
there is no victim, no violence.''

PHARMACISTS FILL A NICHE BY HAND MIXING PRESCRIPTIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA DAVIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A toddler needs cardiac medication that only comes in
adult-strength.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman can't swallow pills, but she needs pain
medication.
</P>
<P>
   A cat refuses to take needed medication in any form.
</P>
<P>
   To treat such problems, more and more physicians _ including
veterinarians _ are turning to specialized pharmacists who
customize medicine the old-fashioned way: with mortar and pestle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a growing area of pharmacy practice,'' said David
Sparks, the president and chief executive officer of the
Houston-based Professional Compounding Centers of America, or PCCA.
``The needs have always been there, but a lot of physicians were
not always aware of the capabilities of pharmacists to meet their
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding, or making drugs by hand, fills a niche not met by
commercially manufactured drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that all pharmacy was compounding, and then we
got in to the manufactured pill,'' said Lynn Simpson, an assistant
clinical professor at the University of Houston College of
Pharmacy. ``Now the pendulum is swinging back to things that can be
compounded and made better for the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cianca, a physiatrist who specializes in musculoskeletal
problems, said he started prescribing pain medicine dispensed in a
topical cream instead of the standard oral pill form when he
learned about compounding two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most pain medications have some sort of systemic effects like
drowsiness. Others are more problematic, like ulcers and high
toxicity levels in the liver,'' Cianca said. ``The topical
applications are good for superficial pain. They provide localized
pain medication without having to go through your whole digestive
system.''
</P>
<P>
   When pills and liquids come in a more desirable form and are set
to a custom dosage, patients are more likely to take their
medicine, said Ken Hughes, a Houston pharmacist. These designer
drugs, therefore, have a higher success rate than commercially
prepared prescriptions, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Some prescriptions can be time-consuming for a pharmacist to
compound, making them more expensive than a commercially prepared
alternative. But that's not always the case, Hughes said. While
most compounded prescriptions cost $30 to $50, some may be cheaper
than name-brand drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and pharmacists alike said most patients have no problem
getting reimbursed by their insurance carrier for compounded
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacists can create medications in almost any form through
compounding. Lozenges, creams, suppositories, capsules and
lollipops are just some of the possible forms. They also can change
the medicine to a child's favorite flavor or put the medicine in a
fish compound to entice a cat to take it.
</P>
<P>
   PCCA, which provides compounding pharmacists with bulk
pharmaceuticals, equipment, devices, flavoring, training and
consultation services, has seen demand increase 20 percent a year
since its founding in 1981, Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmacists that PCCA serves, like most pharmacists who
compound, work in small independently owned shops that specialize
in compounding.
</P>
<P>
   One such pharmacy, The Remedy Shoppe, opened two years ago near
the Texas Medical Center in Houston. Business has grown so rapidly,
the pharmacy is moving to a larger location, said pharmacist Jeanne
Horner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of specialty patients and specialty clinics to
go to in Houston, and to go along with it, you need a specialty
pharmacist,'' Horner said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who benefit most from the compounded prescriptions are
hospice and terminal cancer patients, Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last stages of disease, many patients are no longer able
to take pain medication orally, and it may even be difficult to
give them medicine intravenously, therefore creams that can be
absorbed through the skin, suppositories or fast-dissolving wafers
are immensely helpful, Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacists learn basic information about compounding in their
first two years of pharmacy school, and they may do a six-week
clinical rotation with a pharmacy that specializes in compounding,
Simpson said. Pharmacists need to have basic compounding skills
because they will use them on occasion whether they work at a chain
or independent pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, all drugstores are required by state law to have
the basic equipment _ mortar and pestle, balance, measuring devices
and spatulas _ to do compounding. Pharmacies that don't focus on
compounding, however, usually don't have the equipment needed to do
compounding more efficiently, Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know any pharmacists who don't do any (compounding),''
Sparks said. ``But the chains are geared toward doing high
volume.''
</P>
<P>
   While a pharmacist at a chain drugstore might mix up a cream for
a dermatologist, they spend more time counseling patients than they
do preparing prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing drug therapy doesn't just mean dispensing medications,''
Simpson said. ``A pharmacist is accessible, so patients go there
because their physician doesn't always have time to tell them
everything about their pills.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Platts, a district pharmacy supervisor for Walgreens in
Houston, said her pharmacists may refer people to specialty
pharmacists rather than fill the prescription themselves. She also
said Walgreens is not planning to increase its compounding
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a whole lot of compounding going on, and I'm not
aware of demands in our case going up,'' Platts said. ``But that
might be in our case because doctors don't refer them to us because
they know other pharmacists who specialize in it.''

TOOL SYSTEM HELPS TEXAS AMPUTEE TACKLE DAILY TASKS 

</HEADLINE>

By STEVE OLAFSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAZORIA, Texas _ Necessity really is the mother of invention
for Ron Farquharson.
</P>
<P>
   For some, necessity is being able to pull a wrench or hoe a
garden or cast a rod and reel.
</P>
<P>
   For Farquharson, it was slicing an onion.
</P>
<P>
   With a prosthetic right arm, it wasn't impossible, but it wasn't
easy, either. The knife invariably would slip out of the hook in
his prosthesis.
</P>
<P>
   There's got to be a better way, he figured. So he and a
co-worker invented a system in which amputees are able to lock a
variety of tools into their prosthetic arms to perform everyday
tasks that most of us take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Farquharson (pronounced FARK-uh-sun) has turned the solution to
his onion-slicing dilemma into a business that helps others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works,'' he said recently, moments after pulling a 5-pound
catfish out of a pond behind his rural home in Brazoria County near
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The fishing rod he used to land the catfish is among the tools
that can be locked into a terminal device that fits onto his
artificial arm.
</P>
<P>
   Farquharson still could use a rod and reel before the invention
of his tool system. It was just more difficult for the natural
right-hander to hold the rod with his left arm and crank the reel
with the hook on his prosthetic arm.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a fishing rod, dozens of other tools have been
modified to fit into the terminal system. Hand and carpentry tools,
such as wrenches, files, vise grips and saws; kitchen utensils,
such as cheese slicers, melon ballers, knives and forks; and garden
tools, such as hoes and trowels.
</P>
<P>
   Next, they're thinking about adapting golf clubs for the
terminal device.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other system like it in the world,'' said
Farquharson, 52.
</P>
<P>
   His company, Assistive Devices of Texas, obtained a patent on
the terminal device in 1995. Made of lightweight aircraft aluminum,
it can be turned to a 45-degree angle or be rotated 360 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Adapting tools to fit the terminal device is a matter of cutting
off the ends of whatever the customer wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of wrench handles lying around,'' said Johnnie
Rouse, 45, who owns Reactive Metals in Angleton, Texas, and handles
that end of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Sales have been modest, with just more than 60 of the terminal
devices sold, but Farquharson and his partner, Glenn Betts, 48, go
to trade shows around the country and maintain an Internet site
(www.txad.com) to promote their product.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been beating the bushes showing people this thing
exists,'' Farquharson said.
</P>
<P>
   His first partner, Dan Still, who helped him create the
invention, dropped out of the business venture and sold his
interest to Betts.
</P>
<P>
   Farquharson and Betts realize that their product has a small
market because statistics show that 6,000 to 10,000 people lose an
arm each year and only about half of them get prostheses.
</P>
<P>
   Farquharson admitted that he had been ready to give up two or
three times, but success stories from people like Bryan Lague
convince him of the need for his product.
</P>
<P>
   Lague, 19, of Hampden, Mass., lost his right hand in a fireworks
accident when he was 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing with something that was supposed to sparkle, but
it blew up,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   At the culinary school where he is a student, he would use the
stump of his right hand to guide food and his left hand to wield
knives and other kitchen utensils.
</P>
<P>
   His therapist at a Shriners Hospital told him about Assistive
Devices of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Today, if he needs a spatula, a knife or a peeler, it just takes
him a few seconds to snap one onto his prosthesis and go to work.
</P>

TOMATO FIGHTS AND OTHER FUN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: A tilde is needed over n in Bunol) 
 
By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He seemed perfectly sane when he stopped by the office some time
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Polite. Soft-spoken. Articulate. Feet planted firmly on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   So why does Doug Lansky find himself fending off hippopotamuses
from a canoe on the lower Zambezi River bordering Zimbabwe and
Zambia?
</P>
<P>
   Lassoing reindeer above the Arctic Circle in Sweden?
</P>
<P>
   Playing underwater hockey in Australia?
</P>
<P>
   Riding an ostrich in South Africa?
</P>
<P>
   Attending acupuncture school in Beijing?
</P>
<P>
   Participating in the world's largest tomato fight in Spain?
</P>
<P>
   ``The regular tourist trail just doesn't cut it for me,'' Lansky
explains. ``I crave a more challenging lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
UNUSUAL HONEYMOON &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I renewed acquaintances with Lansky by e-mail a few days ago as
he was beginning a five-month around-the-world honeymoon with his
Swedish wife, Signe, a frequent traveling companion familiar to
readers of Lansky's syndicated ``Vagabond'' column
(www.houstonchronicle.com).
</P>
<P>
   Normally, I'd never dream of bothering a guy during such a
significant occasion. But normally, folks don't honeymoon in
Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya. For starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow, I'm hoping to go deep-sea fishing off the Kenyan
coast where Hemingway pulled in a few fish,'' Lansky answered my
correspondence. ``Next week, I'm scheduled to climb Kilimanjaro.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he comes down from the mountain, he'll rest?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I plan to attend sumo wrestling school in Japan next
month,'' Lansky assured me.
</P>
<P>
   Lansky likes to say that his adventuresome spirit was born ``on
the Third-World island of Manhattan.'' He was raised in Minnesota
and graduated from Colorado College, and in the introduction to his
hilarious new book, ``Up the Amazon Without a Paddle'' (Meadowbrook
Press, $10), he recalls the impact of commencement day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just waiting for them to call my name so I could go up
and collect my diploma, fold it into a paper hat and start flipping
burgers at McDonald's,'' he writes. ``While the speaker was
rambling on about networking, I was daydreaming about sailing down
the Nile, crossing the desert on a camel, ski instructing in the
Alps, crewing on a yacht in the Caribbean, scuba diving in the Red
Sea, splashing around in the Ganges, questioning a guru in Tibet,
swimming with sea lions in the Galapagos, climbing mountains in
Patagonia. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a lot of daydreaming. It was a long speech.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
OFFBEAT ADVENTURES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of us daydream. But over the past eight years, even before
reaching his 30th birthday, Lansky has lived out many of his
fantasies _ hugely assisted by Signe, whom he describes as ``an
editor, a photographer and all-around great person.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm not just saying this because she is a doctor and
financially supports me.''
</P>
<P>
   His new book details 60 offbeat adventures, each covered in
about four pages and many updated from previous Vagabond columns.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite is Lansky's description of Tomatina, or ``getting
sauced in Bunol, Spain. When it comes to parties, it's hard to top
the creativity of the Spanish,'' he writes. ``Give them a few
bulls, they run them down the street and call it a fiesta. Give
them 250,000 pounds of ripe tomatoes and ... well, you can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, for one, will never again look at tomatoes the same way _
those innocuous little red slices that garnish your dinner salad
are actually ballistic weapons. At noon, cannon fire signaled the
entrance of the first truckload of tomatoes and the beginning of
the one-hour battle. By the time the sixth truck came through, the
plaza looked like the sight of a Ragu factory explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few of the 30,000 participants wore swim goggles and gas
masks. I even saw one guy who had fastened a pasta strainer to his
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwater hockey _ also known as ``Octopush'' _ provided a
different kind of splash. ``The English invented it in 1954,''
Lansky explains, ``perhaps as a way for underwater basket weavers
to stay in shape during the off-season.''
</P>
<P>
   Maneuvering the puck _ or ``squid,'' as Lansky's Aussie
teammates in Brisbane called it _ along the bottom of the pool was
challenging enough. But, then, a teammate brought up the subject of
fights. (This was, after all, still hockey.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered if the offending players have to go to the penalty
box,'' Lansky writes. ``I couldn't see one. I just hoped it wasn't
underwater.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Lansky if half-way through any of his adventures he'd
ever had the urge to shout, ``Get me out of here!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I was over my head when I was up the Amazon living
with the Jaguar Indians and woke up with a machete pressed up
against my forehead,'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another time was when I bought a horse in Ecuador and started
riding north to Colombia without a guide, map, compass, tent or
sleeping bag. For some reason, the importance of those things
didn't occur to me until I was sitting on the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, he still daydreams. His current ``wish list'' for
future adventures? ``Of course, the moon is at the top,'' he says.
``And maybe ski jumping school ...''
</P>

`TERM LIMITS' AUTHOR FINDS HIS GROOVE IN NEWEST WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Transfer of Power,'' by Vince Flynn. Read by Daniel Oreskes.
Abridged, approximately 4.5 hours. Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio. $24.
</P>
<P>
   There is good news to report: Vince Flynn is getting better. He
struck pay dirt last year with his first political thriller, ``Term
Limits,'' a not particularly believable or well-told tale that was
nonetheless a big success. (It has been on many paperback
best-seller lists this summer.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Transfer of Power'' is a significant improvement. Sure, it
contains some roll-your-eyes plot developments and capitalizes on
well-worn stereotypes. Arab terrorists have taken over the White
House. The president's trapped in an underground bunker and it's up
to the CIA's top counterterrorism operative to save the day.
</P>
<P>
   But Flynn is clearly working harder this time out. He does well
in developing minor characters who are more than one-dimensional.
The protagonist, Mitch Rapp, is enough of a lone wolf that, as you
root for him, you also try and figure out who might be cast in his
part in the sure-to-come movie. Bruce Willis would be a good bet.
Stage and screen veteran Daniel Oreskes gives a fine reading.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Back to the Moon,'' by Homer H. Hickam Jr. Read by Boyd
Gaines. Abridged, approximately 5 hours. Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio.
$24.
</P>
<P>
   There is a schizophrenic quality to Homer Hickam's fiction
debut. The retired NASA engineer, whose memoir ``Rocket Boys''
received high critical praise, clearly knows the space business and
is able to translate this in ways that don't leave the average
reader gasping to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   But Hickam would benefit from some basic lessons in creating
characters and dialogue; too much of ``Back to the Moon'' fails to
achieve liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   In this space adventure, a zealous space scientist successfully
hijacks a shuttle and pilots it to the moon, where the secrets of
his deceased wife await him. On board, by accident, is a beautiful
daredevil-journalist named Penny High Eagle (yes, the Eagle will
have landed before Hickam is finished). They are forced to battle
unexpected mechanical and logistical challenges, all the while
fighting with one another in a most predictable fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Hickam probably has a good novel in him waiting to be hatched,
but at this point the scientist and the storyteller aren't working
on the same level.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``McNally's Dilemma,'' by Lawrence Sanders. Read by Boyd Gaines.
Abridged, approximately 3 hours. Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio. $18.
</P>
<P>
   The latest in Lawrence Sanders' McNally series jumped
immediately to the best-seller lists this summer, where it stayed
far longer than it deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach private investigator Archy McNally, who works for his
father's law firm, unravels a tangle of blackmail and deceit that
is lacking one crucial element: tension.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' prose has a '40s flipness, with pseudo-wiseguy cracks
that ring hollow. Neither McNally nor any of the men and women he
encounters is especially likable, and collectively they fail to
captivate us.
</P>
<P>
   ``McNally's Dilemma'' can be found in most bookstores' mystery
section, but the only thing that puzzles me is Sanders' popularity.
His fans' loyalty outweighs Sanders' talents, I'm afraid, though
Simon &AMP; Schuster workhorse Boyd Gaines is not to be faulted for
failing to make this sizzle. Steak is required for sizzle, and
``McNally's Dilemma'' is missing the meat.

CONVEX MIRRORS HAVE PRACTICAL USES IN DECORATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ Convex mirrors became the fashion in the late 18th
and early 19th century. Traditionally, they are round and ensconced
in a gilt frame ornamented with hand-carved eagles or dolphins and
goldleaf trim, such as small spheres and carved foliage.
</P>
<P>
   The mirrors, also called ``bull's-eye,'' were popular in the
neoclassical era, the Federal period and with Hepplewhite
furnishings, which have graceful curves. One type, the girandole
looking glass, often features a branched candleholder.
</P>
<P>
   Convex mirrors come in many sizes and also can be rectangular or
square. The outward curve of the mirror makes images appear smaller
than they really are.
</P>
<P>
   Pairs of mirrors would flank a fireplace or hang at each end of
a dining room. Few survive in pairs today, as they were often
broken, or divided when an estate was sold.
</P>
<P>
   Their function was not for grooming, but to reflect light and to
provide an interesting view of a room.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest convex mirrors were most likely manufactured in
England. Lots of reproductions were made in this country during the
late 19th century during the Colonial Revival period and into the
1930s. Although the carving is not as crisp in these replicas, they
can still be hard to tell from the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   They are quite valuable and remain most desirable for interior
design.
</P>
<P>
   One of the finest local examples of a convex mirror is in the
Hart-Cluett Mansion in Troy. Researchers believe that this mirror,
created circa 1816, was part of a pair that originally graced the
front parlor.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their weight, early convex mirrors were attached to
the wall in a more permanent way, rather than today's method of
using picture wire.
</P>
<P>
   New gilt-framed convex mirrors come in many sizes, and a
reproduction can cost approximately $500 and up. Depending on the
maker, age and condition, an antique convex mirror can cost $2,500
or up into the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being decorative, unframed convex mirrors also
have a commercial purpose. Convex mirrors made of glass or acrylic
are used for security in retail stores to discourage pilfering and
to give peripheral views.
</P>
<P>
   You can even get a small convex mirror from Spinner.com that
affixes to your workplace computer monitor, so you can keep an eye
on the activity behind your back.

A SIERRA GEM GLISTENS WITH SECRETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California's best places in the great outdoors
are a mystery. But I've learned that these secrets can be
discovered and unlocked.
</P>
<P>
   Hell Hole Reservoir, set deep on the west flank of the Sierra
Nevada, is much like this. I first saw it by accident, heading back
from Tahoe in my little airplane, and with no turbulence, I decided
to enjoy the smooth air by cruising over the Sierra. The original
idea was to get an eagle-eye view of the Granite Chief Wilderness
and Desolation Wilderness, and trace the route of the Pacific Crest
Trail.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the process I became transfixed instead by this long,
narrow lake set in a granite gorge. The lake was obviously remote,
yet accessible by car, with a paved road all the way in.
</P>
<P>
   Soon I made the trip in my pick-up truck and found that Hell
Hole Reservoir is not only a classic Sierra lake, but offers a
series of features not found anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   On the way there, you pass French Meadows Reservoir, a huge,
beautiful place with excellent camping, boating and fishing. The
lake covers nearly 2,000 acres, circled by conifers, with five
campgrounds, including a great boat-in site, and also provides good
trout fishing. For many, this is perfection, and there is no reason
to go any farther.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want something unique, you do keep going, and
eventually arrive at the primitive, dirt boat ramp near the dam at
Hell Hole, set at 4,580 feet, deep in the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you will notice is that the water is azure blue,
not green, and that at lake's edge is a craggy, granite shoreline.
These two features give rise to several special opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the water is blue is because of its excellent
clarity, a product of the pristine, low-nutrient flows of the
Rubicon River, which feeds the lake, emerging from the Sierra crest
and running through the untouched Granite Chief Wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   According to a taste test of hydrologists, it is the
best-tasting water from any of the 19 national forests in
California. Because of these pristine qualities, the lake is not
stocked by the little rainbow trout the state Department of Fish
and Game is well known for, but instead provides a fishery for
mackinaw trout and brown trout, often elusive but quite large, as
well as the more abundant but smaller kokanee salmon.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other special qualities here. Because of the
rocky shoreline, for instance, no lakeside camps can be reached by
car, which also throws people off. A standard drive-to camp is set
about a mile from the lake; it is clean, sheltered and popular. But
there is another option.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small camp that can be reached by boat, or by hiking
3.5 miles, located at head of the lake along the southern shore.
</P>
<P>
   And here's another secret: On the north side of the lake there
is a 4-wheel-drive jeep road, fairly rough, but which will allow
you to drive to water's edge near the lake's headwaters. This is an
ideal spot, both sheltered and remote, to put in a canoe, then make
the easy paddle across to the boat-in campsite.
</P>
<P>
   To reach this camp by foot, you hike over the dam, then turn
left, where you will find the trail rises and falls in 60-foot
climbs and descents, over and over, routed well above the lake's
shore. An outstanding swimming area is hidden along this trail,
part of a huge granite formation; it can be reached only by foot or
by boat.
</P>
<P>
   Note: This trail camp also provides a jump-off spot into the
neighboring Granite Chief Wilderness to the east for a backpacking
trip, with the wilderness border just another mile up the trail.
The trail is routed along the Rubicon River, and then rises amid a
huge, glacially sculpted face of the high Sierra, where dozens of
lakes are hidden in rock bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The name ``Hell Hole'' comes from its setting in a 400-foot deep
granite gorge. The gorge was dammed and filled with water from the
Rubicon.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've seen this lake in many conditions, and it
is always pretty, even in low water, when the lake is bordered by
the high walls of the granite gorge. When near full, as this
summer, it is a more classic mountain setting, with pines and
cedars on the ridges on each side.
</P>
<P>
   There are 383 lakes you can drive to in California, including
hundreds secreted away in little canyons and pockets much as this.
But none of them are quite like Hell Hole: deep, crystal clear
waters, hidden campsites, great nearby hiking, swimming and
exploring, excellent boating, unique fishing and a 4-wheel-drive
road.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many of my favorite spots, I discovered it by accident.
All because I looked down one day from my little airplane.

A COLUMNIST SPEAKS THE TRUTH, AT LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Yet another newspaper columnist was fired
recently for allegedly making up people and quotes. Now I've
decided to come clean.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this column is nearly 12 years running; that's a
tanker truck full of material that my employer could investigate
and find bogus. Rather than join Patricia Smith and Mike Barnicle,
formerly of the Boston Globe _ and now Julie Amparano, formerly of
the Arizona Republic _ I'll just save my bosses the trouble of
outing me as a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   First and most egregious, I confess that I've made up San
Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   I got the idea from my colleague Rob Morse, who has turned
writing about the mythical mayor into his life's yoga. But, as Rob
confessed in June 1998 when Smith was fired for fabricating people
and quotes, Rob fabricated Willie.
</P>
<P>
   What Rob didn't say was that the impeccably dressed man who
appears at various city functions is an actor _ a very good actor _
but has no connection to genuine government. If he did, wouldn't
the streets be in better shape and the public transportation system
run on time?
</P>
<P>
   In a related vein, I'm sorry to say that, more than a decade
ago, I made up the homeless. I've been lying about them ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The homeless aren't really poor, disenfranchised, messed up
folks. They, too, are actors. But, unlike ``Mayor Brown,'' their
roles are in an ongoing morality play that was scripted about 2,000
years ago by a guy who believed you could judge people and
civilizations by the way they treat ``the least'' among them.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of religion, regular readers know that I often write
about the Catholic Church. All those anonymous priests I quoted?
Especially the ones who are critical of the church? I made them up.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Catholic priests are just like White House aides,
CIA operatives and chief financial officers for privately held
corporations _ a reporter never has trouble getting them to speak
on the record and for full attribution.
</P>
<P>
   Another common topic in my columns is life in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   I've made up most of that, too.
</P>
<P>
   I earn $60,000 a year. How could I afford to live here, let
alone buy a house, which I said I did last year? The truth is, I
live in Prunedale and rely heavily on guide books, the Weather
Channel and a collection of Herb Caen newspaper columns.
</P>
<P>
   Because I don't really live here, I don't honestly know anything
about the San Francisco Opera. Every word I've ever written about
it, including all those columns about spending weeks each season
working as an extra actor (or supernumerary) _ they're all lies.
</P>
<P>
   I'm amazed no one's ever called me on it. How could anybody
believe a grown woman would put in that kind of time _ not to
mention wear clown noses, bald pates and elf shoes _ just to pull
down $6 per show and $3 per rehearsal? And why hasn't anybody
caught on to the mendacity behind another of my pet subjects:
feminism?
</P>
<P>
   There was never any real women's liberation movement. Gloria
Steinem just got a few of us together back in the late '60s and
said, ``Hey, let's pretend that women are sick of getting paid less
than men, being hit on by their bosses, achieving only token
representation in medicine, law, science, government, sports and
finance, and being valued primarily for the size of their
breasts.''
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do to see that we made it up is take a look at
the Howard Stern show, 98 percent of contemporary advertising and
the U.S. Senate, where the score is 91-9, boys vs. girls.
</P>
<P>
   The last big fabrication I must admit to is the most personal. I
made up my parents.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've written dozens of columns about them, my
alleged sister, brother-in-law and nieces. They don't exist. Not as
my family, I mean.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are some nice people living in Indiana who consented
long ago to let me pass them off as ``my folks.'' But we aren't
related.
</P>
<P>
   It's shameful, I know, but I'd just gotten this column in a big
city newspaper and felt I needed a homespun, stabilizing family to
give me warmth and credibility. I thought they could be my version
of Ma and Pa Kent, the Smallville couple who adopted baby Superman
after his space capsule from Krypton crashed on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The truth? I'm the illegitimate daughter of an ultra-wealthy San
Francisco oil tycoon.

   WANT: KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Convicted killer Alan Echols evaded the
law for eight years before his capture last week, but a Jackson
County man wanted for murder has avoided the law for almost two
decades. Yellowing police reports tell of the tale of Richard G.
Bocklage, his 10-foot Burmese python and a bizarre letter that
foreshadows a murder. Jackson County probably has fewer than a
dozen outstanding warrants for murder, investigators say. But
Bocklage's case is the oldest one that prosecutors could take to a
jury. Bocklage is accused of killing his former girlfriend who was
doctor at the time. Joe Lambe. 25. Photos.

   with SHARON31: Jackson County's oldest active murder warrant is
probably also the most notorious _ a pretty brunette called ``La

herself ``just an ordinary girl.'' She's been on the run for nearly
40 years. Joe Lambe 10. Photos, list of others wanted for murder.

QUITTERS NEVER WIN _ OR GO HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Recently, I have been having problems shutting
down my computer. It will get to the part where it says ``Please
wait while your computer shuts down,'' and then it doesn't. I know
I need to get it worked on, but would like to have some idea of
what they need to do rather than just paying for anything the tech
tells me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quittin' Time
</P>
<P>
   DEAR QUIT: This is such a common problem, I don't even know
where to start. Or stop, I guess. And the first thing we have to
stop is this ridiculous notion you have to pay somebody to fix your
computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   A Windows machine is no Macintosh. You actually have to learn
what makes it tick, and you get smarter in the process. So here's
lesson No. 1: The reason it takes Windows so long to shut down is
that it's trying to terminate all the stuff that's going on behind
the scenes, making it safe for you to kill the power. That stuff
can include programs that are running, memory caches that are being
dumped or even Microsoft Stealth Inquisitor 2000 transferring your
bank balance and all your private personal records to World
Domination Headquarters in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Something is refusing to shut itself down, so Windows can't. Do
a Control-Alt-Delete, and you'll see everything that's going on
displayed in a new window on your screen. You can selectively
terminate programs there, then try shutting down to see if things
work better. Virus checkers are prime candidates for gumming things
up, but almost anything else has the potential to do it, too.
</P>
<P>
   I've also seen a clogged CD-ROM memory cache get caught in the
flywheel. Unless you're some data-crunching Poindexter, right-click
on My Computer, then select Properties. Click the Performance tab,
and go for the File System button. You get another set of tabs to
deal with. Hit the CD-ROM tab and cut your cache size to the
minimum. Never thought you'd turn into such a tech-head did you?
But look how much more you know about your computer now.
</P>
<P>
   If things are still jammed, Microsoft has an online
troubleshooter to help you identify the problem. I guess they got
tired of answering calls from irate consumers, Go to
support.microsoft.com/support/tshoot/w98startup.asp and have at it.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I forgot about using the Add/Remove utility in
Windows 98 to eliminate programs. I merely deleted the folders to
get rid of them. They are still listed in the Add/Remove programs
list, though.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone But Not Forgotten
</P>
<P>
   DEAR GONE: Normally, I'd tell you to go look on Microsoft's Web
site for TweakUI, a wonderful little free utility that works harder
than my rehab counselor. One of the things it does is clear bogus
entries from that list.
</P>
<P>
   But it's as if Microsoft is embarrassed by TweakUI, which
contains tools that are so helpful only a moron would have left
them out of the release version of Windows. If it's still on the
download site at all, then it's hidden better than crazy old Uncle
Elbert during a Bombay family reunion. Tweak UI used to be buried
on the Win98 CD, too, but I can't find it on the Second Edition
disc.
</P>
<P>
   Don't mess with Microsoft. Go to www.shareware.com and do a
search for TweakUI98.

if you get this E-mail.

IS HELL A STATE OF MIND, OR A PLACE? (AND WE DON'T MEAN TEXAS IN
AUGUST)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you live in Texas, where temperatures often reach higher
than 100 degrees, the idea of a fiery hell isn't all that bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up with outdoor summertime revivals in Texas, where the
visiting evangelist was expected to terrorize us with sermons about
the possibility of being cast into a pit filled with fire and
brimstone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, few pastors talk about hell. Even its existence is being
disputed. How could a loving God make us suffer eternally in a
blazing furnace?
</P>
<P>
   People who don't like to think about hell as a fiery fate likely
took some solace recently when Pope John Paul II gave a message
from the Vatican saying that hell is a spiritual state, not a
physical place. It is ``the state of those who freely and
definitively separate themselves from God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I was a little surprised by the pope's message. Some of the art
treasures of the Vatican depict a very literal, torturous place
called hell.
</P>
<P>
   When I visited the Vatican last year with some other religion
reporters, we had a private tour of the Sistine Chapel and
Michelangelo's famous masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   We had time to linger in that great room and craned our necks
looking at the paintings on that magnificent ceiling. Among them
were depictions of the biblical creation story.
</P>
<P>
   On the front wall of the chapel were the most graphic visions of
hell I had ever seen. Wide-eyed figures were being pulled down into
hell. They were besieged by demons biting them on the heels.
</P>
<P>
   As they went downward, others with beatific smiles were
ascending into heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those old-time Texas evangelists, I'm sure, would have
loved to have had copies of Michelangelo's scenes of hell to go
with their sermons.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, many evangelicals do not agree with Pope
John Paul's view that hell is a spiritual state and not a literal
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope's denial of the traditional Christian understanding
of hell is one more step in a progressive rejection of the very
real and very horrible picture of hell revealed in the Bible,''
wrote Albert Mohler in a column for Religion News Service.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted polls consistently indicating that most Americans
believe in heaven. A high percentage believe they will also end up
in heaven. Few believe in hell. Almost none think they will be
going to hell.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on American optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Mohler, the conservative president of Southern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., is right when he says that
most people today simply joke about hell. We speak about
``air-conditioning'' the place.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a serious theological subject.
</P>
<P>
   Those who see hell as fiery place of suffering argue that Jesus
talked about a burning hell many times in the New Testament.
</P>
<P>
   Mohler, for example, refers to Mark 9:44-47, where Jesus was
giving a message that I hope wasn't intended to be taken literally.
</P>
<P>
   As he exhorts humans to turn from sin, Jesus states: ``If thy
foot offend thee, cut it off; it is better to enter halt in life,
than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never
shall be quenched.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's view of hell differs only slightly from the
definition of hell in the Catholic Dictionary, which says hell is
``the place and state of eternal punishment for the fallen angels
and human beings who died deliberately estranged from the love of
God. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The punishment of hell is eternal as declared by Christ in his
prediction of the last day. ... The existence of hell is consistent
with divine justice since God respects human freedom and those who
are lost actually condemn themselves by resistance to the grace of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is hell?
</P>
<P>
   I'm following the lead of a friend who said she doesn't know
whether hell is an actual place or a spiritual state of suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't intend to ever find out, either,'' she said.

TOO BUSY TO WORRY ABOUT DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DALE O'REILLEY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDFORD, N.J. _ We Americans take dying much too seriously.
Death is serious, but dying is just a step on the way, a place
where you can choose, by the way you think, to be very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, once other people know you're dying, they think
they have to say things like, ``I'm so sorry,'' when what you
really wish they would do is tell you a good joke.
</P>
<P>
   But most people are either concerned about being appropriate or
so afraid of the idea of death that they avoid the subject by
avoiding you.
</P>
<P>
   So there you are, dying, with all this time on your hands. Time
to kill (joke). And no one is quite sure what to do about, or with,
you.
</P>
<P>
   I was told eight years ago that I had ALS (amyothrophic lateral
sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease) and that it is
incurable, untreatable and always fatal. I knew I had to find a new
way of thinking about life and death, or I would go crazy before I
ever actually died.
</P>
<P>
   My first idea was a flop. I asked for a referral to a
psychotherapist. I'm not sure if the problem was her inexperience
or my expectations. What I asked is that she teach me how to change
my thoughts so I wouldn't dwell on the negative.
</P>
<P>
   When I was depressed, I wanted to be able to get over it and be
calm, if not happy. Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Elizabeth
Kubler-Ross, in her classic book, ``On Death and Dying,'' told us
the five stages of loss or grieving were: anger, denial,
bargaining, depression and acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   I had to move through those stages, or something like them,
before jumping right to acceptance. Along the way, I had to get rid
of a lot more than negative thoughts. I had to change my whole way
of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Time. One of the first things I gave up after going on a
ventilator six years ago was my watch. The exact time was
irrelevant. Before ALS it was always ``time'' for something ... to
get up, go to work or a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a journalist; there were always deadlines. Now I think about
time in more general terms ... the season, or when my husband will
be home. I don't make plans too far in advance.
</P>
<P>
   However, I do have infinite time on any given day for doing and
thinking about just what I feel like.
</P>
<P>
   Image. I used to think about my looks. I wanted to look
professional yet feminine. That meant makeup, styled hair, business
suits and pantyhose without runs. Now, out of necessity, my hair is
cut short and glasses replaced contact lens. I gave away all my
clothes and live in T-shirts with shorts or sweat pants. Makeup
went because I have a horror of ending up with blue eye shadow,
pink circles of blush and crooked lipstick. In fact, I stopped
looking in mirrors, an easy way to stop wasting thoughts on your
looks.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Dominique Bauby, in his wonderful memoir, ``The Diving Bell
and the Butterfly,'' wrote that if he had to drool (he had suffered
a crippling stroke), ``let it be on cashmere.'' I drool constantly
because I can't swallow. I had to give up silk dresses, belts and
high heels, but every cool evening, I'm wrapped in a luxurious
cashmere shawl, given to me by my husband.
</P>
<P>
   Work. My last boss was insane. He snuck into the office after
everyone had gone home to read our mail and leave scribbled notes
on scraps of paper. He bugged our phones and saved whole rooms full
of old magazines.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have to work for or with psychos any more. Now I write
when and if I feel like it. When I wake in the morning, I think
about who and what I want to write, for as long as I want to.
</P>
<P>
   I've met many people who, once disabled, don't know what to do
with themselves. I've met others who have started whole new
careers, and one who happily announced he'd always wanted to be ``a
couch potato.'' Now he is. It's all how you think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Faith. I was raised as a Congregationalist, like my Puritan
ancestors. Somewhere around college I lost my belief in religion
and stopped thinking about God.
</P>
<P>
   When I was diagnosed with ALS, I envied people of faith. They
are able to believe there is a reason for their affliction and that
when they die, they will go to a better place. I think about
religion a lot. I've tried reciting remembered Bible verses,
reading books on spiritism, praying with friends. A good friend
brought a healer/medium all the way from Brazil to help me. Was his
failure my lack of faith or his inability? Faith isn't something
you can think into existence.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends. When I became seriously disabled by my ALS,
I'm not sure what amazed me more: the people who disappeared from
my life, or the ones who found me and became part of my life.
</P>
<P>
   My husband frequently reminds me to be thankful for the people
who are here for us and stop obsessing about the ones who are not.
We've had to open our home, 24 hours a day, to nurses.
</P>
<P>
   They, and their families, are now our family. My life is in
their hands, and yet this wouldn't work unless we were friends.
I've had to redefine friendship. I e-mail dozens of people I'll
never meet, many with, or touched by, ALS. We support, advise and
encourage each other. We send jokes and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the people who have just appeared ... the lady
who helped me find switches, the man who built me a special table
for my computer, the reporter who wrote a series on me, the
neighbors who help me shop and wrap Christmas presents ... and
stayed. All are people who never knew me before ALS.
</P>
<P>
   One old friend asked me what I do when I get bored. ``Bored?'' I
e-mailed back. ``I don't have time to get bored. I have people to
write, books to read, music to listen to, so much to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   The critic Randall Jarrell described Walt Whitman as someone who
wrote of ``the tears of things, and the joy of things, and the
truth beneath either tears or joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's something worth infinite time and thought.

LOUISIANA GOP DETERMINED TO HOLD FIRST '00 ELECTION CAUCUS

<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ For GOP presidential candidates who have
grown tired of pork chops and county fairs, the Louisiana
Republican Party is offering up a spicy alternative to Iowa's
``first in the nation'' caucus.
</P>
<P>
   For a mere $5,000 entry fee, candidates can get a break from the
heartland hoopla by going deep into the heart of Cajun country _
where GOP officials are vowing to host the first caucus of the 2000
election even if it means they have to hold it at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The party's drive for a slice of the national spotlight is
contributing to a more compact and early presidential primary race,
likely to be decided by early March, months before the summer
nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   With its reputation for favoring social conservatives, the
Louisiana caucus is not expected to draw mainstream candidates such
as Gov. George W. Bush and former Red Cross director Elizabeth
Dole, though they haven't officially ruled anything out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the caucus system is not open, and if the rules are fuzzy,
and if it's hard to find places where people can vote, I think I'm
going to shy away,'' Bush said. ``If it's an open caucus where
people can participate, I'll participate. Right now, it's hard to
tell what the rules are. There's no date, there's no rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other hopefuls on the far right are organizing early
and hoping the contest will give them a ``bump'' going into the
Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Or, suggest the experts, maybe it will bump somebody from the
race and narrow the field.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas in 1996.
Conservative talk show host Pat Buchanan took on Gramm with an
under-the-radar, grass-roots campaign and walked away with a
majority of the 21 delegates up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is you're going to have a conservative elimination
contest down here,'' said Jeff Crouere, a former executive director
of the state Republican Party and now co-host of ``Politically
Speaking,'' a New Orleans talk radio show.
</P>
<P>
   Although Buchanan still has a loyal following in Louisiana,
conservative activist Gary Bauer and wealthy magazine publisher
Steve Forbes appear to be the most competitive so far.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has snapped up Buchanan's 1996 Louisiana campaign chief,
a former director of the state GOP and the former head of the state
Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   And Bauer, the only candidate with an official campaign
headquarters in the state, has tapped a network of church leaders
and activists and is relying on support from some of the 30,000
Louisiana followers of ``Focus on the Family,'' a conservative
radio program with which Bauer has been associated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody beats Bauer in terms of the amount of time spent in the
state,'' Crouere said. ``Forbes has the money, like Gramm did. But
Bauer has the grass-roots support. It may be sort of money vs. the
grass roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spokesman Greg Mueller dismissed the comparison between
Gramm and Forbes, saying the Texas senator fell prey to his own
high expectations. When he didn't live up to them, he abruptly
ended his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes will be competitive in Louisiana while still respecting
the traditional role that Iowa plays, Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition holds for us,'' he said. ``It's the top three
candidates that come out of the Iowa caucuses. One of them will win
the nomination and potentially the presidency. ... Louisiana is an
opportunity for the more niche candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   For some candidates in the top tier, participating in Louisiana
could be an unnecessary risk. Former Sen. Bob Dole ignored the
state in 1996 and still won the GOP nomination, though not the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   This year, his wife is running, but she has not made a decision
about whether to participate in the Louisiana caucus, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain does not consider Louisiana to be ``one
of his priority states right now,'' said Bryan Wagner, a McCain
ally and longtime Republican leader in the state. A McCain
spokesman in Washington said the senator has been to Louisiana at
least three times this year but has made no decision about whether
he'll participate in the caucus.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush appears to be leaning against participating.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers are more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fixed. I can't recommend that he play,'' said Donald
Ensenat, a longtime friend and former roommate of Bush (and former
ambassador to Brunei) who is helping the governor raise money in
Louisiana. ``I'd sure like him to play, because if it was a fair
election, (Bush) would win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ensenat cited a meeting that party officials called about a
month ago to discuss the caucus. He said the Bush campaign got no
notice of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hogwash,'' said state Rep. Tony Perkins, who is running
Bauer's Louisiana campaign. Perkins, who attended the meeting, said
Bush is not entering the Louisiana caucus because Republican Party
Chairman Mike Francis did not commit to him at a February meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan acknowledged that Bush talked
with Francis about the caucus during a winter visit with Louisiana
Gov. Mike Foster, but he said he was not aware of ``any discussions
of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the impending absence of several major
contenders in Louisiana has been cause for joy in Iowa, where
Democratic and Republican party officials guard the
first-in-the-nation label like a family heirloom.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the national news media and top candidates aren't
acting like the Louisiana caucus is a big deal, neither is Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure their event is technically a caucus,'' said Kayne
Robinson, chairman of the Iowa state GOP. ``It probably does not
cause us to change our date, in any event.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Iowa's caucus date has been set for Feb. 7, officials
there expect to move it to Jan. 31 to ensure that the state stages
its event one week before the New Hampshire primary, now set for
Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted Louisiana Republicans to fixate on Jan. 22 as
the date for their caucus, meaning that it would be held a week
before Iowa. But in the event that Iowa moves its caucus to an
earlier date, Louisiana has vowed to follow suit, even if that
means backing into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't we be the first?'' said Connie Chittom, deputy
chairwoman of the Louisiana Republican Party. ``I don't think Iowa
should be afraid of us. We're just another state having a caucus.
It's not going to take anything away from them, except they want to
be first. So do we.''

   GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands _ We needed this family vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Four months of shuffling correspondents throughout the Eastern
Hemisphere to report on the bombing of Yugoslavia and its aftermath
had me cursing at the mere mention of the name ``Milosevic.''
Worse, my family was leaving me notes in lieu of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   To re-connect we came here, to the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, this gorgeous three-island chain may be one of
the best kept secrets for family vacations in the Caribbean
off-season _ generally the summer and early fall.
</P>
<P>
   Flights, car rentals and rooms can be found at reasonable
prices. Restaurants run the gamut: from expensive to affordable,
from authentic island cuisine to Pizza Hut. The primary
entertainment (read that, the beach) is free.
</P>
<P>
   And there are a few things you can't put a price on: No theme
park crowds. No panhandlers. A low crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   For about what it costs to jet a family of five down for a week
of Disney or Universal Studios, we treated ourselves to turquoise
blue water, sugar white beach sand, and marine life in spectacular
colors both below and above water.
</P>
<P>
   Although we visited this summer, the fall has an added bonus:
Pirates Week, when Caymanians abandon their British reserve with
parades, costume parties and treasure hunts. The October festival
is one of only two main events all year; the other being the
Carnival-style Batabano holiday in April.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, we have three young daughters. My wife, Klemie, took
them down a week ahead of me to visit family on the main island,
Grand Cayman. The ``oohs,'' ``aahs'' and ``whoas'' that began
flowing from the girls even as they gazed out the plane window
before landing _ 2-year-old Elisabeth included _ was worth the
exhausting, frustrating, taxing trip down. (I'm still paying for
that one.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time I arrived the following week, visiting the beach had
become a daily routine for Klemie and the girls. They'd even staked
out a semi-private, partially shaded piece of it called ``Our
Spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Even hundreds of yards from shore, the water is crystal clear
and rarely deeper than 10 feet, allowing the kids to do a little
shallow-water snorkeling. If it wasn't for the large coral rocks
and little fish swimming around your feet, you'd think you were in
a big warm swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   There was a downside: Tearing the girls away from the beach also
became a daily routine. This was primarily a problem with
Elisabeth, who could not fathom why she couldn't live in the water
and thus, had to be carried away kicking and screaming most days.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and did I mention the sand? There is sand _ lots and lots of
sand. It's everywhere. It's on you, your clothes, in your car and
if you're not careful, your food.
</P>
<P>
   Three little girls provide a further challenge with sand. It
gets in their hair. Well, actually they tend to pour it in one
another's hair. I was never able to figure out the genesis of this
ritual. But given that I have sworn a vow of restraint against
meddling in our little girls' ebony locks, my beautiful wife was
forced to take up this challenge alone.
</P>
<P>
   I did mention that my wife is beautiful, right?
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness there's a lot more to Grand Cayman, the main
island, than the beach. It remains environmentally pristine,
despite the continued incursion of big-name hotels, restaurants and
shops. But overall, the island had changed noticeably from the last
time Klemie and I visited 11 years ago. . . alone. . . with no kids
. . . oh, sorry I drifted there for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip, we rented a car and spent the majority of our time
exploring: everything from sights on and off the beaten path to
character-filled shops to local restaurants. (We had five rolls of
film to prove it.)
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, we ate at our hotel, the Sleep Inn. The hotel
cost included a daily complimentary breakfast buffet. Not bad for
US$140 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth's second birthday gave us a reason to celebrate one
evening by trying out one of Grand Cayman's nicest restaurants, The
Wharf. The setting is gorgeous, allowing you to eat in an
air-conditioned veranda dining room or on a seaside patio. We chose
the latter.
</P>
<P>
   But while the ladies preferred the safety of foods they've
tasted before, I had turtle steak _ a beef-like delicacy in the
Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The night's entertainment involved hand-feeding tuna to some
massive, hungry tarpon off The Wharf's small dock. Rachel, our
adventurous 10-year-old, decided to give it a shot. But 5-year-old
Taylor thought better of it after a closer view revealed that she
was smaller than the fish. Elisabeth? Well, she was too busy
tearing into her birthday chocolate mousse to care.
</P>
<P>
   We tried another authentic restaurant called Ocean View at White
Hall Bay, located on the waterfront, downtown _ and down the price
scale. It's less formal, but the food was just as good, and with
big portions. The charming old hostess who greeted us was also the
cook and waitress. I don't think we got better service or food
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But we certainly got worse. As our exploring took us from Grand
Cayman's West Bay to the East End area, we found hole-in-wall dives
that reminded us that just because it's authentic, doesn't mean
it's good.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for island shops, as well. There are plenty of places
where you can buy T-shirts, jewelry, shells and cigars _ duty free.
And ``50% Off'' signs are everywhere, a result of the off-season.
Most of the major shops are in or near downtown. But there are
others to be found exploring the island; including shops that
people have set up out of there homes.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you decide to shop, don't be in a big hurry. We saved
most of our shopping for the last couple of days and that was
plenty of time. And don't forget, the Cayman Islands are pretty
relaxed and reserved. Most shops close at 5 p.m. on Saturday and
stay closed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of exchange for cash is US$1 equals CI$.80. Don't sweat
trying to figure it in your head. Everyone from the fisherman
selling the day's catch on the dock to the Tiffany's jeweler can
figure it for you _ and you can be pretty sure they won't try to
stiff you. I took the easy route and exchanged much of my cache of
U.S. dollars for C.I. dollars when I first arrived.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good thing, too. You don't want to be bogged down
counting coins when you're listening to interesting characters like
Carey Hurlstone, the owner of Dr. Carey's Black Coral Clinic, spin
one of his island tales. A burly guy with a booming voice, ``Mr.
Carey'' _ he likes to be called that _ prefers to walk around
shirtless, showing off the myriad tattoos covering his weathered
skin. He also was one of the many native Caymanians we ran into who
was either somehow related to my wife or knew one of her many
relatives here.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Carey polishes and crafts black coral into jewelry, one of
the islands' best-known traditions. He mesmerized my daughters with
stories of acquiring the precious commodity from the sea. And he
showed off other unusual items in his shop. (He owns giant shark's
teeth and the largest collection of marbles I've ever seen.)
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, places we visited that were more on the
tourist path. Among them are two great nature and history stops.
One is Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park, which sports all of
Cayman's flora and fauna in living color. The other is Pedro St.
James _ known locally as Pedro's Castle _ which touts itself as the
``birthplace of democracy in the Cayman Islands.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of nature, we got up close and personal with huge green
sea turtles at the world's only turtle farm. The girls loved this
because they saw how turtles go from eggs to hatchlings and grow to
weigh a quarter-ton or more. There's even a tank where they picked
up and held smaller turtles.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Another world-famous tourist spot is Hell, a tiny community here
so-named for its rugged surreal pointed rock formation near town.
It has learned to trade on its name, and no one is better at
exploiting it than Ivan Farrington, the owner of the Devil's
Hangout Gift Shop who dresses as none other than the devil himself.
Farrington was actually very nice. He gave the girls a bunch of
postcards from his shop. He gave Klemie a peck on the cheek. And he
gave me . . . well, hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, Mr. Farrington ,you've got an interesting place here,'' I
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to turn it into paradise but business went to hell,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, OK. So what kind of town is it,'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hell of a town,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh. How warm do you think it is today,'' I asked, looking
to change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hot as hell,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, I think that's enough. We're heading out now , Mr.
Farrington,'' I said, exasperated. ``Take care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to Hell!'' he said, smiling and waving.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I found time to go fishing. Ever since I'd arrived I'd
been trying to get together with a guy named ``Red'' Smith, who
worked at our hotel. He was also distantly related to my wife, and
offered to take me out on his little 12-footer to teach me ``line''
fishing _ the popular way natives fish here sans rod and reel.
</P>
<P>
   We hooked up the day before the family was set to leave. Klemie
and the girls set off for the beach one last time. Smith and I set
off from a little cove in the North Sound with his Yamaha outboard
motor pushing us about two miles out over beautiful green water
that was clear enough to see the coral-covered bottom.
</P>
<P>
   I got the hang of line fishing quickly enough to haul in more
than a dozen small grunts and grouper in a little more than an
hour. The problem came when we tried to leave. The motor wouldn't
start. I guess I should have known this could be a problem when I
first saw that it was held together by duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   As I turned toward what I thought was land (and noticed how far
away it was), I gleaned that the water was getting choppy. It
occurred to me that we could be getting back rather late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what do we do,'' I asked, straining to remain calm as
screaming came to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah man. You wanted adventure, eh,'' he said with a big
smile. ``Grab that oar, man. We'll be there before you know it.''
</P>
<P>
   We were lucky the current was with us. It took a good hour and a
half, but we made it back just after nightfall. We passed the time
talking about everything under the setting sun: fishing, politics,
marriage, children.
</P>
<P>
   But not once did I ever hear the words ``Kosovo'' or ``the
Balkans.'' That's what I call a family vacation.

   ``For a summer vacation? What about Disney or Universal

</P>
<P>
   ``Not if I want to avoid hearing the words 'Kosovo' or
'Balkans,''' I answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about the kids,'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? Turquoise blue water, sugar white beach sand, and marine
life in spectacular colors both below and above water,'' I replied.
``This will be big fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about the cost,'' he queried, sounding a bit more

frustrating, taxing trip down. (I'm still paying for that one.)
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim starts here.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a situation made more trying by Delta Airlines' flight
problems, and the fact that my wife _ she grew up here _ decided to
fly down a week earlier with the girls to spend time with her
parents. Let's just say that it was so bad that my four favorite
ladies had to switch to two other airlines to get to Grand Cayman,
while their luggage eventually showed up on Delta about 12 hours
after their trip began.

scale. It's less formal, but the food was just as good, and with
big portions. The charming old hostess who greeted us was also the
cook and waitress. I don't think we got better service or food
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But we certainly got worse. As our exploring took us from Grand
Cayman's West Bay to the East End area, we found hole-in-wall dives
that reminded us that just because it's authentic, doesn't mean
it's good.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for island shops, as well. There are plenty of places
where you can buy T-shirts, jewelry, shells and cigars _ duty free.
And ``50% Off'' signs are everywhere, a result of the off-season.
Most of the major shops are in or near downtown. But there are
others to be found exploring the island; including shops that
people have set up out of there homes.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you decide to shop, don't be in a big hurry. We saved
most of our shopping for the last couple of days and that was
plenty of time. And don't forget, the Cayman Islands are pretty
relaxed and reserved. Most shops close at 5 p.m. on Saturday and
stay closed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of exchange for cash is US$1 equals CI$.80. Don't sweat
trying to figure it in your head. Everyone from the fisherman
selling the day's catch on the dock to the Tiffany's jeweler can
figure it for you _ and you can be pretty sure they won't try to
stiff you. I took the easy route and exchanged much of my cache of
U.S. dollars for C.I. dollars when I first arrived.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good thing, too. You don't want to be bogged down
counting coins when you're listening to interesting characters like
Carey Hurlstone, the owner of Dr. Carey's Black Coral Clinic, spin
one of his island tales. A burly guy with a booming voice, ``Mr.
Carey'' _ he likes to be called that _ prefers to walk around
shirtless, showing off the myriad tattoos covering his weathered
skin. He also was one of the many native Caymanians we ran into who
was either somehow related to my wife or knew one of her many
relatives here.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Carey polishes and crafts black coral into jewelry, one of
the islands' best-known traditions. He mesmerized my daughters with
stories of acquiring the precious commodity from the sea. And he
showed off other unusual items in his shop. (He owns giant shark's
teeth and the largest collection of marbles I've ever seen.)
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, places we visited that were more on the
tourist path. Among them are two great nature and history stops.
One is Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park, which sports all of
Cayman's flora and fauna in living color. The other is Pedro St.
James _ known locally as Pedro's Castle _ which touts itself as the
``birthplace of democracy in the Cayman Islands.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of nature, we got up close and personal with huge green
sea turtles at the world's only turtle farm. The girls loved this
because they saw how turtles go from eggs to hatchlings and grow to
weigh a quarter-ton or more. There's even a tank where they picked
up and held smaller turtles.
</P>
<P>
   Another world-famous tourist spot is Hell, a tiny community here
so-named for its rugged surreal pointed rock formation near town.
It has learned to trade on its name, and no one is better at
exploiting it than Ivan Farrington, the owner of the Devil's
Hangout Gift Shop who dresses as none other than the devil himself.
Farrington was actually very nice. He gave the girls a bunch of
postcards from his shop. He gave Klemie a peck on the cheek. And he
gave me . . . well, hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, Mr. Farrington ,you've got an interesting place here,'' I
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to turn it into paradise but business went to hell,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, OK. So what kind of town is it,'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hell of a town,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh. How warm do you think it is today,'' I asked, looking
to change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hot as hell,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, I think that's enough. We're heading out now , Mr.
Farrington,'' I said, exasperated. ``Take care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to Hell!'' he said, smiling and waving.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I found time to go fishing. Ever since I'd arrived I'd
been trying to get together with a guy named ``Red'' Smith, who
worked at our hotel. He was also distantly related to my wife, and
offered to take me out on his little 12-footer to teach me ``line''
fishing _ the popular way natives fish here sans rod and reel.
</P>
<P>
   We hooked up the day before the family was set to leave. Klemie
and the girls set off for the beach one last time. Smith and I set
off from a little cove in the North Sound with his Yamaha outboard
motor pushing us about two miles out over beautiful green water
that was clear enough to see the coral-covered bottom.
</P>
<P>
   I got the hang of line fishing quickly enough to haul in more
than a dozen small grunts and grouper in a little more than an
hour. The problem came when we tried to leave. The motor wouldn't
start. I guess I should have known this could be a problem when I
first saw that it was held together by duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   As I turned toward what I thought was land (and noticed how far
away it was), I gleaned that the water was getting choppy. It
occurred to me that we could be getting back rather late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what do we do,'' I asked, straining to remain calm as
screaming came to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah man. You wanted adventure, eh,'' he said with a big
smile. ``Grab that oar, man. We'll be there before you know it.''
</P>
<P>
   We were lucky the current was with us. It took a good hour and a
half, but we made it back just after nightfall. We passed the time
talking about everything under the setting sun: fishing, politics,
marriage, children.
</P>
<P>
   But not once did I ever hear the words ``Kosovo'' or ``the
Balkans.'' That's what I call a family vacation.

   VITAL STATISTICS
</P>
<P>
   Capital: George Town (Grand Cayman)
</P>
<P>
   Geography: Grand Cayman is the largest island, at 76 square
miles. The other islands are Little Cayman and Cayman Brac.
</P>
<P>
   Population: 37,000, mainly of mixed European and African
descent.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: Cayman Island dollar (Exchange rate: US$1  &QC;  CI$.80).
</P>
<P>
   Official language: English
</P>
<P>
   Political status: British Dependent Territory
</P>
<P>
   Religion: Christianity
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE
</P>
<P>
   The first place to go for information should be the Internet:
www.caymanislands.ky or www.caymans.com. The Cayman Islands
Department of Tourism also has offices in Miami, Houston, New York,
Chicago, Los Angeles and Toronto, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   As for guidebooks, Fodor's or Frommer's provide pretty good
overall information. Another guide, ``Caribbean With Kids'' (Open
Road Publishing) is also good. But beware: It puts the Cayman
dollar exchange rate at ``US$1 equals CI$1.20.'' (According to
banking officials, the rate remains fairly constant at US$1  &QC; 
CI$.80.)
</P>
<P>
   Once you're in the Caymans, be sure to pick up both ``Horizons''
and ``Key to Cayman'' magazines. Both are complimentary
publications that contain information on just about everything
there is to do there.
</P>
<P>
   The Caymans, south of Cuba in the Caribbean Sea, are less than
two hours flight time from Houston and just over an hour from
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING AROUND
</P>
<P>
   The best way to get around and see most of Grand Cayman is to
rent a car. The cheapest rates are offered by the locally owned car
rental companies.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller families and those with older kids, you can also
rent 4x4 Jeeps, and motorized and non-motorized bikes.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING GOING
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the place that the kids will want to spend most of
their time is the beach. It's a good thing too, since it's free.
The other water activities are basically snorkeling or diving, and
they can cost. There are plenty of people offering rental equipment
for both services.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other spots and activities on Grand Cayman:
</P>
<P>
   --Submarine rides (Atlantis Submarines; Nautilus, The Undersea
Tour)
</P>
<P>
   --Stingray City (Take a ferry boat over to one of the best-known
dive sites in the world and swim with the stingrays. There are
actually two: a deeper one for divers; a sandbar for waders and
snorkelers.)
</P>
<P>
   --Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park (A 65-acre showcase of
Cayman's flora and fauna in living color.)
</P>
<P>
   --Mastic Trail (A restored 200-year-old footpath that great for
hiking.)
</P>
<P>
   --Cayman Turtle Farm (A chance to get up close and personal with
green sea turtles.)
</P>
<P>
   --Pedro St. James Castle (Known as the ``birthplace of democracy
in the Cayman Islands,'' it is the oldest structure in the
islands.)
</P>
<P>
   --Cayman Islands National Museum (A great cultural arts stop for
kids who love this sort of thing.)
</P>
<P>
   --Hell (A tiny community so-named for its rugged surreal pointed
rock formation near town. It's kitschy. It's kooky. It's catchy.)
</P>
<P>
   --Shipwrecks (There are numerous spectacular wrecks lying off
the coast on every side of Grand Cayman.)
</P>
<P>
   GETTING GRUB
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem. For kids, the more than 120 restaurants run the
gamut: from expensive to affordable, from authentic island cuisine
to fast food. Don't worry if you're having trouble getting the kids
to eat that turtle steak or conch stew. There's no McDonald's, but
other old reliables like Burger King, Wendy's and Pizza Hut are
just around the corner. There are even coffee shops for when you
need that extra shot of caffeine.

   GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands _ We needed this family vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Four months of shuffling correspondents throughout the Eastern
Hemisphere to report on the bombing of Yugoslavia and its aftermath
had me in hives at the mere mention of the name ``Milosevic.''
Worse, my family was leaving me notes in lieu of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   To re-connect we came here, to the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a summer vacation? What about Disney or Universal
Studios,'' a friend asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not if I want to avoid hearing the words 'Kosovo' or
'Balkans,''' I answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about the kids,'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? Turquoise blue water, sugar white beach sand, and marine
life in spectacular colors both below and above water,'' I replied.
``This will be big fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about the cost,'' he queried, sounding a bit more
perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the off-season,'' I said. ``Flights, car rentals and
rooms are more reasonable. Restaurants run the gamut: from
expensive to affordable, from authentic island cuisine to Pizza
Hut. The primary entertainment (read that, the beach) is free.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there are a few things you can't put a price on: No theme
park crowds. No panhandlers. A low crime rate.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as my wife Klemie noted to me later, the ``oohs,''
``aahs'' and ``whoas'' that began flowing from our three daughters
as they gazed longingly out the plane window on the trip over _
2-year-old Elisabeth included _ were worth the exhausting,
frustrating, taxing trip down. (I'm still paying for that one.)
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim starts here.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a situation made more trying by Delta Airlines' flight
problems, and the fact that my wife _ she grew up here _ decided to
fly down a week earlier with the girls to spend time with her
parents. Let's just say that it was so bad that my four favorite
ladies had to switch to two other airlines to get to Grand Cayman,
while their luggage eventually showed up on Delta about 12 hours
after their trip began.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time I arrived the following week, visiting the beach had
become a daily routine for Klemie and the girls. They'd even staked
out a semi-private, partially shaded piece of it called ``Our
Spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Even hundreds of yards from shore, the water is crystal clear
and rarely deeper than 10 feet, allowing the kids to do a little
shallow-water snorkeling. If it wasn't for the large coral rocks
and little fish swimming around your feet, you'd think you were in
a big warm swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   There was a downside: Tearing the girls away from the beach also
became a daily routine. This was primarily a problem with
Elisabeth, who could not fathom why she couldn't live in the water
and thus, had to be carried away kicking and screaming most days.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and did I mention the sand? There is sand _ lots and lots of
sand. It's everywhere. It's on you, your clothes, in your car and
if you're not careful, your food.
</P>
<P>
   Three little girls provide a further challenge with sand. It
gets in their hair. Well, actually they tend to pour it in one
another's hair. I was never able to figure out the genesis of this
ritual. But given that I have sworn a vow of restraint against
meddling in our little girls' ebony locks, my beautiful wife was
forced to take up this challenge alone.
</P>
<P>
   I did mention that my wife is beautiful, right?
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness there's a lot more to Grand Cayman, the main
island, than the beach. It remains environmentally pristine,
despite the continued incursion of big-name hotels, restaurants and
shops. But overall, the island had changed noticeably from the last
time Klemie and I visited 11 years ago. . . alone. . . with no kids
. . . oh, sorry I drifted there for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip, we rented a car and spent the majority of our time
exploring: everything from sights on and off the beaten path to
character-filled shops to local restaurants. (We had five rolls of
film to prove it.)
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, we ate at our hotel, the Sleep Inn. The hotel
cost included a daily complimentary breakfast buffet. Not bad for
US$140 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth's second birthday gave us a reason to celebrate one
evening by trying out one of Grand Cayman's nicest restaurants, The
Wharf. The setting is gorgeous, allowing you to eat in an
air-conditioned veranda dining room or on a seaside patio. We chose
the latter.
</P>
<P>
   But while the ladies preferred the safety of foods they've
tasted before, I had turtle steak _ a beef-like delicacy in the
Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The night's entertainment involved hand-feeding tuna to some
massive, hungry tarpon off The Wharf's small dock. Rachel, our
adventurous 10-year-old, decided to give it a shot. But 5-year-old
Taylor thought better of it after a closer view revealed that she
was smaller than the fish. Elisabeth? Well, she was too busy
tearing into her birthday chocolate mousse to care.
</P>
<P>
   We tried another authentic restaurant called Ocean View at White
Hall Bay, located on the waterfront, downtown _ and down the price
scale. It's less formal, but the food was just as good, and with
big portions. The charming old hostess who greeted us was also the
cook and waitress. I don't think we got better service or food
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But we certainly got worse. As our exploring took us from Grand
Cayman's West Bay to the East End area, we found hole-in-wall dives
that reminded us that just because it's authentic, doesn't mean
it's good.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for island shops, as well. There are plenty of places
where you can buy T-shirts, jewelry, shells and cigars _ duty free.
And ``50% Off'' signs are everywhere, a result of the off-season.
Most of the major shops are in or near downtown. But there are
others to be found exploring the island; including shops that
people have set up out of there homes.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you decide to shop, don't be in a big hurry. We saved
most of our shopping for the last couple of days and that was
plenty of time. And don't forget, the Cayman Islands are pretty
relaxed and reserved. Most shops close at 5 p.m. on Saturday and
stay closed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of exchange for cash is US$1 equals CI$.80. Don't sweat
trying to figure it in your head. Everyone from the fisherman
selling the day's catch on the dock to the Tiffany's jeweler can
figure it for you _ and you can be pretty sure they won't try to
stiff you. I took the easy route and exchanged much of my cache of
U.S. dollars for C.I. dollars when I first arrived.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good thing, too. You don't want to be bogged down
counting coins when you're listening to interesting characters like
Carey Hurlstone, the owner of Dr. Carey's Black Coral Clinic, spin
one of his island tales. A burly guy with a booming voice, ``Mr.
Carey'' _ he likes to be called that _ prefers to walk around
shirtless, showing off the myriad tattoos covering his weathered
skin. He also was one of the many native Caymanians we ran into who
was either somehow related to my wife or knew one of her many
relatives here.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Carey polishes and crafts black coral into jewelry, one of
the islands' best-known traditions. He mesmerized my daughters with
stories of acquiring the precious commodity from the sea. And he
showed off other unusual items in his shop. (He owns giant shark's
teeth and the largest collection of marbles I've ever seen.)
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, places we visited that were more on the
tourist path. Among them are two great nature and history stops.
One is Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park, which sports all of
Cayman's flora and fauna in living color. The other is Pedro St.
James _ known locally as Pedro's Castle _ which touts itself as the
``birthplace of democracy in the Cayman Islands.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of nature, we got up close and personal with huge green
sea turtles at the world's only turtle farm. The girls loved this
because they saw how turtles go from eggs to hatchlings and grow to
weigh a quarter-ton or more. There's even a tank where they picked
up and held smaller turtles.
</P>
<P>
   Another world-famous tourist spot is Hell, a tiny community here
so-named for its rugged surreal pointed rock formation near town.
It has learned to trade on its name, and no one is better at
exploiting it than Ivan Farrington, the owner of the Devil's
Hangout Gift Shop who dresses as none other than the devil himself.
Farrington was actually very nice. He gave the girls a bunch of
postcards from his shop. He gave Klemie a peck on the cheek. And he
gave me . . . well, hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, Mr. Farrington ,you've got an interesting place here,'' I
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to turn it into paradise but business went to hell,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, OK. So what kind of town is it,'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hell of a town,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh. How warm do you think it is today,'' I asked, looking
to change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hot as hell,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, I think that's enough. We're heading out now , Mr.
Farrington,'' I said, exasperated. ``Take care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to Hell!'' he said, smiling and waving.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I found time to go fishing. Ever since I'd arrived I'd
been trying to get together with a guy named ``Red'' Smith, who
worked at our hotel. He was also distantly related to my wife, and
offered to take me out on his little 12-footer to teach me ``line''
fishing _ the popular way natives fish here sans rod and reel.
</P>
<P>
   We hooked up the day before the family was set to leave. Klemie
and the girls set off for the beach one last time. Smith and I set
off from a little cove in the North Sound with his Yamaha outboard
motor pushing us about two miles out over beautiful green water
that was clear enough to see the coral-covered bottom.
</P>
<P>
   I got the hang of line fishing quickly enough to haul in more
than a dozen small grunts and grouper in a little more than an
hour. The problem came when we tried to leave. The motor wouldn't
start. I guess I should have known this could be a problem when I
first saw that it was held together by duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   As I turned toward what I thought was land (and noticed how far
away it was), I gleaned that the water was getting choppy. It
occurred to me that we could be getting back rather late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what do we do,'' I asked, straining to remain calm as
screaming came to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah man. You wanted adventure, eh,'' he said with a big
smile. ``Grab that oar, man. We'll be there before you know it.''
</P>
<P>
   We were lucky the current was with us. It took a good hour and a
half, but we made it back just after nightfall. We passed the time
talking about everything under the setting sun: fishing, politics,
marriage, children.
</P>
<P>
   But not once did I ever hear the words ``Kosovo'' or ``the
Balkans.'' That's what I call a family vacation.

<P>
   GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands _ Divers. Honeymooners. Families.
</P>
<P>
   Encircled in powdery white beaches that seem to float calmly in
clear turquoise blue waters, the three islands that make up this
Caribbean chain _ Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac _
have been expanding in the type of tourist they attract. For many
of the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a little hustle and bustle with your rest and
relaxation, Grand Cayman won't let you down,'' according to
``Fodor's 99 Caribbean'' guidebook. ``If it's pure R&AMP;R you seek,
you'll find pockets of sweet seclusion, especially on Cayman Brac
and Little Cayman.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Columbus, on his fourth Caribbean voyage, sighted
the islands in 1503 and noted the large turtle population in the
surrounding waters. He named the islands Las Tortugas _ ``The
Turtles'' in Spanish _ but over the next 100 years the name was
changed to ``Caymanas'' or Caymans, derived from the Carib Indian
word for crocodile.
</P>
<P>
   This tiny group of islands has always seemed to hold a special
place in the heart of some wayward group _ from the adventurers who
made them a regular stop to load up on turtle meat, to the pirates
rumored to favor the coves of the sparsely populated islands, to
the divers who have made the Caymans one of the world's top diving
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Cayman Islands _ they are actually the tips of
underwater mountains _ are clearly best-known as a divers'
paradise. They are surrounded by shallow reefs and then sheer walls
that drop off thousands of feet to the ocean floor, making diving
here both unique and exciting.
</P>
<P>
   There are literally hundreds of places to dive and scores of
professionals to dive with. To be sure, there are resorts catering
to divers. But any hotel on the islands worth its salt offers scuba
diving and snorkeling excursions to its patrons.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite, well-known site is Little Cayman's Bloody Bay Wall,
rated the third-best dive site in the world by the late Jacques
Cousteau. Its drop-off begins at 18 feet, then plunges sharply to
1,200 feet. The array of coral, sponges and fish of various shapes,
sizes and colors in the coastal water is nothing short of
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   As stories of gliding through these waters spread, however, the
attractiveness of the Caymans grows with young honeymooners and
older couples. From jewelry and cigar shopping to fine dining to a
simple evening stroll on a quiet beach, the islands _ particularly,
Grand Cayman _ offer the perfect romantic background.
</P>
<P>
   The Cayman Islands Tourism Ministry has seized upon, and sought
to enhance this image with its ``Relax, Cayman Islands Style,''
advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Couples can be seen all over doing just that _ relaxing. Some do
it by swimming with the stingrays at Stingray City. Some dine under
the stars on the seaside patio at The Wharf restaurant here in
George Town. And some escape to the serene isolation of Cayman Brac
where they can hike a nature trail through a 180-acre parrot
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   It is activities like the latter, however, that are opening the
Caymans to yet another group _ families _ in the Caribbean
off-season (generally the summer and early fall).
</P>
<P>
   With airline flights, car rentals and hotel rooms offered at
reasonable prices, many families are finding the Caymans a relaxing
alternative to the harried theme park vacation. What's more, to go
along with the pricier restaurants, there are plenty of familiar
and affordable fast-food eateries.
</P>
<P>
   The primary entertainment (read that, the beach) is free.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty more where that comes from. One of the best known
is Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park, which sports all of Cayman's
flora and fauna in living color. Another is Pedro St. James _ known
locally as Pedro's Castle _ which touts itself as the ``birthplace
of democracy in the Cayman Islands.'' Both are great nature and
history stops. And the Cayman Turtle Farm allows kids to get up
close and personal with giant green sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important for families, however, is the safe
environment of the Caymans. Panhandling is illegal and the crime
rate is very low. And in the off-season, crowds are largely
nonexistent.

`MOESHA' SPINOFF DOESN'T MAKE THE GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give UPN credit for launching one of the few television shows
this season that has an African-American cast. Then subtract points
for airing yet another sitcom that is as predictable and rim-shot
rote as they come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parkers'' is a spinoff from one of UPN's longest-running
hits, ``Moesha.'' But any resemblance _ especially to quality _
ends there.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Moesha'' has been about family, coming of age and the
various dramatic and comic moments that spring forth, ``The
Parkers'' is first and foremost an over-the-top sitcom. That it
tries to temper the cartoonish behavior with a life lesson or a
sweet hug just makes it all the more formulaic and dislikable.
</P>
<P>
   Countess Vaughn, who made a name for herself as the
wise-cracking friend on ``Moesha,'' continues her Kim Parker
character as she enters Santa Monica College. The hook, borrowed
from a ``Moesha'' plot line, is that her mother, Nikki (played by
stand-up comic Mo'Nique), who went back to high school after 18
years and finally earned her degree, is now so into higher learning
that she's coming along to college.
</P>
<P>
   That's it, really. ``The Parkers'' is about a mom who wants to
do the same thing as her daughter and ends up _ punch line after
punch line _ crowding her space. Then, when mom has gone too far _
by being too popular or too loud or attracted to the same men _
there's always a heartfelt mother-daughter make-up speech, and then
the two sassy sisters get back to business.
</P>
<P>
   One of the apparently humorous devices is to have mother and
daughter dress outrageously, to match their personalities. Both
also possess screeching voices that reach a fever pitch about every
five lines of the show _ but at least it temporarily knocks out the
laugh track.
</P>
<P>
   The jokes in ``The Parkers'' were baked from the same
cookie-cutter sitcom recipe that inhabits other sitcoms, as well.
It's the obvious setup-and-punch-line bit that's older than Milton
Berle's dad. At one point, Nikki says, ``College is just as I
imagined.'' Another character says, ``Hard?'' To which Nikki, in
that tired, you-go-girl smirk that dominates so many black sitcoms,
says, ``No, but the bodies on those young boys was.''
</P>
<P>
   In another scene, Kim says she's going to sign up for a
black-studies class. Says mom: ``Black studies? Isn't that like
taking Me 101?'' When the writers tire of that kind of hilarity,
they fall back on the exasperated daughter dealing with overbearing
mom, and the resulting refrain _ heard endlessly _ is: ``But why,
momma?'' And in that not-quite-endearing way that Vaughn has about
her.
</P>
<P>
   None of the charm and freshness of ``Moesha'' translates to
``The Parkers.'' The producers _ the same ones who built ``Moesha''
_ have opted for the effortless, old-school ways of unenlightened
comedy. Perhaps they had no real direction from the start, because
even though Vaughn was a scene-stealer in ``Moesha'' and long
rumored to get her own show, the initial title to this show was
``Mo'Nique,'' which probably didn't sit well with Vaughn. The two
barely looked at each other on a recent publicity tour, and Vaughn
ends up saying the straight lines most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters. ``The Parkers,'' as it stands now, is
nothing to be territorial about. Unless either of them thinks being
called the ``ghetto fabulous Doublemint twins'' is cause for
excitement.

SPRINGSTEEN FINDS RENEWED HARMONY WITH E STREET BAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Bruce Springsteen is ecstatic about the way his
reunion tour with the E Street Band is going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the happiest I've ever been with the band,'' he said after
his last show in Boston on Friday night. ``I think they're playing
better than ever. Everybody came in with a great attitude, and it's
stayed that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting backstage at the FleetCenter in a workingman's T-shirt
and jeans, Springsteen added that ``everybody knows their roles and
has improved their playing.'' He also was thrilled to have
guitarists Nils Lofgren and Miami Steve Van Zandt onstage together
for the first time. They were in the band during different eras.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Springsteen said there's ``a long road to
go'' on this tour, but hinted broadly when the question of whether
he would record with the band was raised. ``For the past 25
years,'' he said, ``I've made band records and acoustic records.
And I'll continue to do that in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen noted that any friction with the E Street Band,
which had not been together in the previous decade as he pursued
other projects, was overblown by the media. ``I've always stayed in
touch with them,'' he said. ``We've always remained friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen's whole point on this tour, he emphasized, is to
``be right here, right now, in the present. That's why I ask the
crowd, `Are you alive right now?' I'm interested in the present.''
</P>
<P>
   His renewed closeness with the E Street Band (``I really feel
I'm playing with the full band for the first time'') has enabled
him to dig deep to play more than 70 songs on the tour, which
already has entailed a European leg, then 15 shows in New Jersey
and five in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New Jersey, we were also rehearsing an hour a day,'' he
said, noting that helped them to work up more material.
</P>
<P>
   His renewed faith in the band has also permitted him to ``call a
lot of audibles'' during a given show. For instance, at Friday's
three-hour finale at the FleetCenter, he diverted liberally from
his planned song list, as the mood struck him. And his sense of
experimentation was evident, as he opened with the surprise
hard-rocking ``Candy's Room,'' followed by ``Ties That Bind'' and
``Adam Raised a Cain,'' both of which had opened other Boston shows
last week. To stack that trio together was purely speculative,
``but at the end of them, when I saw how the crowd reacted, I
thought, `Wow, that worked.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What has also worked is a pattern of stacking ``Jungleland'' and
``Born to Run'' together on the encores. ``When we did that, things
just exploded,'' he said. As for the noise of the audience, which
sings along with a gusto that sometimes belies their years,
Springsteen said: ``I've been amazed by the reaction. I looked out
tonight, and it was so loud that I saw some people had their
fingers in their ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen is most pleased to be able to showcase songs from
his turning-point album, ``Darkness at the Edge of Town,'' from
1978. As his manager, Jon Landau, said Friday, ``We're not doing a
lot of the hits.'' Instead, they're featuring such ``Darkness''
tunes as the title track, ``Badlands,'' and ``The Promised Land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought when I wrote those songs that they'd be interesting
to sing 20 years later. I really wondered what it would be like,''
said Springsteen. ``And now, they're a large part of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   While known as his own harshest critic, Springsteen admitted
that he's pleased with his performance so far. ``I think there's
more subtlety in my voice now,'' he said, crediting his solo tour
in 1996 (for ``The Ghost of Tom Joad'' CD) for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I still have the falsetto in my voice. Why it's still
there is a mystery. Usually, I lose it because I'm singing so hard.
But I think I've learned to sing better. I have more vocal range,
and I'm really happy with that.''

A HAUNTING NOVEL _ AND A FLIGHT FROM THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE LAST LIFE 
By Claire Messud. Harcourt Brace. 352 pp. $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We tend to wear the past lightly in America, flaunting it when
it suits us and discarding it at the first sign of weight or
trouble. This gauzy memory is part of the American contract, or at
least its nebulous promise: The chains of history, having brought
so many to these shores, can always be cast off in the name of
becoming someone else. A lot of this is delusional poppycock, of
course _ as a society, we are both mired in class and family
origins and mesmerized by them _ but the dream is part of what
grants the American character its peculiar (some would say unreal)
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   One need only eavesdrop on a cafe conversation among European
students in Harvard Square to get a glimpse of an older world view,
where your life is bound inextricably by blood of family and
politics alike. Claire Messud's somber and luminescent novel
sustains this idea, using the hint and lure of America as a
contrasting color in its margins. Unfolding through the memories of
a young French-Algerian woman, Sagesse LaBasse, who has fled her
homeland for the equivocal anonymity of New York, ``The Last Life''
is the story of a family beholden to the past and nearly drowning
in its waves.
</P>
<P>
   This is Messud's second novel; her first, ``When the World Was
Steady,'' was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award. Born in 1966,
she possesses a voice blessed with ruminative depth _ with the
knowledge that no action lives outside of memory, that the imprints
in sand are often more revealing than the step that left them
there. Such a sensibility is usually earned by years alone, and its
defining presence in ``The Last Life'' is what grants the novel its
heft as well as its haunting afterglow.
</P>
<P>
   Sagesse is in her 20s as she begins her story, ensconced in her
bookish lair near Columbia University, looking back on a few
critical years in the LaBasse family when the girl was 15. The clan
was ruled by the seamless tyranny of her grandfather, Jacques, a
self-starting patriarch who managed to build a hotel on the French
shores of the Mediterranean after fleeing Algeria's civil wars.
Nearly three decades later, Sagesse is a teenager hanging out at
the Hotel Bellevue's pool _ a girl who cares mostly about her
year-round bikini line and the boys who admire it. Her father,
Alexandre, is trapped in the shadows of Jacques; heir apparent to
his father's emotional tempests, he is also no match for his
strengths, and so languishes at the hotel waiting for the chance to
run it. His wife, Carol, is a mostly unhappy, displaced American _
a woman, now middle-aged, who fell for the romance of France and
Alex before she was old enough to see beyond their high-gloss
illusions. Her marriage into the LaBasses was cemented by the
births of Sagesse and then a son: Etienne, wonder-child and
tragedy, who, trapped too long in the birth canal, lives his life
in a wheelchair, profoundly mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   With his implicit contracts of duty and mystery, Etienne is in
some ways the emotional center of the family _ all its failings
writ large, all its possibilities for connection manifest in his
touch. Sagesse knows this, and her love for her brother is one of
the cornerstones of the novel. But the LaBasses possess other dark
legacies, less subtle than Etienne but ultimately more dangerous.
Jacques's deterioration is revealed before it is explained:
Infuriated by the gaggle of hotel teenagers who invade his swimming
pool each night, he finally fires a gun into their midst _ wounding
one, terrifying them all, and setting in motion the ruination of
the empire he tried to erect.
</P>
<P>
   LaBasse pere is arrested and eventually tried for his wild
assault, which also serves as a narrative apex from which to
explore the rest of the family's collective saga over the decades _
Jacques's emigration from his beautiful Algeria, on the verge of
upheaval; the journey of Alex as a teenaged boy, fleeing Algiers as
it fell; and bearing the corpse of his beloved grandmother. These
are extraordinary stories in and of themselves, and if they
sometimes feel disjointed within the larger span of the novel, they
also tend to float above it like shooting stars of history.
Sickened by her grandfather's actions, ostracized by her peers,
Sagesse takes brief refuge with her American relatives in New
England _ long enough to taste the sweet amnesia on this side of
the Atlantic, though too transient to escape the grievous sorrows
that await her at home.
</P>
<P>
   And in the future: ``The Last Life'' is a novel that draws its
structural core from time itself: from yesterday and tomorrow and
the stillness of the present, and the innumerable effects of each
upon the other. While this grants the novel some admirable
reflection, it can also overwhelm the here-and-now that any plot
requires with muddy speculation and self-conscious prose. Messud
may be Proustian in her temporal intentions, but some of her
sentences, too, are as long as Algeria's civil wars, and not always
conferred with the magic that made Proust's worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the voice that conveys this sad story _ one of deceits and
regrets, nighttime escapes and transcendent flights _ is remarkably
assured and self-aware. The horrifying indignities to which Etienne
is prone are captured in one breathtakingly awful comment from a
smiling relative: ``How tall _ or long _ or whatever, is he? You do
keep track, I imagine?'' At the other end of the spectrum is
Messud's stunningly apt description of a philosophical landscape
glimpsed by St. Augustine, then Camus, as ``the teetering flail of
the void gaped where God's safe shore had loomed.'' Messud has been
ambitious enough to go after that territory where memory and
history cohabit: where a falling city reflects its populace's
personal anguish, where a girl can see her grandfather on his way
to prison and feel only ``agonizing recognition.'' This complexity
is what lends ``The Last Life'' its fineness of vision and makes
its insights as interior as they are far-flung.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton is in a race against time.
</P>
<P>
   As the sand runs out on his administration, Clinton is
determined to be an activist in his remaining 17 months in office,
particularly because of the year he lost to the Monica S. Lewinsky
scandal and impeachment, friends and observers said.
</P>
<P>
   A confluence of interests has emerged to energize him: His
wife's expected run for the US Senate from New York, his vice
president's race to succeed him, and his own legacy as president,
observers said. His ability to withstand the impeachment and Senate
trial and still lead the United States and NATO to victory in
Kosovo has lifted Clinton's confidence and noticeably lightened his
mood.
</P>
<P>
   The president's closest friends said that while Clinton has
become more reflective and has started to think about his
post-White House future, he remains principally occupied with a
strong finish to his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not playing the Boston Celtics slow-down the 24-second
clock, freeze game,'' said Thomas F. McLarty, Clinton's former
chief of staff and longtime friend from Arkansas. ``He's still
aggressively trying to get points on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the business of governing is on hold. The past
two weeks have been consumed by house hunting in New York and a
languid vacation in Martha's Vineyard. This weekend, the Clintons
are in New York for fund-raising in the Hamptons, then will get in
a few more days of vacation in the state's Finger Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
   But the president intends to pick up the pace when he returns to
Washington in September. Because of the lack of progress on his
agenda in the year of Monica and because of his own relative youth,
Clinton has adopted a strategy different from most two-term
presidents winding up their seventh year, said Stephen Hess, a
presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still thinking as a sixth-year president,'' Hess said.
``He's very anxious to make amends, to catch up in a way that will
correct a legacy that is apt to start, `William J. Clinton, who was
impeached by the House of Representatives but not convicted.'. .
.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Clinton believes he will be vindicated by historians
who will judge that the zeal of Republicans to remove him from
office for lying about an affair with Lewinsky was worse than his
own misdeeds. He and his friends also think he will be remembered
for such things as the drops in crime and welfare rolls, and his
stewardship of a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   But most of those events took shape in Clinton's first term. And
a 1996 poll of historians ranking the quality of presidents put
Clinton in the ``low average'' category, far below the men he
idolizes, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and John
F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton desperately wants to improve his standing, starting with
this year's fight with Congress over using projected budget
surpluses to expand the life of Medicare and Social Security, while
offering targeted tax relief. But the obstacles include not only
GOP opposition, but the preference of some Democrats to keep the
issue alive for next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, said Hess, who has worked for four presidents
beginning with Dwight D. Eisenhower, as a president's term winds
up, ``your relations with Congress, particularly if it's an
opposition Congress, is mostly posturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Slater, Clinton's transportation secretary and a friend
from his Arkansas years, said that is why the next 17 months ``are
so important, and that's why he is redoubling his efforts and
really trying to take full advantage for the American people of the
opportunity that he's been blessed with.''
</P>
<P>
   Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin said Clinton's full-court press
is not without precedent. President Lyndon B. Johnson, succeeded in
getting landmark civil rights legislation through Congress as he
was about to leave office.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of Clinton's key staff members have left or are
looking to leave, and while the rewards and punishments a president
can employ might be less effective now as both parties in Congress
cast their eye toward the elections, Clinton can ``counter that
with extra passion and focus,'' Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What may be possible may be a long shot, but it's worth the
effort,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has begun taking other steps that could influence what
the history books say. For example, he has resumed regular news
conferences, and in recent months he has been having dinner with
small groups of reporters who regularly cover the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He took an antipoverty tour that took him to Appalachia, a South
Dakota Indian reservation, and South Central Los Angeles, among
other impoverished areas, where he called on businesses to invest
in untapped markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a year and a half left on my term and, yet, I'm
thinking more about the long term than I did even when I got
here.'' Clinton said earlier this month at a Democratic fund-raiser
at the Washington home of Senator John F. Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now in a position to think about the long term and
about how we can do more than just make the country work . . . how
we can secure a framework for opportunity for America, for a
greater social justice, for a greater good at home and around the
world than ever before,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   McLarty, who has had several conversations with Clinton about
his plans, said: ``I think he's obviously beginning to think about
what he's going to do after the presidency. But he is so
superstitious, and he's frankly so committed to the job, that he's
only beginning to formulate that in a general way.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Clinton planned to write his memoirs and work on
his library and his golf game, at least for his first two
post-White House years.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said he envisioned Clinton using his
popularity abroad to promote human rights and international
relations. ``And then he could spend the rest of his time driving
Miss Hillary,'' quipped Jackson, referring to the first lady's
interest in becoming a US senator.
</P>
<P>
   Other friends said they would not be surprised if Clinton turned
to lecturing and teaching at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Rutherford, president of the William J. Clinton
Presidential Foundation, which raises money for the library to be
built in Little Rock, said Clinton plans to use the library to
focus on race relations in America and on international issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he leaves the presidency, he will be 54 years old. He
will be the youngest ex-president since Teddy Roosevelt,''
Rutherford said. ``He's been to the mountaintop twice in his
career.''
</P>
<P>
   From that perspective, Rutherford said, if Clinton accomplishes
nothing else at the White House, ``there has got to be a great
sense of personal fulfillment, not withstanding the obstacles, the
setbacks, the shortcomings of any president.'' And that, he said,
accounts for the president's livelier mood.

<TEXT>
<P>
   !! 1/2 ``Better Than Chocolate'' This nugget is a low-budget
little charmer. Set in Vancouver's lesbian community, it is a
coming-of-age story about a law school droput turned artist trying
to explain why she's a lesbian to her straight mother. (Unrated)
(Jim Sullivan) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``In Too Deep'' This story about an undercover cop trying to
bring down a drug lord sidesteps the usual cliches of the usually
dumbed-down genre by sidestepping stereotype and allowing
psychological complexity. Omar Epps is dynamic and affecting as the
cop who finds himself conflicted as well as stressed, and LL Cool J
proves he's as much an actor as a rapper by not only keeping the
vicious drug lord in the human race, but giving him a couple of
seductively charming traits. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! 1/2 ``The Muse'' Albert Brooks at his best in a wickedly funny
satire of Hollywood craziness and its need to believe in magic.
Brooks plays a just-fired screenwriter who, needing a quick career
fix, hires a high-maintenance muse, played by Sharon Stone with
high style and a flair for insouciant comedy. Brooks's writer
scores with amusingly cranky asides and responses to being royally
dissed. Cameos by Martin Scorsese and James Cameron add to the fun.
(PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``The 13th Warrior'' Sword-happy 10th century multiculturalism
adds up to a lot of epic nothingness as Moslem diplomat Antonio
Banderas joins a gang of Norsemen fighting off flesh-eating
savages. Between his brain and their brawn, they get the job done,
but apart from a lot of enthusiastic and gory whacking, the film
has little to recommend it except atmosphere and imposing Vancouver
Island locations standing in for the gloomy Scandinavian forest.

REMEMBER TO FIGURE EFFECTS OF INFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 43 and my husband is 63. Our combined income is well
over $200,000 yearly. We have the following assets: $275,000 in
Fidelity Blue Chip Growth fund, $155,000 in a Fidelity money market
IRA account, $65,000 in a Putnam Growth Fund IRA, $30,000 in a T.
Rowe Price Money Market account, $10,000 in a CD, and $20,000 in a
bank savings account. Our yearly goal is to purchase $43,000 worth
of shares in Fidelity Blue Chip, contribute $4,000 to the money
market IRA accounts, and to add $3,000 to the taxable money market
fund. My husband will receive a $12,000 annual pension and
approximately $14,000 from Social Security. If we retire in six
years, what kind of income stream might we expect?
</P>
<P>
   C.H., Orange, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In the end the answer is largely up to you. Using an estimate
of 8 percent average annual portfolio growth, you would accumulate
a total of $1,252,947 over the next six years if you continue the
savings program you outline.
</P>
<P>
   If that entire amount were then invested in a fixed-income
portfolio that produced an average yield of 6.5 percent, its yield
would combine with the pension and Social Security to give you a
$107,441 annual income stream.
</P>
<P>
   But even though your husband will be 69 at that time, you will
be only 49, and you should anticipate many years of retirement. For
that reason, you also should be worrying about the effects of many
years of inflation on your savings.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, it would be more prudent to leave a good
chunk of the portfolio in growth instruments such as the Fidelity
Blue Chip Growth and the Putnam Growth funds.
</P>
<P>
   I'd put about $850,000 in fixed-income holdings designed to
produce your income stream, leaving the balance of $402,947
invested for capital appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   If you did that, using the same assumptions, you would have an
annual income of $55,250 from your fixed-income portfolio, and a
total of $81,250 when the pension and Social Security are counted
in.
</P>
<P>
   You could, of course, establish any level for the growth segment
of the portfolio after retirement, but as I said, given your
relative youth, it should probably be fairly sizable.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to approach this problem _ a more dangerous one, in
my opinion _ is to look at the beginning balance, calculate a
maximum expected lifespan, and then calculate how much money you
might be able to withdraw monthly so that the balance would be
depleted at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you estimated a 40-year withdrawal period and
presumed average portfolio earnings of 7.5 percent, you could
withdraw $8,015 a month, or $96,180 a year. With the pension and
Social Security added in, the income stream would be $122,180 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Why did I say this method is dangerous? Well, one factor is
inflation. It's certain that what $122,180 a year buys in the year
2005 will be a great deal more than what the same amount will buy
in the last year, 2045.
</P>
<P>
   The second factor is that, when you establish a set period of
time and deplete your funds over that period, you put yourself in
the morbid position of betting that you will die before the period
is up. In the example I chose, you would have to dread the prospect
of your 89th birthday, because that's about the time your financial
well would run dry, even if you happened to be in splendid health.
</P>
<P>
   In the You-Didn't-Ask-But Department, I think you should
diversify the stock side of your portfolio. Both of your funds are
in the same sector _ large-cap domestic growth stocks. Since the
lion's share of this money is in a taxable account, I wouldn't sell
as a means of diversifying, but I would use your substantial
ongoing contributions to the savings plan to diversify _ buying a
value-oriented large-cap fund, a mid-cap fund, a small-cap fund, an
international fund, and a health care fund.
</P>
<P>
   A more broadly allocated stock portfolio would enhance your
chances of attaining the growth level I projected at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The company I work for has increased the number of options
into which I can invest my 401(k) money from 10 to 23 funds. My
problem is that with so many funds, I'm unsure where to invest. I
want to diversify without being redundant. I now have $45,000 in
the account, with $2,000 to $6,000 in each of these funds: Fidelity
Equity Income II, Fidelity Equity Portfolio Growth, Fidelity Growth
Opportunities, Fidelity Magellan, Invesco Small Company Growth,
Janus, Janus Worldwide, Twentieth Century Ultra, Vanguard Growth
and Income, and Vanguard Wellington. The new options are these:
Cigna Lifetime funds (five separate offerings), Charter Guaranteed
Income fund, Charter Corporate Bond fund, Charter High-Yield Bond
fund, Charter Large Company Stock Index, Charter Large Company
Stock Growth, Charter Large Company Stock Value, Lazard
International Equity, and Warburg International Equity. I am 29 and
newly married. My current salary is $62,000 and I invest 10 percent
in the 401(k) with 3 percent matched by my company as well as
yearly profit sharing, which this year will amount to 2 percent. I
consider myself an aggressive investor and anticipate retirement in
25 to 30 years. Or when I can afford it. Where should I focus my
401(k)?
</P>
<P>
   G.B., Lehighton, Pa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Just as important as which of the new selection of funds you
might chose is which of the current holdings you should get rid of.
Building a properly balanced portfolio isn't like baseball _ you
don't have to touch every base.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new offerings and a few of the funds you hold are
designed for people much older than you, those who are nearing
retirement and want to reduce their risk exposure as the time when
they will need the money gets closer.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason I would begin by jettisoning Vanguard
Wellington. It's an excellent balanced fund, but you are about 20
years away from the time you might want to look there.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I'd cut Janus Worldwide loose as well, not because it's
not a solid fund, but because you'd be better served by getting
your international exposure in an all-international fund, rather
than a world fund such as Janus Worldwide, which holds more than a
third of its assets in large-cap US stocks. I suggest you select
Lazard International Equity from the new list to represent your
international exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Third, I would select among Fidelity Equity Income II, Vanguard
Growth and Income, and the new fund you identify as Charter Large
Company Stock Value. (The latter isn't a publicly offered fund,
although it may share management and largely duplicate the results
of one; many 401(k) offerings devise new names for their menu
options, which sometimes mean they are funds that are particular to
the manager of the 401(k), and sometimes are simply variant
identifications of public funds.) My guess is that Vanguard Growth
and Income will end up showing the best long-term results in the
large-cap value arena.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, you'll want to compare the results of Invesco Small
Company Growth with the Charter Small Company Value Stock offering
and decide which is the better prospect. If the results show that
the value-oriented fund has been only slightly better than the
Invesco offering in recent years, I'd stick with Invesco, since the
results are probably more a function of the current small-cap
malaise than the virtues of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'd assess the various large-cap growth offerings,
limiting the selection to no more than three, consisting perhaps of
one in the large-cap growth sector and a couple in the sector
representing a blend of growth and value issues. If the Charter
Large Company Stock Index is a Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fund, I'd put
25 percent of the entire portfolio there.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I'd design the portfolio so that 60 percent of the
money and ongoing contributions are in large-cap domestic stock
funds, and 20 percent each in small-cap and international funds.
</P>
<P>
   If in the future a mid-cap and a health care sector fund become
available, I would cut the large-cap position to 50 percent and put
12 1/2 percent each in mid-cap, small-cap, international, and
health care offerings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm 63 and in the process of selling my winter home. What
should I do with the money?
</P>
<P>
   P.G., Gloucester, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. To give you advice, I need to know something of your overall
situation, needs, and desires. Write again with more detail and
I'll try to help.
</P>
<P>
   I don't answer this in the paper to frustrate you, but because I
get many letters which are unanswerable because of inadequate
information.

END-OF-CENTURY ISSUES HAVE A FAMILIAR RING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the century ends, there is much concern about the state of
the nation. Citizens fear violent crime and seem overwhelmed at the
abundance of guns and drugs. Scholars and journalists worry about
public apathy. We argue over whether America should deal with
China, how many more immigrants we can absorb, and if we can
protect our environment.
</P>
<P>
   It is 1999, and it was also 1899, and though it would be too
simplistic to suggest that nothing has changed, it is either ironic
or reassuring to note that human nature does not radically alter
itself in a mere century.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the economy is fueled not only by high technology,
information systems, international investment, and the lucrative
entertainment industry. Its engine runs also on organized crime,
the ethnic and racial diversity of which would satisfy the most
aggressive of affirmative action proponents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1899, Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, and their Wild Bunch
gang robbed a Union Pacific train of $60,000 near Wilcox Station,
Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Ignazio Saietta, a Sicilian mafioso, arrived in
New York and organized an extortion outfit called The Black Hand.
He and his pals would terrorize their Italian immigrant neighbors
for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Monk Eastman, born Edward Osterman, a Jew, had a gang
of about 1,200 members in New York City's Lower East Side. They
were very entrepreneurial. If you wanted a person's ear chewed off,
they would charge you $15. It cost $100 or more to eliminate the
whole person.
</P>
<P>
   Eastman, a brutish man, was also a sophisticated criminal. He
understood the connections between the underworld and the political
world and pledged his loyalty to Tammany Hall, long a target of
``reformers,'' who blamed clubhouse politics for the ills of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Today, ``reformers'' bemoan the high cost of political campaigns
and the influence of money and special interests on candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, ``reformers'' agonized over the influence of
corporate wealth and the existence of political machines in both
major parties.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Irish political bosses were doing well by doing good.
In Philadelphia, a Republican machine was so strong that a reform
organization did not even bother to oppose the machine's
candidates. Why even that ``reformer,'' Teddy Roosevelt, was
alleged to have made deals with the Republican machine in New York
state.
</P>
<P>
   Some idealists got off their duffs and did something. They
started settlement houses for the poor or campaigned for clean
housing and clean elections.
</P>
<P>
   But The Nation magazine warned that America's ``indisposition to
have principles, to stand fast and adhere to them, to meet the
enemy at the gate, and sink or swim, live or die, for what you
believe will be right rather than pleasant, is the curse of the
nation and the great obstacle to reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Author Frederick Lewis Allen would later call it ``a time of
complacency. Since the end of the depression of the mid-'90s, the
voices of protest at the disparities of fortune in the United
States had weakened. Populism was dead; the free-silver agitation
had petered out; the once angry farmers of the Plains States were
making out so well that in 1899 a traveler commented that `every
barn in Kansas and Nebraska has had a new coat of paint.' ''
</P>
<P>
   To the irritation of those who worried about an expansionist
America, Republican Senator Albert Beveridge would soon embark on
one of those famous ``fact-finding'' tours to the Far East. He
would return to tell his colleagues, ``And just beyond the
Philippines, are China's illimitable markets. We will not retreat
from either.''
</P>
<P>
   While anti-imperialists warned their fellow citizens against
expansionism, Secretary of State John Hay was worried that Japan
and the European colonial powers would divide China up so quickly
and efficiently that American business would be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to 1999, as the Clinton administration, business
leaders, and certain economists and scholars argue for continuing
dialogue and trade with a communist China, and a combination of
human rights activists and consesrvatives counter with condemnation
of such rapprochment.
</P>
<P>
   As both sides have at it, Chinese gangsters round up countrymen
who will pay a price to be illegally brought to America, crowd them
into ships, and unload them to disappear into the indentured
servitude of the underbelly of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they engage in this, the poorest of Mexican families
entrust their lives to Mexican criminals to spirit them into the
underbelly of the United States, ironically the land their nation
once claimed as its own, to work at low wages. They're the lucky
ones. Some die in transit.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the ``illegals'' the thousands of legal immigrants from
all over Latin America, Southeast Asia, India, Pakistan, northern
Africa, Nigeria, the Middle East, Russia, and, again, as a century
ago, voices are raised in protest that America can take only so
many, that the nation's bloodlines will somehow be diluted by these
new arrivals. Among those protesting are the grandsons and
granddaughters of the eastern and southern Europeans whose arrival
a century ago convinced ``native'' Americans that the nation was
doomed. It seems to have flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Not all has flourished, however. By 1899, the real ``native''
Americans, the Indians, were no longer a threat to white expansion
within the continent. They had become, at best, objects of
curiosity; at worst, a defeated, demoralized people who had warned,
in their own way, that too much growth, too much ravaging of the
land, would defy the spirits of nature. But, of course, they were
savages. Who listened?
</P>
<P>
   Now, a century later, the new, or, one might say accurately,
renewed, buzzword in political, environmental, and journalistic
circles is ``sprawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in sprawl, there may be what some might consider an element
of justice, however. Foxwoods, in Connecticut, is noted now for
more than its abundant greenery. It is host to a lucrative gambling
casino. The Indians run it.

PEDIGREE CROP; CALMING RAGE; A GUT FEELING

   This is the summer of the heirloom tomato. The phrase crops up
on restaurant menus, in newspapers, and in magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Cute tomatoes for food snobs? Not at all, says Carolyn Male,
author of ``100 Heirloom Tomatoes for the American Garden.'' Some
reviewers of her book have mistakenly thought the word ``heirloom''
implies some sort of snobbery. It's a term used in agriculture and
livestock breeding to indicate plants and animals that pre-date
hybridization.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 10 years, Male has grown and evaluated more than
1,200 heirloom varieties and offered seeds through the Seed Savers
Exchange. She says the best of the heirlooms far exceed hybrids
when it comes to taste. In her book, just published by Workman,
Male writes short histories and descriptions of 100 of her
favorites. The accompanying color photographs, by Frank Ionanotti,
are positively voluptuous.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Male retired from teaching biochemistry to
medical students and moved to Salem, N.Y., ``just over the
mountain'' from Manchester, Vt. Her property used to be owned by
Andy and Martha Stewart, before the divorce. Male, who describes
herself as ``anti-domestic,'' says a friend gave her a plaque to
hang in her new home: ``Martha Stewart Doesn't Live Here _ and It's
a Good Thing.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Traffic calming. Another phrase that seems to be popping up all
over the place. It's an engineering term that originated in Europe
to describe a system of narrowing roads, extending curbs, and
installing speed bumps, rumble strips, and other obstructions to
force drivers to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   When I first saw a sign reading ``Practice Traffic Calming'' on
Route 2, at a spot where four lanes suddenly turn into two, I
assumed it had something to do with road rage. It does, in a way.
Such signs warn motorists to be careful, to slow down and be civil
to other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of traffic calming can lead to road rage,'' said Jay
Scirame, deputy highway commissioner of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, traffic calming has, unfortunately, led to road
rage. In Denver, for example, some drivers were furious at being
forced to put on the brakes when the city experimented with traffic
calming.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge was one of the first local communities to try traffic
calming in certain neighborhoods, including Central Square, where
sidewalks and curbs were widened and pedestrian crossings
installed. You still take your life in your hands every time you
cross Mass. Ave., but traffic calming seems to have made the trip
less of an extreme sport than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a friend told me she had an appointment to see an
intuitive healer. The other day I met a woman who told me she
practices intuitive feng shui. Now here's a book, sent along by a
publicist, ``Practical Intuition,'' by Laura Day (Broadway Books).
It doesn't take intuition to see that intuition is huge this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The shelves of the self-help sections have a dozen or more
intuition-related titles, among them, ``Cracking the Intuition
Code,'' by Gail Ferguson; ``Ignite Your Intuition,'' by Craig
Karges; and my favorite title on the subject, ``You Already Know
What to Do,'' by Sharon Franquemont. So why do I need this book?
Day's ``Practical Intuition'' and her ``Practical Intuition for
Success'' are the bestsellers on the subject, in part because Demi
Moore is an outspoken Day disciple. She provides a glowing
introduction for the first book, in which she credits Day with
helping her choose the right roles. My intuition tells me it's time
Demi went back for a tuneup.

DIVIDED CITY, EIFFEL TOWER REPLICA AMONG RED RIVER DRAWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Photos available on NYT database) 
 
By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You gotta have a gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   That was the advice given to a young Gypsy Rose Lee by Electra
and the other strippers in the popular musical ``Gypsy.''
</P>
<P>
   And those words ring true for tourist-hungry towns as well as
entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   On a tour of the Red River Valley, several Texas cities touted
attractions too appealing to pass up:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Texarkana, the state line separating Texas and Arkansas
runs directly through the center of downtown. The city's split
personality requires two of nearly everything: two mayors, two city
governments, two police departments, two fire departments. ...
Well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The twin cities do share two entities: the State Line Post
Office and the Bi-State Justice Center.
</P>
<P>
   The State Line Post Office straddles State Line Avenue, meaning
that offices on the west side of the building are in Texas and
offices on the right side are in Arkansas. In front of the building
is a specially constructed island designed solely for visitors who
want to stand in two states at once for that Kodak moment.
</P>
<P>
   A more unusual situation is found at the Bi-State Justice
Center, also on State Line Avenue. Inside the building are judicial
and law offices serving two states, two cities and two counties.
</P>
<P>
   It took special legislation in both states for the concept to
work, making it possible for a Texas judge to preside over a
courtroom that is physically in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Taking its cue from that European city on the Seine, the Texas
town of Paris boasts its own Eiffel Tower. Constructed by union
workers with donated materials, the tower debuted five years ago
and enjoys a spot overlooking the city's civic center.
</P>
<P>
   At about 65 feet in height, the Red River valley version isn't
as imposing as France's famous 900-foot structure. But the Paris,
Texas, landmark has a special feature: Last year, the town topped
its Eiffel Tower with a huge red cowboy hat.
</P>
<P>
   To which we say, ``oui, oui.''
</P>
<P>
   _ No one is ever going to confuse Muenster with Fredericksburg.
With 100 shops and 300 bed and breakfasts, Fredericksburg in the
Hill Country isn't likely to lose the title of most touristy
Teutonic-tinged Texas city.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK. Muenster's German heritage is not in question. The
town was founded in 1889 by two brothers, Carl and Emil Flusche.
Today, it counts about 1,500 citizens, and 90 percent are
descendants of the first German Catholic settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Each April, the city celebrates its roots with Germanfest, a
three-day event that features a bike rally, fun run, arm wrestling
contest, sausage cook-off, live music, dancing, arts and crafts and
other family entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   During the rest of the year, visitors can get a taste of
Germany. Fischer's Market, a large grocery store/butcher shop, has
been operating since 1927. Cases of smoked sausages and cheese
entice shoppers and picnickers. Or make Bayer's Kolonialwaren your
stop for apple strudel or sweets.
</P>
<P>
   The city also has two dining rooms: The Center Restaurant and
Rohmer's. We prefer the latter, which has served German and other
homestyle fare in unpretentious quarters for more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Just two days after we rumbled through Nocona, this little
town got some disturbing news. About 160 workers at the local boot
factory would be losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Nocona, named for an Indian chief, was losing the
factory that put it on the map. The downturn in the Western fashion
industry is forcing Justin Industries to close two Texas factories
_ the Nocona plant and one in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Although the closure means Nocona loses its largest employer,
the boot company that was founded here still will have a presence.
The Nocona Boot Factory Outlet, located adjacent to the factory, is
as good a reason as any to slow down on U.S. 82.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you are looking for that first pair of cowboy boots or a
baseball glove your teammates will envy, the factory store's staff
is helpful, friendly and knows good leather when they see it.
</P>

GOING WITH THE FLOW IN THE RED RIVER VALLEY

<P>
   Forget Wal-Mart, strip shopping centers and malls.
</P>
<P>
   In the small communities of the Red River Valley, which hugs the
Texas-Oklahoma border, the place to be is downtown, where historic
commercial districts lure tourists and residents with an agreeable
mix of shopping, history and nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   In county seats such as Bonham and Gainesville, central town
squares are dominated by courthouses. These were among the first
structures built in Texas' fledgling counties. Around them,
commerce thrived: Cotton was bought and sold, household necessities
were acquired in shops that fronted the square, and any leftover
cash was entrusted to the corner bank.
</P>
<P>
   In other towns, Main Street was just that. Whether the route of
a stagecoach line or the site of a train depot, Main Street
attracted traffic, and traffic attracted business.
</P>
<P>
   Skinny and unruly, U.S. 82 lolls across the copper-colored earth
of the Red River Valley, linking cities from Henrietta to Paris. On
stretches where battered sedans and shiny pickups disregard the
generous speed limit, drivers here follow the custom of pulling off
to the shoulder to let the faster fellow pass.
</P>
<P>
   That's just the way a visitor should tour Texas' small towns:
slowing down at the first glimpse of a water tower, pulling over
for a historic marker or pausing for the daily special at a local
lunch spot. These tasty bits of history and color can't be gleaned
from the interstate or gathered from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They must be taken in small-town bites.
</P>

PARIS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The prettiest square in the Red River Valley may belong to
Paris, where an ornate fountain is the centerpiece of the historic
business district. The Culbertson Fountain was constructed in 1927
after a 1916 fire had destroyed most of a town center dating to the
mid-1840s.
</P>
<P>
   Today the square is home to five antiques dealers, dueling
optical companies, four boutiques, a tux shop, a sporting-goods
store, an art gallery, a bank, the Paris Community Theater and a
blue-eyed, bobtail stray that accompanied us on our stroll.
</P>
<P>
   The Lamar County Courthouse is on Lamar Street, a few blocks
from the square, and is worth a stop. The imposing
marble-and-granite structure was built in 1917 in the Classical
Revival style.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BONHAM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An ``I Believe in Bonham'' sticker decorates the front door of
Bewley's 5 &AMP; 10, one of dozens of businesses on Bonham's town
square. The old-timey five-and-dime sells everything from washtubs
to fake floral arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Its neighbors on the square include a chiropractor, four law
offices, two medical-supply stores, a jewelry shop, a bank, a
travel agency and Pizza Plaza. Although several empty storefronts
detract from the scene, the square is a treat, with signs recalling
past glories and stories.
</P>
<P>
   At the center is the rather drab Fannin County Courthouse. The
original courthouse, built in 1888, was more elaborate and
better-suited to being the focal point of town. But a fire
destroyed its decorative roof and steeple in 1929. A modernization
in 1965 incorporated parts of the 1888 structure. Check out
photographs of the original courthouse and its pretty grounds at
the Fannin County Museum of History, a few blocks away in the
restored 1900 Texas and Pacific Railway Depot.
</P>
<P>
   One of the oldest towns in Red River Valley, Bonham was founded
in 1837. The city was named for James Butler Bonham, who carried
news of the siege of the Alamo to James Fannin, then returned to
San Antonio to die with the defenders of the now-famous mission.
</P>
<P>
   A statue of Bonham decorates the courthouse grounds, which have
been nearly completely paved for parking. Also on the grounds is a
Confederate memorial.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SHERMAN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sherman's town square is more inviting, welcoming visitors with
benches and large shade trees. The lawns of the Grayson County
Courthouse are peppered with monuments, markers and other mementos.
</P>
<P>
   A Confederate memorial was erected in 1896. Other markers honor
the Ninth Texas Calvary and recall the history of Grayson County.
One marker recounts a 1905 visit by Theodore Roosevelt, who was on
his way to a Rough Rider reunion in San Antonio; more than 35,000
people turned out to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Two time capsules are buried in the courthouse lawn. One was
placed there on July 4, 1976, to mark America's 200th birthday; the
other was buried in 1986 to mark the county's sesquicentennial.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete-and-limestone courthouse was built in 1936 in the
style of Stripped Classicism. A thriving business district,
dominated by law offices and a large furniture store, envelopes the
structure.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, free weekly concerts are given on the square.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GAINESVILLE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bustle of Gainesville's town square may be due to its
proximity to I-35. While thoroughfares have bypassed the historic
business districts of many Texas small towns, here the freeway runs
close enough for drivers to see the Beaux Arts dome of the Cooke
County Courthouse.

THE INSIDE STORY ON `OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Corrente picked up a novel by an unknown
author named Peter Farrelly in 1988 at a yard sale in Easthampton,
N.Y., where Corrente was living. The novel was called ``Outside
Providence.'' It cost him a dollar. ``I figured, a buck, how bad
could it be?'' Corrente says, in an office at a Manhattan hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It resonated, big time. ``I fell in love with it,'' he says. The
novel, dealing with teenagers growing up in working-class
Pawtucket, R.I. during 1974, brought back feelings Corrente, now
40, had back then, when he grew up in a similar environment in that
Rhode Island city.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years later, ``Outside Providence,'' out Wednesday, is a
movie directed by Corrente, and co-produced by two Duxbury, Mass.
brothers named Farrelly _ that same Peter and his younger sibling
Bobby, now rather famous for making ``There's Something About
Mary'' and ``Dumb and Dumber.'' They co-wrote the script with
Corrente.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story is more my life than it is Peter's,'' says
Corrente, ``which is another reason people wanted me to do the
movie. I really have to tell you that most people between New York
and LA know that guy, they know that house, that lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great foundation, which was Peter's novel,'' adds
Corrente. The Farrellys, he says, grew up somewhat privileged, sons
of a doctor in an upper-middle-class family. ``We were less
fortunate.'' The book was ``a great blueprint. It's not like we
were creating any of this stuff. We got to add and fill in stuff
from our own personal lives. Movies work when they work.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his own upbringing, Corrente says his father was illiterate,
but a film buff. Michael, one of six children, used to see foreign
movies with his dad, and he'd have to read him the subtitles. That,
Corrente says, was his version of going to film school. First film
that floored him: ``The Bicycle Thief.''
</P>
<P>
   As ``Outside Providence'' begins, you meet Dunph, an affable,
but semi-dim, pot-smoking teenager played by Shawn Hatosy. Dunph
has a paper route that is a collaborative effort with his younger
brother Jackie, who is in a wheelchair. Dunph drives with his
brother's chair roped to his truck, and Jackie hurls the papers at
his customers' houses. Trailing on a leash is their smelly,
three-legged, one-eyed mutt named Clops, whom their embittered
widowed father (Alec Baldwin) won't even let in the house. His
father has nicknamed Dunph, whose name is Timothy Dunphy, Dildo,
and relishes calling him that in public.
</P>
<P>
   Dunph hangs out with three low-wattage, no-ambition pals,
nicknamed Tommy the Wire, Decenz, and Drugs. It is not a life of
much promise.
</P>
<P>
   It is one, however, that changes for the better because of
Dunph's stupidity. While stoned, he crashes the family car and, as
things could happen in those days, a friendly judge ``punishes''
him by enrolling him in a tony Connecticut prep school. There, his
dumbness _ he thinks Arizona is an ocean state _ slowly dissipates
and a certain studiousness and self-awareness take over. Plus, he
falls in love with a preppy girl named Jane Weston, played by Amy
Smart. A window to another world is opened. And then, maybe,
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside Providence,'' which began shooting early last year and
was made entirely in Rhode Island, is not a movie of simple yuks or
of lesson-learned poignancy. Yet in the Farrellys' world of sex,
silliness, and slapstick this might qualify as an almost subtle
picture. It is a movie of ambiguity, with situations that teeter
between funny and pathetic, grim and riotous.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, might be seem something of an anomaly in a teen
film market predicated on the idea of high concept. (You should
ignore the implication of the ad's limerick, which runs ``There
Once Was a Boy From Pawtucket . . .''; there's no ``hair gel'' kind
of vibe here. ) The makers of ``Outside Providence'' are taking the
risk that viewers can handle the juxtaposition of tone.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Graduate' was funny and it was serious,'' says Corrente.
``There are a lot of good movies that had elements of both in it.
`Good Will Hunting' was very funny at times and very serious at
times. . . . This is about some blue-collar people in a tough
neighborhood with the inability to express how they feel.
Ultimately, they figure a way out.'' Well, some do.
</P>
<P>
   The serious bent is due, it would appear, to the efforts of
Corrente, who is known for gritty films such as ``American
Buffalo'' and ``Federal Hill,'' art-film-circuit pictures. He says,
with a laugh, that the $7.5 million budget of ``Outside
Providence'' is a big picture _ ``It's actually going to end up in
more than 50 theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the money was spent on the production, the look. ``It
wasn't on the talent. It was a period piece and all the cars, all
the clothes, you have to be careful where you put the camera.'' The
money, incidentally, was raised by soliciting Rhode Island business
people, who put up the cash against the film's future earnings.
Corrente says virtually every studio passed on it, this, of course,
being before the Farrellys got hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard every excuse,'' says Corrente. `` `It's too funny';
`It's not funny enough.' . . . I would love to be in a position to
go back now after `There's Something About Mary' grossed what it
grossed.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrente's young stars _ Hatosy and Smart are both 23 _ are
aware of the boom in teen-oriented movies. ``Kids go and see these
kind of movies,'' says Hatosy, who is from the Baltimore area.
``Any movie, really.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeals to a lot of different age groups,'' adds Smart, who
hails from Laurel Canyon, Calif. ``Teenagers, people that lived
through the '70s. I don't think (the teen movie boom) will last
forever, but this is definitely a time when they are doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrente added one disturbing scene, based on his own
experiences, a flashback scenario about Dunph's mother shooting out
Christmas lights with a popgun. ``That scared Peter, he didn't like
it. But for me, it's the only pleasant moment (Dunph) remembers
with his mom and dad and brother, even if it's a little twisted.
It's enough to let you know things are a little crazy here.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrente and company get the details right, from the scruffy
garb worn by the actors to the rock music played to the locals'
beer: Narragansett and Old Milwaukee. The soundtrack _ with hits
from Wings, the Eagles, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and others _ is impressive,
not just for its representation of the era, but for the fact that
heavyweights like Paul McCartney signed on.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney, says Corrente, liked the movie and sold them the song
for, well, a song. ``He said, `I know you don't have a lot of
money, but here is a number we can live with,' '' recalls Corrente,
who figures his picture received ``favored nation's status'' from
Big Mac. The other rockers agreed to low figures, saying, ``Well,
as long as no one is making more money than we are . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Hatosy says he was initially stymied by the Rhode Island accent
and needed a dialect coach. Corrrente told him just to hang out
with him and the Farrellys and in a month ``you won't be able to
stop talking like this.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the characters' look, Corrente says he told the costumers,
``I don't want to get caught looking at a costume. Give me a pair
of ratty jeans and a T-shirt and an Army jacket _ not a new one.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Negative role models &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dunph's dad and his male buddies, one of whom is played by
George Wendt (Norm from ``Cheers''), play poker and drink beer
around the Dunphy kitchen table for most of the movie. Clearly,
their dead-end routines and casual bickering are what could lie
ahead for Dunph and his pals.
</P>
<P>
   Corrente is unflinching about the kids' use of marijuana. It is
part of the fabric of their lives, for better or worse. The movie
doesn't tell an audience drugs rule; neither does it say they
necessarily kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the characters does pay a pretty price for what
happens,'' Corrente says, ``but if you were alive in 1974 and went
to a concert, there were at least 15,000 joints floating around.
The way I make movies is I want the ability to tell a story the way
that I remember it and not sit back and say, `Is the studio going
to let me?' That's what was going on; I didn't overdo it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatosy's character is one of those who preside over a makeshift
memorial to a late friend. They toss an Allman Brothers Band album
on the fire, a pack of rolling papers, a bottle of booze. ``I guess
that's when he finally makes that change,'' says Hatosy of Dunph.
``He realizes these characters are such knuckleheads and that `I
don't have to end up playing cards with these guys 20 years from
now, like my old man does.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside Providence'' easily earned its R rating because of
frequent cursing _ not quite ``Scarface'' but not ``The Brady
Bunch'' either _ and portrayals of drug use. Does Corrente worry
that might shut out the core audience?
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is, the best way to get teenagers into
a movie is to tell them they can't go.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Outside Providence'' does not go anywhere near the
explicitness of, say, ``American Pie'' when it comes to sexuality.
Given the R, why didn't he go further when it came to that aspect?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a big sexual-content guy. For me, it's either sell me
triple-X-rated pornography or shut the door with your foot on the
way into the bedroom. Anything in between is embarrassing and
awkward. I don't want to see kids going at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this picture will do well,'' Corrente says, ``because
I think it delivers on a lot of levels that a lot of teen pictures
are not delivering. A lot of pictures are made because somebody
thinks teen movies are making money, so they put 115 pages of stuff
together that gives you a reason to put teenagers in a movie, but
they forget to put a heart and soul in the story.''

UNDATED: Cooke County Courthouse.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The courthouse, a concrete-and-stone structure built for
$150,000 in 1911, is the fourth on this site. The first courthouse,
a log cabin, was built in 1850, two years after the county was
created. Cooke County takes its name from Capt. William Cooke, a
hero of the Battle of San Jacinto.
</P>
<P>
   On the grounds are monuments to World War II and Confederate
veterans. The clocks that adorn the copper dome of the courthouse
were added in 1920 as a World War I memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The streets facing the courthouse are pedestrian-friendly.
Shoppers have a choice of several antiques malls, a couple of gift
shops, a jeweler, a gallery, a JCPenney catalog store and more. But
it wasn't always bustling.
</P>
<P>
   Like many small-town commercial districts, Gainesville's
downtown struggled for survival. When Joe Albro opened his Carousel
Antiques Mall in 1991, more than 65 percent of the storefronts on
the square were empty. Today, Albro says, ``You can't rent a
building downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Albro's antiques mall is housed in a former hardware store;
across the street, past the courthouse, is his wife's Shady Oak
Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Albro, who owned an insurance company for 28 years, says the
nearby interstate has aided downtown's revival; about 95 percent of
shoppers are from out of town.
</P>
<P>
   One place that draws both locals and visitors downtown is the
Fried Pie Co., a laid-back diner that serves home-style meals
topped off with pies filled with apricots, apple or chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Just a block off the square is the Morton County Museum, a small
historical museum with changing exhibits and a fine collection of
stained glass. Ask for a brochure detailing a self-guided tour that
points out some of the 30 Victorian homes nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Not too far from the square is the Santa Fe Passenger Depot, a
small 1901 Mission Revival railroad station that is being
renovated. Rail service, discontinued two decades ago, was recently
restored with Amtrak service that runs between Oklahoma City and
Fort Worth. The train pauses at several small Oklahoma towns, and
the Gainesville stop _ the only stop in Texas besides Fort Worth _
is popular with shoppers drawn to Gainesville's many antiques shops
and its large outlet mall.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DENISON &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Denison has no main square, but it certainly has a thriving
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alive and well'' is how Gary Sewell, owner of the Blue Moon
Antiques Mall, describes Denison's historic commercial district.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two Wal-Marts within seven miles of downtown, and
we're still lucrative,'' Sewell says.
</P>
<P>
   This border city was established in September 1872 to
accommodate the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad, commonly
called the MK&AMP;T or the Katy. Within 100 days of its founding,
Denison boasted 3,000 citizens. According to historians, every
third building under construction was a saloon.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the city's first buildings still survive and are among
the more than 130 structures in the city's historic commercial
district. One of the earliest predates the town's founding. The
J.K. Miller House, built in 1866, served as a stop for the
Butterfield Stagecoach.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent building in the historic district is the Katy
Depot. The Beaux Arts depot cost $250,000 to build in 1909, but
that was appropriate for a station that at one time disembarked
more than 50 passenger trains per day.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching like a ribbon from the Katy Depot, Main Street is
home to a diverse collection of businesses that include a winery, a
bow (as in arrows) shop and galleries with cute names such as the
Little Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   Sewell's Blue Moon Antiques Mall also is on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough art galleries, antique malls and
bed-and-breakfasts to keep visitors busy for two days,'' Sewell
says, adding that many weekenders from Dallas and Fort Worth know
Denison as well as the locals.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Main Street is the 1920 Rialto Theater, one of several
downtown movie houses that entertained Denison residents and
visitors during the town's boom days. The 900-seat Rialto's claim
to fame was a visit by Montgomery Clift, who came to town for the
1948 world premiere of his film ``Red River,'' co-starring John
Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   Denison's only theater, the Rialto is enjoying a renaissance.
Main Street Country Showcase presents Branson-style entertainment
to standing-room-only crowds each Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, downtown is the place to be.

CONVICTED MURDERER'S FATE RIDES ON DNA TEST 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERIDAN, Ore. _ Jeffrey MacDonald can barely contain himself.
Moments after he enters a cinder block visiting room at the federal
prison here, the former Green Beret doctor and convicted triple
murderer begins dissecting the long-suppressed evidence he says
proves his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   There is the mystery hair clenched in his slaughtered wife's
hand, the fingernail scrapings from his slain daughters, the black
wool on the club used in the murders, the blond wig hairs, the wax
drippings, the confessions of others, and on and on _ a torrent of
details bouncing off the oddly cheery yellow walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``By keeping the pressure on, and constantly fighting and never
saying die, the truth will come out,'' MacDonald boomed. A prison
official and a guard seated nearby don't even look up; they've
heard it before.
</P>
<P>
   But 29 years after the notorious murders, new hope has emerged
for MacDonald. His Boston-based defense team has persuaded a court
to order DNA tests on 15 key exhibits, primarily hair samples, that
were taken from the crime scene. Most were discovered, long after
his conviction, by MacDonald's defenders poring over prosecutors'
records. The DNA tests are expected to begin within two weeks, and
results are expected by October.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, MacDonald knows he is challenging more
than his 1979 guilty verdicts in the murders of his pregnant wife
and their two daughters. He also is fighting the devastating public
image created by ``Fatal Vision,'' the 1983 bestseller that
portrayed him as a narcissistic hedonist driven mad by domestic
drudgery and diet pills. A television miniseries also made
indelible the impression of a psychotic doctor stabbing and
clubbing his family, then blaming it on drug-crazed hippies.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the DNA tests are MacDonald's last best chance
for freedom and, perhaps, a measure of public redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point somebody is going to have to face the reality,
which is that Jeffrey MacDonald is a crime victim, not a crime
perpetrator,'' said Boston lawyer Andrew Good, who has defended
MacDonald without pay for the past decade along with his partner
Harvey Silverglate, an acquaintance of MacDonald's from Princeton
University, and their associate, Phil Cormier. The team also
includes Barry Scheck, an expert on DNA evidence who helped defend
O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald and his lawyers expect the test results _ barring what
they call an ongoing pattern of government treachery _ will support
MacDonald's claim that murderous strangers, including a woman named
Helena Stoeckley, left behind telltale traces never seen by the
jury that convicted him. And that, they hope, will persuade a court
to allow the introduction of not just the DNA results but also a
broad assortment of other exculpatory evidence they say was
withheld from MacDonald's trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point in 1999 where I am literally at my last
gasp, and it hinges on this sort of magical new three-letter term,
DNA,'' MacDonald said. ``What I hope and pray for is enough
findings on the DNA that the court door gets opened for a hearing.
Then all the evidence that I've been talking about, the stuff that
puts Helena Stoeckley and her crowd in that house, committing those
murders, all comes to light.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hard government line
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials have maintained that MacDonald is a
guilty man properly serving three life terms. Department lawyers
refused to discuss the DNA testing, MacDonald's claims about
Stoeckley, who died in 1983, or allegations of prosecutorial
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department has nothing to say about Jeffrey
MacDonald,'' said spokesman John Russell. Federal attorney Brian
Murtagh, who coprosecuted the case and has spent two decades
defending his work, also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the DNA tests, and ultimately the crux of the case,
is who was present at 544 Castle Drive on the Fort Bragg, N.C.,
Army base in the early morning hours of Feb. 17, 1970.
</P>
<P>
   To the government, the answer is as simple as it is chilling.
From the start, Army investigators and federal prosecutors have
maintained there was clear evidence that MacDonald acted alone,
savagely murdering his wife Colette, 26, and their daughters,
Kimberly, 5, and Kristen, 2.
</P>
<P>
   Either in a failed suicide attempt or merely to deflect blame,
prosecutors said, MacDonald stabbed himself in the side, collapsing
a lung, and inflicted other nonlethal injuries on himself, then
trashed the apartment to make it appear he had battled with
intruders.
</P>
<P>
   The jury agreed, as did millions who read ``Fatal Vision'' by
Joe McGinniss or saw a televison movie based on the book.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, and to this day, MacDonald told a far different
story, no less chilling but more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald said Colette went to sleep before him that night, and
when he joined her he found their daughter, Kristen, already had
crawled in and wet the bed. He said he carried the sleeping toddler
to her bed, then went to the living room and fell asleep on the
sofa. He said he awoke to the screams of his wife and older
daughter and found three men, two white and one black, standing
over him. He rose to fight, but they cut and stabbed him, then beat
him unconscious, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before he blacked out, MacDonald said, he saw a woman wearing
what appeared to be a blond wig and a floppy hat. Carrying a
flickering light, possibly a candle, she chanted, ``Acid is groovy.
Kill the pigs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mystery woman
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later, suspicion would mount among MacDonald's supporters that
the woman was Stoeckley, a drug informant for Army and civilian
authorities who gave several partial confessions, though at other
times said her memory was clouded by drugs. To the day she died,
she was never able to account for her whereabouts at the time of
the murders.

   CHINA-SMUGGLING _ ATLANTA _ Immigrant smuggling from Asia has
become big business in the last 10 years. We've seen recent cases
where Asian women promised a better life were smuggled to USA to
work as prositutes to pay off their debts. And more than 130
Chinese endured weeks at sea in poor conditions to get here. Why do
people pay up to $50,000 - dozens of times their annual income in
China - to endure slave-ship conditions to come here? Do they know
they'll end up in sweatshops, brothel or Chinese restaurants?
(Bixler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30.
</P>
<P>
   w/ASIAN-PROSTITUTES _ ATLANTA _ For five years, four separate
organizations _ one of them a Chinese tong _ ran houses of
prostitution in suburban Atlanta, which they stocked with young
women from Viet Nam, Thailand, Korea, Malaysia and China. The
women, many of them teenagers, were, for all intents and purposes,
slaves. Smuggled into the U.S. for prices between $35,000 and
$40,000 a piece by men known as snakeheads, the women worked for
$100 a customer. Of that money, $30 would go to the brothel where
they were kept under armed guard (often houses or apartments
furnished only with mattresses and condoms). The remainder repaid
the men snakeheads, the jockeys and agents who had smuggled them
into the country and arranged for false identities. Johns were
often recruited from metro Chinese restaurants, including one whose
owner, was prosecuted for organized gambling three years ago and
whose girlfriend is a suspected madam. (McDonald, Atlanta

now at Mercer. (Suggs, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   SCHOOL-CIVILITY _ ATLANTA _ Students, it seems, aren't the only
ones occasionally acting up in Fayette County schools. Adults are
too, school officials say. They're getting too rowdy at sporting
events, yelling during meetings with teachers and even cursing in
classrooms. In hopes of curbing this misbehavior, the district is
drafting a ``civility policy'' outlining what is expected of school
visitors. The policy would not have any teeth _ no punishment faces
parents or others who violate the new code. Fayette Superintendent
John DeCotis said he's hoping that simply spelling out what is
appropriate behavior for visitors should do the trick. (Donsky,

   SCIENCE-MEDICINEAIDS-CONFERENCE _ ATLANTA _ AIDS deaths are
still declining, but far more slowly than they were two years ago,
according to new national data released by the CDC Monday at the

development of HIV drug resistance. (Kim, Atlanta

   TAKE-BOS  
 HERIDAN, Ore.: ... the murders.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Significantly, in the eyes of MacDonald and his defenders,
Stoeckley acknowledged owning a blond wig, which she said she
burned after the murders. Unknown to MacDonald's defense team until
a decade after the trial, investigators had found an unidentified
hairbrush at the murder scene containing blond synthetic wig hairs.
Colette MacDonald did not own such a wig.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the murders, official suspicion fell almost
immediately upon MacDonald, who at the time was an Army captain.
But an Army colonel cleared him after a six-week hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, federal prosecutors picked up the case, and nine
years after the murders, MacDonald was convicted. For the past 20
years, he has been behind bars for all but 18 months, during which
he was freed by a finding that he did not receive a speedy trial;
that ruling was overturned and he was returned to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Now 55, his blond hair has turned a soft gray, his hazel eyes
are clear and lively, and his expressive face is still handsome. He
retains the charisma his critics say accounts for much of his
support. In a different setting, inmate 00131-177 could easily pass
for the distinguished doctor he once was.
</P>
<P>
   He retains a military bearing, accented by a well-pressed khaki
prison uniform. On his feet are Adidas running shoes. Called
``Doc'' by fellow inmates at this campus-like, medium-security
prison 50 miles southwest of Portland, MacDonald has made few
concessions to age, although his slight paunch resists a daily
regimen of running and weight lifting. He also plays first base on
a prison softball team, the Dust Devils.
</P>
<P>
   He wakes daily at 5:20 a.m. in cell 233, which he shares with a
42-year-old robber. He works as an orderly, cleaning the offices of
prison officials for 16 cents an hour. He meditates regularly and
says he still spends an hour or two daily reading medical books and
journals, in the event he is freed and can reclaim his license.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Out of trouble, on the case
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald has a relatively clean prison record, although last
year he spent a month in disciplinary segregation _ ``the hole'' _
for giving medical advice to a fellow inmate.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald says he mostly avoids trouble by following a few
strict rules: no gang ties, no booze, or drugs, no homosexual
liaisons, no unpaid debts, and no holier-than-thou attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Although he keeps himself as busy as a caged life allows, what
occupies him is working on his case. MacDonald has read thousands
of pages of government files and prosecution notes released to him
and volunteer investigators under the Freedom of Information Act,
and he has an encyclopedic memory of the details. The only mistake
he makes is occasionally reversing dates, 1979 for 1997, for
instance, but that is understandable: his life has been on hold all
that time.
</P>
<P>
   What excites MacDonald most is talking in an uninterrupted
stream about dozens of key exhibits and other evidence that, in his
narrative, points unequivocally to other killers. He bolsters his
case with support from a 1995 book, ``Fatal Justice,'' written by
two independent investigators as a compelling repudiation of
``Fatal Vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most explosive evidence not included at the first
trial, MacDonald and his lawyers say, is a short brown hair found
in Colette MacDonald's left hand. The hair was tested against
MacDonald's and found not to be his, but the jury was told it was
too small to test. Now cut into four tiny pieces, it will be
included in the DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald's defenders speculate it might have come from a man
named Greg Mitchell, a boyfriend of Stoeckley's who died in 1982.
After his death, friends came forward to say he had confessed to
the crimes, although Army officials said he had been cleared during
the initial investigation by a polygraph test.
</P>
<P>
   Also intriguing to MacDonald supporters are brown hairs from
different sources found under the fingernails of the two girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, if there is hair and it's not from the family or
me, and it's not from an investigator who was working over that
crime scene, I think the government's case is in serious trouble,''
MacDonald said. ``Believe me, if they had shown in 1970 that brown
hair was mine, it would have been their prime piece of evidence.
When it wasn't mine, they first lost the hair report, then tried to
change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on a ``Top 10'' list of suppressed evidence compiled by
Silverglate are black wool fibers found on the murder club and on
Colette MacDonald's mouth that matched nothing found in the house.
Trial prosecutors characterized the fibers as having come from
MacDonald's pajamas, but that assertion was false, and MacDonald
partisans suggest they came from the real killers.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also found fresh wax drippings, seeming to support
MacDonald's vision of a candle-holding hippie woman, that did not
match any of the candles in the MacDonalds' home. Silverglate and
MacDonald also lament what they call the strange disappearance of a
piece of skin investigators found under his wife's fingernail.
</P>
<P>
   While MacDonald is difficult to stop when talking about the
details of the case, he is reticent about his family, although he
chokes up when reciting their birthdays and sheds tears when
describing his effort to resuscitate his wife. He also cries while
discussing Silverglate's belief in his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My most difficult fight was coming to the conclusion that I
was OK, that somehow the fact that I wasn't able to get off the
couch and defeat the aggressors and save Colette and Kim and Kris,
it doesn't mean that I murdered them, which is what the government
said it means. But it also doesn't mean, as a lot of people
alleged, that I'm a coward.''
</P>
<P>
   If the DNA evidence fails to win MacDonald his freedom, he could
apply for parole, although he has promised himself he won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see going into a parole hearing and somehow feign that
I'm rehabilitated or remorseful for something I didn't do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stay alive, and I'm going to stay in good
shape,'' he said, his eyes wandering toward the barred window
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep fighting my case. The DNA is very, very
important, but if I don't win on DNA this year, I'm going to win on
something else, sometime.''

BRET HELPS THE GULF COAST GET IN SHIPSHAPE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ At his baitshop beneath the John F.
Kennedy Causeway, Wilbert Gohlke and his wife scrubbed out bait
tanks they hope will soon be brimming with shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Gohlke, 70 and a veteran of four decades of wresting a living
from the bays behind Clem's Marina, has a hunch Hurricane Bret did
the Texas coast a favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fishing and shrimping is good after a storm. I think all the
water that comes in from the Gulf of Mexico, it's good. It cleans
out all the dead water,'' said Gohlke.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the state's top marine scientists predict Bret's massive
infusion of freshwater will bring long-term, beneficial effects to
South Texas bay systems normally closed off from freshwater and
saltwater inflows. The flushing of the bays will mean more than
just better sport fishing. Experts say a whole marine ecosystem of
interdependent species, ranging from invisible plankton to ungainly
brown pelicans, will be helped.
</P>
<P>
   And the pesky brown tide, which has plagued Texas bays for
nearly a decade, may have been flushed away.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most dramatic effect of the storm can be seen on
beaches along the Gulf of Mexico. Bret's storm surge carved open 12
new channels through the barrier islands along the Gulf from Port
Isabel to Corpus Christi, allowing huge quantities of fresh sea
water to flood the bays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have a big storm event like this one _ and this
storm Bret went right through the center of the Laguna Madre,
dumped a lot of water, raised the tides to very high levels _ it
has a big effect on the flushing of the Laguna Madre,'' said Ken
Dunton, an associate professor at the University of Texas Marine
Science Institute at Port Aransas.
</P>
<P>
   Dunton, an expert in sea grass and coastal marshes, expects new
and expanded growth of three of the five species of sea grass,
which serve as a nursery for shrimp, crabs and fish. Those grasses
_ shoal grass, manatee grass and wigeon grass _ are also an
important food source for millions of ducks that winter in Texas
bays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term benefits of increased freshwater inflows through
a major event such as a hurricane to Texas estuaries far outweigh
the short-term, negative effects. Long-term, you'll see increased
habitat utilization by commercially important species of finfish
and shellfish,'' including shrimp, blue crabs, trout, redfish and
black drum, Dunton said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the immediate short-term concerns is the heavy runoff
from farm lands, which means increased nitrates that promote algae
blooms such as brown tide. Other concerns are that larval marine
life could have been flushed out of protective bays into the Gulf;
sea grass could be covered in silt in areas near the new channels.
</P>
<P>
   When Bret moved ashore late Sunday, huge quantities of rainwater
were dumped directly into a number of South Texas bays with
relatively high salt levels, rapidly lowering their salinity. As
the storm moved inland, additional freshwater poured into the bays
after draining into creeks, sloughs and rivers that form the
watershed for the lower Laguna Madre, Baffin Bay, the Nueces
estuary _ which includes Corpus Christi Bay, Nueces Bay and Redfish
Bay _ and the Aransas estuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that means is when you flush the system like that, you're
carrying away a lot of material in the Laguna Madre that has been
sitting there decaying for a long time, dead sea grasses and
vegetation that has been rotting, and you're revitalizing the
system,'' said Dunton, who has been studying the bay system for the
last 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're exposing substrates, or (bottom) areas that have not
been exposed for a while, providing perhaps new opportunity for sea
grass growth or growth expansion, through the removal of this dead
and decaying material.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, state wildlife biologists and officials from the
Texas General Land Office were preparing to take aerial photographs
of Gulf beaches where Bret cut a dozen new channels above and below
the Port Mansfield cut, which divides North and South Padre Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hurricane has literally wiped out part of the island,''
Jock Whitworth, superintendent of Padre Island National Seashore,
told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times. ``It's a huge natural
phenomenon. That's what barrier islands do for us is dissipate part
of that energy. It's kind of exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The granite jetty at the Mansfield cut, once accessible by
vehicle from South Padre Island, is now blocked by four wide
channels to the south, said Deputy Land Commissioner Andrew
Neblett. The largest of the new channels is 50 to 60 yards wide and
3 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts expect the channels to be temporary, eventually
silting up and disappearing, some as soon as several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the storm's benefits will take longer to realize,
``something we'll see over the next year or two. You'll see it in
the amount of aquatic life, the vegetation, and the (marine)
creatures you'll see over a period of time,'' Neblett predicts.
</P>
<P>
   UT's Dunton, the sea grass expert, and colleague Paul Montagna
note that it normally can take a year or longer to flush out the
Laguna Madre and Baffin Bay, which have few connections to the Gulf
and limited freshwater flowing into them due to the arid South
Texas climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complete area of Baffin Bay and Laguna Madre, we think it
takes a year to flush naturally. So clearly this big event has a
beneficial effect, flushing it on the order of a couple of days or
a week,'' said Montagna, a research scientist at UT Marine Science
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers believe brown tide has been flushed from a
number of small ``refuge'' bays where plankton has lingered for a
decade. Montagna and other marine scientists began extensive
sampling on Friday in those bays to see if the brown tide remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue to us is the brown tide, which started in 1990
and has persisted,'' Montagna said. ``We had been predicting it
would take a big event like this to flush the system, and we're
hoping that's what happened. We're hoping we won't see brown tide
for many, many more years.''
</P>
<P>
   Montagna also notes that new channels to the Gulf benefit a
number of marine species, including shrimp, which spawn in the
ocean, but whose offspring migrate into the protective bays to
mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``So again, there is a direct oceanic connection which I'm sure
hasn't occurred since Hurricane Allen (in 1980),'' the scientist
said. `` It's good, because almost all the organisms, and many of
the fish and shrimp and crabs in the bay, have an
estuarian-dependent life cycle. They spend their adult lives in the
ocean and their juvenile lives in the bays, so it's really
important they have good ways to get to the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishing guides and outfitters say they already have seen
increased activity in the bays just days after the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get all the new water and oxygen, it really turns the
fish on, and there is more bait for them to eat,'' said Roger Viar,
manager of the Marker 37 Marina on Corpus Christi Bay. ``I don't
know, they get real frisky.''
</P>
<P>
   Viar reported parties taking limits of trout and redfish in
Baffin Bay late last week, which he attributes to a recharge of the
bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings a lot of freshwater with the rain and it drops the
water temperature down, and it's probably down to the low 70s now.
That does a lot of good because it brings your crabs out of hiding
_ your crustaceans and shrimp _ they bury themselves when it gets
hot. It brings in new oxygen for the water, and it helps the grass
... and gets rid of the old stagnant stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In Port Isabel, fishing guide Gilbert Vela said the influx of
fresh sea water through new channels in the island has
traditionally improved the fishing in the landlocked bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a plus, bringing freshwater or getting a cut to
the ocean,'' he said. ``I caught 18 reds (redfish) today out of one
school. We boxed eight, and the rest were oversized and we released
them. So the fish are there.''

MCCAIN IS SCORING POINTS _ AND BUSH IS NOTICING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The person with the best credentials by far for
being The Other Guy doesn't see things that way. ``I don't see
myself as the alternative,'' John McCain was saying the other day
about a certain media phenomenon from Texas. ``If I did, and if my
campaign was built that way, then he would be shaping me. Bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do anything about George Bush. But I can do a lot
about me and my own campaign. I'm still convinced that when more
typical voters start to pay attention to all this in the fall, they
will want to take a look at each of us on our own terms. It would
be a mistake, as well as not me, to just do a positioning act.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Arizona senator hops aboard a bus for four days of
serious immersion in New Hampshire this week, he may be going about
this madness his own way, but there's no question that Bush has
noticed him.
</P>
<P>
   When the president-in-waiting descended upon South Carolina
(another early-voting state next winter) last week, he found the
Republican wise guys and the local press more than a little
interested in the solid job McCain has done in planting his flag in
the state via numerous appearances and the strong impression he has
made. So Bush talked about him before ladeling out his usual mush.
He praised the senator's record, claimed him as a pal and, lacking
any more substantive thoughts, blurted out a vow to
``out-organize'' him.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else happens in the months ahead, organization will
have little to do with it. Having something to offer the country as
a person and a potential president will. As McCain likes to say,
voters don't get two ballots (one for character, one for agenda).
</P>
<P>
   If McCain were doing this the shallow way like Bush, he would
travel the country as the Vietnam War hero and prisoner who endured
unimaginable torture, and ride the image the way Bush rides his
political media status. But he doesn't; he almost never brings it
up. It's simply there, offering him instant respect and a hearing.
So, also, is his extensive record as a very tough conservative and
an independent cuss with a knack for making big things happen
bipartisanly _ the sort of stuff presidents do.
</P>
<P>
   As we were finishing our chat, McCain's car pulled up to the
local USO. I'm sure that from his bevy of bandwagon-riding issue
advisers, Bush has been told that there are some 11,000 military
families getting food stamps, and I'm equally sure he will be
programmed to express suitable outrage at some point.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain owns this issue. He can talk low pay, housing
allowances, housing supply and location, recruiting policies,
family stresses, and child care in real depth. He chats
knowledgeably with a young Marine who delivers pizzas off duty to
make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to him than empathy. His ideas are
comprehensive, going well beyond the pending pay increase, as are
his thoughts on military readiness and new hardware. He insists
that major new investments have to be made.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the independent cuss emerges, because McCain has
thought through the budgetary implications of his advocacy. And he
is as devoted a foe of defense pork as he is of domestic program
waste. McCain is positive the new investments in people and
hardware can be financed entirely within the Pentagon budget. And
he is the only Republican running with the credibility to attack
the unneeded bases and politically inspired hardware boondoggles
whose cancellation could provide the money.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of money, his well-known attack on the campaign
finance status quo plays well in California, and has now taken on a
particularly mischievous dimension that could have implications for
next March's mega-primary. Even as he prepares for his annual
battle in the Senate in October to rid the system of the unlimited
chunks of cash called soft money, McCain has become part of a
gathering storm here.
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento earlier in the week he jumped aboard an initiative
campaign that offers California (where limits on sources and
amounts of special-interest cash are virtually nonexistent) the
same kind of cleaner system chosen in recent years by people in
Maine and McCain's Arizona. Limits on contributions would be
exchanged for access to free time on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is the brainchild of a local conservative
maverick, software zillionaire Ron Unz, who inspired last year's
divisive campaign that tossed out the state's bilingual education
system. It is caught up in all kinds of state politics, and
includes extraneous, populist fodder cutting state legislator's pay
and linking paychecks to timely enactment of state budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But it would change the system, and its potential popularity is
enhanced by widespread revulsion at new Governor Gray Davis's
shameless fund-raising in his first months in office. And the fact
is, if Unz gets the signatures for next March's ballot, a vote for
the initiative would at least be a possible vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of activity that has gotten Bush's attention.
For that part of the divided Republican mind that would like a real
contest for the nomination, the guy who is about to get on a bus in
New Hampshire mocks his mush and as usual threatens conventional
thinking.

<P>
   Thunder thighs are clogging up ``Thunder Road'' and ``Hungry
Hearts'' are chowing their way through the concession stands.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band are the stars of a
sellout, six-city reunion tour this summer, but the real show is in
the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The Boss sold out his first two shows in Boston in 30 minutes,
all five in less than three hours. In five nights last week, he
drew nearly 100,000 fevered fans to the Fleet Center. Clearly, in
the decade since he last toured the United States with the band,
Springsteen's appeal has not diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, neither has the size of his audience.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when the only food you were likely to encounter at a
rock 'n' roll concert was an herbally enhanced brownie? Entering
the FleetCenter last week, your first impluse was to wonder whether
you had wandered into a wrestling match by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Who were all those graying Baby Boomers with nacho chips and
deep-dish pizzas on their laps? A glimpse in a pane of glass at the
refreshment counter proved a quick reality check. They were us, of
course _ members of the generation that long ago parted with its
hairline and its waistline, but will never surrender its youth.
</P>
<P>
   We are not aging gracefully, boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   It is harder to say what was more disorienting Friday night,
pulling into a rock concert in the family minivan (behind a Volvo
and a Mercedes-Benz), watching rock fans check in with their baby
sitters by cell phone from their balcony seats, or seeing hundreds
of flickering Bic lighters reflected in hundreds of pairs of
bifocals in the darkened arena.
</P>
<P>
   At least there is no gender disparity at a Springsteen concert;
there's an equal opportunity to embarrass yourself in public. Last
week was enough to make one ponder whether there shouldn't be a
city ordinance regulating the age of women who wear spandex and men
who don tie-dyed T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Previous generations of men might have dreamed of being fighter
pilots or international spies. This one, it is clear, still
fantasizes about rock stardom. To watch men of a certain age
pumping their arms, playing air guitars, and spinning imaginary
microphones over their heads, like so many Roger Daltrey wannabes,
was to wonder whether some boys ever grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Until you checked out the women.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers who left adolescent daughters at home dreaming about a
date with one of the Backstreet Boys were screaming themselves
hoarse at every shot on the overhead screen of Springsteen's
sweat-drenched chest. We haven't swooned like that in Boston since
Mark Lindsay of Paul Revere and the Raiders threw his tricorn hat
into the orchestra seats at Symphony Hall during a rousing chorus
of ``Kicks'' in the summer of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   About the only people in the crowd who did not look like they
needed to be told to act their age were Springsteen and his wife
and band mate, Patti Scialfa. He of the taut muscles, tight jeans,
and boundless energy. She of the sunken cheekbones, leather pants,
and ``I've-got-Bruce-and-you-don't'' smirk.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have to lie about their age; they defy it.
</P>
<P>
   He is 49 years old; she is not much younger and the mother of
three young children. Yet they played relentless rock 'n' roll for
three hours each night without a pause or a discernible diminution
of energy. (Poor Peter Wolf of the J. Geils Band. With the
mummified mien of a Mick Jagger, he could only suffer by comparison
with the Boss during his guest appearance on Friday night.)
</P>
<P>
   In what Jim Sullivan, the Globe's rock critic, describes as the
``Church of Bruce,'' it is easy to feel like an agnostic at a Billy
Graham revival meeting unless you know from the first chord every
song about to be sung and every word once it begins. Among the
faithful, many of whom attended all five concerts last week, it is
not enough to appreciate Springsteen's music; you have to become an
acolyte.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the lyrics down is one form of homage; putting the fork
down might be another. The Boss, bless his heart, loves us anyway.
(``You're not a beauty but, hey, you're all right.'') But if our
arteries are going to hold out long enough for us to catch the next
reunion tour, we are going to have to hit the gym or the track.
It's the gospel, according to Bruce: ``Tramps like us, baby we were
born to run.''

<P>
   It is an enduring image, honed by ``Love Story'' and the J. Crew
catalog. As autumn's leaves start to fall, fresh-faced college
students flood back to campus, hauling duffel bags and laundry
baskets out of their parents' station wagons, decorating their dorm
rooms with tapestries and Absolut ads. For four years, their days
are filled with lectures and tutorials, their weekends with
football games and fraternity parties.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, that picture is as faded as your father's letter
sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only about 20 percent of college students nationwide are
what most people think of as the average: younger than 22, living
on campus, or going to class full time. Less than half are between
the ages of 18 and 21 _ and millions of students older than 35 have
elevated the average age of the American undergraduate to 26.6
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional image of a college student, a white male
between 18 and 22 from a relatively affluent family, is
increasingly irrelevant,'' said Terry Hartle, senior vice president
of the American Council on Education, the nation's umbrella group
for colleges and universities. ``This is a trend in all colleges
and universities; the difference is simply the extent. But it's
obvious we're in the middle of a profound change.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the country's largest private university is the nationwide
network of the University of Phoenix, which takes only students
older than 23. Even elite schools like Harvard, Yale, Brown, and
other New England institutions _ where the shrinking pool of
traditional students still clusters _ are expanding their roles to
tap into the huge potential profits to be made from the aging
student body.
</P>
<P>
   And at the several thousand other colleges nationwide, the new
demographics are changing how and when schools teach, who is
teaching, even the notion of what a campus looks like. Forget
stadiums, pubs, or ivy-covered walls. What do the students in the
new majority want most? According to the College Board, a place to
park their cars.
</P>
<P>
   The stereotype of Joe College, All-American Boy was born in the
early 1800s, and was largely accurate until the early days of the
women's movement.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1970s, older students became the fastest
growing group of undergraduates. Full-time students who were 25
years or older grew by 164 percent between 1970 and 1990, compared
with an increase of only 18 percent among younger students. The
jump was especially pronounced among women over 25; their ranks
increased by 477 percent in that period. Students older than 40,
too, increased by 235 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The baby boomers who return to campuses this fall to drop off
their own children will find them markedly different places. Only
13 percent of undergraduates live on campus. A third work
full-time, half attend school only part-time. Less than half say
they rely on mom and dad to pay the bills _ and almost a quarter
have children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Even an expected increase in the number of high school graduates
nationwide over the next few years won't change that picture much,
demographers say; any increase will be limited to a handful of
states.
</P>
<P>
   For colleges and universities, the new definition of Joe College
means rethinking often pejorative views of older students. In
attitude and ambition, the new students aren't like those in the
old continuing-education programs, taking a few courses in pottery
or paralegal studies. The overwhelming number are pursuing an
undergraduate degree. And more and more, colleges are demanding
they meet the same admissions standards as their younger
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher education has largely ignored these people up until
now,'' said Harold Hodgkinson, director of the Center for
Demographic Policy outside Washington, D.C. ``Registrars used to
refuse part-timers. . . . They said the only people who mattered
were those who were going four years to get a degree. Now, they're
paying less attention to the group that used to be the dominant
symbol of higher ed.''
</P>
<P>
   The new symbol, then, might be someone like Jessica McDonald. At
36, she had been out of school for 19 years, having bailed out
after a few months of freshman year at UMass-Boston. She had
started her own makeup business in Faneuil Hall, moved to Italy for
10 years to work in fashion, and then became ``excruciatingly
bored,'' as she says now. ``I needed to use my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   She worried about making it through as an older student and
raising her then-5-year-old son at the same time. But like the
profiles of other older students nationwide, she became one of the
more motivated, and was asked to join the honors program and tutor
others. Now 42, she expects to get her degree this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Classrooms look different right down to the walls _ in some
cases, there are essentially no walls, only a computer screen that
allows a student to earn a degree from an elite school halfway
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the 53,000-student University of Phoenix system, a for-profit
college founded in 1979, education takes place in nondescript
buildings at sites across the country. Professors are required to
be employed full-time in the specialty they teach.
</P>
<P>
   More traditional schools are revamping themselves to suit adult
learners, squeezing 15-week credits into five, for example, and
creating accelerated bachelor-degree programs. According to a 1991
College Board survey, 15 percent of undergraduate institutions
offered on-campus housing for older students, and 30 percent had
special orientations for adults. ``Office hours'' are now done by
e-mail. Even marketing has been affected: Admissions brochures are
being redone to include photographs of older students.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the world of higher education is burgeoning so fast
as on-line education, with 1 million adults reported to be taking
courses via computer this year, and twice that number by 2002.
Institutions from state universities to Stanford are setting up
satellite campuses across the nation where students can take
so-called distance learning courses via computer. They offer the
same coursework, grant the same degree, and in most cases, charge
the same tuition. But they are far cheaper to run _ no need for
campus centers or athletic teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the cash cows,'' says Hodgkinson, a former dean at
Simmons and Bard colleges. And the entrepreneurial world has taken
note. Junk bond king Michael Milken is behind a new distance
learning venture. Harcourt General, the company that owns Neiman
Marcus and Harcourt Brace, last year hired former Massachusetts
education commissioner Robert V. Antonucci to start an on-line
university complete with deans and provosts. The company chose
Cambridge as its headquarters because it is such a mecca for
traditional higher education.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the traditional campus hasn't gone unlamented. The
emphasis on older students, most of whom are seeking career
training, has made many traditional schools move away from liberal
arts toward professional-degree programs.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of University Professors has fought to
keep out institutions like the University of Phoenix and the new
Harcourt company, worried about their use of non-tenured
instructors. And many people worry about how to control quality of
distance learning programs. ``The ability to evaluate quality has
not kept pace with the availability of these programs,'' Hartle
said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, disdain the caution and glacial pace of change.
``The model of higher education has remained substantially
unchanged for many, many years,'' said Laura Palmer Noone, provost
of the University of Phoenix. ``Institutions are going to have to
rethink what it is they are here to do. There is a huge need out
there.''

MEDICATIONS MAY REDUCE ALCOHOL CRAVINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pill to cure alcoholism?
</P>
<P>
   We're not there yet, and a pill may never be enough by itself.
But leaders in alcoholism research report significant recent
progress in the use of drugs to diminish alcoholics' craving for
the substance, increase their abstinence rates, and convert problem
drinkers into moderate imbibers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're entering a major new epoch in alcoholism
treatment,'' said Dr. Enoch Gordis, director of the National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), who will
summarize recent research Sept. 2 at an international meeting in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the neuroscience cooking along as it is, and the prospect
that we'll find genes related to alcoholism, we'll have far more
targeted drug therapies for alcoholism in the next five to 10
years,'' Gordis predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The social impact could be enormous. An estimated 14 million
Americans are alcohol abusers _ about 10 percent of adult men and
three percent of women _ and the problem costs society more than
$100 billion a year. Yet only about 700,000 people are in
alcoholism treatment at any given time, federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The pioneer ``anti-craving'' drug of Gordis's new epoch,
naltrexone or ReVia, is already on the market, though not yet
widely used. This month the Archives of General Psychiatry
published an encouraging study on a second such agent, nalmefene.
And last week in Paris, researchers discussed (behind closed doors)
the first results of a large US trial of acamprosate, a third
anti-alcoholism drug already in widespread use in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are sworn to secrecy, but basically the European
results have been very positive, and I would imagine the US results
will be positive too,'' said Dr. Robert Swift of Brown University's
Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies, one of the US study sites
for acamprosate.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the accumulating drug studies, the NIAAA this fall
will launch a major program in Boston and nine other cities called
Project Combine to test whether combinations of drugs, along with
established ``talk therapies,'' can significantly improve long-term
success rates in treating alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the best conditions currently, you might get total
alcohol abstinence after 12 to 15 months of treatment for a
minority of roughly a third of patients,'' Gordis said. ``Treatment
is of modest help to a smaller group, and it will fail in about
half. We can't cure alcoholism yet, but then we can't cure most
chronic diseases _ and that's what alcoholism is.''
</P>
<P>
   The new approaches reflect a dawning of scientists'
understanding about the complex brain chemistry of alcohol
addiction, first among experimental animals trained or bred to seek
alcohol and more recently among human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol is a brain stimulant, accounting for its pleasurable,
sociable, and de-inhibiting effects. But it's also a sedative,
dulling normal cognitive and motor processes and also damping
anxiety and tension. Thus, it's not surprising that alcohol acts on
several important neurotransmitters and their respective receptors
on brain cells, with both acute and long-term effects.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, many of alcohol's stimulant effects are due to the
chemical's action on dopamine neurons, which are instrumental in
the brain's pleasure-seeking or ``reward'' systems.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol also inhibits receptors for glutamate, the brain's major
excitatory neurotransmitter, responsible for arousal and attention.
The brain reacts to long-term alcohol ingestion by increasing nerve
cell arousal to counter alcohol's depressant effect. When an
alcohol-addicted individual stops drinking, this chronically
over-excited state becomes unbearable, producing the notorious
symptoms of withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all alcohol does to the brain. It also enhances the
function of neural receptors for GABA, the brain's primary
inhibitory neurotransmitter. And it lowers levels of serotonin, a
neurotransmitter that modulates mood and may mediate aggressive or
violent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The very complexity of these brain effects offers multiple
opportunities for targeting drugs to counter alcohol's action.
Naltrexone and nalmefene counteract the brain's natural opiates to
dull the craving for alcohol. Acamprosate works on the glutamate
system in ways not entirely understood, somehow normalizing the
hyper-excited state that chronic alcohol abuse causes.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers hope that combining two or more different-acting
drugs will damp the drive to seek alcohol while preventing the
distress of withdrawal symptoms. But, as studies with naltrexone
have shown, it will only work if patients faithfully take the
drugs, which is where counseling and supportive talk therapy come
in.
</P>
<P>
   Another current strain of research focuses on which patients are
more susceptible to alcohol dependence, and which are more likely
to respond to drug therapy. After eight years of effort,
researchers have identified dozens of ``candidate genes'' that put
patients at risk for alcoholism, and four human chromosomes where
those genes are likely to lurk. The next step is to tease out the
genes and determine what proteins they code for. Voila _ more
potential targets for drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But merely devising ingenious new treatment approaches for
alcoholism will not be enough. Putting treatment advances into
widespread use is another matter, as the disappointing experience
with naltrexone shows. Naltrexone won federal approval four and a
half years ago _ the first anti-alcoholism drug since the 1948
approval of Antabuse (disulfiram).
</P>
<P>
   Antabuse was supposed to cure alcoholism by making users
violently ill if they drank alcohol while taking the medication.
But the well-known drug is not widely used today, since a large
1986 study showed no difference in abstinence rates among patients
who took it.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a number of studies in North American and Europe
have shown that naltrexone combined with supportive ``talk
therapy'' produced long-term abstinence rates two to three times
higher than patients who took placebo pills along with
psychotherapy. The new drug, which interferes with the
neurochemistry of the brain's pleasure-seeking circuits, is the
first anti-alcoholism medication to act on the brain's chemistry of
craving and reward. But the alcoholism treatment community has not
embraced the drug approach with enthusiasm, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naltrexone hasn't made the inroads one would expect,'' said
Klaus Miczek of Tufts University School of Medicine, a co-chairman
of this week's joint meeting of the US and European Behavioral
Pharmacology Societies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I heard, naltrexone was only selling in the
range of $20 million to $30 million a year, which is minuscule,''
added Dr. Raymond F. Anton of the Medical University of South
Carolina in Charlestown. ``Part of the reason is the lack of
knowledge among treatment providers and the general public about
the effects of alcohol on the brain and how medications can affect
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The ignorance may be due to the lackluster marketing of
naltrexone by its manufacturer, DuPont-Merck, which won approval
only two years before the drug's patent expired, greatly lessening
its profitability. Many alcoholism treatment providers and dominant
groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous have a strong bias against
using drugs to treat addictions and favor social supports,
counseling, self-help, willpower, and spiritual approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this longstanding orientation _ and the lack of
effective pharmacologic agents _ alcoholism treatment has been
``dominated by non-medical approaches,'' Anton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of evidence that physicians don't do a good job
in identifying people who could benefit from treatment,'' the South
Carolina researcher added. ``And there is some concern among
non-medical counselors that an overemphasis on medications will
diminish attention to counseling and behavioral therapies.'' Gordis
speaks of ``a legacy of ideology about alcoholism which has impeded
acceptance of pharmaceutical therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   This may change with the availability, possibly within the next
year, of more anti-alcoholism drugs. Drug companies are finally in
hot pursuit of such agents, and the European company Merck-Lipha
developing acamprosate is aggressively seeking US Food and Drug
Administration approval for that drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought naltrexone would change the world, but it didn't,''
said an observer. ``But the advent of a couple more drugs is sure
to make an impression on the treatment community.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Gordis said, it should be possible to harmonize the
opinions of those who emphasize willpower and social supports with
the neuroscience and genetic research that are revealing the
biological basis of alcoholism. In other words, drugs to treat
alcoholism do not relieve alcoholic patients of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person who has been drinking heavily for some time is
largely overcome with the biological pressure of craving for
alcohol and the physiological demand to drink,'' Gordis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are two situations in which the individual still has
a major responsibility to do something,'' he continued. ``First, if
a person is a member of a family in which there have been drinking
problems, he should be very alert to early signs of a problem.
Second, there's the established alcoholic who has become sober,
been presented with the impact of alcohol, and has the chance to do
something about it.''

THE MARRIAGE OF FOOD AND WINE
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photos of Chef Evely and a plate of food 
 By MIRIAM SILVER 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Gray meat and brown vegetables'' was the standard home-cooked
fare for Mary Evely when she was growing up in Michigan. Today,
Evely is an expert on another culinary pairing: food and wine.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is she chef at Simi Winery in Healdsburg, Calif., where
combining foods and wines is a studied pursuit, but she is also the
author of a cookbook called ''The Vintner's Table,'' aimed at
giving others guidelines on how to balance the tastes and textures
of various foods and wines.
</P>
<P>
   The book was the first place winner in the ''first book''
category of the 1998 Julia Child Cookbook Awards, sponsored by the
International Association of Culinary Professionals. That the award
was named for Julia Child was particularly meaningful to Evely.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't accept the award for myself,'' Evely said, ''but on
behalf of Julia Child, because she taught me how to cook.'' Instead
of going to culinary school, Evely studied the teachings of three
food luminaries: Craig Claiborne, James Beard and, her favorite,
Julia Child.
</P>
<P>
   Her enthusiasm for food was cultivated in New York City, where
she was an art student at Cooper Union in the early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Evely lost herself in the gustatory pleasures of the restaurants
and sidewalk cafes in Little Italy, Chinatown and the other ethnic
areas that crowd the city. Her friends in the arts became equally
as passionate about food.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a gathering of interests and energy. It was like
critical mass,'' Evely said. ''We all started getting interested in
food and cooking. We'd start having dinner parties and getting into
fun one-upmanship. That got me interested in wine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Evely's path to chefdom was not straight.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Los Angeles in the late '60s, working as a graphic
artist and then opening a clothing store. She stayed interested in
food and wine, joining a chapter of Les Amis du Vin (The Friends of
Wine). She started making annual trips north, mostly to Sonoma
County, to try the wine and began selling California wine in her
store.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the lease for her store, she decided to move to
Sonoma County. In 1983, Simi Winery hired her to run visitors
services. Her talent for pairing wine and food came out of wine
tasting parties Evely was involved in with other people in the food
and wine business.
</P>
<P>
   She tells of the night when each person brought a bottle of 1977
cabernet sauvignon and some food to go with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone brought smoked salmon. I loved it. I started tasting
the wine; it tasted terrible. The smoked salmon was destroying the
wine. It's a huge conflict,'' she said. ''It really makes a
difference. I wanted to know about this.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Evely set up the first wine and food pairing events at
the winery, long before wine and food pairing meant much in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   While the winery had a small kitchen and dining room, there was
no equipment, so Evely hired a caterer. But the stuffed grape
leaves were stuffed with canned mushrooms and Evely thought: ''I
can do better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Next time around, she brought in her own kitchen equipment and
set out to learn about which wine went well with which food.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sat down with the group and we tasted six different wines
with six different kinds of food. I taught myself by doing those
tastings. I started seeing patterns, certain categories of food I
could predict would work with certain kinds of wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Now called The Vintner's Table series, Evely's annual winery
events are centered around particular food producers or products,
paired with the appropriate wines. The dinners, which range in
price from $40 to $65, were among the first such events, which many
other Wine Country restaurants and wineries now present.
</P>
<P>
   In ''The Vintner's Table''cookbook, based on these ongoing food
and wine programs at the winery, Evely shares her experiences
through recipes that are divided by wine varietals.
</P>
<P>
   The sweetness in a particular dish, Evely advises, should always
be more subtle than the sweetness of the wine that is being served
with it. Otherwise, she says, ''the palate cannot perceive the
fruit in the wine and it appears thin, tart or bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, most desserts, she said, do not do well with
most wines unless the wines are slightly sweeter than the food,
such as sweet sparkling wine, a sauterne, or a cognac. But, Evely
nevertheless includes some dessert recipes in her cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't have a cookbook without dessert, because I love
dessert,'' said Evely, who maniacally clips and tries almost every
new cookie recipe she finds.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes the cookbook will lead people who love food to care
about wine. It's a sneaky way, she said, to get more people to
drink good wine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am trying to bring people into the fold,'' she said. ''Wine
is such a wonderful part of life. I can't separate it from food.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical of her commentaries in the book is this one, which
accompanies a recipe for Chicken Charmoula: ''The strong green
herbs, the heat from the cayenne pepper, and the acid of the lemon
juice would fight with any wine other than sauvignon blanc. Ask
your local wine merchant to help you avoid the softer
''wanna-be-Chardonnay'' styles of this varietal, however, which
would not work nearly as well with this dish.''
</P>
<P>
   She says sauvignon blanc is her favorite wine because it is the
most ''food-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN CHARMOULA
</P>
<P>
   Serves six
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sweet paprika
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
</P>
<P>
   1 cup nonfat yogurt
</P>
<P>
   Cilantro sprigs for garnish
</P>
<P>
   For the seasoning mixture, mince the garlic in a food processor
fitted with a steel blade to make about 1 teaspoon minced garlic.
Add the parsley, cilantro, cumin, paprika, salt and cayenne pepper
and process until minced. Add the lemon juice and olive oil and
process until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the chicken and pat dry. Spread half the seasoning mixture
over the chicken and cover. Chill the chicken and remaining
seasoning mixture for 2 to 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the broiler or prepare a fire in the grill. Grill or
broil the chicken for 3 minutes on each side or until it springs
back to the touch and is cooked through. Place on serving plates.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the reserved seasoning mixture with the yogurt. Serve the
chicken with a dollop of the yogurt sauce and grilled vegetables;
garnish with the cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Note: This dish is equally good hot or at room temperature. It
also makes great sandwiches.

KIDS CAN LEARN FROM SCHOOL CRISES
</HEADLINE>
  By LAURA TAXEL 
 c.1999 magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the event lies almost 40 years in my past, the memory
of getting on the wrong bus and going to the wrong place on my
first day of first grade is still vivid. When I arrived at school,
nobody had any record of me. No one knew where I should go. I
watched all the other children go with their teachers, and I was
left behind, confused and frightened.
</P>
<P>
   The principal took me under her wing and after a lengthy
question and answer session and a few phone calls, she located my
mother, who, I was assured, was on her way to get me. Meanwhile the
principal figured out where I actually belonged.
</P>
<P>
   I have often remembered that day and the realization that I
survived is an important part of the memory. A bad thing happened
to me, but I came out okay.
</P>
<P>
   This was something I knew even then, a lesson learned and
understood on the spot with no explanation necessary. I noticed
that day that strangers _ adults I'd never met before _ were nice
to me. People wanted to help. Being unhappy was something I could
endure. In fact, getting myself lost wasn't as awful as I had
always imagined it would be. In fact, it was interesting.
</P>
<P>
   I think perhaps that it was on that day that I began to become a
person who would move through the world with a basic trust that
things always work out, that this is a generally kind universe, and
that I would be safe in it. I believe that's a working definition
of confidence. It is something that has helped me countless times
in my own life, and it's something I very much want my children to
feel.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with this in mind that I agreed, when my nine-year-old
twin boys requested permission to walk to school alone on the first
day of a new school year. They had never before braved the occasion
without a parent in hand.
</P>
<P>
   They left the house, emboldened with a sense of adventure and
new notebooks, a little hesitant to be on their own, but, for
reasons never explained to me, determined to do it. I thought about
them during the day, hoping that they were all right. If they'd
somehow gotten lost, I told myself, then surely I would, like my
mother before me, have heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   We had decided I would meet them at school at 3:00. They knew
they'd be so excited they wouldn't be able to wait till they got
home to tell me all about their day. Standing in the sunshine,
networking with all the other parents meeting children, I
discovered that many were quite surprised I had not been there that
morning.
</P>
<P>
   There was, I thought, some veiled criticism, in remarks like ``I
couldn't believe you weren't here with your boys on the first day
of school'', or ``I don't think my nine year old is mature enough
to handle being alone on the first day.'' Another told us that she
and her son had come to school the day before the first day for a
dry run. The building was open as staff prepared, so they could
find his classroom, meet his teacher, and be sure the next day held
no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Some mothers were quick to tell me that things hadn't gone well
that morning. The school had tried a new approach to bringing
teachers and children together in groups outside the building and
the result had been rather chaotic. Some youngsters had not been
able to locate their teachers, others couldn't find their
classrooms once inside.
</P>
<P>
   The parents were visibly upset with the fact that it had not
been a perfectly smooth operation. I had some guilt pangs that my
boys had gone off into this melee on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Over milk and cookies later that afternoon, we talked about it.
One of the boys remarked that it had been sort of crazy and he
wasn't sure at first where he was supposed to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you sorry you'd gone to school alone,'' I asked``Were you frightened, did you get upset?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' he said, giving me a comforting grin that
made me feel as though I was the one who needed reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We handled it just fine,'' added his brother. ``I asked
someone for help,'' said Simon with visible pride, ``and Nathan
figured it out by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it make you feel nervous when you didn't know where to
go?'' I probed, determined to know about any moments of suffering
they may have endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little,'' said Nathan, ``but it wasn't a bad kind of
nervous.'' And then, having had enough of both cookies and
conversation, they ran out to play.
</P>
<P>
   They were clearly neither traumatized nor put off by the fact
that things had not been smoothly orchestrated. And although many
parents obviously thought that the process should have been handled
differently, arranged so that it would be easy and problem free, I
could see that the first day had gone perfectly for my children.
</P>
<P>
   It was an opportunity, without much danger, for them to learn
many things about themselves and their ability to come out the
other end of a rocky encounter. I suddenly saw a certain
mythological character to the experience; they'd faced a dragon,
albeit a small 4th grade sized one, and like their mother before
them, survived the encounter, and even vanquished the foe.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad I was not there to shepherd them through their
difficulties. I'm happy they suffered a brief, but oh-so-bearable
moment of distress, and then found a way to take care of
themselves. It means that they are now one step closer to being
ready for life, their own life, which they will inevitably have to
live without me watching over them and fixing everything. This day,
imperfect as it was, had allowed them a chance to add confidence to
their repertoire of responses to the world. If they're anything
like me, they will remember the event in the years to come with a
certain deep and abiding pleasure.

ARMY CONSIDERS NEW SLOGAN TO REVERSE RECRUITING SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Army Secretary Louis Caldera says he will take a
hard look at the future of the service's familiar jingle, ``Be all
that you can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldera isn't sure how to modify or replace the slogan, listed
by Advertising Age magazine as one of the century's leading
commercial tunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a question of whether it's a little bit
dated,'' Caldera said of the slogan, which was introduced in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The Army is reassessing its advertising strategy as the service
tries to reverse its worst recruiting year since 1979, falling
short by about 7,000 enlistees. And things will get tougher next
year as the service seeks to sign up 80,000 active-duty recruits,
5,500 above this year's goal.
</P>
<P>
   A $92 million publicity campaign is planned, but the Army would
like to boost its ad budget to as much as $130 million. Just what
the new ad campaign will look like when it debuts in December isn't
yet known. But there are hints the time-honored ``Be all that you
can be,'' which replaced three previous Army themes used over the
years, is already on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   The song was scrapped in a series of 15- and 30-second spots
that first aired last October. The slogan instead appeared in
writing at the end of the commercials, which continue to air. Focus
groups thought the jingle was too old, and preferred to see it
rather than hear it, said Col. Kevin Kelley of the Fort Knox,
Ky.-based Army Recruiting Command.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera said the Army had not discarded the slogan because it is
so readily recognized. It is ranked by Advertising Age, a trade
weekly, 18th among the century's 100 top ad campaigns, pulling
ahead of Burger King's ``Have it your way,'' Campbell Soup's
``Mmm-mm good,'' and Budweiser's ``This Bud's for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army theme song topped the General Motors Corp.'s ``See the
USA in your Chevrolet,'' Coca Cola's ``It's the Real Thing,'' and
Oscar Meyer's ``I wish I was an Oscar Meyer Wiener.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really become part of the lexicon of America,'' Kelley
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign will shift its focus from high school
graduates, and concentrate more on community college and vocational
students, as well as Hispanics, blacks and women, he said. The ad
drive will target cities considered the most fertile grounds for
cultivating recruits, among them El Paso, Texas; Fresno, Calif.;
Houston; Jacksonville, Fla.; Phoenix; San Antonio; Seattle; and
Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Cities likely to see fewer ad spots are Chicago, New York and
Los Angeles, said Kelley, who heads the Army's ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Air Force, which has kicked off an 18-month, $54
million advertising blitz in hopes of boosting sagging enlistment,
the Army sees advertising as a key in its campaign to win the
hearts and minds of young people.
</P>
<P>
   Changes include adding more rural recruiting stations, moving
some offices from strip shopping centers to busy malls, and giving
recruiters cell phones and computers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Caldera, the nation's first Hispanic Army secretary, said his
service would put more money into Spanish-language advertising.
About $8 million will be spent for those spots.
</P>
<P>
   The Army also will reach out to Hispanics this fall as it
unveils a pilot project in California, Texas and the Northeast that
pays high school dropouts to earn their equivalency diplomas.
Caldera has said his service's recruiting woes would disappear if
it got its ``fair share'' of Hispanics who make up 11.4 percent of
the population but 7 percent of the service.
</P>
<P>
   To reach them and others, he said, the Army must air ads that
appeal to a wide spectrum of people. ``Right now we have one
message being broadcast primarily at sports-watching audiences,''
Caldera said. Though ``Be all that you can be'' hasn't been
discarded because it's so well known, he said, it stresses the
tangible personal benefits of the service, rather than
self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about you personally, as opposed to serve your country,''
Caldera SAID. ``So we do need to look at it, we do need to look at
whether it needs to be updated.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``We wouldn't want to discard it without thinking
very hard about it given how much we've invested in that slogan.''

PROFESSOR SAID'S UNTRUE STORIES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If he were a columnist for The Boston Globe, he would be fired.
But Edward Said is not a journalist, he is an academic, and the
standards of truth and accuracy in academia are lower than those in
journalism. So it is a safe bet that Said has little to fear from
the fact that he has just been exposed as a liar. He will not be
fired from Columbia University, where he is a tenured professor,
nor will he be ousted from the renowned Modern Language
Association, whose presidency he assumed in January.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, Said has been the Palestinians' most illustrious
spokesman. Articulate, zealous, brilliant, he has savaged Israel
and championed the PLO in every imaginable medium: books,
newspapers, speeches, interviews, radio broadcasts, even a BBC
documentary. He was a close adviser to Yasser Arafat and the author
of Arafat's infamous 1974 United Nations speech. For many years
Said was a member of the Palestine National Council, the parent
body of the PLO. He resigned in 1991 and today calls Arafat a
traitor for signing peace agreements with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   What has always made Said's pleas on the Palestinians' behalf so
poignant is that he spoke from personal experience. He told of
growing up in Palestine before the Israeli War of Independence, and
of how his family was uprooted by Zionist violence and forced into
exile. ``I was born in Jerusalem,'' he wrote last year, ``and spent
most of my formative years there and, after 1948, when my entire
family became refugees, in Egypt.'' In an interview with the
Christian Science Monitor he recalled how his family had fled ``in
panic'' in December 1947, when ``a Jewish-forces sound truck warned
Arabs to leave the neighborhood'' in which they lived.
</P>
<P>
   Said's life story has infused his advocacy with moral authority.
As Salman Rushdie puts it, by writing about ``the anguish of living
with displacement, with exile,'' Said ``enables us to feel the pain
of his people.''
</P>
<P>
   Said has described with sad nostalgia his childhood home at 10
Brenner St. ``I feel even more depressed,'' he told an
English-language Palestinian newspaper in March, ``when I remember
my beautiful old house surrounded by pine and orange trees in Al
Talbiyeh in East Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Some time after his family was pushed out by the Jews, Said has
noted, the famed Jewish philosopher Martin Buber moved in. ``Buber
of course was a great apostle of coexistence between Arabs and
Jews,'' Said told a West Bank audience last year, ``but he didn't
mind living in an Arab house whose inhabitants had been
displaced.'' The home of his youth thus serves as a parable for the
Palestinian condition itself.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing is wrong with Said's deeply affecting
autobiography. He made most of it up.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Said's childhood, and with it his credibility, has
been exploded by Justus Reid Weiner, an Israeli scholar who spent
three years checking out Said's tales. ``Virtually everything I
learned,'' Weiner writes in the September issue of Commentary,
``contradicts the story of Said's early life as Said has told it.''
</P>
<P>
   He grew up, it turns out, not in Jerusalem, but in Cairo's
richest quarter. The ``beautiful old house'' in Jerusalem was his
aunt's, not his father's. Said's parents sometimes visited this
aunt; during one such visit in 1935, Edward was born. On his birth
certificate, the family's place of residence is given as Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   The expulsion from Talbieh in December 1947 never happened. A
sound truck urging Arabs to evacuate did go through the
neighborhood in February 1948, Weiner learned. But only a few Arab
residents left, and they soon returned. Meanwhile, the Jewish men
in the sound truck were arrested by the British.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Buber and his family, who came to Palestine as refugees
in the 1930s, did live at 10 Brenner St. _ as tenants of Said's
aunt, who rented them a basement apartment in 1938. Said's acid
description of Buber living in the home of a displaced Arab is an
exact inversion of the truth. For in 1942, six years before the
war, Said's aunt broke the lease and expelled her Jewish tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner's devastating article _ `` `My Beautiful Old House' and
Other Fabrications by Edward Said'' _ drives a stake through Said's
integrity. If the man lies about his own past, what won't he lie
about?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Said lies routinely, especially when Israelis or Arabs
are on the agenda. It would take a far longer column to catalog all
his falsehoods, but two are enough to give a taste of his
inventiveness:
</P>
<P>
   --During the intifada, when scores of innocent Palestinians were
being killed by fellow Arabs as ``collaborators,'' Said defended
the murderers. ``The UN Charter and every other known document or
protocol,'' he wrote, ``entitles a people under foreign occupation
. . . to deal severely with collaborators.'' The UN Charter says
nothing of the kind.
</P>
<P>
   --Said has accused Israel's founders of literally taking lessons
from Hitler. During World War II, he has written, the Zionists
``were in touch with the Nazis in the hope of emulating their Reich
in Palestine.'' A more evil libel is hard to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Said's foremost scholarly work, ``Orientalism,'' is littered
with factual errors, as the historian Keith Windschuttle recently
showed. ``In Search of Palestine,'' Said's 1998 BBC documentary,
brims with false accusations and gross distortions. But the most
shameful lie of all is Said's formulation of the creed he lives by:
``to speak the truth, as plainly, directly, and as honestly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be more untrue.

HORIZONTAL DRILLING ALLOWS OPERATORS TO CUT TIME, SAVE MONEY

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Oil-field service companies say that by using the
latest technology they could drill a well at One Shell Plaza in
downtown Houston, swing horizontally, and after several miles of
boring, hit a target half the size of a business desk.
</P>
<P>
   The technology behind that boast comes in many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Boring inch by inch through rock and compressed sediment, the
drill bit is guided by computers. If it seems to be heading off
course, the driller sends a series of pulses _ almost like a Morse
code _ down through the drilling mud that flows within the drill
pipe.
</P>
<P>
   The pulses coming back up through the mud tell the operator
precisely in what direction the tool is headed.
</P>
<P>
   And, to get a better feel for what is happening in an invisible
spot far away, an attached tool package measures naturally
occurring gamma radiation, which tells whether the bit is cutting
through shale, or moving through a strata containing oil, natural
gas or saltwater.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent conference, Baker Hughes Chairman Max Lukens said
that his company's latest steerable drilling system could start
downtown, head west beneath Interstate 10, then cross under the
Houstonian conference center where he was talking, and come up in
the Galleria ice rink.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the major oil-field service company was making that
claim for his company's AutoTrak tool because hitting a diminutive
target can be the difference between a major discovery and a dry
hole.
</P>
<P>
   And, being able to hit within a couple of feet is almost a given
now for a directional driller, says Dave Bergt of Schlumberger,
whose Anadrill subsidiary also manufactures steering tools.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, if the drill bit ends up two feet above the
oil-bearing deposit, ``you've just thrown away a couple million
dollars,'' says Bergt, describing the cost of drilling a dry hole.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to drill horizontally for miles is particularly
important offshore because one such rig can do the work of several
that had to be used previously.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to deepwater drilling, ``you will see a ton of
advancement in these technologies,'' says Marshall Adkins, an
energy service analyst in Houston for Raymond James &AMP; Associates,
an institutional research company.
</P>
<P>
   Most technologies to date have been evolutionary, according to
Adkins. The revolutionary ones will be in fiber optics, deepwater
drilling, underbalanced drilling and seismic data collection, he
predicts. ``We are on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   One idea involves running fiber-optic cable into the hole to
monitor the well. Another has seismic companies suspending their
listening devices in established wells, using the crunching of a
drill bit as a source of vibrations.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the improvement is from horizontal drilling, which
requires more accurate targeting of the bit than a vertical hole.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the obvious advantage of being able to hit one or
more &UR;  &LR; slim-profile &UR;  &LR; vertical pockets, says Raymond James &AMP;
Associates, horizontal wells produce oil and gas five to 10 times
faster than vertical wells. This rapid drain is considered
important, although horizontal wells cost one-and-one-half to three
times as much to drill.
</P>
<P>
   Schlumberger's tools have been used in drilling record-setting
horizontal wells, one at the tip of South America and another on
the southern coast of England, drilled laterally nearly seven
miles.
</P>
<P>
   The current record was set last month with a 35,196-foot hole _
or ``stepout'' _ on the Wytch Farm Field in England, says Linda
Silinsky of Schlumberger Oilfield Services in Sugar Land.
</P>
<P>
   Using drilling rigs sitting on dry land, the tools drilled
horizontally under the sea to reach oil.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional drilling methods would have required either the use
of an expensive offshore rig or the construction of an artificial
island for $260 million, Bergt says.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, according to Raymond James &AMP; Associates, is
that technologies of the past 10 years have allowed operators to
continually cut the time it takes to drill a well. This saves
money.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of finding oil and gas has plunged, but that is more a
function of oil companies selecting only the cheapest prospects to
drill, in line with recent oil prices, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   Technology such as three-dimensional seismic data collection has
helped the industry by boosting the success rate of wells, which
means fewer dry holes.
</P>
<P>
   And, drillers are using technology to go deeper and deeper.
Average U.S. well depth will exceed 6,500 feet in 2003, Raymond
James &AMP; Associates estimates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tapping into previously inaccessible reservoirs,
there will be less damage to underground formations, which allows
more oil and gas to be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these concepts seem impossible to people who are not in
the oil business, however.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins and his research associates say laymen need to let go of
the idea that the steel in drill pipe is rigid. The truth is that
steel is very flexible.
</P>
<P>
   A string of drill pipe about 3 1/2 inches in diameter and
several miles long ``is about as flexible as a thin tree branch,''
the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, directional drilling is best visualized as a bit
``swimming'' through the earth as it pulls a flexible leash of
drill pipe behind it. The notion of a stiff pipe pushing the bit
straight down is outdated.
</P>
<P>
   The AutoTrak tool, introduced by Baker Hughes' Inteq subsidiary
in 1997, is so steerable it can make 90 degree turns (although very
gradually), and weave to hit four or five oil deposits with the
same bit, said Product Manager Jonny Haugen from Inteq's office in
north Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier tools that utilize a slight bend near the front
for steering, the AutoTrak is straight. Four pads backed by
hydraulic cylinders push on the sides of the hole to change the
direction.
</P>
<P>
   With the more-conventional bent type, the tool doesn't rotate.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to change direction, just shift the position of the
tool a little and it will follow the direction of the bend. If you
want to go straight, spin the tool and it wallows out the hole.
When making a turn with this kind of tool, only the drill bit on
the front rotates.
</P>
<P>
   On conventional directional tools the bit is turned by a mud
motor, an innovative downhole device powered by drilling mud
flowing past vanes in a turbine.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Adding to a growing body of evidence that workplace stress is
harmful, researchers have linked job strain with higher rates of
heart disease and other physical ailments, and are exploring the
psychological effects of working long hours or being disenchanted
with a job.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most comprehensive US studies so far of
hypertension and job strain _ defined as being in a job with high
demands but low control over working conditions _ researchers
followed nearly 200 men for three years, and found that those with
the most job strain had significantly higher blood pressure than
those with the least.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, European and Japanese scientists have been
looking at the influence of job strain on heart disease,
gastrointestinal illness, immune system function, back and joint
pain, and depression and absenteeism, as well as at ways to
redesign the workplace to reduce stress.
</P>
<P>
   And University of Iowa researcher Cynthia A. Bonebright reported
last week finding that ``workaholics'' _ people who work long
hours, whether out of enthusiasm for the job or not _ have more
conflicts between work and family, and less satisfaction and
purpose in life. And Georgia State University professor Kenneth B.
Matheny reported that workers who say they suffer the most
``burnout'' are less confident in general and more disinterested in
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   These and other findings _ not to mention downsizing, longer
workdays, computerization and other changes that are increasingly
affecting workers _ have made job stress a priority for US public
health officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-quarter of the American working population feels their job
is a highly stressful force in their life,'' said Dr. Linda
Rosenstock, director of the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health, or NIOSH.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as a major issue,'' she said. In fact, the average
American work week is the longest in a generation, at about 47
hours, according to statistics she cited.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, the International Labor Organization has estimated
that work stress costs employers more than $200 billion a year, and
the World Health Organization has reported that about
three-quarters of people who seek psychiatric help have symptoms
that relate either to lack of job satisfaction or the inability to
relax, said Matheny, director of counseling psychology at Georgia
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people feel like automatons,'' he said. ``The electronic
stuff has made things all the worse _ beepers, e-mail. They can get
to you constantly,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But while the US government is just beginning to recognize what
researchers call the psychosocial factors of work-related stress,
illness and injury, some European countries have already put
regulations on the books to protect workers from such hazards, said
Robert A. Karasek, professor in the department of work environment
at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in Norway, government officials can be called in
to investigate complaints about employees being forced to do too
repetitive a job, or work too fast, according to Karasek, who has
advised occupational health officials worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   And in Japan, officials have recognized work stress as an
occupational cause of death for more than two decades. They even
have a word that means ``death from overwork'' _ karoshi.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision in March that opens the door for workers
compensation claims based on suicide, a Japanese court forced the
government to award a sum of money to the family of a machine shop
worker who hanged himself in 1985, after working 80-hour weeks. And
the recent suicide of a Japanese baseball scout, which was
considered to be a direct result of unrelenting job stresss,
enabled his family to receive an annual government pension.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any American worker will say they have stress on the job,
but researchers have found that the greatest health risks come from
a particular type of stressful job _ one that imposes high demands
but gives little control over working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the kinds of jobs that Karasek has found to put people
under excessivly high strain are garment factory workers, phone
operators, waitresses, gas station attendants and nurse's aides.
</P>
<P>
   But work-environment specialists have also found that job strain
can be reduced, and productivity improved, by lessening demands or
giving workers more control over their working conditions. In other
words, they say: change the way that work is organized; don't just
tell individual workers to use stress management programs, which
often have short-lived effects.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers recommend that employers and employees, through
anonymous surveys or face-to-face meetings, figure out the sources
of stress _ like unrealistic deadlines, lack of support from
supervisors and little involvement of workers in decision-making _
and do something concrete to change the way the work gets done.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Germany, some workplaces have ``health
circles,'' where employees get together to discuss sources of job
stress and come up with solutions, according to Karasek. But, he
said, there needs to be a level of trust between employers and
employees before such communication can even occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is really significantly behind in focusing
on the issue,'' said Karasek, a sociologist who devised the job
strain model and a job content questionnaire that has been used by
officials around the world to understand and prevent the health
consequences of high demand _ low control jobs. He just returned to
Massachusetts from a year in Denmark, teaching at the government
occupational health institute there.
</P>
<P>
   Karasek said NIOSH's entire budget would barely pay for one of
the comprehensive studies now going on in Europe and Japan,
involving tens of thousands of workers, to assess the effects of
job strain on such things as heart disease and absenteeism. The US
government used to fund large-scale occupational health studies but
stopped about 20 years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   NIOSH's Rosenstock acknowledged a ``clear underinvestment in
what is needed for the scope of the problem,'' with the agency
spending a little under $2 million a year on studies of job stress
and other issues such as how best to reorganize duties so that
workers have more control over their working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But NIOSH has placed job stress and the organization of work on
a national research agenda, and issued a report entitled
``Stress...At Work'' _ the first of its kind to educate employers
and workers about the causes and prevention of job stress.
</P>
<P>
   While Karasek welcomed the new efforts, he still considers the
funding ``minuscule.'' Regardless of money, workplace changes are
sorely needed, considering the examples of job strain here, said
Dr. Peter Schnall, associate professor of medicine at the
University of California at Irvine and an author of the
hypertension and job strain study.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he cites an automobile plant in California, where
the assembly line sped up so much that employees were timed
spending 58 seconds out of every 60 seconds working. ``Every second
of every minute of every working hour is accounted for in plants
like this,'' said Schnall, who is also director of the Center for
Social Epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
   While those kinds of working conditions have been linked to
repetitive strain injuries, Schnall said, they are ``sort of the
canary in the coal mine'' when it comes to the long-term health
consequences of speeding up workers.
</P>
<P>
   In his hypertension and job strain study, published in October
in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, Schnall and colleagues from
Cornell University monitored the blood pressure of nearly 200 men
for 24-hour periods. Those who had the highest job strain had on
average a systolic blood pressure (the upper number) nearly 12
points higher and a diastolic blood pressure nearly 10 points
higher than those with the least strain.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Schnall said, after looking at all possible causes of
high blood pressure, job strain was found to be more important than
smoking or salt in the diet. The only other major factor was being
overweight, said Schnall, who is an internist.
</P>
<P>
   Karasek is beginning a similar study at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, to assess people's heart
rate based on job strain; the volunteers will use a portable
monitor for 48 hours. But he and his graduate students have found
it difficult to find people in high-strain jobs willing to
participate. ``They say, `We have no time to do this,' '' Karasek
said.
</P>
<P>
   While research exists to support the negative health
consequences of job strain and the prevention strategies available,
Karasek remains disappointed in the US response, compared with that
in Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think the problem is in the United States is the lack
of social dialogue,'' or the willingness of employers, workers,
family members, politicians and the general public to talk about
stress at work, he said. ``It's not that the problem is more
severe. It's that the solution is less likely to be applied.''

HOUSTON: in a turbine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The AutoTrak tool doesn't use a mud motor. Instead, it is turned
by the rotation of the drill pipe. The pads are contained in a
sleeve that doesn't rotate.
</P>
<P>
   Baker Hughes' tool was developed in cooperation with the Italian
company Agip in an effort to deal with slanting layers of rock that
deflected the drill bit from vertical.
</P>
<P>
   The tool was field-tested in Germany, where it is still
manufactured in Celle, an old oil-field town.
</P>
<P>
   AutoTrak is 40 feet long, packed with 14 computers, and weighs
around 5,000 pounds _ about the same as a Ford Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Using this type of high technology can be pricey. The tool rents
for between $35,000 and $40,000 per day, which is about the rental
cost of some entire onshore drilling rigs, according to Haugen.
Customers use it because the tool saves money, he says. It drills
rapidly because it never has to stop in order to change direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Baker Hughes steerable drilling tool proved itself when it
made possible the development of the 1-billion-barrel Troll Field
off Norway in 1994, Haugen says.
</P>
<P>
   Although it stretches for miles, the oil-bearing formation in
the Troll Field is only about six feet thick, he explained. The
drill bit needs to go right down the middle horizontally in order
to drain the oil, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Using onboard instruments, the operator can tell ahead of time
when the bit is heading out of the formation and make corrections
before it is too late. If a measurement called resistivity starts
to drop, it means that you are approaching the layer where the oil
and water make contact, Haugen says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other sensors perform what is called ``logging while
drilling,'' basically creating a record of what was encountered by
the drill bit. Other companies' directional drilling tools also
carry measurement-while-drilling instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the well can be logged with even more complex instruments,
to decide whether it should be put into production or plugged.
</P>
<P>
   A high-tech magnetic resonance imaging tool, which borrows from
medical technology, comes from the Numar subsidiary of Halliburton,
a Dallas-based company.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way that an MRI can visualize bone, water and fat in
a person's body, the tool can see the oil, gas and water in a
formation, says Numar President Manfred Prammer, of Malvern, Pa.
The crude oil is analogous to a person's fat.
</P>
<P>
   MRI logging was tried out in the 1960s, but failed to become a
commercial success at that early stage because it used the earth's
magnetic field, which was too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Numar was the first to use a powerful, permanent downhole
magnet, Prammer says. The company produced the first commercial MRI
log in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   MRI logging has grown to a $100 million business in 1999 with 54
percent held by Schlumberger, 42 percent by Halliburton and 4
percent by Baker Atlas, a part of Baker Hughes, according to a
Raymond James &AMP; Associates estimate.
</P>
<P>
   But high-technology instruments placed deep in an oil well
aren't any good unless you can get the information to the surface
and back.
</P>
<P>
   Copper wire could be used, but cutting and reconnecting the wire
every time you add a 30-foot section of pipe as you drill gets
expensive, says Gary Flaharty of Baker Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the use of mud pulse telemetry, which has been around
since the 1980s. With the aid of computers, unwanted pulses created
by drilling are filtered out.
</P>
<P>
   However, improved technology, such as underbalanced drilling,
can create problems for engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The underbalanced technique uses drilling fluid that weighs less
than the pressure within the formation. The fluid is lightened by
injecting air, carbon dioxide or nitrogen. The technique keeps mud
from clogging the pores in the rock through which oil and gas must
flow.
</P>
<P>
   Also, underbalanced drilling helps to flush away rock fragments,
so they aren't crushed again and again by the bit, allowing it to
plow through rock up to 10 times faster, according to Raymond James
&AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Underbalanced drilling is favored in hard-rock locations such as
the Rocky Mountains. Raymond James expects its use to nearly double
in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   It is an old technology that was reborn during the late 1980s,
particularly in the Austin Chalk area of Texas. Canadian drillers
have picked up the technique with enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem is that underbalanced wells are close to being
blowouts, which occur when downhole pressure overwhelms the weight
of the drilling fluid. Drillers tend to be afraid of them, says
Bergt, especially offshore where a blowout on a big rig would be a
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Lightweight drilling mud also contains air bubbles, which means
it won't transmit shock waves like the old-style mud.
</P>
<P>
   In such situations where mud pulse telemetry can't be used, the
French company Geoservices has developed electromagnetic
transmission, like the low-frequency waves used to communicate with
submarines.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment sends an electromagnetic wave through the earth to
the tool. The tool, in turn, uses batteries to generate its own
signals, which are sent back to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The antenna can be as little as a rod driven into the ground, or
as much as a barbed wire fence with steel posts. These fences, used
in Colombia to keep away troublemakers, make ``fantastic''
antennas, says Marketing Manager Bob Pilko of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like magic to me,'' was the reaction of one client to
the technology, Pilko says.
</P>
<P>
   But electromagnetic waves don't travel well through certain
kinds of rock. Thus, sometimes they can't reach as deep as needed.
His company keeps working on improvements, Pilko says.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligent completions will be the next big development,
according to Bergt of Schlumberger and Flaharty of Baker Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's imminent _ everybody is working on it,'' Bergt says.
</P>
<P>
   With smart wells, sensors deep in the earth would tell someone
sitting at a computer screen such things as how fast the formation
was depleting, or if one portion was being drained too fast.
</P>
<P>
   With a few keystrokes, the engineer could throttle back that
portion or shut the well down completely, while opening up another
zone in the formation. Up to this point, downhole hardware such as
packers, plugs and sliding sleeves have been called ``dumb iron.''
</P>
<P>
   Placing such equipment is beyond difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Doing that kind of plumbing work, through a fairly small hole,
has been compared with ``fixing a car motor through the exhaust
pipe,'' Pilko says.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost overnight, in the late 1950s, the outlook for a baby born
with hydrocephalus improved dramatically, thanks to a treatment as
conceptually simple as a piece of plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Because hydrocephalus _ sometimes called ``water on the brain''
_ is caused by a blockage in the brain's circulatory system leading
to excess fluid pressure, surgeons began installing shunts that
diverted the extra fluid from the brain through a tube into the
abdomen or elsewhere in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Devised by a surgeon who placed one in his son's head, shunts
have made it possible for many hydrocephalic children to grow to
adulthood with relatively normal intelligence and to live pretty
much as other people do. In years past, a child would have been
mentally retarded and lived out his or her life _ vastly shortened
_ in an institution.
</P>
<P>
   Although shunts revolutionized the treatment of hydrocephalus,
they are far from perfect; they can become infected or blocked,
malfunction, be outgrown by a child, or become dislodged. They
often require a few or even numerous surgeries (called revisions)
to fix.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, however, a ``programmable'' shunt valve whose
pressure can be changed simply by holding a magnetic controller
against the head has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. It's already been shown to cut down on the need for
shunt surgeries, and surgeons say they like it because they just
``dial in'' different pressures to see how the patient responds,
instead of having to operate each time.
</P>
<P>
   One recipient of the programmable valve, Lindsay Corkin, 13, of
Hanover, Mass., developed hydrocephalus four years ago from a brain
tumor and had a standard shunt implanted.
</P>
<P>
   She was fine until last year, says her mother, Lauren, when she
began having severe daily headaches and vomiting that got worse,
despite repeated visits to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she became so miserable that Lauren Corkin pulled her
daughter out of summer camp and took her to Children's Hospital,
where a spinal tap showed her fluid pressure was too high. Dr.
Peter Black, a neurosurgeon at Brigham and Women's and Children's
hospitals in Boston, replaced her shunt with a new one equipped
with the programmable valve.
</P>
<P>
   Black set the valve at one pressure level, and following the
operation monitored her condition and reduced the pressure using
the magnetic programmer.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Lindsay has had no more headaches, vomiting or other
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   A Malden, Mass. man with hydrocephalus, 32-year-old Greg Tocco,
says, ``As far as I'm concerned this device has probably saved me a
couple of surgeries'' already, after having had the programmable
valve implanted as part of a clinical trial of the device.
</P>
<P>
   Tocco, who developed the condition after being hit in the head
with a baseball when he was 13, has established the Hydrocephalus
Foundation, Inc., a Saugus, Mass. advocacy group for affected
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our families are very, very pleased with it,'' said
Emily Fudge, executive director of the Hydrocephalus Association in
San Francisco, another support and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrocephalus occurs about once in every 1,000 births, either as
an isolated problem or part of another congenital malformation like
spina bifida or Dandy-Walker syndrome. Often it's not diagnosed
until a child's head continues to grow past normal dimensions. The
condition can also begin in adulthood when blockages of fluid are
caused by tumors, trauma, bleeding or infections.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carlos Hakim, a neurosurgeon, invented the programmable
valve while training in a combined MIT -- Harvard biomedical
engineering program. His father invented an earlier shunt valve,
and after Hakim designed the programmable version, it was then
developed and manufactured in Switzerland by craftsmen previously
employed in watchmaking, Hakim said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The valve, now called the Codman Hakim Programmable Valve System
and sold by Johnson and Johnson Professional Inc., can be adjusted
to any of 18 different pressures using a magnet that's held over
the skin of the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows us to match the pressure to the patient's needs''
without performing an operation to adjust the valve, says Black.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Johnson estimates that $100 million is spent
annually in the United States on shunting operations _ half of it
on revisions. Presumably the valve, by eliminating a proportion of
these revisions, will reduce the need for invasive procedures and
save money.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Madsen, a neurosurgeon at Children's Hospital, says
he has implanted about 20 of the programmable valves. He said they
make it easier to fine-tune pressure inside the brain. For example,
when a patient is bothered by headaches, although the shunt is
doing its job, he said, ``it wouldn't necessarily be worth doing a
whole operation just to see if your headaches would improve'' with
a shunt that has a different presssure.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Hakim valve, he said, ``You could adjust it at a
different pressure, and if it doesn't solve the problem, come back
next week and we'll try another pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Other recent shunt innovations include catheters coated with
antibiotics designed to reduce infections, and a shunt with an
electronic sensor that can transmit pressure readings from inside
the brain to a bedside monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Shunts are made up of a catheter placed through a hole in the
skull into the fluid-filled spaces inside the brain; a small
pressure valve under the skin of the head to control the flow; and
a flexible tube that snakes under the skin of the neck and body to
the abdomen, where it dumps the extra fluid.
</P>
<P>
   By lowering the pressure of the fluid that is squeezing the
brain, shunting vastly reduces the risk of mental retardation,
headaches, gait problems, lethargy and other complications.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they are working well, shunts may have to be replaced
because the pressure inside the patient's brain changes, so that
the set pressure at which the valve opens becomes too high or too
low.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the pressure is too low, and too much fluid escapes from
the brain, the brain collapses around the shunt and you can get bad
headaches'' and other problems, says Black. ``If the pressure is
too high, then the shunt doesn't work and the patient doesn't get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the life expectancy for someone with hydrocephalus
averaged 10 years. But in the last 25 years, the death rate from
the condition has plunged from 54 percent to 5 percent, and the
chance of retardation is down from 62 to 30 percent. And this
almost entirely due to shunting.
</P>
<P>
   Today, ``the first generation of kids who were shunted are now
adults,'' says Fudge at the Hydrocephalus Association. ``With
shunts, many of them are doing very well, but we're just beginning
to learn about the long-term effects'' of the disorder and its
treatment, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Kellie Robinson, the California co-author of a new book on
hydrocephalus, says, ``my head is a little bigger than normal, but
it's not noticeable. To look at me, you wouldn't know I have
anything wrong.'' But she says that she has problems in
concentrating and remembering, and finds mathematical concepts
particularly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Fudge told the FDA at a hearing earlier this year that a
Hydrocephalus Association survey found that ``while most people
with hydrocephalus and their families are grateful that shunts
either provide them with a normal life or saved their life, they
are deeply concerned about revisions, mechanical failures,
infections, long-term complications and the difficulty of assessing
whether or not'' the shunt is working properly.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the fruits of the efforts by surgeons and
biomedical inventors like Hakim appear to be paying off. The
adjustable shunt ``has made a world of difference to this girl,''
says Lindsay Corkin's mother. ``We have our old Lindsay back.''

WHY DOES LIGHTNING ZIG-ZAG? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why does lightning zig-zag? If it didn't, would it affect the
bolt's speed?
</P>
<P>
   M.B., Leominster, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's start before the first zig. When turbulence in the air
sends particles crashing into one another, electrons get ripped
loose and those particles usually end up with either a positive or
negative charge. In a thunderstorm, the particles are usually tiny
slivers of ice, water droplets, or pieces of hail.
</P>
<P>
   In thunderstorms, the heavier particles of hail end up with a
negative charge. They fall to a lower altitude within the storm
clouds, while the updraft winds carry the lighter ice slivers and
frozen water droplets, with a positive charge, higher up. That
creates something like the top and bottom of a battery.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Uman, professor of electrical and computer engineering at
the University of Florida at Gainesville and a world-renowned
lightning expert, explains that the air breaks down and becomes a
conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Like a piece of wire, the conducting air lets the opposite
charges attract, creating a spark. That's the first zig in the
lightning. Zag is created when zig zaps an adjacent chunk of air
that already has the right electrical charge. Remember, the air
where this is happening is churning wildly. So it's almost
impossible to expect all of the particles in the next
electrically-charged chunk of air _ zag _ to be perfectly lined up
with zig when it hits. That's why lightning zig-zags.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My friends say thunder is louder in Buffalo than it is in
Boston. Can thunder be louder in some places than others?
</P>
<P>
   V.W., Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but it's not the geographic location per se that
dictates loudness. Uman of the University of Floriday says that
loudness can vary with atmospheric conditions like humidity and
wind or the stability of the air through which the sound is
traveling, or surface topography, including buildings, that can
intensify or muffle sound waves.
</P>
<P>
   Thunder is exploding air. Since the peak temperature of
lightning in the return stroke, 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit, is five
times hotter than the surface of the sun, and it travels at 20,000
to 60,000 miles per second, it heats up air molecules faster than
they can expand. When they finally do expand _ CRACK! Or BOOM, or
RUMBLE _ depending on what direction the lightning is traveling.
</P>
<P>
   If it is up and down, perpendicular to you, all the shock waves
from the exploding air along the length of the lightning arrive at
your ear about the same time, and you get more of a crack sound.
But for every cloud-to-ground blast, five to 10 bolts of lighting
happen only up in the clouds. Intra-cloud lightning runs horizontal
to you. The first shock waves from the nearest end hit your ear
seconds before the vibrations from the far end. That produces the
more familiar rumble.
</P>
<P>
   Intra-cloud lightning can be tens of miles long, producing a
rumbling thunder that can last more than a minute.

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The weather and my reading mood have matched this long, hot
August: dry, desiccated, a bit severe. I twisted and turned in my
bed at night, unable to get cool even as the air conditioning
hissed and sighed away, and I tried here, there, and nearly
everywhere to find a book or two that gave me unqualified pleasure.
Did I read more critically because of the heat or despite the heat?
Whatever, discontent was the result.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Deaver's work is hailed as ``dazzling,'' ``brilliant,'' and
he is described as a brainy lawyer who quit law practice to write
full time. ``The Devil's Teardrop'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) is his
12th book, and that must be the problem _ too many, too fast _
though I have read only a third of his work, which may also be the
problem: Perhaps this book isn't typical of him. The plot is a
sizzler, as they say on dust jackets. On New Year's Eve, Dec. 31,
1999, in Washington, D.C., a killer mows down a group of people at
the Dupont Circle Metro station, and the mayor, already beleaguered
over an effort to introduce reforms to the city's decaying
educational system, receives a note demanding $20 million. If not
paid, the killer, soon dubbed the Digger, will strike again and
again, every four hours, killing expansively and randomly. Then the
apparent mastermind behind the robotic assassin is killed, run down
by a car, and the Digger, programmed to kill endlessly, simply goes
on. The FBI, special agent Margaret Lukas, and a retired forensic
document examiner must figure out where the Digger will strike next
and stop him.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is chilling, and the buildup holds plenty of
suspense, but the plot manipulation is as robotic as the Digger.
One-sentence paragraphs abound, illogical sequences squirm across
the page, and in the end the Digger proves both less and more
complex then we can imagine. Three times the FBI agents are trailed
by another car or person and never notice; the Digger is fired upon
repeatedly but always slips away into the darkness, the crowd, the
prose. The forensic expert behaves stupidly several times. Tiny
sentences jangle. ``Luke's cell phone rang. She answered. Listened.
Then she said, `Thanks.' She hung up, not pleased.'' This is
suspense? Writing?
</P>
<P>
   Grouchy, grouchy. Jeremiah Healy is one of my favorite writers,
and his John Francis Cuddy series, normally set in Boston, is
attractive and entertaining. In ``Spiral'' (Pocket Books, $23) he
moves Cuddy off to Florida, not for the first time, and disaster
results. The story begins with the death of Cuddy's lover in an
airplane accident. He goes to Florida to forget, and ostensibly to
help an old buddy. The buddy, known as ``the Skipper'' back in
Vietnam, is not at all interesting and everyone around him is
unpleasant. His grandmother had died during a pool party. Perhaps
someone is trying to get at the Skipper. Healy never makes us care
one way or the other in a book that is flaccid, much too long, and
quite without suspense. Take Cuddy back to Boston, please!
</P>
<P>
   And, please, will Howard Engel return to Benny Copperman and
Ontario? Engel is a prize-winning author of excellent mysteries,
but he wants to tell us about the literary life in Paris in the
1920s. ``Murder in Montparnasse'' (Overlook Press, $23.95) gives us
a serial killer, expatriate writers, and some fairly mindless
people. The writing is earnest, the dialogue rehearsed, and one
longs for Benny to return, with all the placid sense of Canada that
Engel has described so well in eight earlier books.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the secret is to read only authors of whom one has no
preconceived expectations. David Ball's ``Empires of Sand''
(Bantam, $23.95) is a first novel, and a splendid adventure tale, a
kind of Count of Monte Christo in imperial dress, beginning in
Paris in 1870 and racing off to the Sahara where two boys, once the
best of friends, become bitter enemies. There are nomadic Tuareg,
there is passionate love, rich writing, a vibrant sense of place,
and much research worn lightly. This is a big book, full of
incident, and precisely what I needed to pull me back from my
despairing thought that I couldn't find anything that really sang.
This is romance at its best.
</P>
<P>
   I also like ``Silent Snow'' (Viking, $24.95) by Steve Thayer,
perhaps because it took me away from August, but more because it
too tells a fine story, which in the end is what this kind of
fiction is all about. Rich Beanblossom, an investigative reporter
in the Twin Cities, must solve the mystery of the disappearance of
his young son from his nursery, and he can do so only by
contemplating the Lingbergh kidnapping. Thayer provides a blend of
history and fiction that is quite satisfying, and between them
Thayer and Bell restore one's faith in the craft of storytelling:
logical yet surprising, cleanly written yet intricately argued,
compelling of locale and enterprising of plot _ just what we need
to end this long hot summer.

TWO YEARS AFTER HER DEATH, LESS ADO OVER DIANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Two years after Britain was swamped by a tidal wave of
emotion over the death of Diana, the people's princess seems to
have been forgotten by a good number of people.
</P>
<P>
   There are no official commemorations scheduled Tuesday, the
second anniversary of the death of the princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   There is no memorial to her in place, and the committee in
charge of putting one up seems paralyzed by indecision. Donations
to the charity created in her memory have fallen off dramatically.
Even the numbers visiting her gravesite at her family's estate at
Althorp have been far below those predicted.
</P>
<P>
   A recent appeal in The Sun, Britain's biggest circulation
newspaper, seemed almost plaintive as it asked readers to send in
their memories of the week Diana died.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when she was killed in a Paris car crash, people
did not have to be asked to volunteer their emotions. They cried in
the streets. More than 1 million bouquets were left at the gates of
the royal family's palaces. Tens of thousands stood in line for
hours to sign books of condolence.
</P>
<P>
   Many say the country has simply moved on. Jonathan Freedland, a
columnist for The Guardian, put it so bluntly that he had to first
stipulate that he was not being facetious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legend of Diana is fading because she is dead,'' he said.
``Alive, her fame rested on novelty, the public appetite for the
next photograph, the new haircut, the latest boyfriend, Tuesday's
twist in the drama. Drained of any chance of newness, the Diana
narrative has dried up.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bitter irony, even Diana's brother, Charles Spencer, who at
her funeral blamed the insatiable appetite of the tabloid press for
hounding his sister to an early grave, concluded that 25,000
tickets to the Diana museum at Althorp remained unsold when it
opened last month because of the lack of publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, the princess was in the newspapers all the time,''
he said. ``It hasn't been like that this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But friends of Diana, especially those who work in the charities
that she took to heart, insisted that the amount of attention being
paid to her memory is scant only when compared to the exaggerated
attention that followed her death and its first anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Scott, communications director for the Diana, Princess of
Wales Memorial Fund, said public attitudes about the memory of
Diana have become ``very respectful, very measured, as they should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said the fund is currently receiving about $50,000 a month
in donations. If that figure held steady for the next 16 months,
the fund would net about $800,000. In the first 16 months after
Diana's death, the fund received $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true to say the money is not coming in like it was. But
we did not expect it to after a certain period of time, and we are
not fund-raising,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fund has raised more than $160 million, most of it on
the sales of licensed products and memorabilia that will continue,
and has distributed more than $33 million to some 150 charities in
Britain and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Even Diana's staunchest admirers, however, acknowledge the
country has moved on and is no longer obsessed by her or the
circumstances of her death. Perhaps the best indicator of that is
the willingness of Prince Charles, Diana's former husband, to make
public his relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles, the ``other
woman'' whom Diana blamed for breaking up her marriage. Not only
did Charles step out in public with Parker-Bowles for the first
time earlier this year, last month he took his sons along with her
on a Greek vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, that would have been widely regarded as an insult
to Diana's memory. But most Britons shrugged it off, believing that
the prince is entitled to the relationship. Initially maligned by
many as a cad who drove his wife to depression, Prince Charles has
become a more sympathetic figure, especially after the emergence of
various accounts depicting Diana as having suffered from
personality disorders. There is a more measured view of him and
Diana.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the crash, which killed not only Diana but
her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and their French chauffeur, many Britons
blamed the pursuing paparazzi for causing her death. But last
week's recommendation by a French prosecutor to drop charges
against the photographers who chased the doomed Mercedes sedan was
greeted mostly with resignation.
</P>
<P>
   There are the inevitable conspiracy theories that Diana was
bumped off by British intelligence agents to prevent her marrying
or having children by a Muslim, theories not dampened by Fayed's
bitter father, the owner of Harrods, London's most famous
department store. But last week's muted reaction to the French
prosecutor's report suggests that most Britons accept that Diana
died because her French chauffeur was drunk and drove too fast in
his attempt to elude photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham Palace, in an official statement, urged that the
anniversary be ``spent quietly.'' Well it should, said critics of
the royal family. Diana's glamour and common touch exposed the
shortcomings of many other royals in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a contingent within the palace that had predicted
Diana's popularity would fade with time. The royals have ridden out
the storm of protest that, in the days immediately following
Diana's death, seemed capable of eroding support for the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Andreou, a 25-year-old London hairdresser, is typical. She
cried when she watched the nonstop television coverage of Diana's
death, the return of the flag-draped coffin, and the dignity of
Diana's sons, Princes William and Harry, as they greeted mourners
outside Kensington Palace. She shook her fist and cheered Spencer
when, in front of the royal family at Diana's funeral in
Westminster Abbey, he blamed heartless members of the monarchy and
media for destroying his sister.
</P>
<P>
   But today Andreou doesn't know how to feel about Diana. She is
sad that Diana died but, frankly, doesn't think about it that
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be everywhere, you couldn't get away from the
story, so you thought about it all the time,'' she said. ``Now you
don't hear about her so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The media most responsible for cultivating her image, tabloid
newspapers and glossy magazines, do the occasional retrospective,
but they focus on the living, not the dead.
</P>
<P>
   One of the tabloids, The Mirror, called on the government to use
public resources to memorialize Diana before it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost as if she had never existed,'' an editorial
complained. ``If we are not very careful, there is a real danger
that she will disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bodell, director of the National AIDS Trust and a close
friend of Diana's, believes it is only natural that the hysteria
and hype that followed her death have subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense she is forgotten,'' said Bodell. ``But anyone who
was touched by the princess has not forgotten her, and never
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana is credited with helping to lessen the stigma associated
with AIDS by touching and comforting people with AIDS. The National
AIDS Trust memorialized her by creating an annual lecture series in
her name. Two months ago, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan gave the
lecture, saying, ``Faced with her example, we simply cannot leave
the neediest on this earth to needless death and degradation. She
gave too much and cared too deeply for us not to honor her memory
with action.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodell said there was little press coverage of the lecture. He
ruefully acknowledges there probably would have been more had it
been about her fashion sense. But Bodell believes that as the years
go by, Diana will be remembered more for her sense of compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``History will be kinder to her because it will recognize the
good work she did on unpopular issues like AIDS, leprosy, land
mines and homelessness,'' he said. ``Five years down the road,
Diana's legacy will be clearer.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, he says, will the public memory of her.

SEEKING SHELTER FOR THE QUAKE`S HOMELESS

<P>
   IZMIT, Turkey _ On a stretch of grassy promenade in front of the
Sea of Marmara, the Meckeli family has built a living room of
sorts, with an overstuffed couch, matching chairs and a small
coffee table holding warm cans of soda.
</P>
<P>
   Their real apartment was made unlivable by the earthquake that
devastated a huge part of Turkey's industrialized region. And now,
like so many others living out in the open air, the Meckelis are
trying to hold on to a semblance of their old life while they wait
for the government to help them build a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that we made it out alive, but sooner
or later somebody has to tell us what's going to happen to us, how
long will we be out here, will we ever get any money for our
losses?'' said Ismail Meckeli, a married factory worker with two
sons.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two weeks after the earthquake, which killed more than
13,000 people and left at least 200,000 homeless, officials are
struggling to come up with a plan to provide housing for quake
survivors who often lost everything.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and the Netherlands have promised prefabricated housing to
ensure that the homeless get out of tent camps by the start of
winter. Other countries have donated money and supplies to help
people get through the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   This is a temporary measure, until the government organizes a
program for rebuilding the 10,000 buildings _ 60,000 apartments _
that collapsed or that were seriously damaged in the 45-second
earthquake that hit Turkey's most industrialized region.
</P>
<P>
   A state minister and government spokesman, Sukru Sina Gurel,
said last week that Turkey planned to provide free housing to those
who had lost their homes, but added that it would be more than a
year before everyone was permanently rehoused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we also have to consider establishing some new
residential areas, because some places were perhaps built on areas
that are too prone to serious earthquake damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Engineering experts warn that before construction starts, Turkey
must put together stronger rules to ensure that buildings can
withstand quakes in this temblor-prone region.
</P>
<P>
   Many engineers say that lax building codes, and unscrupulous
contractors and politicians, contributed to the disaster by
allowing substandard buildings on fault lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned a lesson from this earthquake about how things
should be built, and now the issue is that we want to ensure that
standards are met and that the government institutes necessary laws
for this,'' said Murat Celik, chairman of the Modern Lawyer's
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The association is one of several groups trying to sue the
government _ from Turkey's president to Istanbul officials _ for
not ensuring that buildings were constructed according to
earthquake standards.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits also might help survivors to get compensation.
Because home insurance is rare, and contractors are not required to
carry insurance, few of those who lost their homes can count on
being recompensed for their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated costs to Turkey from the earthquake range from $4.5
billion, for the loss in production, to about $17 billion for the
added damage to apartment buildings and the infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   This is expected to push Turkey's economy this year into a gross
domestic product loss, or ``negative growth.'' But business groups
say the economy should start bouncing back by the year 2001, partly
because of the construction boom that the earthquake has
necessitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the human tragedy is foremost in people's mind,''
said Erkut Yucaoglu, chairman of TUSIAD, the country's main
industrialists' association.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we would expect a great deal of economic activity over the
next two to four years because of the reconstruction,'' Yucaoglu
said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is also expecting loans and grants to help it shoulder
the burden of rehousing people and restoring damaged
infrastructure. Water lines are still down in most of the quake-hit
region, electricity is just being turned back on, and roads and
bridges need repair.
</P>
<P>
   A team of US engineering experts was in the region surveying the
damage to make recommendations on how Turkey can house people,
given constraints of time and money.
</P>
<P>
   One issue is how many of the damaged buildings _ some of which
were built by people who put in all their savings as an investment
_ need to be torn down and which ones can be reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can put a man on the moon but at what cost?'' said Roger
Sullivan, sent as part of Washington's assistance program to Turkey
after the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an engineering standpoint it's easier to knock down a
building and start again than try and reinforce, but it's tough to
tell people that you're going to wipe out their structure where all
their savings went,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some groups are not waiting for help from the government,
which was accused by many of being slow to react after the
earthquake. Along with volunteers who flocked to the region to
distribute food, water, and clothing, many factories in the Izmit
area have started caring for their displaced workers, setting up
their own tent camps.
</P>
<P>
   This makes sense for businesses eager to get back to work and
worried that their workers will go elsewhere in the search for
temporary shelter, but it also reflects the way in which
nongovernmental groups have jumped in to help survivors while
governmental efforts are still somewhat disorganized.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pakmaya yeast factory in Izmit, a private company that
exports to 100 countries, officials said they were preparing to
break ground to build 80 housing units for workers who lost their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employees contributed to our earnings over the years, and
now it's our turn to share these gains with our workers,'' said
Tuncay Yurdesin, factory manager.

US TRIES TO TURN YUGOSLAV OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ US intelligence agents and State Department
officials, seeking turncoats in hopes of an ouster, have been
contacting associates of President Slobodan Milosevic in his ruling
coalition and in the top ranks of the army, according to officials
in Washington and Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   With the goal of finishing what NATO's 78 days of bombing left
undone _ unseating Milosevic and avoiding a repetition of the Gulf
War outcome of failing to oust a dictator _ US officials have been
``talking to as many people as we possibly can,'' a Clinton
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   A government source in Belgrade confirmed the account: ``The
Americans have been contacting the top officers in the army, saying
to them, `The war crimes indictment list will be extended to 600
names, so you betray the big boss when I tell you, or you'll go to
the Hague.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the source said that many in the government are reluctant to
put faith in the Americans because of past US deals with Milosevic,
including the 1995 Dayton peace accords, and because over the past
12 years Milosevic has shown an uncanny ability to hold fast to
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think this could be the Titanic, and they are being
offered a lifeboat. But they are afraid the Titanic might survive
and they will be stuck in the lifeboat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the behind-the-scenes US efforts to overthrow
Milosevic, complemented by three public meetings with Serbian
opposition leaders this summer in the other Yugoslav republic of
Montenegro, is difficult to predict, according to intellectuals,
opposition leaders, and diplomats in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a diplomat said, ``This is the beginning of the end of
Milosevic. He knows it. But around him is a strong structure of
economic interests, and that is the main problem. They will not
permit him to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and four associates have been indicted on war crimes
charges by the United Nation's International Criminal Tribunal in
the Hague. The diplomat said that since Milosevic cannot leave
Serbia without the near-certainty of arrest, ``He feels now as if
he is in a cage. There's no way out. This is a most dangerous
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months after NATO's last bomb fell on Yugoslavia, other
pressures continue to mount on the Serbian leader. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   --A bitterly divided opposition will try to regroup by starting
daily street protects beginning Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   --The country's bomb-damaged electric power system could
collapse when demand rises in winter, leaving many without heat and
potentially fueling domestic unrest.
</P>
<P>
   --Financial reserves are down to a reported $150 million.
Without new funds or substantial United Nations assistance, the
government must make painful choices, such as whether to put money
toward fixing power stations or paying pensioners.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, no one is predicting Milosevic's immiment departure.
</P>
<P>
   His fiercest opponents begrudgingly see him as clever and wily,
and he has two great advantages: He controls the armed forces, and
persistent infighting keeps the opposition divided. A poll released
last week by the independent magazine NIN reflected strong
dissatisfaction with the choice of leaders. Asked whether Milosevic
should resign, 57 percent said yes, 31 percent said no, and the
rest said they were undecided. But asked which opposition leader
could lead the country, 68 percent said none. Twenty percent
refused to respond. The poll's margin of error was not available.
</P>
<P>
   But even opposition leaders do not see much error in the poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic fact is that the majority of people are fed up with
Mr. Milosevic. It's also true that they are not happy with the
opposition groups . . . in part because of the leadership's
vanities,'' said Goran Svilanovic, 35, of the Alliance for Changes,
a coalition of opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Svilanovic, Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia
has seized the initiative by saying it might back early local
elections on Nov. 7. While Svilanovic wants the opposition to unite
and challenge Milosevic in a national election with one candidate
this fall, his coalition is leaning toward boycotting any early
elections with daily street protests, he said. A decision may be
announced early this week.
</P>
<P>
   It is a time of maddening uncertainty in Serbia. Many ordinary
Serbs make passing references to going crazy, and some close to
power have chosen to go elsewhere _ such as Montenegro _ until the
country's future becomes more clear.
</P>
<P>
   One influential leader, Bogoljub Karic, reportedly the
wealthiest man in Serbia, resigned as minister without portfolio to
distance himself from the Milosevic regime, the government insider
and a diplomat said. Karic is in Montenegro, refusing all interview
requests.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty over the country's fate is not entirely
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   In half a year, this nation of about 11 million people has
lurched from one extreme to the other, from war to peace, from the
Serbs' massive ``ethnic cleansing'' of ethnic Albanians from the
province of Kosovo to seeing returning Albanians drive out Serbs,
from censorship of government criticism to large antigovernment
rallies, from the overnight rise of opposition leaders to their
dizzying downfall.
</P>
<P>
   What next? An internal American-backed coup? A civil war? A
million protesters in the streets?
</P>
<P>
   If the outside world is having difficulty making sense of it and
forecasting the future here, so are Serbia's exhausted people. As
they try to sort it out, and as they watch the government and
opposition for signals, they are certain only that Milosevic has
never been weaker _ and that there is no clear path to a
post-Milosevic society.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon last week, after a protest of pensioners in a
downtown square, Gordana Stoyanovic, 50, a former chemist, said she
has a recurring fantasy. It is a Serbian version of the Hollywood
movie character who shouts out his window, ``I'm mad as hell and
I'm not going to take it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People can't organize and do something together, so I think
about demonstrating by myself in front of all the federal
government buildings,'' Stoyanovic said. ``But if I did it, they
would take me away to a lunatic's asylum.''

   She laughed. ``All of us in this country,'' she said, grinning,
``are on the edge of mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade, population 2 million, sprawls out from the confluence
of the rivers Danube and Sava, and on these late summer days all
seems quiet, especially along downtown pedestrian walkways, as
residents sip espresso and mineral water. NATO bombs hit several
dozen targets in the city, and while a few structures such as the
Army and Communist Party headquarters are landmarks of destruction,
bomb damage does not define the looks of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet signs of trouble are elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Lines of cars stretch for a half-mile around gas stations
because of shortages. Pensioners regularly hold protests _ 31 at
last count _ because the government is more than four months behind
in paying them. Police are due two months' back pay. Fresh milk is
almost never in the supermarkets, and farmers take out newspaper
ads saying it won't be available until the government pays a fair
price. Many people sit for hours in cafes, in no rush to go
anywhere. Unemployment, at 26 percent before the war, now is over
50 percent, according to independent economists.
</P>
<P>
   And it's only going to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Winter worries people. Everyone is bracing for a severe shortage
of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The country lost one-third of its electric capacity in the war,
said Momcilo Cebalovic, spokesman for the government-run Electric
Power Industry of Serbia. NATO's new graphite bombs, each
containing three miles of string-like fiber, fell on electric
transformers and power stations, drapping the wires and coils like
bales of cotton candy. On contact, the fiber short-circuited power
facilities, causing widespread damage to Serbia's electrical
system.
</P>
<P>
   This happened four times. Repairs haven't caught up.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate to fix the entire system is about $200 million, $50
million more than Serbia's federal reserves. There's some hope that
a visiting United Nations team will recommend that humanitarian aid
be used for repairing the electrical system. Officials also hope
that Russia will agree to a new natural gas contract, even though
Yugoslavia owes more than $300 million from the last contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wonder about the winter,'' Cebalovic said. ``But we know
that we won't be able to provide electricity for heating for
civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is asking people to switch to wood and coal for
heat, but a group of wood-sellers on the outskirts of Belgrade said
there have been few takers so far. They acknowledged raising the
price for a cord of wood to $60 from $50. And they said with little
apology that the price probably will soar to $120 in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no electricity,'' said Rade Milosauljevic, 48,
as he leaned against his wood-laden truck. ``Everyone is worried,
and everyone is asking what will happen to this country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Milosevic is surviving here,'' said a woodcutter who
identified himself only as Dragan, 38, a father of three. ``We will
probably screw Milosevic eventually. He is screwing us. He'll go
like Ceaucescu _ only even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   (In a 1989 uprising, Romania's dictator, Nicolae Ceaucescu, and
his wife were savagely murdered.)
</P>
<P>
   Considering the divided state of Serbia's opposition,
intellectuals believe a better shot at removing Milosevic rests
with the American effort to get his associates to turn on him.
</P>
<P>
   No one would disclose results of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that Milosevic and his wife are hanging on by their
fingernails for a while longer,'' said a second US official, adding
that classified intelligence reports have said for the last two
months that Milosevic was in deep trouble internally and that there
is increased domestic turmoil between Milosevic and his powerful
wife, Mirjana Markovic, head of the Yugoslav Left Party. The
official said Markovic, a pillar of support for Milosevic during
NATO's bombardment of Yugoslavia, ``has been going into tirades
against him.''
</P>
<P>
   The official declined to give specifics, saying only,
``Milosevic has always looked to her as a sounding board, and that
isn't happening so much now.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, meanwhile, several developments suggest that Milosevic
may be worried about US contacts with those around him.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Milosevic reshuffled his Cabinet, replacing seven
ministers. One of them was Milosevic's predecessor, Zoran Lilic,
who was demoted from deputy prime minister to economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this month, the Globe reported that Serbian
President Milan Milutinovic suddenly was assigned a new security
detail, out of suspicion he may be ready to turn against Milosevic.
Milutinovic was also indicted on war crimes charges by the Hague
Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Jovan Mandic, a former electric department supervisor for the
city of Belgrade, said there is a high chance many parts of the
country's electrical system could simply shut down. The peak winter
electricity load will be 50 percent higher than available supply,
and when demand outstrips supply the system will collapse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, we have been using spare parts to fix problems. Now
there are no spare parts,'' Mandic said on a recent night in the
Belgrade suburb of Zemun, as a harvest moon rose over the Danube.
``All the systems will be destroyed.''

   NEW RELEASES: ``Titanic'' (DVD) _ How many times can they float
this movie? Now it's on DVD, but there are no extra bells and
whistles. They'll probably release the extra features on a future
DVD release. The next time you need a synonym for cash cow, use
``Titanic.''

every minute. It might even dissuade viewers from thinking every
show must be paced like an MTV video.
</P>
<P>
   New Video has also slated two other nonfiction titles for fall
release _ ``Off the Menu: The Last Days of Chasen's,'' set during
the legendary Beverly Hills restaurant's final week, and ``Climb
Against the Odds,'' a moving story of cancer patients climbing
mountains.

   KEYES-PROFILE (Greenville, S.C.) _ Alan L. Keyes, the

Republican primary for president. He gets few cameras at his
events. Political analysts tend to forget him in their
prognostications. Polls show him receiving one percent of the vote,
or less. And when the Log Cabin Republicans, a homosexual group,
issued a news release last week attacking religious conservatives
for intolerance, Keyes didn't even merit a mention. But to his
small yet devoted cadre of followers, Keyes a former Reagan
administration diplomat with a Harvard Ph.D., has something his
fellow arch conservatives lack: mesmerizing oratorical skills
twinned with a messianic vision. By James Dao. (1600 words)

STUDENT'S ``LIGHTNING MACHINE'' INVENTION MAKING SPARKS IN THE
MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SARAH SKIDMORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When you get the Rives family together the sparks fly.
Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Rives, an 18-year-old Lakeside School senior, is the
proud inventor of the ``Lightning Machine,'' an educational toy
being sold through his parent's scientific toy company, Scientific
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   The toy is making sparks on the market too, with more than
30,000 sold since April. It's now in close to 2,000 stores,
including the Discovery Channel and Museum Company stores,
according to Alexander's father, William.
</P>
<P>
   It made the list of ``Best Children's Vacation Products for
1999'' which is produced by Dr. Steven Auerbach, an expert in child
development.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning Machine itself is a hand-held lightning maker,
which has a suggested retail price of $19.98. Children construct
the toy out of plastic tubing, copper wire and copper strips. The
end product is an advanced form of the 18th-century Leyden jar,
which is the world's first device to store electricity.
</P>
<P>
   To make lightning, the toy is run across a television screen to
collect the electrons and then the two copper covered spheres at
the top are touched together to create a lightning bolt.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's father previously considered creating a
lightning-related toy but nothing was ever constructed. However,
Alexander did not brainstorm long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't have much homework one week and we were studying
Leyden jars and capacitors in school and it just sort of
happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He started with a prototype created out of foil, a film canister
and a nail. He said the concept and construction was easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alexander has been a great source of ideas in production
development since we started this business. I am very pleased,''
William said. ``But this is the first time he has really followed
it through the entire developmental process.''
</P>
<P>
   Although science is one of Alexander's better subjects, he said
he does not feel it is his favorite subject. He wouldn't divulge
his cumulative grade-point average but admitted it was close to a
4.0. He created the idea himself and went to his physics teacher
just once, not for assistance but to show off his handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   After spending this summer as a volunteer for Earthwatch in
Iceland studying the relationship between glaciers and the island's
volcanoes, Alexander is making plans to create a new volcano toy
for Scientific Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   When he isn't helping with his parent's business, he operates an
Internet business of his own.
</P>
<P>
   His Web site, Bryce's Tips, offers tips on computer generated
graphics (www.halcyon.com/alrives/brycetips/). He is also a member
of the crew team at Seattle's private Lakeside School and is a
recreational photographer.

QUARTET HAS MADE SEATTLE'S PIKE PLACE MARKET ITS SIDEWALK STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIKA HAYASAKI  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On a sunny weekday afternoon, tourists swarm Seattle's
famed Pike Place Market while Clifford Miller, Wil Smith, Levi
Barnes and James Butler seize a spot on the Pike Place sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   After clearing their throats and cracking a few jokes, it's time
to do their thang.
</P>
<P>
   They bust out with a few hit tunes: ``Under the Boardwalk,''
``This Little Light of Mine'' and ``I Got Sunshine.'' Within
minutes they're surrounded by a whooping, clapping, toe-tapping
crowd of nearly 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   When the vibrant quartet, known as A Moment in Time, debuted at
the Market three years ago, they electrified the street performance
scene.
</P>
<P>
   The rhythm-and-blues singers have roused crowds with their
animated performances every afternoon since, usually performing
between noon and 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time we performed we only had three songs. We still
blocked off the street and traffic couldn't get through,'' Smith
said. ``The Market said if we didn't keep people from blocking the
street, we'd have to leave and they would take away our permits.''
</P>
<P>
   The group was started three years ago by Barnes, 54, a friendly
jokester from Tennessee who had been singing alone on street
corners in Pioneer Square for two years.
</P>
<P>
   He ran into Smith, 42, who had just moved to Seattle from
Tennessee and was wandering around First Avenue and Yesler Way.
They decided to form a group and later discovered Miller, 45, a
short man with a powerful voice who was singing alone in front of
the downtown Nordstrom store.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day we were in the elevator at St. Charles Hotel, where
Levi was living, and (Barnes and Miller) started singing. I added a
note and we said, `Wow, we've got something here,' '' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, the three came across Butler, 56, a Louisiana
native, playing the guitar at the Market. After hearing his soulful
voice, they quickly recruited him. His Dixieland musical and vocal
talent added just the right twang to the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I come here, I check them out. I've probably come
to see them nine or 10 times,'' said Pauline Harrison, who lives in
Arizona and owns a second home in Issaquah, a Seattle suburb. ``I
think they're great. I love their voices.''
</P>
<P>
   The foursome have a rare magnetic energy.
</P>
<P>
   On that busy weekday, few people paid attention to the man on
the corner with dancing toy monkeys. A man in a wheelchair who sang
the blues had an audience of three. And an a cappella trio earned a
mere couple of bucks in change.
</P>
<P>
   But A Moment in Time had a tall pile of bills in its plastic
yellow bucket. And the group never fails to attract a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen them before, but I love them,'' said Lasara
Jarvis, an 18-year-old who moved to Seattle from Northern
California a couple of weeks ago, as she danced to their music.
``So far, this is the best part of Seattle. They are down-home and
I love to see someone who is willing to perform their soul out.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they take in more cash than most street performers,
they don't make enough money to pay the bills or cut a CD, which
they estimate will cost about $1,900. Miller works as a carpenter
to support himself, while Butler and Barnes say they are on
disability. The group occasionally performs at weddings and
parties.
</P>
<P>
   They say they don't sing for money or fame, but because they
love to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives me a chance to express myself. And if you're good,
you make some money,'' said Butler, wearing a faded linen shirt
with a pack of smokes in the pocket. ``You work your own hours down
here _ no more than two to three hours a day. And I love music, I
don't know what I would do without it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love making people happy, I can't live without entertaining,
and I can't live without singing. I sing everywhere I go,'' said
Miller, a St. Louis native.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who previously worked as a tree planter in Forks, Wash.,
and used to be a drifter, boasted he's been drug free for 18
months. He used to sing on the street corners of New York, but
didn't make much money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing it for fun, drinking wine and beer on the
corner,'' he said. ``I drifted around for a while and then six
years ago, in Tennessee, I watched them throw fish on the TV (at
Pike Place Market) and I said, `I'm going to Seattle. And I've been
here ever since.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He serenaded twin toddlers who shyly hid behind their father,
and flirtatiously joked with a young lady asking her, ``Are you
Miss America?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to do this forever. It's something I enjoy,
seeing the smiles and making people happy,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   All four say they have music in their blood. Barnes came from a
musical family with 13 siblings. Butler performed in various blues
bands in the 1960s. Smith enjoys writing music in his spare time.
And Miller was raised in the church, where his father was a
preacher and his mother sang in the choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been singing all my life. My daddy was a preacher and
I've been singing since I was 3 years old. I sang in choirs,''
Miller said. ``I used to preach on the street. I was singing all
gospel when I started.''
</P>
<P>
   Passersby, who saunter between shops chatting with each other,
are drawn to the group by their impassioned musical flavor and
dynamic charisma. They glimpse, listen, come closer, stop and
pretty soon they're clapping their hands and dropping money in the
bucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a great rhythm and great voices,'' said Kathy
Thoman, a tourist from Cincinnati. ``And they have fun _ that's the
best part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of A Moment in Time say a CD is in the works, but it
will be a few months before they can take care of technicalities,
such as raising money and obtaining permission to record songs with
copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope for something bigger and better, to get recognized and
recorded. That's every musician's dream,'' Butler said.

NO SOCKEYE SEASON WILL BE DEVASTATING TO MANY FISHERMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLAINE, Wash. _ Nick Karuza and his wife Diedra sat on the aft
deck of their 50-foot purse seiner Alice Anne moored at Blaine
Marina last week and checked the old boat's nets for damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather came from the Croatian island of Vis in the
early 1900s, and he fished for salmon in Puget Sound,'' Nick Karuza
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father fished in Puget Sound for 50 years, and I was 14
when I started fishing for sockeye salmon in Puget Sound, and I'm
53 now.''
</P>
<P>
   But this year, for the first time that anyone can remember,
there will be no Puget Sound fishing season for sockeye.
</P>
<P>
   Karuza, the Alice Anne and its crew will remain idle.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 70 other purse seiners and 150 gill-netters who paid
$630 for licenses will remain at their docks, too.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the last gasp for commercial fishing in Puget Sound,
one of the last of the state's traditional industries struggling to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forecast a run of more than 8 million sockeye for this
season, and it now appears the run is going to be a little over 3
million sockeye and virtually all of those fish are needed for
escapement,'' said Dennis Austin, of the state's Department of Fish
and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore, there is not going to be any Canadian or U.S.
commercial fishery this year. The economic impact will be
devastating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists blame the small sockeye return on 1997 weather
conditions at sea that killed young fish.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, who leads a U.S.-Canada panel overseeing sockeye and
pink salmon from Canada's Fraser River, source of the Puget Sound
sockeye, estimates the value of the lost harvest at ``somewhere up
to $10 million.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karuza and others who depend on the sockeye season, which
typically begins in August, say effects are far greater than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate it will be more like $24 million or $31 million
for some, but that's just the dollar value,'' Karuza said.
</P>
<P>
   He is convinced he will lose the Alice Anne, his Bellingham home
and the way of life his family has lived for almost 100 years. Last
year, Karuza caught fewer than 1,000 fish, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In good times, owners of purse seiners could make $100,000 a
year fishing in Boundary Bay off Point Roberts, a thumb of U.S.
territory jutting south of the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Purse seiner skippers would put a small skiff into the water
behind the larger fishing boat. The small boat would loop a net in
an arc behind the main vessel, forming a net ``purse,'' trapping
fish inside. The larger boat would haul aboard the net and its
catch of fish.
</P>
<P>
   Karuza is not alone in facing hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Anderson placed an advertisement in a local newspaper
offering to give away for free his 58-foot purse seiner Sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an albatross around my neck, and it will spiral me down
to ruin,'' said Anderson, who lives in a camper and showers with a
garden hose.
</P>
<P>
   He is ``on the beach,'' working for $8 an hour training horses
and giving riding lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The Port of Bellingham, which operates the Blaine and Squalicum
marinas, wants $17,000 from Anderson to pay $1,500 in overdue
moorage fees, $8,000 to reimburse the Coast Guard for pumping out
petroleum products from the boat to prevent environmental damage
and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't pay it,'' Anderson said. ``If I could pay that, I'd
pay to have the hull fixed so I could use it for fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Four commercial boats are chained to the dock in Squalicum
Marina, big red impound stickers on cabin windows, for being
delinquent in moorage payments, said Reed Gillig, harbormaster
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chaining up a boat for us is a last resort,'' Gillig said.
``You take away a means of making money to pay the fees and take
away a means for the owner to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   More boat slips are expected to go to pleasure craft.
</P>
<P>
   The port will continue to have income from the rentals, but
Gillig agrees that it won't be from fishermen. Many fishing boat
owners are finding other work ashore these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that from the time I started at the Port
of Bellingham 14 years ago, the fishing fleet has diminished with
the decline of salmon returns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's boat has not been chained to the dock for unpaid
moorage fees but is considered ``not seaworthy and environmentally
dangerous,'' Gillig said.
</P>
<P>
   Karuza estimated that as many as 300 Puget Sound families whose
livelihood is tied to salmon fishing face economic hardship and,
perhaps, bankruptcy by the lack of a sockeye season this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are deckhands and people who sell supplies on the docks
and the fish processors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dodd at the Blaine Marina Fishermen's Wharf sells fuel and
other supplies to fishing boat skippers. He buys fish from the
boats for companies such as Seattle-based Trident Seafoods Corp.,
receiving a commission for each fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get by, but there will be a big loss in income,'' Dodd
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the fishing industry declined, he cut expenses by leasing one
of his two docks to a company buying crab. He diversified by
turning part of his operation into a store selling hardware,
furniture, appliances, televisions and audio equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Walsh, manager of Westman Marine Inc., a Blaine Marina boat
yard, said many of the older wooden hull boats are in disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't make any money so we're handling less and less
fishing boat repairs in recent years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His yard will survive by serving pleasure boats and larger
vessels.
</P>
<P>
   State legislators with ties to the Puget Sound commercial salmon
industry say they are working to ease the hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad has been fishing since he was 16, and he'll be 73 in
September,'' said State Rep. Kelli Linville, D-Bellingham, whose
district includes the Whatcom County fishing boat harbors.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Martin Kuljis, operates Sea-K Fish, a processing
facility on Blaine's Boundary Bay pier.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not out of the salmon business, but he has diversified
because he can't depend on the salmon,'' Linville said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also processes bottom fish, crab and other seafood.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Legislature, she and Rep. Doug Ericksen, R-Bellingham,
have led efforts to obtain financial assistance for people hit by
the decline in the salmon industry.
</P>
<P>
   Linville said she also has been forging a coalition of loggers,
Eastern Washington farmers and other groups crippled by financial
hard times to oppose Initiative 696, which would ban the use of
commercial fishing nets in state waters.
</P>
<P>
   Voters rejected a similar proposal in 1995, but sport anglers
are back for a second try, saying overharvesting by commercial
fishing interests has contributed to the decline of wild salmon
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say nets kill all species indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
   But Aaron Briones and Barney Kieper, deckhands aboard the Alice
Anne, said they separate fish hauled aboard, keeping legal species
and returning others to the water.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will decide Nov. 2 on the measure to ban commercial nets.
</P>
<P>
   Linville said she also has been working to obtain financial
assistance for fishing families, but other state officials said
help won't come quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A program to buy back fishing licenses was part of the
U.S.-Canada Salmon Treaty that went into effect earlier this year,
said Curt Smitch, the governor's special assistant and head of the
Governor's Salmon Recovery Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The status of that is that we have some money in the state
budget for salmon buyback _ about $2 million over three years _ but
it is a bit vague as to whether the Legislature intended for that
to be statewide and go for all fishing efforts or just for the
Puget Sound fishers,'' Smitch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is approximately $15 million in the federal budget that
would begin Oct. 1 this year, but that is all up in the air,'' he
said, noting the House and Senate have conflicting versions of the
bill that will have to be worked out in conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   Karuza, who has a degree in history and education from Western
Washington University in Bellingham, temporarily works maintaining
machinery used in the environmental cleanup after an explosion of a
Bellingham fuel pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   He and others in the Puget Sound fishing industry say they need
more help immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the $630 license, Puget Sound commercial anglers have an
average moorage and web locker bill for their nets of about $3,600
a year, insurance of $1,500 or more, annual gearing their boats for
repairs and maintenance at $1,200, plus home expenses and taxes,
Karuza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure my total expenses come to $31,230 a year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of the issue is most commercial fishers are
already overextended in credit because of past economic disasters.
We're in the same situation as the farmers when there was a buyback
program to help them and the same as the loggers when they got a
buyback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we deserve it, too.''

IMPRESSIONS AT NIGHT: SEATTLE MUSEUM'S LATE-NIGHT SHOW WILDLY
POPULAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Midnight at the Seattle Art Museum, and the place was
hopping. The line snaked out the door, up University Street and
back along Second Avenue on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its history, the museum held an art
marathon to celebrate its immensely popular exhibit,
``Impressionism: Paintings Collected by European Museums,'' keeping
the doors open from 9 a.m. Saturday to midnight Sunday night, when
the show closed.
</P>
<P>
   Looking crisp and clear-eyed, Anna Loper, 89, said she went
Saturday at midnight with her daughter to participate in the
``spirit of a party'' and because the 19th-century French art
movement known as Impressionism is her favorite form of painting.
``It's not as restrained as what came earlier and not as crazy as
what came later,'' she said. The exhibit inspired her to think
about taking up painting herself. ``I've got a couple of years
left,'' she said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impressionism'' drew more visitors to the downtown museum than
any other show in its history, attracting about 316,000 from the
exhibit's opening June 12 to its flamboyant end.
</P>
<P>
   During the 39-hour finale, the show drew roughly 18,000 people,
meaning anyone going late Saturday night to avoid a line was
disappointed. The typical wait was 2{ to 3{ hours, evaporating to
immediate access and no line at all at 4 a.m. and building back up
by 10 a.m. Sunday to a line along University and halfway down
Second Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a yellow T-shirt appropriately inscribed ``Life is
Short, Stay Awake for It,'' Gary Roshak said his long stretch in
line Saturday night didn't bother him. ``How many times can you be
inside an art museum at 2 a.m.?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The same reason drew Sarah Jubinski, 15, on hand with her
friends Aston Edmonds, 15, and Jesse Palek-Zahn, 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in third grade, my favorite book was `From the
Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweller,' by E.L. Konigsburg,''
said Jubinski, brightly. ``It's about a girl who runs away from
home and hides in the Met. Ever since, I've wanted to be in an art
museum late at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds said she went because she likes to be up late and there
aren't that many places to go for ``clean fun at 2 in the
morning.'' Palek-Zahn, a bagger in a grocery store soon to be an
ex-bagger as he leaves to start college in the fall, said he went
to escort the girls and keep them distracted from the wait in line
with tales of strange shoppers, like the woman earlier that day who
had demanded he list the ingredients in honey.
</P>
<P>
   Museum guard and creative writer Yoona Lee said her shift was 9
p.m. Saturday night to 9 a.m. Sunday. About 2 a.m. Sunday, she was
looking a little dazed, but had her journal out to take notes in
case she wanted to write something later.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great crowd,'' she said, looking around.
``Everybody's polite, better than crowds we've seen during regular
hours for this show.'' Consulting her notes, she observed that she
was trying to ``coagulate my thoughts,'' which were slipping away
from her. ``Through the sheer lateness of the hour, the walls are
starting to undulate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying his 3{-year-old daughter Jenai in a backpack, Marshall
Kirkpatrick called the late-night museum show a
``once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I wanted my daughter to be able
to say, `I was there.'''
</P>
<P>
   She beamed down over his shoulder, one arm wrapped around his
neck in what looked like a police choke hold. Looking at her
somewhat warily from his perch in his dad's backpack, Jacob Moran,
also 3{, sported a bruised face acquired earlier in the day when
Jenai hit him with a garden hose. He said he liked the Monets,
adding that there was a Monet in his house ``in Daddy's room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a real one,'' amended his father, Jason Moran. Jacob
frowned, puzzling that over.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Drenkel, 21, could have explained the difference between
a reproduction and an original to him. That's the reason she stood
in line, to see the real thing, that and the fact she and her
friends ``function best at night and travel in packs,'' she said,
gesturing to the motley band beside her. ``You can see these
paintings in books, but I like to see the texture of the brush
stroke up close,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By 3 a.m., Bethany Graves, 23, was getting a reviving massage
from her friend Jill Seager, 22. Coming to the show was Seager's
idea. ``I had a day planner full of Monets,'' she said. ``It got me
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2:30 a.m., Anthony Plank, 17, looked as if he had been ready
to head home hours ago. ``I respect these paintings, but not this
late at night,'' he said. His girlfriend, Denise Junell, 17, said
she had seen a lot of Impressionism in Chicago, and ``there are
only so many a normal person wants to see,'' she said. ``Paintings
of blue sky and green trees, how many do you need?'' Because they
were there with her mom and her aunt, they had no choice but to
wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like surrealism better,'' she said, sagging a little into
Plank.
</P>
<P>
   Past 1 a.m. all over the exhibit, children were starting to
slump. Some stretched out on benches and some were fast asleep in
their parents' arms.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Moore, who had been painting his house all day with his
wife, leaned against the wall and started to slide, eyes closed.
When his wife reached him and gently shook his arm, he opened his
eyes, straightened up and smiled. ``My sister-in-law talked us into
coming,'' he said. ``I'm tired, but this show was worth being tired
for.''

THE REAL QUESTION? MEDICINE, NOT DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's political reporters are on the wrong track. People
don't care if Gov. George W. Bush did foolish things in his youth.
They do care desperately, however, what he and other presidential
candidates would do about health care.
</P>
<P>
   While a scandal-starved press corps prattles on about whether
Bush ever took illicit drugs, a serious nationwide problem has been
rapidly reaching crisis proportions. The record number of
Americans, now estimated at 44 million, without any health
insurance at all _ that, in this summer's trivialized political
dialogue, is the smoldering time bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters paid little attention in May when former U.S. Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop and John C. Baldwin, dean of Dartmouth
Medical School, warned that the health-care situation has become so
grave that it simply cannot be solved by tinkering around the edges
with peripheral reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Both the political media and the nation's lawmakers should have
been awakened to the gravity of the situation by the stirring words
of Dr. Paul Ellwood, the acknowledged founder of the HMO movement.
His ideas spawned the managed-care industry in this country. But
Ellwood warned a Harvard University conference last month that
``uneven health care in the United States is a national disgrace
... unacceptable ... can't be allowed to continue.'' Astonishingly
few pundits noticed.
</P>
<P>
   This man, whose model at Jackson Hole, Wyo., was responsible for
the rampant spread of HMOs, is bitter now that the nation's health
insurance net has deliberately discarded so many of the very people
who need coverage the most. According to Koop, a record 16 percent
of all Americans have fallen through the cracks without any help to
fall back upon.
</P>
<P>
   Ellwood despairs of any major improvement surfacing from within
the profit-driven health system. He says the need has become so
critical that it requires broad government intervention. ``Market
forces will never work to improve quality, nor will voluntary
efforts,'' he declares, predicting foreseeable double-digit
increases in health premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Health is intensely personal. It affects everyone. Hardly
anything can shatter a family's tranquility or threaten its
economic lifeline more catastrophically than a major illness. Yet
whole segments of our society _ self-employed, domestic, workers in
countless service trades, newly created unemployeds outsourced by
the big corporations as a means of reducing payroll _ an entire
culture living on the edges of the new global economy has been
abandoned by health insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely a family anywhere has escaped some cataclysmic illness.
Lucky are we who contracted for coverage years ago and have been
able to hold onto it. I should know.
</P>
<P>
   For 60 years I was never hospitalized. Now, twice in the past
decade I've undergone major surgery for cancer and subsequent
treatment. I'm fortunate to have had good insurance coverage. But
suppose I were a commissioned salesman, or a small businessman, or
a self-employed carpenter or plumber, or someone dropped from
coverage by corporate downsizing. I could have been rendered
penniless.
</P>
<P>
   Even those with coverage in the health-care system often suffer
short-lived security. They live on the precipice of unannounced
change, driven by the profit motive, over which they have no
control.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two Metroplex hospitals canceled their contracts with
managed-care companies. As many as 2,900 patients could be required
to find new doctors or new hospitals, or both.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of thing is going on across the country, as
money-motivated health-care providers vie with hospitals and
predatory nationwide groups buy up community hospitals or drive
them out of business. Often insurance premiums increase while the
number of physicians available to the patient shrivels.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, one of my daughters received a diagnosis of
multiple sclerosis. Twice she has been forced by her insurance
providers to change doctors. Today her company recognizes only one
of this specialty in the entire Metroplex. Kay has heard very good
things about a doctor in Dallas, but the arbitrary rules of the
company make his services inaccessible to her.
</P>
<P>
   The public momentum for change is beginning to reverberate in
Congress. Support is growing for a Patients' Bill of Rights.
Several Republican lawmakers with personal backgrounds in medical
practice have broken ranks with their party to support a Democratic
plan to strengthen protection for all Americans covered by private
health insurance. It would give patients broader rights to choose
their physicians and guarantee that doctors, not insurance company
personnel, determine what care is ``medically necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   One Oklahoma Republican, an obstetrician professionally,
recently told the House about a pregnant patient who'd been exposed
to chickenpox. As her doctor, he had prescribed an injection of
anti-serum. Her insurance company refused to pay, although it
covered obstetric care, saying the injection was not medically
necessary. The serum cost $700, and the mother needed it to protect
her unborn infant.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Charles Norwood, a dentist, rounded up 238
colleagues (19 more than a majority) to join him in sponsoring a
stronger bill than the GOP House leadership wanted. Still, this
measure got nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gregg Ganske, a plastic surgeon, found 285 co-sponsors for
a measure to stop HMOs from imposing autocratic rules on their
doctors to prevent them from even telling patients about effective
treatment options that might cost a few dollars more than the HMO
wants to pay. That bill, too, has gone nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But an undeniable momentum is building, fueled by public unrest.
Something must give. The need to fix an unresponsive system is
urgent. How to do so affordably is what people want to know.
</P>

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Aug. 31:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LIVERMORE-RESIGN (Undated) _ The head of the National
Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore resigns when it is
disclosed that he had never received the doctorate he claimed. The
division he headed is the cornerstone of U.S. nuclear fusion
research with a $1.6 billion budget. By Malcolm W. Browne. (800
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TREE-OF-LIFE (Undated) _ As part of an outpouring of
research that is revolutionizing notions about the genetic,
biochemical, structural and evolutionary relationships among living
things, fungi like mushrooms have now been revealed as being closer
to animals like humans than to plants like lettuce. The revelation
is just one of many emerging new ideas about family ties in the
upper reaches of the earth's 3.8-billion-year-old tree of life, in
particular ties among plants and between them and other higher
forms of existence. By William K. Stevens. (2000 words)
</P>
<P>
   Eds, the two stories above were also listed on AM-NYT-BUDGET.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WEB-MEDICINE (Undated) _ Scores of misleading, inaccurate
statements about cancer and other diseases can now be downloaded in
moments by anyone with computer access to the Internet. A
University of Michigan team analyzed 371 Web page references to one
particular cancer to determine their accuracy. Their search
revealed errors that the authors called ``shocking,'' with about a
third of the references lacking any indication that the information
had been deemed accurate by independent experts through the
time-honored process of peer review. Six percent of the web pages
that were not peer-reviewed contained ``clearly erroneous''
information. In other cases, the information was seriously outdated
or misleading. By Jane E. Brody. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   With
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ This year some 25.5 million
Americans are expected to turn to computers for answers to their
health questions. When the federal government established an online
health information initiative several years ago, 4.8 million people
visited the site in its first 30 days of operation. Health issues,
not weather or stock reports, are the single biggest reason people
now log on to the Internet. But chances are, too, that much of the
information and advice they glean from the computer screen will be
biased, inaccurate and, in some cases, downright dangerous. By Jane
E. Brody. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SKY-MYSTERY (Undated) _ Astronomers think they have solved
the mystery of the mysterious object that has confounded them ever
since its discovery three years ago. It's not any kind of star or
galaxy. Nor is it some entirely new celestial phenomenon. As a few
astronomers had suspected, the object is almost certainly an
extremely rare type of quasar. By John Noble Wilford. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MULTICELL-AMOEBAS When times are good and there are plenty
of bacteria to eat, Dictyostelium discoideum _ a species of soil
amoebas _ are loners. These microscopic one-celled animals are
content to crawl through their environment, absorbing whatever food
they come across. But when famine or other catastrophes strike,
something remarkable happens: using their protruding false legs for
propulsion, the amoebas seek each other out and stick together to
create a multicelled creature that can sense light and heat and can
travel faster and farther than any of its component cells traveling
alone. By Malcolm W. Browne. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ARCTIC-REDTAPE (Undated) _ Of all the adversaries of the
Arctic explorers of the 19th century, the most dangerous foe was
government bureaucracy, according to researcher who found many more
perils as part of government missions. By Michael Pollak. (450
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RUSSIA-ANTARCTIC (Undated) _ As Russia's impoverished
scientific institutions face ever more severe cuts in funding,
Moscow's main station on the Antarctic continent has been forced to
close. If the participation of Russian institutions in Antarctic
research is to continue, scientists say, they will require
increasing international support. By Malcolm W. Browne. (870 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WHALES-HIPPOS (Undated) _ The whale's closest cousin is the
hippopotamus, new DNA testing show. The latest of these studies,
published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
is based on the viruslike elements that have copied themselves
throughout the genomes of many species. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EINSTEIN-PAPERS (Undated) _ This spring the eighth and
thickest installment of the Collected Papers of Albert Einstein was
published by the Princeton University Press in two parts totaling
1,118 pages, carrying Einstein through four of the most heroic and
stormy years of his life, from 1914 to 1918 when, among other
things, he finished work on his crowning achievement, the general
theory of relativity. By Dennis Overbye. (2150 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on bird
breeding, reducing phosphorous in chicken manure and ape origins.
By Henry Fountain. (670 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-KIDS-WORMS (Undated) _ A downside to modern hygiene:
Children in relatively wormfree industrialized countries have a
much greater tendency to grow up into adults with autoimmune
disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus and
inflammatory bowel disease than their third-world counterparts,
whose immune systems are constantly exposed to potential pathogens.
By Andy Newman. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PATIENTS (Undated) _ Essay: Another disturbing aspect of
health care is coming up for some needed reform. The chief
executive of the King's Fund, an influential British health charity
and think tank, says it is high time to abolish the word
``patient.'' But more disturbing is the choice of what to replace
it with. By Abigail Zuger, M.D. (900 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-DEATHS (Undated) _ Death rates from AIDS in the United

something remarkable happens: using their protruding false legs for

THE SEEDY SIDE OF BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The story was floated deftly, so that it would
sort of stick to the back of your brain rather than hit you flush
in the face. Plus, there were no fingerprints to lead the reader
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The story was that there have been some backchannel discussions
among baseball executives about buying out a few of the straggling
teams, presumably to save their cities the shame of having to
tolerate underfunded baseball any longer.
</P>
<P>
   The four cities mentioned were Kansas City, Minnesota, Montreal
and Oakland. The Royals saw an attempt by a local businessman to
buy the team for $75 million summarily rejected by the owners, the
Twins were rebuffed in their attempt to move to Charlotte, the
Expos are in position to become the first team in nearly two
decades to average fewer than 10,000 per game, and the A's because,
well, they're the A's.
</P>
<P>
   And the one doing the mentioning was an anonymous management
figure who admitted while the chances ``weren't 50-50, they were
better than 20-80.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. In fact, the chances of this are zero, but it does
give you fresh insight into the modern-day owners' thinking.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Partners? What partners?''
</P>
<P>
   Before you get too worried about your favorite team, it should
be mentioned here that nobody in baseball is prepared to pick up
the tab for any of these alleged buyouts, which would total in the
neighborhood of $600 million if only four teams were folded. That
would be roughly $23 million from each of the surviving 26, and
frankly, we don't see a lot of will for that.
</P>
<P>
   But we know why the owners are at least whispering about it.
</P>
<P>
   This last expansion not only gobbled up the last promising city
for baseball (Phoenix) but stuck it with another city that could
take the game or leave it (Tampa-St. Petersburg). In other words,
there are no good places left to go, and too many teams that can't
muster up a good extortion pitch to their cities or politicians.
</P>
<P>
   So of course, confronted by this little conundrum, some
management deep thinkers suggest Plan B _ thinning out the herd.
</P>
<P>
   This wouldn't be much of a story if the A's weren't part of this
alleged discussion. It could hint at one more hurdle for the
Piccinini-Dolich group to clear in its attempt to convince the
owners to approve their $122 million offer to buy the Elephants.
</P>
<P>
   But since the A's are not only making money but actually
contending for a postseason berth, the timing of the story has a
particular poignancy and aroma to it. Aside from the economic and
logistical nightmare (asking Peter Magowan for $23 million to help
the A's get lost is in itself a Lucy skit waiting to happen), the
whole concept has that curiously half-baked taste to it that only
owners with too much time on their hands can produce.
</P>
<P>
   After all, what are the criteria? Not winning? Fine. Lose the
Dodgers, Rockies, Cubs, Orioles and Angels. Not making money? If
you believe the owners, everyone has to fold; if not, why don't you
throw the Marlins, Devil Rays, Tigers, Brewers and Pirates down the
gurgler? Not fashionable enough? The Astros, Rangers, Phillies and
White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   See how easy it is to put someone else on the endangered list
once you get started? Why, if it weren't for the owners' apparent
affection for commissioner Bud Selig, the Brewers would meet every
criterion for extinction, new stadium or no.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, even if you get back to 26 teams, you'll still be
looking at four teams that aren't cutting it with everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what is so special about the Angels or White Sox or
Mariners or Padres? Tradition? Hah! May we refer you to four
divisions, the designated hitter, interleague play, six divisions
and Milwaukee back in the National League?
</P>
<P>
   And what's to say the Giants won't be in trouble in five years,
or the Tigers, or Pirates? They'll all have new stadiums next year,
but what happens in five years' time if they're not playing well?
They won't be drawing well, either, and then they'll become teams
on the extinction bubble too. And if you can do it once ...
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if four teams won't do it, why not eight? Why
not 14? Why not go back to two eight-team leagues and bring back
the Washington Senators, in case you need a little federal
legislation exempting baseball from the laws on inheritance taxes?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, anything is possible in this grand industry, including
euthanasia. And never mind the fact that the problems inherent in
shooting the slackers are currently insurmountable. It's the fact
that someone thought enough of the idea to float the concept in the
media that should make you think, and shake your head in disgust.

IS THIS ABOUT DRUG USE OR HYPOCRISY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the popular rationalizations for demanding that George W.
Bush answer these continuing questions about possible past drug use
is that he supports harsh treatment of drug offenders by the
criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   The theory seems to be that it is hypocritical for an elected
official to believe in punishing people for something that he may
have done at one time or another _ and that the public has a right
to know if the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination is a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   I have no objection to the practice of unmasking hypocrites. I
can say without reservation that unmasking hypocrites is a noble
pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not what's going on here. For one thing, there's
nothing hypocritical about a former drug user supporting tough drug
laws.
</P>
<P>
   For another, there's no indication that the media are concerned
about hypocrisy. There's as much hypocrisy in the media as there is
in any other field of endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   No, this hypocrisy business is simply an excuse invented by the
media to justify their continuing preoccupation with a nonstory
about George W. Bush and his alleged drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The media _ and Bush's political opponents _ may very well
suspect that the public has little interest in a candidate's
long-ago personal failings. But they can safely assume that the
American people have no use for a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   So if they can just convince everyone that the story is about
hypocrisy rather than drug use, they can keep it going a lot
longer.
</P>
<P>
   But if it is hypocritical for public officials to support tough
laws against conduct that they may have engaged in somewhere along
the way, then every member of Congress, every member of every state
legislature, every criminal court judge and every law enforcement
officer who has ever voted for or enforced the laws against drunken
driving should stand up in public and answer the question: Have you
ever driven under the influence of alcohol?
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous, you say? Sure it is _ but no more ridiculous than
the suggestion that a politician who may have used illegal drugs
many years ago is now a hypocrite because he supports drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has confessed to abusing booze when he was younger. Is it
hypocritical for him to support enforcement of laws against drunken
driving and underage drinking? Of course not. And no one has even
suggested such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   But there's an aspect of this flap over Bush and drugs that's
even more distressing than the phony charge of hypocrisy: the
suggestion that certain categories of personal conduct have become
legitimate or even mandatory areas of inquiry for presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Do most voters really want to know if some candidate for the
nation's highest office may have once upon a time smoked marijuana
or snorted cocaine or cheated on a spouse? A case can be made that
such behavior is relevant if it is current or recent _ but 25 years
ago? Now that's ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   And who gets to decide which areas of conduct are fair game for
inquiry? If we're asking about drug use and adultery, shouldn't we
also ask about domestic violence, alcohol abuse, exotic sexual
proclivities, underhanded business dealings, pathological lying,
reckless driving, speeding, road rage and stealing paper clips at
the office?
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't the list go on forever?
</P>
<P>
   With so many personal questions to ask, will there ever be time
to ask candidates where they stand on balanced budgets, military
preparedness, foreign policy, taxes, federal debt?
</P>
<P>
   By the time we get through examining and analyzing the personal
shortcomings of all the folks who want to be president, will there
be a moment or two left over to wonder about their actual
qualifications to serve as chief executive of the world's lone
remaining superpower?
</P>
<P>
   The new morality police in the media and politics apparently
believe that voters don't care about real issues. They believe that
all we care about is making sure that we have a president who has
never made a mistake and who will keep his hands off the interns.

CELEBRATE THE GIFTS THE WILDERNESS ACT HAS GIVEN US 
</HEADLINE>

Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Wilderness Act turns 35 years old on Sept. 3. Secretary of
the Interior Bruce Babbitt calls it ``one of the most important
environmental laws of the past half-century.'' Anyone who loves the
outdoors, wildlife and pristine wilderness must agree.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilderness Act created the National Wilderness Preservation
System.
</P>
<P>
   More than 104 million acres of federal public lands have been
classified as wilderness areas under the act, so far. Congress must
approve the designation of any federal land as a wilderness area.
</P>
<P>
   The act required the secretary of the interior and the secretary
of agriculture to review, within 10 years of the passage of the
act, every roadless area of 5,000 acres or more in the federal
lands system to determine the suitability of such areas for a
designation and preservation as wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Wilderness is defined by the act as ``an area where the earth
and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself
is a visitor who does not remain.'' It is further defined as ``an
area of underdeveloped federal land retaining its primeval
character and influence, without permanent improvements or human
habitation, which is protected and managed so as to preserve its
natural conditions,'' and that ``appears to have been affected
primarily by the forces of nature, with the imprint of man's work
substantially unnoticeable.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Babbitt explained the act further: ``The
fundamental premise of the Wilderness Act is that the process of
building roads is a death sentence for an ecosystem. There are all
kinds of scientific studies which show that roads fragment habitat
in a way that leads to the disintegration of the ecosystem. The
grizzly bear is a great example. The grizzly cannot tolerate a
fragmented habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt continued: ``The results of the act in terms of
wilderness speak for themselves. We have fabulous, fabulous lands
which are now protected in perpetuity for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been very little action to approve wilderness areas in
the last two sessions of Congress. And Babbitt expressed his
chagrin at the politics that has held up wilderness designations:
``Too much of the time, it has become an ideological flash point,
rather than an opportunity to work together. We've made almost no
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal agencies that manage public lands _ the National
Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service and the U.S. Forest Service _ each manage whatever
lands in their jurisdiction that have been included in the National
Wilderness Preservation System.
</P>
<P>
   The BLM was not authorized to designate wilderness areas by the
Wilderness Act. It had to wait until the Federal Land Policy
Management Act was passed in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   FLPMA required the BLM to identify wilderness areas. At present,
the BLM manages 622 wilderness study areas (17 million acres) and
only 136 designated wilderness areas (5.3 million acres). Study
areas await congressional action to become wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four federal land agencies, the BLM manages the fewest
wilderness areas. Over a third of the USFWS public lands are now
wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming has no wilderfess areas managed by the BLM. The state
has 42 wilderness study areas comprising less than 600,000 acres
out of the 18 million acres managed by the BLM in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The wilderness areas managed by the National Park Service and
the USFWS are subject to greater restrictions than those managed by
the Forest Service or the BLM. But the Wilderness Act mandates that
all these lands ``shall be administered for the use and enjoyment
of the American people in such a manner as will leave them
unimpaired for future use and enjoyment as wilderness, and so as to
provide for the protection of these areas, the preservation of
their wilderness character, and for the gathering and dissemination
of information regarding their use and enjoyment as wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   In wilderness areas managed by the BLM, one may hunt and fish,
hike, ski, snowshoe, ride horses, take river trips and camp. In
general, no motorized vehicles are allowed in wilderness areas.
That means no off-road vehicles, no snowmobiles and no skidoos.
</P>
<P>
   One cannot hunt in a national park; therefore, hunting is
prohibited in wilderness areas managed by the National Park
Service. The same restriction applies to wilderness areas managed
by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   One may hunt on Forest Service lands; therefore, one may hunt in
wilderness areas managed by the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the restrictions applied to public use of wilderness
areas are consistent with the restrictions that the managing agency
applies to federal lands under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Wilderness areas are the most protected landscapes in the
federal system. And they are large enough areas to be refuges for
plants and animals. They allow ecological forces to work unimpeded
and allow the natural fluctuation of animal and plant populations.
</P>
<P>
   Clean water in New Mexico, in large measure, comes from
wilderness areas. Clean air in Arizona is protected by that state's
wilderness areas. Clean water for Denver and Seattle, again, thank
the wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Wilderness preserved is a gift to each and all of us. Even a
brief visit to a wilderness area can wash away the burdens and
pressures of modern life. Wilderness areas not only protect the
values inside them _ the land, wildlife, air and water -- they also
preserve our connection to all living things and our connection to
the deepest part of ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Wilderness Act, write
your congressional delegation and tell them we need more wilderness
areas and less political partisanship.

CHALLENGING WOMEN TO WALK FOR HEALTHIER HEARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mass., Conn.) (nk) 
 By ALISHA BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women do not need to jog, much less run marathons, to reduce
their chances of heart disease. A survey of more than 72,000 women
ages 40 to 65, published last week in The New England Journal of
Medicine, showed that women who either walked briskly (20-minute
miles or faster) for a minimum of three hours a week, or who
exercised vigorously at least 90 minutes a week, had a 30 percent
to 40 percent reduction in their risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   But getting people to exercise can be as challenging as getting
them out to vote. ``As many as 60 percent of adult women are
sedentary,'' said Dr. Elaine Stone, a health scientist
administrator at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that women are less active than men, and this begins
as early as middle school,'' Stone said. ``About a third to a
fourth of adults participate in no physical activity at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kyme, a vice president at the New York Health and Racquet
Club in Manhattan, says making the decision to be active is the
first step. ``It sounds crazy,'' he said, ``but the first thing is
making that decision. Any exercise routine becomes easy to
procrastinate. You have to say, `It's time I started doing
something _  &UR; now. &LR; ' Then you should consult your doctor. Once you
have the go-ahead, you need a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyme suggested finding a workout partner because people tend to
show up more often when they have an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working out can be anything,'' he said. ``Any form of stress
on your heart in a good way will be good for you. Keep it fun, and
you'll go back. That's what matters in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   The new report is part of the long-running Nurses' Health Study
at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, which is following tens
of thousands of healthy women through the years to determine risks
of certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   It showed that the more exercise people did, the greater the
reduction of their risk of heart disease; walking briskly for five
hours a week cut the risk of heart attacks 50 percent, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But any exercise is better than no exercise: 1 to 2.9 hours of
brisk walking a week brought a 30 percent reduction in heart
attacks and deaths from other coronary problems, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it ever too late to start. Women who started exercising
later in life showed significantly reduced risk as well. ``At any
age,'' said Stone of the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, ``it's
important to be active.''
</P>
<P>
   Terri Cingari, a 61-year-old retiree from Easton, Conn., says
she has been getting up early most mornings for the past 15 years.
She puts on her walking shoes, turns on her Walkman and sets out
for a three-mile walk to the banter of a local morning show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking makes me feel great,'' she said. ``I'd tell everybody
to walk. You don't have to buy anything special. You just get up,
get dressed and go. I really enjoy it, even though some mornings
you don't want to do it at all. And then, once you're going, before
you know it, you find yourself in step.''

THE HAUNTING OF OUR LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 5)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
(Jeffrey McQuain is the author of ``Never Enough Words: How
Americans Invented Expressions as Ingenious, Ornery and Colorful as
Themselves'' (Random House). William Safire is on vacation.) 
 By JEFFREY McQUAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Most individuals arrested by the government,'' a Sudanese
dissident told ABC News, ``are routinely taken to unmarked
buildings we call  &UR; ghost houses &LR; . In these places all forms of
torture are practiced, and sometimes the detainees are killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only houses, however, are being haunted nowadays.  &UR; Ghost &LR; 
expressions have been rising rapidly throughout our language.
</P>
<P>
   The solid word  &UR; ghostware &LR; , for instance, first appeared in
computer lingo a few years ago. In 1996, Time magazine's Techwatch
included `` &UR; ghostware &LR; : technology that is alive and well today
with no one (or almost no one) sensing its presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's spookspeak also contains hyphenated compounds. Martha
Grimes, in her haunting 1996 novel ``Hotel Paradise,'' described
how a dying flashlight points ``its dim  &UR; ghost-circle &LR;  at the
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Most  &UR; ghost &LR;  terms, though, are two-word phrases. The
lexicographer Cynthia Barnhart cites  &UR; ghost nets &LR; , a 1980s term
used by environmentalists for abandoned drift nets that entrap
marine life, and  &UR; ghost children &LR; . Writing for The Atlantic Monthly
in 1994, Xiao-huang Yin examined China's population problems: ``To
get around strict child quotas, villagers often fail to register
the births of their daughters. ... In a village near Baoying, in
northern Jiansu, I found seven such  &UR; ghost children &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The first element of these scare words is nothing new.  &UR; Ghost &LR; 
itself came into Old English as  &UR; gast &LR; , ``soul, spirit.'' Among its
varied meanings are a doubled image on a TV screen and an absent
student counted as being present.
</P>
<P>
   Other English compounds may include words worth looking at for
their intimations of immortality. The lively  &UR; deadline &LR; , for
example, began as a literal term during the Civil War for the
boundary of a prison camp; any prisoner crossing that designated
line would be shot. Similarly, in the early 20th century,
 &UR; graveyard shift &LR;  (now often shortened to ``I'm working
 &UR; graveyard &LR; '') provided a fatal phrase for late-night employment.
But  &UR; ghost &LR;  terms have proved far more pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody said ``boo'' when the English philologist W.W. Skeat
coined  &UR; ghost word &LR;  in 1886. Skeat's term indicated any false
dictionary entry, usually the result of a misprint or misreading,
known in Latin as  &UR; vox nihili &LR; . A current dictionary maker detected
a  &UR; ghost word &LR;  in ``firmwave,'' a misspelling of the computer
``firmware.''
</P>
<P>
   Next came  &UR; ghost town &LR;  and  &UR; ghostwriter &LR;  early in this century,
but the lexical explosion began just a generation ago. Since the
1960s,  &UR; ghost feather &LR;  has been among a dusting of synonyms for
``dust bunny,'' a bit of fluff under furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Then  &UR; ghost time &LR;  appeared during the Vietnam War as military
slang for being off duty, and  &UR; ghost town &LR;  was revived to denote a
resort area after its busy season (leading the humorist Richard
Lederer, in his spirited new ``Word Circus,'' to serve up its
spoonerism:  &UR; toast gown &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   The dead-on  &UR; ghost rider &LR;  has also been recently revived. This
expression, first popularized in the 1949 Western song `` &UR; (Ghost)
Riders &LR;  in the Sky'' by Stan Jones, came back in the early 1990s
for insurance fraud; when a bus or train wreck suddenly produces
more victims than the number of actual riders, the added claims are
said to come from  &UR; ghost riders &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Other transportation terms that have come out of nowhere include
 &UR; ghost train &LR; , identifying a train that runs at night to carry
convicts or to keep tracks from being shut down by snow.  &UR; Ghost
train &LR;  is also what London bus drivers call each night's final run,
while  &UR; ghost station &LR;  designates an unstaffed or unused train
depot.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ghost plane &LR; , perhaps based on the Flying Dutchman myth of a
 &UR; ghost ship &LR; , began in the early 1990s for flights without fliers.
During an American Airlines strike in 1993, Michael Riley reported
in Time that ``angry passengers watched helplessly as  &UR; ghost
planes &LR;  _ no flight attendants, no passengers, just baggage _
pulled away from the jammed gates at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Chapman, the slang expert who revised Roget's
Thesaurus, notes the development of ``several dozen  &UR; ghost &LR; 
phrases. They have the same general semantic core: either something
that was once alive and is now dead (like  &UR; ghost town &LR; ) or
something that is mysterious or evanescent.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the popularity of these terms, Chapman adds: ``I
strongly suspect that the prevalence of  &UR; stealth &LR;  has stimulated
the productivity of  &UR; ghost &LR; . Perhaps  &UR; stealth &LR;  became too trendy,
so we consult our mental thesaurus for a way to avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon  &UR; ghost &LR;  may be the word to avoid. In the last decade, Wall
Street has scared up  &UR; ghost stock &LR;  for stock that cannot be
delivered, because it was sold short without being acquired for
delivery. A doctor can perform  &UR; ghost surgery &LR;  on another
physician's patient without that patient's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   In The New Dickson Baseball Dictionary, Paul Dickson reveals
that sandlot baseball games may include a  &UR; ghost runner &LR; , an
imaginary player to enlarge a team's roster. More recent is the
street slang  &UR; get ghost &LR; , a verb phrase meaning ``to leave quickly
or disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne H. Soukhanov, the author of ``Word Watch,'' also calls up
 &UR; ghost band &LR; . That musical noun phrase, she explains, conjures a
``group, especially one specializing in swing, that still bears the
name of its deceased leader and continues to perform with a new
leader and chiefly new members, in the manner of the Nelson Riddle
Orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, any unexpected reversal or change of direction is
called a  &UR; ghost turn &LR; . The ubiquitous signal of  &UR; thumbs up &LR; , for
instance, underwent a reversal of meaning a century ago. Until
then, the gesture was an ancient symbol for death or disapproval; a
Roman emperor would turn  &UR; thumbs up &LR;  (not  &UR; thumbs down &LR; ) to
indicate death, and a reverse or  &UR; ghost turn &LR;  produced its modern
sense of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Other supernatural sayings may soon materialize. In fact, these
 &UR; ghost &LR;  terms could be just the first part of the  &UR; phantom &LR;  menace.

BEHAVIOR: WHEN TELEVISION SHAPES A SEX LIFE

<P>
   Eagerly wondering what will happen to Ross and Rachel and
Chandler and Monica after the cliffhanger Las Vegas episode of
``Friends''?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you should not be too eager: Young women who get deeply
involved in the sexual content of television programs are more
likely than others to view sex as recreation, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from the University of Michigan, surveyed 314
college students of both sexes, aged 18 to 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study found that females who are more active viewers
identify with the characters and attribute greater realism to the
portrayals are more likely to see sex as a goal and a game, unlike
a relationship,'' said Dr. L. Monique Ward, an author of the study,
who is an assistant psychology professor at the university. The
study appears in the current issue of The Journal of Sex Research.
</P>
<P>
   Where previous research focused on the role of heavy regular
consumption of television on viewers' attitudes, this study also
explored the role of viewer involvement. Ultimately, the
researchers found that how much viewers were involved, rather than
how much they watched, was a more consistent predictor of sexual
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV may be a contributor to adolescent attitudes and
expectations about sex, especially for women,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a heightened sexual atmosphere,'' she added, ``and
creates an impression that that's how things are in the real
world.''

   SAFETY: Carrying Baggage, the Right Way
</P>
<P>
   In the world of baggage, backpacks are better for joints and
muscles than briefcases and shoulder bags. But if worn improperly,
the backpack has its own perils.
</P>
<P>
   As students are gearing up for school, the American Physical
Therapy Association, a national professional organization, is
warning children and their parents to use care when they strap on
their packs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is increased incidence of headaches,
shoulder pain, upper back pain and lower back pain,'' said Patrice
M. Winter, a physical therapist in private practice in Fairfax,
Va., and a member of the American Physical Therapy Association.
``In my opinion, it's a combination of more time at the computers
and having backpacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Many teen-agers have taken to slinging packs over just one
shoulder, said Ms. Winter, but that could lead to back pain,
strained shoulders and neck, or even scoliosis. Girls entering
puberty should be particularly aware of this danger, she said,
because they already face a greater risk of curvatures of the
spine.
</P>
<P>
   Students should also pay attention to the contents of their
bags, she said, because toting too many heavy textbooks can cause
children to alter their posture, affecting the natural curve of the
lumbar vertebrae, or the thoracic region in the upper back. She
advised students to carry loads no more than 15 percent to 20
percent of their body weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``When bags are overloaded or carried on one shoulder, the fine
balance of their structures are put in stress, and you can have
mechanical breakdown,'' Ms. Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bag should have wide shoulder pads that are well-padded,''
she added. ``But the most important thing is to have a backpack
that is the right size for the child.''

   PERFORMANCE: Double Ironwomen Achieve Their Goals
</P>
<P>
   They never claimed to be great athletes. But in Colonial Beach,
Va., this weekend, two New Yorkers, Patricia Buttenheim and Ann
Snoeyenbos, overcame heat, humidity and schools of stinging
jellyfish to become two of the first American women ever to finish
a ``double ironman'' triathlon: a 4.8-mile swim, a 224-mile bicycle
ride and a 52.4-mile run.
</P>
<P>
   It took Ms. Buttenheim, a 38-year-old registered nurse from
Brooklyn, 31 hours, 38 minutes. ``The hardest part,'' she said,
``was a tossup between the huge jellyfish stinging me on every
exposed part of my body during the swim and the pain in the feet at
the end of my run.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snoeyenbos, a 35-year-old reference librarian from
Manhattan, missed the official cutoff time of 36 hours, but
soldiered on to finish in 37 hours, 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The two friends said they undertook the event to prove that
ordinary people can perform extraordinary feats. They began
training for the competition six months ago, arising at 4 a.m.
every weekday to cycle 40-plus miles around Central Park, then do
an hour and a half of yoga and strength training.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the double ironman, Paul Bedard of Westport,
Mass., finished in 25 hours, 7 minutes. The women's top finisher,
Sylvia Wieneke of Switzerland, placed fourth overall, in 26 hours,
54 minutes.

   What do you want to know about health? How to treat your
arthritis? Which vitamins to take? How to quit smoking? How to find
the best cardiac surgeon? What to do about your anxiety attacks?
Are there any promising new cancer drugs? How to join a clinical
trial? Or are you looking to join a support group of people who
share your health problems? Perhaps you want to buy a prescription
drug or consult a physician about a pressing medical matter without
ever having to leave your home.
</P>
<P>
   You name it, and chances are you'll find it on the Internet.
This year some 25.5 million Americans are expected to turn to
computers for answers to their health questions. When the federal
government established an online health information initiative
several years ago, 4.8 million people visited the site in its first
30 days of operation. Health issues, not weather or stock reports,
are a major reason people now log on to the Internet. But chances
are that much of the information and advice they glean from the
computer screen will be biased, inaccurate and, in some cases,
downright dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Typical Internet users have no assurance that medical advice
dispensed on the World Wide Web has been properly tested for
effectiveness or safety, and most people lack the expertise to
assess the validity of what they find. Unlike peer-reviewed reports
in medical journals, information on the Web is not screened by
independent experts who can determine whether the conclusions and
recommendations are warranted by the available evidence. There are
no quality standards for statements posted on the Web, and anyone
with some computer savvy _ from ordinary patients and purveyors of
products to top medical experts and government agencies _ can set
up a Web site and promulgate ``facts'' for you and me to find.
</P>
<P>
   As the editors of The Journal of the American Medical
Association put it: ``When it comes to medical information, the
Internet too often resembles a cocktail conversation rather than a
tool for effective health care communication and decision making.
The problem is not too little information but too much, vast chunks
of it incomplete, misleading, or inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some physicians are concerned with the tantalizing reports on
the Internet of unproven ``nontoxic'' remedies for serious health
problems, which may prompt patients to abandon established
treatments. ``Seriously ill people, such as cancer patients, are
particularly vulnerable to unsubstantiated claims about less toxic
therapies and better overall outcomes,'' noted Dr. Maurie Markman,
chairman of hematology and medical oncology at the Cleveland Clinic
Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Internet can be an invaluable source of
facts and guidance for people with all kinds of health problems,
including rare diseases that have baffled their personal
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Jeff Newman, a commodity trader in Chicago,
suddenly lost his voice to an incurable viral condition called
recurrent respiratory papilloma, which caused polyps to form
repeatedly on his larynx. After three operations, Newman sent out
an e-mail query on the Web that led him to a remedy his doctor had
never heard of _ one cup of cabbage juice a day _ and six months
later another computer message directed him to Indole-3 powder
derived from the active ingredient in cabbage, which aborted the
growth of his polyps.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a friend of mine suffering from plantar fasciitis, a
painful inflammation of the tendon that connects the toes to the
heel, derived far more valuable tips on treatment from patients who
posted their own findings on the Web than from his doctor. His
newly found Web friends, not his doctor, eventually cured him.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Web sites uncovered when searching for useful health
information have been established by commercial sources, especially
pharmaceutical companies and producers of vitamins, herbals and
homeopathic remedies. While this does not automatically mean the
information is biased, Web browsers must be constantly on guard
against being steered toward this or that product, which may or may
not be appropriate for the condition in question. As the medical
magazine Patient Care recently noted, ``Web sites are used by
unscrupulous marketers to sell various medications, books and
devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Another common danger is information that is outdated. Unless
Web sites are continually updated with the latest facts and
findings, what you download may be too old to be useful.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no guaranteed route to quality information on the
Web, there are some guidelines that can increase the likelihood
that what you are finding is both factual and useful.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, check the source of the information. Who put
it together? Whom does that person work for? What are his or her
credentials? Who is the sponsor of the site? If it is a business,
what kind of business? Might the tail of potential profits be
wagging the dog? You are most likely to get reliable information
from leading medical centers, university hospitals and government
health agencies, like the National Institutes of Health, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention or the Food and Drug
Administration. But keep in mind that even these sources have
potential biases.
</P>
<P>
   Next, check whether the information is based on reports
published in leading medical journals. If all the references are to
foreign or obscure publications you never heard of, be suspicious.
And, of course, if there are no references, the statements may be
based more on opinion than on fact.
</P>
<P>
   Try to assess the objectivity and comprehensiveness of the
information presented. Keep in mind that there is no way to stop
someone from posing as a medical expert and dispensing erroneous
advice. How many opinions does the advice reflect? A reliable
source is likely to present various perspectives on a health
matter. No one organization has all the answers, and even reputable
sources reflect opinions that may be disputed by other experts.
</P>
<P>
   Is the information current? A Web site on health should be
updated monthly and should state the date of the most recent
update.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe everything you read. Maintain a healthy
skepticism. Check out Internet advice with your doctor, and don't
start taking remedies recommended on the Web without first
consulting your doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Be very careful about the growing practice of online medicine. A
doctor who cannot see or examine you physically necessarily lacks
vital information about the state of your health, and is totally
dependent on what you choose to report. This can easily result in
misdiagnosis or improper or even dangerous treatment
recommendations. The same caution should apply to ordering drugs
online. Unless someone is checking you out for potential
contraindications or interactions with other drugs you take, the
consequences can be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Last but not least, Jeanne C. Ryer, author of ``Health Net''
(Wiley, 1997), urges, ``Use your common sense. If something sounds
too good to be true, it probably is.''

JUSTICE TAKES A WALK IN ROBISON CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 17 years the families of Larry Keith Robison's five murder
victims have waited for justice. Tiny measures of it came after two
jury trials found him guilty of killing Bruce Gardner. Numerous
appeals that upheld those convictions helped. But the families
thought they were finally going to get closure on Aug. 17 when a
lethal mix of chemicals was to be pumped into the veins of the
42-year-old murderer.
</P>
<P>
   A surprise ruling by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on a
petition filed the day before execution means that they may have to
wait many more years.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours before the scheduled execution, the appeals court
decided to stay Robison's date with death until doctors can examine
him to see if he's competent enough to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   That decision literally knocked the strength from members of the
Gardner family, who collapsed in a prison waiting room when word
came that their brother's killer had dodged his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been so emotionally traumatic for the victims'
relatives,'' said Melissa Estes, an Oregon attorney who traveled to
Huntsville to be with her cousins, Bruce's brothers. ``If it hadn't
been for the compassion and support of Dan Guerra and the Victims
Services division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, we
would not have made it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Lois Robison, Larry's mother, got her prayer answered, at least
temporarily. She had some highly organized outside assistance in
making that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, the Roman Catholic Church and other
special-interest groups see Larry Robison as an opportunity to make
a political statement about capital punishment at the expense of
carrying out justice for the families of Bruce Gardner, Rickey Lee
Bryant, Gloria Ann Reed, her son, Scott, and her mother, Earline
Barker. Mrs. Robison no doubt welcomes this attempt to go against
the majority of Texans who, in poll after poll, have said they
support the death penalty as a means of exacting punishment for
premeditated, heinous crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Two separate juries and a number of appeals courts found Robison
sane when he committed the crimes, sane when he was convicted and
sane when he was sentenced. But now Robison is allegedly not
competent enough to understand the nature of his punishment and why
it is being imposed, the criteria necessary for execution to take
place, according to Robison's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   William S. Harris, self-described as ``the lawyer who has
represented Larry Robison for the last four years through writs of
habeas corpus in both state and federal courts,'' told a Fort Worth
Star-Telegram reporter on Aug. 21 that he only recently found out
that ``Larry was making statements that suggested he didn't think
he could be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   How convenient for Larry. Why, even Harris admits that less than
two months ago his client was acutely aware of his situation _
enough to try to find a way around his jury-imposed death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't think you know is (that) Mr. Robison, through his
attorneys, offered to plead guilty to the four remaining murders
and accept consecutive life sentences if the state would commute
his sentence to life. This offer was made more than a month and a
half ago,'' Harris wrote in an Aug. 18 e-mail to me.
</P>
<P>
   Problem 1 with this statement: Robison's legal eagles are trying
to undo what 24 jurors decided _ exchange a death sentence for life
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Problem 2: In early July, Robison was competent enough to know
that he was going to die if he and his lawyers didn't come up with
Plan B. For Robison, Plan B is to believe he can't be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go in and out of states of competency mentally in the
criminal justice system all the time,'' Harris wrote. ``In my
experience, it is not uncommon for some of them to go back and
forth from a state of incompetence to one of competence several
times.''
</P>
<P>
   One wonders if this will become a prevalent characteristic among
Death Row inmates with aggressive legal strategists in future
high-profile cases should Robison prove successful. It could rank
right up there with vicious killers suddenly finding Jesus when the
jail gate slams shut. Just as there are no atheists in a foxhole,
there are very few nonbelievers in a prison cell. There could be
fewer competent ones in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The question has never been, nor is it today, whether Robison
slaughtered five people on Aug. 10, 1982. It's whether he can
convince psychologists and a reviewing judge that he's incompetent.
Even if he's found competent, his attorneys will no doubt pursue a
series of appeals that could delay final resolution for years,
according to Tarrant County Assistant District Attorney Greg Pipes.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that the families of the victims feel they've
been betrayed by the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been dragged through this horrible ordeal for 17
years,'' said Estes.
</P>
<P>
   What, exactly, is just about that?

   Breeds Unto Their Own
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have always assumed that familiarity breeds. That is,
if two populations of a species live near each other, they will
eventually mingle and produce offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers from Montpellier, France, studying blue tits on
Corsica, found that for two populations of the birds the island was
hardly a melting pot. The birds, which are highly mobile, lived
just 15 miles apart, one group in a forest of deciduous oaks, the
other among evergreen oaks. Tracking the two populations over six
years, the researchers found little evidence of interbreeding.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, whose paper on the subject appears in the
current issue of Science, discovered that the birds' main food
source, leaf-eating caterpillars, became available a month earlier
in the spring in the deciduous forest than in the evergreen one
(corresponding to the earlier availability of leaves in one forest
versus the other).
</P>
<P>
   The birds breed when food is at its most abundant; therefore,
the two populations have adapted to their distinct food situations,
breeding one month apart. Blue tits from one population have little
interest in the other population at breeding time, helping to keep
them separate. The researchers suggest their work could have
implications for conservation policies that are meant to protect
diversity among species.
</P>
<P>
   Changing a Food Chain
</P>
<P>
   In their short lives, commercially raised chickens eat a lot of
phosphorous, a nutrient that helps their muscles and bones grow.
They also produce a lot of manure.
</P>
<P>
   Putting two and two together, that means manure contains a lot
of phosphorous. Chicken manure is often used as fertilizer, and
phosphorous-containing runoff from fields can pollute streams and
ponds and the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   This is a problem in areas with large commercial chicken
operations. Now scientists at the University of Delaware, working
with the United States Department of Agriculture and researchers
from companies with a stake in the chicken industry, have found a
way to reduce the amount of phosphorous in manure.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists have developed a corn hybrid that contains more
phosphorous that can be digested by the chickens. Regular corn
contains a lot of the element, but much of it is bound to phytic
acid and cannot be absorbed by the birds. The hybrid contains less
of the acid, and thus more of the phosphorous in the corn is
available. The researchers also fed the chickens an enzyme that
helps break down the phytic acid and make even more of the
phosphorous digestible.
</P>
<P>
   Grandfather of the Apes
</P>
<P>
   In the field of ape evolution, it's a jungle out there. The ape
family tree has been pared down in recent times, but millions of
years ago it was a mess, with lots of species around. It was hard
to separate the oreopithecus from the otavipithecus, not to mention
all the other pithecuses.
</P>
<P>
   A new fossil find from Kenya, announced in Science, has helped
sort out one twist of primate evolution. The fossil, a 12 million-
to 15-million-year-old partial skeleton about the size of a modern
baboon, represents a new genus, which the scientists who studied
the fossil named Equatorius.
</P>
<P>
   The find may be most important for what it says about another
fossil ape. By comparing the Equatorius skeleton with the two
species of another genus, Kenyapithecus, the researchers determined
that the more primitive of the two Kenyapithecus species belongs
among Equatorius.
</P>
<P>
   That may not seem like much of a distinction, but making it
frees up paleontologists to look at the remaining Kenyapithecus
species, named wickeri, in a different light. Considering wickeri
on its own, the researchers could see that some of its advanced
features connected it to more modern apes. For one thing, its
dental pattern is close to that of a fossil ape from Turkey,
evidence that wickeri is linked to a great explosion of apes out of
Africa 14 million years ago.

MOTHER ROSARIO HAS RENEWED HOPE FOR MONASTERY AS CUBA CHANGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly three years had passed since the 1959 revolution that
brought Fidel Castro to power.
</P>
<P>
   But the chaos lingering in Haydee Fernandez's native Cuba in
March 1962 was too much to bear. Church land had been seized,
private and secular schools had been closed and open worship
outlawed. The peso, once the equivalent of the American dollar, was
virtually worthless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was in turmoil,'' said Fernandez during a recent
visit to her parents' home in Burleson in North Texas. ``And not to
have freedom of speech and religion was the worst thing that could
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That March, 55 days after requesting a visa, Fernandez boarded a
plane to Florida on the pretense that she wanted to continue her
education. The only things that she was allowed to bring were three
dresses and a pair of shoes _ the ones on her feet. The new clothes
that she had hoped to wear in America were left behind.
</P>
<P>
   For a 17-year-old who admittedly was in love with the material
world, that was as devastating for Fernandez as communism's
invasion of her homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at age 58, the thought is almost too embarrassing for her
to repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very worldly,'' Fernandez said as a smile hid the shame
in her brown eyes. ``I loved my clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fernandez has changed. She is now known as Mother Superior
Maria Rosario, the driving force behind efforts to complete
additions to the Monastery Santa Catalina de Siena in Havana, a
project that began more than a decade ago. She has forfeited all
her worldly possessions _ including her name _ for a life of
introspection, solitude and prayer in a country in which religion
had been outlawed since Castro rose to power.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuba is changing, too, with religious prohibition slowly
being lifted. Winning government approval to make additions to the
monastery and other religious facilities is, perhaps, the single
best example of change in what was an atheist state from the time
of the Castro-led revolution until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   With only two years left in her stay in Cuba and no money,
however, Mother Rosario knows that she faces a formidable task. She
wants to build a 2-story addition to the centuries-old monastery
that would include four additional bedrooms, an infirmary,
wheelchair ramp and library. The estimated cost: $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a lot, but I have faith it can be done,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANSWERING A CALL
</P>
<P>
   Born in Cuba in 1941, Mother Rosario spent half her life in
North Texas with her stepmother, father and two brothers.
</P>
<P>
   She came to the United States first, alone, and lived with other
relatives until her immediate family arrived. Cuba was in turmoil
after the Castro-led revolution, with the Bay of Pigs invasion
having failed to topple him early in 1961. Mother Rosario's
departure from Cuba came only months before the Cuban missile
crisis almost plunged the world into nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly adapted to life in the United States and was working
for Pier 1 in the late 1970s, but her strong religious convictions
led her to follow another path.
</P>
<P>
   She was on assignment as a temporary manager of a Pier 1 store
in Amarillo in the Texas panhandle when by chance she met a
Dominican priest. When she told him about her feelings, he
recommended that she visit the Monastery of the Infant Jesus four
hours away in Lufkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt this calling many times, but I was too busy for that,''
she said. ``I always said, `No, no, Lord.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was while on another assignment in Houston that Mother
Rosario decided to make the trip to Lufkin. She immediately felt at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was not alone,'' she said. ``I felt the Lord was with
me, and he had brought me to the place I was to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother Rosario made four more visits to the monastery. Each
time, the nuns would share their stories and she would share with
them something from her own life.
</P>
<P>
   On Easter Sunday in 1980, she took a leave of absence from her
job with Pier 1, to enter the monastery to begin the process of
becoming a Dominican nun.
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly six years, but eventually, she took the vows of
obedience, which encompass chastity and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very exciting day for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE CHURCH IS ALIVE'
</P>
<P>
   Mother Rosario is sitting in her parents' kitchen in Burleson,
dressed in a white habit and black veil. On her right ring finger
is a single gold band, signifying her marriage to Christ.
</P>
<P>
   She has come home for a short visit to see her father, who is
getting on in years, her stepmother and brothers, Jose and Robert.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Rosario talks openly about daily life in the monastery
but measures her words carefully about life in Cuba, fearing that
what she says might get back to the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   The life that she describes seems almost unbearable. Any hope
for progress that followed the much-publicized visit by Pope John
Paul II a year ago is slowly fading.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Mother Rosario says little has changed either in Cuban society
or in Castro's regime. The Communist Party's rule remains strong,
and life for most people is a daily struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard because life is completely different,'' she said.
``You work, but the pay is very low. Food is rationed. You can't
buy clothing, toothpaste. You have to have dollars. The money in
the nation has no value.''
</P>
<P>
   But like most Cubans, she also believes that things have gotten
better in the past six years, even more so since the pope's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is very much alive,'' she says. ``Mass is full.
People get their children baptized. They have Bible study and
catechism.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she says that this is only a beginning. Mother Rosario
says that when a child reaches 7, the government no longer makes an
allotment of milk for the family. Almost everyone steals to get
things that they can sell for U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part, though, is to live in a place where you don't
have freedom of speech,'' she said. ``Now people are more willing
to say things, but they still see if anyone is listening.
Everything is done with fear and trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is there for the first time,'' she added, ``but they
move a little forward and then back.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SACRIFICE AND REWARDS
</P>
<P>
   Mother Rosario's stepmother hands her a Pepsi from the
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   The soft drink, she says, is a luxury in Cuba. It symbolizes the
kind of sacrifice that she makes day to day to do what she believes
is the Lord's work.
</P>
<P>
   At first, she says, she was drawn back to Cuba because she
wanted to visit her sister, Eva, who has remained there alone, and
nephew, Waldre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also wanted to see my mother's grave one more time (her
mother died when Mother Rosario was 10), and the people I left
behind,'' she said. ``But the longer I was there, the more I felt I
wanted to be there to help, to be with my people, to pray with
them, to help the sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1998, after a year of waiting for permission from
monastery officials in Lufkin, Mother Rosario returned to Cuba for
a three-year posting.
</P>
<P>
   What she didn't expect was to be voted Mother Superior.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big surprise, believe me,'' she said. ``I didn't
know what I was getting into when I said yes, but the Lord has
given me the grace to take a day at a time and do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Under her leadership, the nuns at Monastery Santa Catalina de
Siena rise at 5 a.m. and pray for people who leave requests either
in a box on the monastery grounds or on the telephone answering
machine. Seldom, she says, are those prayers specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the world is in need of prayer, and we don't have
to know the specific need,'' Mother Rosario said. ``God knows what
each of us needs.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to praying, the nuns perform physical tasks such as
gardening, sewing habits, making fruit juice and cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   They rarely leave the monastery, and when they do, it's to visit
the doctor or dentist, or to buy groceries. None of them has a
stereo or television in her room, but each nun has a desk clock.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday nights, sometimes during supper, they indulge
themselves and listen to classical music on a small tape recorder.
It's a spartan existence, one still fraught with uncertainty and an
element of danger, but they persevere. Communism and religion are
co-existing in Cuba, and that alone is an accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sacrifice but I don't do it as a morbid thing,'' Mother
Rosario said. ``I really feel the Lord wants me there. I'm trying
to do my best for my people and my country.''

   ``The Parkers'' is a breed of sitcom that has been nearly
nonexistent during the past few television seasons but will
undoubtedly make a comeback over the next two. Uproar concerning
the absence of minority faces on prime-time dramas and comedies
will see to that as networks scramble to present a future world
more representative than the one that, for the time being, looks
like the proverbial polar bear in a snowstorm.

   The question is whether the future of black sitcoms will look
and sound like ``The Parkers.'' UPN was slow in sending a review
tape of Monday's episode, which is enough of a red flag to warrant
concern. But let's be optimistic. Having seen the premiere episode
of this comedy and the introductory, test-the-waters episode of
last season's ``Moesha,'' I have a pretty good idea of what we have
to look forward to. It's isn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Following ``Moesha'' and sitting in the middle of UPN's
segregated Monday of black-oriented programming (hey, why not stay
around for Jaleel White in ``Grown Ups'' and Eddie Griffin in
``Malcolm &AMP; Eddie'' for your black cultchah!), ``The Parkers''
arrives on the shoulders of two amusing women who might be better
digested as bit players to straight-man performers but are much too
much when presented as a tag team.
</P>
<P>
   Countess Vaughn, who played the comedic spark plug on
``Moesha,'' brings her fast-talking, slang-throwing character to
``The Parkers'' as half of a mother-daughter team that has invaded
the local junior college. The running gag here is the educational
setting itself, that the 36-year-old Mom (who just got her high
school diploma, by the way) is hanging out with these young folks
and driving her daughter up a wall. Monday's episode dealt with Mom
and daughter joining the same sorority.
</P>
<P>
   Mom is played by Mo'Nique, a stand-up comic who is a lot like
Thea Vidale, the latest oversized, loud-mouthed, take-no-mess black
female stand-up comic whom the networks deemed a mainstream crowd
pleaser. The creators of ``Thea'' were sensible enough to keep a
lid on Vidale's bulldozing persona, but something tells me that in
the name of ratings, the same restraint might not be exercised
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parkers'' is co-executive produced by Ralph Farquhar, who
co-created ``Moesha'' with integrity and was the mastermind behind
the superb but short-lived ``South Central'' as well as the bland,
but amusing, ``The Sinbad Show.'' I have to say that surprise is my
initial reaction to Farquhar's decision to even put ``The Parkers''
out there, but maybe he'll surprise me.
</P>
<P>
   I always thought that Vaughn's neck-wiggling, bug-eyed Kim was a
change of comic pace on ``Moesha,'' sort of a nod to the fact that,
well, despite the potential stereotype of the sassy black woman,
the Kims of the world do exist. That her character was part of a
balanced set of images made her tolerable and therefore comical.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether we can take Kim and now a larger version
of her as leads who will more than likely fill nearly every frame,
and whether there will be an effort to balance what could very well
be the target of the image police.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the current no-people-of-color debate in this
year's crop of series is what happens when networks dash out and
buy products for the sake of having minority faces. TV's track
record is dismal when airing black-oriented series anyway, so the
thought of networks jumping into the game just to silence the NAACP
is scary.
</P>
<P>
   Then we'll be right back where we were a few seasons ago,
wondering why every black character is a criminal or buffoon and
every Hispanic is the wacky gardener.

SCHOOLS REACH OUT FOR HOMELESS CHILDREN

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ At 6:30 a.m., tiny voices begin to resonate
inside the Presbyterian Night Shelter. Thirty-nine children have
slept there overnight, and more than a dozen are getting ready for
school.
</P>
<P>
   There is no smell of brewing coffee or sizzling bacon. Instead,
the odor of sweat, stale cigarettes and dirty mop water lingers in
the facility hidden on a side street east of downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons as varied as their appearance, more and more
children and teen-agers are being reared in homeless shelters once
occupied mostly by men on Skid Row. Educators in Fort Worth and
nationwide are reaching into the shelters and pulling these
children into classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998-99 school year, the Fort Worth school district
counted 1,470 homeless children among its students. The numbers
this year are higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average age of a homeless person is now 9,'' said June
Davis, the district's guidance program coordinator. ``I am amazed
at how resilient these children are. They tend to make the best out
of the situation they are in.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of children housed at the night shelter recently
swelled to 54, forcing the staff to rearrange the cots on the
concrete floor in the cavernous sleeping rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't make any sense of this,'' said John Suggs, head of
the area's largest walk-in shelter, which serves more than 500
people. ``The only thing we can think of is that people are trying
to stabilize their lives now so that their children can go to
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a booming economy, children end up on the streets, often
with a parent, because of a shortage of affordable rental housing,
a parent's addiction to drugs or alcohol or an attempt to escape an
abusive family member.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off from familiar surroundings, friends or relatives,
homeless children can become alienated. They can't have sleepovers
with classmates. They rarely join scouting groups or after-school
sports teams, and they have no comfortable place to do homework.
</P>
<P>
   They live in uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   But just as a desperate environment can breed apathy and
cynicism, it can also produce remarkable grit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PREPARING FOR SCHOOL
</P>
<P>
   Pam Nesmith wipes the sleep from her eyes and flips on a light
switch inside a mint-green room, not much bigger than a walk-in
closet, on the second floor of the Presbyterian Night Shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Stretched out on a narrow mattress, their feet draped over each
other's legs, are Jeffrey and Ashley, Nesmith's 9-year-old twins.
Nesmith came to Texas from Massachusetts, and the three have been
in and out of shelters since the twins were born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to get up and get ready for school,'' Nesmith says,
nudging them.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley sweeps her strawberry-blond hair from her cheek, sits up
and greets her mother with an angelic smile. Her brother needs more
coaxing.
</P>
<P>
   For Nesmith, the chore of rousing her children and getting them
off to school is the same as for any parent at home.
</P>
<P>
   But there, the similarities end.
</P>
<P>
   The twins just started third grade at Van Zandt-Guinn Elementary
School. Through the school district's homeless program, the two
have received blue-and-white uniforms to wear, a package of
underwear and socks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get dressed now so you can go and brush your teeth,'' says
Nesmith, whose private room is a perk of being on the shelter's
staff.
</P>
<P>
   The children are unfazed by the sounds of a resident vomiting in
the hallway below.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley heads to the bathroom. Wearing too-small sneakers, she
walks past the coughing and scratching vagrants just waking up on
the men's side of the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   There's no bubble bath _ just weary mothers gently brushing
tangled hair.
</P>
<P>
   The school bus will come soon. Waiting along Cypress Street,
both children ignore the people sleeping on the sidewalks. And when
the school bus stops, the twins run to it and plop down next to
other children just picked up from the Union Gospel Mission down
the street.
</P>
<P>
   Nesmith worries about the teasing her children may endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how kids can be cruel,'' she says, waving at the bus
in her tattered cotton nightgown. ``They tease them and call them
shelter kids. It isn't fair.''
</P>
<P>
   When the children leave, Nesmith's smile does, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE VAN ZANDT-GUINN
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning. The 300 students file into the hallways as if
their shoes were made of lead; the weekend seems to have drained
their energy.
</P>
<P>
   A breakfast of toast, cereal and chocolate milk in the school
cafeteria raises their energy a notch.
</P>
<P>
   In uniforms, there is no way to distinguish homeless students
from others. Educators want it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want these students singled out,'' Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   The school bell rings and the students, prekindergarten through
fifth grade, walk single file to their homerooms.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley and Jeffrey are in adjacent rooms. Jeffrey, at least for
now, is tired of his sister's company. She's been pouting all
morning, since she fell down the stairs at the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Ashley reports the mishap to her teacher, Mayme Macon, who
promptly sends her to the school nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Gregorita Smith examines a painful spot on Ashley's back and
notices that insect bites cover her back. She also has bites on her
ankle and arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of things,'' Smith says later. ``The children
come in here with ringworm, ant bites, lice and a number of other
things. One kid came in complaining about his leg hurting, and I
found a scorpion on him, which scared me to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she often serves as the primary medical caregiver for
the homeless students.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley returns to class, and the learning begins.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey, an introvert with bright eyes, appears most comfortable
completing his schoolwork in the computer lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Line the horses up in order,'' the computer screen reads.
</P>
<P>
   Click. Click. Click. The task is done.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Macon has been teaching at Van Zandt-Guinn for more than 20
years and says that meeting the educational needs of homeless
children is a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never know how long they will be with us,'' says Macon, a
certified reading recovery teacher. ``One student came to my
classroom, and he had already lived in seven different states.''
</P>
<P>
   Some homeless students are in school one day and gone the next.
Others show up in the middle of the year. Some students are shy and
don't want to participate in class. Others are bright and fit right
in.
</P>
<P>
   Davis says parenting classes stress the importance of keeping
children in school.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report the Department of Education issued to
Congress last week, homeless children are almost three times more
likely than other students to miss three or more weeks of school
during a three-month period. As a result, the report said, many are
slower to develop language and motor skills and to acquire personal
and social skills.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, the district provides tutors to assess homeless
students' individual needs.
</P>
<P>
   Macon visited the shelters to see firsthand the conditions in
which homeless students live.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an eye-opening experience,'' she says. ``You know about
the homeless adults, but you don't know about the children until
you see it for yourself. It ripped my heart right out.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Macon says, homeless children need a stable home.
But while they are homeless, she says, they need to be in school to
acquire the skills to escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Van Zandt-Guinn has more than 60 homeless students enrolled this
session, the most of any school in the Fort Worth district.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's homeless program, called Give 'Em A Chance,
receives $135,000 in federal funds, most of which provides school
supplies, clothing and field trip money, as well as emergency
medical, dental and eye care, Davis says. The district kicks in an
additional $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters from the Salvation Army attend Meadowbrook
Elementary. Children from Second Chance, an agency that provides
transitional housing for homeless women with children, attend
Sagamore Hill Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   Van Zandt-Guinn is part of the district's Elementary Schools
Initiative, a program started in 1995-96 to help low-achieving,
low-income schools improve.
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Once rated as one of the state's low-performing schools, Van
Zandt-Guinn can now boast that more than 80 percent of its students
passed the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test, earning it a
rating of ``recognized'' from the state for two years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL IS OUT
</P>
<P>
   The view from the bus on the ride back to the shelter is hardly
scenic. The bus passes blighted streets dotted with abandoned
homes, littered streets and vagrants gulping alcohol from bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner _ the usual fare of rice and beans _ is being served when
Ashley and Jeffrey return to the shelter about 3:30 p.m. The twins
frown at the meal and instead race up to their room to watch
cartoons on a small TV with poor reception.
</P>
<P>
   Nesmith wakes from a nap and asks the two about their day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers have told me that the both of them have improved
quite a bit,'' Nesmith tells a visitor, kissing Jeffrey on his
forehead. ``They both work so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, as overnight visitors fill the shelter, the
children are visited by church volunteers who participate in play
groups and help with homework.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Griesemer, 22, is the shelter's case manager. This is her
first job since graduating from Texas Christian University in May.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not tracking down immunization records, birth
certificates and school report cards, Griesemer says, she lends an
ear to the children who want to vent about their day.
</P>
<P>
   She describes them as having hard-earned street smarts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know the ins and outs of the streets,'' Griesemer says.
``The people here don't scare them, and they are not surprised by
their environment. It's a lifestyle they have learned to deal
with.''

   A Great Flood
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do scientists suspect the flood described in the Bible was
caused by an earthquake like the recent one along the Anatolian
fault line?
</P>
<P>
   A. Rising sea levels worldwide are a more likely explanation for
a great flood about 7,500 years ago, or 5500 B.C., that suddenly
inundated areas around the Black Sea. Some scientists suggest it
could have been the basis for flood stories in both the Hebrew
Bible and the Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh, though others say the
accounts came too long after the event to have been inspired by it.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of such a flood were reconstructed by American
scientists from seismic soundings of the sea floor and sediment
data gathered by a Russian research ship in 1993, tracing former
shorelines. The dating of the flood was based on radiocarbon dates
for the transition from freshwater to marine organisms in the
cores.
</P>
<P>
   Before the flood, the scientists say, the Bosphorus was a narrow
spillway carrying fresh water from the Black Sea to the Aegean and
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the data indicate, there was an abrupt rise in the level
of the Black Sea, perhaps a foot a day at the height of the flood,
as the flow of water through the Bosphorus reversed in a great
torrent. In less than a year, the Black Sea became brackish and its
level rose as much as 500 feet. Land around it was inundated at a
rate of a half a mile to a mile a day, leaving about 60,000 square
miles of formerly dry land covered by water.

<P>
   Death rates from AIDS in the United States slowed again in 1998.
But the rates are no longer falling as rapidly as they did from
1995 to 1997, after the introduction of combination drug therapy,
health officials said Monday at a meeting in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And the rate of infection with HIV, the AIDS virus, is no longer
declining and has stabilized, the officials said. About 40,000
Americans have been infected annually in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, AIDS deaths dropped 42 percent from 1996 to 1997 but
only 20 percent from 1997 to 1998, reported the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Although these rates are much lower than they were at their peak
in the 1980s, the slowing rate of decline shows that more
aggressive prevention efforts are needed, officials said. At the
same time, a new method of testing blood has been providing
hitherto unavailable information about trends in new infections and
fresh ways to detect hot spots of infections _ steps that are
expected to help focus prevention efforts on groups in which the
virus is being transmitted most rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of new infections with HIV was ``dangerously
high'' in some areas among young gay men and heterosexual women,
particularly blacks and members of other minorities, participants
at a conference in Atlanta said.
</P>
<P>
   The new studies also showed that the highest rates of HIV
infection were found among men and women who had been infected with
other sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this era of better therapies, it is clear that people are
becoming complacent about prevention,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, who
directs the AIDS program for the CDC in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have offered several explanations why the decline in the
death rates has slowed. One is that a saturation effect has set in:
Most people who know they are infected are already receiving the
newer combinations of drug treatments and are responding favorably,
which has helped reduce the death rate.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, many people are unable to take the large
number of pills prescribed each day according to a rigid schedule
that is often built around meals, or the HIV strains infecting them
are resistant to the drug combinations.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, AIDS deaths dropped by 25 percent in 1998
after falling a total of 63 percent in the two previous years. But
the number of deaths did not drop at all from the first half of
1998 to the second half, said Dr. Mary Ann Chiasson, an assistant
commissioner of disease intervention research at the New York City
Department of Health. And the death rate during the first six
months of 1999 was expected to be about the same as the first six
months of 1998, which would suggest that the rate has leveled off.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, AIDS deaths in New York City dropped sharply from 1995
to 1998, but different groups declined at different rates. White
men had the greatest decline, 83 percent; black women declined 75
percent. But two new studies, from the New York City Department of
Health and the Michigan Department of Community Health, hint that
bisexual practices among black men may lead to a higher rate of
infection among black women, as men are infected by other men and
then transmit the virus to women.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York City study of more than 7,000 men in gay bars
and other meeting places, 20 percent of the black men reported
having had sex with both men and women, compared with 12 percent of
Hispanics and 4 percent of white men.
</P>
<P>
   There was one bright spot: HIV infections in New York have been
decreasing among people who inject drugs, according to a study by
the New York Department of Health AIDS Institute. The decline was
attributed in part to prevention programs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The emphasis on prevention was the impetus behind a four-day
meeting in Atlanta, which began Sunday. Although sessions on
prevention are part of the large international meetings held every
other year and the scores of smaller meetings held each month, AIDS
workers felt that prevention was not getting enough emphasis. So
the CDC and 17 other organizations are sponsoring a national
meeting to focus on scientific efforts to monitor and prevent
infection.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting comes at a time when more people are living with
AIDS and HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC, a federal agency with an annual budget of $2.6 billion,
also is under pressure to justify spending $657 million on AIDS
programs. Nearly seven-eighths of the AIDS budget, $565 million,
was spent on HIV prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we get better treatments, we are naive in thinking we
will wipe out AIDS by treatment alone,'' Gayle said. ``Prevention
perhaps is more important than ever, and we need to elevate its
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Prevention efforts have been hampered by the lack of a national
reporting system for HIV. Since the disease was discovered in 1981,
health officials have tracked the virus by using reported cases of
AIDS. But because drug therapy is delaying or preventing HIV from
progressing to AIDS, new tracking techniques are needed, and health
officials are beginning to use a combination of two blood tests to
estimate the number of new infections.
</P>
<P>
   One is the standard blood test that detects the antibodies that
are formed to fight infections. HIV antibodies develop an average
of six to eight weeks after the virus has entered the body, but
there is no way to tell from a single test when a person became
infected. Because it takes many weeks for the antibody production
to peak, researchers have developed a second test, a less-sensitive
version of the standard one.
</P>
<P>
   When the two tests are done together, scientists can identify
new HIV infections. ``If the first test is positive and the second
is negative, the probability is that the individual got infected in
the last six months,'' said Dr. Robert S. Janssen, an expert on the
tests at the CDC. ``And if both tests are positive, infection most
probably occurred more than six months earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Using these tests, researchers from the CDC led by Dr. Hillard
Weinstock found an annual infection rate of 6 percent among gay men
treated in clinics specializing in sexually transmitted diseases in
Baltimore, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and New Orleans. The
rate was 15 times the 0.4 percent figure for heterosexuals treated
in the same clinics.
</P>
<P>
   And a study by Dr. Sandra Schwarcz of 34,866 men and women
treated in sexually transmitted disease clinics in San Francisco
found an annual infection rate of 1.6 percent. The rate was highest
among gay men who used drugs (8.2 percent); for other gay men, it
was 6.6 percent. People with gonorrhea had an HIV infection rate
five times that of those without gonorrhea (6 percent compared with
1.2 percent). Inflammation from gonorrhea and other sexually
transmitted diseases is believed to enhance the transmission of
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The rates, which were higher than expected, underscored the need
for improved detection and treatment, Gayle said.
</P>
<P>
   In a study in six cities, researchers led by Dr. Linda Valleroy
found ``alarming'' rates of HIV infection in 3,492 gay men, aged 15
to 22 years. Valleroy found that an average of 7 percent of the
participants were HIV-infected and that new infections occurred at
a rate of 3 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
   Young blacks had the highest rates of infection (14 percent)
compared with mixed race (13 percent) and Hispanics (7 percent).
HIV incidence rose with age, rising from 2 percent among
adolescents to 4 percent among young men in their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks represent 13 percent of the U.S. population. But blacks
accounted for 49 percent of AIDS deaths and 48 percent of AIDS
cases in 1998, and are experiencing less dramatic declines in AIDS
deaths than whites, according the CDC.

IN PURSUIT OF AUTOIMMUNE WORM CURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of Western history, the average child walked around
with a bellyful of parasitic worms: pinworms, tapeworms, hookworms.
Then modern civilization came along, put shoes on the children's
feet, installed sewers and stopped using human waste as fertilizer,
and the worms mostly disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be a downside to all this hygiene. Children in
industrialized countries, which are relatively worm-free, have a
much greater tendency than those in other countries to grow into
adults with autoimmune disorders, in which the body makes
antibodies that can cause disease: rheumatoid arthritis, multiple
sclerosis, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is a coincidence, but maybe not. Recently,
researchers at the University of Iowa gave a drink containing the
eggs of helminths, a parasitic worm, to six people suffering from
acute, chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Five went into
remission, and the sixth improved substantially.
</P>
<P>
   None got sick from the worms; all relapsed after the worms left
their systems. ``Every one of those patients is begging to be
re-treated,'' said the lead researcher, Dr. Joel Weinstock.
</P>
<P>
   The sample was admittedly small. But the preliminary results,
which made a big splash at an American Gastroenterological
Association conference in May, could offer hope for the hundreds of
thousands of Americans who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases,
mainly Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, which cause chronic
and often bloody diarrhea, pain and weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very interesting work,'' said Dr. Stephen Hanauer,
co-director of the inflammatory bowel disease center at the
University of Chicago School of Medicine and an international
authority in the field, who was not connected with the study. ``It
needs to be substantiated in controlled trials, but there is some
biologic sense to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstock is one of a growing number of subscribers to what is
known as the hygiene hypothesis _ the idea that the war on germs
and other contaminants is producing some unintended consequences.
</P>
<P>
   A Swedish study in The Lancet, a medical journal, found this
year that children of families that used antibiotics and
vaccinations had more allergies than children of families that
avoided them. And researchers in Israel found that rats raised in
germ-free environments developed more arthritis and diabetes than
other rats.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstock's team believes that Crohn's disease flares up when an
immune system that has evolved to deal with multiple invaders finds
itself unable to adapt to a more sterile environment.
</P>
<P>
   Hanauer says the concept seems sound. ``There are other
potential explanations,'' he said. ``There are a lot of processed
foods in first-world countries, and you're exposed to different
toxins. But this is an interesting concept because it is holistic
across the other immune diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstock got the idea for the worm cure three years ago while
editing journal articles on parasites of the liver and intestine.
In looking over decades of literature, he kept running across the
idea that all well-adapted parasites perform some useful function
for their hosts, if only to assure that the host survives to give
them a home.
</P>
<P>
   He and his colleagues began wondering about helminths, which
have been with humans for millions of years. ``We were racking our
brains trying to think of what the benefits of these guys might
be,'' he said. ``Then the autoimmune disease hypothesis came up.''
</P>
<P>
   The hypothesis is based on the widely held theory that the
immune system, when challenged by an invader, fights back with
white blood cells of the Th1 or Th2 type. Th1 cells attack the
body's infected cells, while Th2 cells go after dangerous microbes
before they even invade the body's cells.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstock believes that inflammatory bowel diseases develop when
the body overreacts to the normal bacteria in the digestive tract,
unleashing a salvo of Th1 cells that end up damaging the colon and
bowel themselves. Helminths, he says, trigger a Th2 response, which
dampens the Th1 response.
</P>
<P>
   The worm cure, if it proves effective, could have the side
benefit of rehabilitating the reputations of parasitic worms, which
have remained widely reviled even as some intestinal bacteria like
acidophilus and lactobacillus have become popular over-the-counter
supplements. The parasites, Weinstock said, have been the victims
of unfair, if understandable, prejudice. ``Some worms do cause
problems,'' he said, ``but some cause very little problems.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he cautioned against ingesting worms without
proper medical supervision. For this reason, he would not identify
the precise species of helminth he uses in his research. ``We don't
want people going off to Mexico or who knows where else trying to
expose themselves to helminths that are not controlled and getting
who knows what kinds of consequences,'' he said. ``If people run
out and get hurt, I'm not going to feel really good about this.''

TIGER ASKS FOR SUBDUED ROAR AT RYDER CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Golf is an old game, but its fans may be younger
than ever. And one 23-year-old is sounding almost fatherly in
expressing concern about where this may lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods was talking specifically about next month's Ryder
Cup in Brookline, Mass., in light of the boisterousness of the fans
during the final hours of his battle with Sergio Garcia at the PGA
Championship two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope our fans won't be as loud as they can be and as
boisterous,'' Woods said recently. ``I don't want them to go
overboard where they are rooting against the other team. Cheer for
both sides. Maybe bipartisan in how loud the roars are. I
understand that. But make sure that you be fair and understand that
golf is a gentleman's sport.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an interesting concept coming from Woods, who many think
oversteps the gentlemanly boundaries with his on-course
fist-pumping. But he was the enemy in his match with Costantino
Rocca in Spain two years ago, and establishes some boundaries of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they don't get out of hand where they are either booing
or yelling for someone to hit a bad shot,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   If he hears any of that next month, at least it should be on his
side. In the meantime, he's heading for San Francisco to present a
junior golf clinic and exhibition at Harding Park on Sept. 6.

ESSAY: PATIENT SUFFERS FROM CONNOTATIONITIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By ABIGAIL ZUGER, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another aspect of health care is coming up for some needed
reform. The chief executive of the King's Fund, an influential
British health charity and research organization, says it is high
time to abolish the word ``patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Derived from the Latin ``patior,'' or ``I suffer,'' ``the word
indicates immediately the unequal nature'' of the relationship
between the patient and the doctor,'' the executive, Rabbi Julia
Neuberger, wrote in the June 26 issue of The British Medical
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are timid, passive, horizontal creatures, while doctors
are powerful, decisive and vertical. This distinction ``may have
sat happily with ancient ideas of respect for doctors,'' Rabbi
Neuberger went on, ``but it fits poorly with modern views of users'
taking an active part in their own health care, and indeed taking
responsibility for some of their own recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Patient'' also implies that the person on the receiving end of
health care is ill. But in fact, Rabbi Neuberger noted, as disease
prevention plays an ever more prominent role, patients are likely
to be at least as healthy as anyone else in the examining room.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``patient'' has to go, what word should replace it?
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Neuberger considered but rejected ``client,'' which she
thought made health care delivery sound like a purely financial
transaction. (Actually, ``client'' derives from the Latin word for
an underling who leans on a patron in a fawning, subservient kind
of way, and has possibly even more unfortunate implications than
``patient.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer'' also struck her as wrong, conjuring an image of the
``constant ingestion of pills and potions.'' She finally settled
for ``user,'' a word that ``despite its lack of elegance,'' conveys
action rather than passive acceptance, confidence rather than
bewilderment, power rather than dependency. ``It could even suggest
an equalization of status between health professional and service
user that is nearer the climate in which modern health services
should be provided,'' she declared.
</P>
<P>
   But who exactly are these ``health professionals''? Our patients
_ that is to say, our users _ used to know us as doctors, dentists,
nurses, pharmacists, therapists. Perhaps we are now called health
professionals to distinguish us from health amateurs: mothers,
grandmothers, patron saints and swamis who have managed to squirm
into our fields without forking over the requisite tuition.
</P>
<P>
   We answer to ``health care providers,'' an optimistic term
evoking a pleasant utopian vision of banquet tables overflowing
with cornucopias of free health, which we periodically restock from
the heavy trays on our shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   One cannot help but feel that some further change in
nomenclature is in order for all of us, so that our usual roles in
modern health care delivery might be reflected more precisely.
</P>
<P>
   One option would be to return to a more technical language, as
is already the custom in operating rooms, emergency rooms and other
rapid-action medical settings. People seeking care there tend to be
called by the pertinent part of their anatomy: the hernia in Room
5, the appendix in the O.R., the rash who just ducked out for a
smoke. But elsewhere in medicine, this approach would transform far
too many people into pains, drips and headaches to be widely
acceptable. It would be equally hard on us providers: I, for
instance, would turn into the prescription pad in Room 2 _ a
depressing if not entirely inaccurate description.
</P>
<P>
   A second approach might be simply to ignore the technicalities
of the relationship. Patients and providers would become friends,
colleagues, associates or longtime companions; we would all be
persons, humans and comrades in health.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as disability and insurance forms, those most
politically incorrect of documents, circulate among us, this reform
would never fly. ``Please have your friend or associate complete
this section'' would reduce us to chaos in a month.
</P>
<P>
   A better plan might be to take a long step back and look at the
realities of our mutual enterprise these days. A classic 1977
collection of essays analyzing the American health care scene was
titled ``Doing Better and Feeling Worse''; to anyone scanning
today's headlines, the phrase still rings true. Health is the still
the pot of gold at the end of an ever more glorious, nebulous and
unsatisfactory health-care rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   Patients pick the name of yet another strange doctor out of a
new care plan's catalog. Doctors scan lists of patients they never
met, and rules they never bargained for. Wonderful new operations
are possible. Magic pills with unpronounceable names flood the
market. Cash registers clink. The invisible ranks of the uninsured
mount.
</P>
<P>
   A new children's hospital slated to open in the Bronx in 2001
plans to distract sick children with a theme of space exploration.
On admission, children will be told they are ``explorers on a
journey to healing'' and will get a passport, a compass and a
periscope to help them navigate. The truth is that every one of us
could use a kit like this for ourselves, for that is what we really
are these days: whatever name we answer to, we are explorers,
fellow adventurers, worried pilgrims all.

CHARGES VOLLEYED IN ARIZONA FIRING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for San Antonio; moved 8/25)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A battle is brewing in Phoenix where Arizona Republic columnist
Julie Amparano, fired last week for allegedly fabricating sources,
is denying the charges and threatening to sue the paper.
</P>
<P>
   According to executive editor Pam Johnson, on Aug. 18 a
senior-level editor informed her of some newsroom fears that
Amparano might be inventing characters in her new ``Conversations''
column. An internal examination of the sources in 11 of her columns
turned up 20 names that could not be traced.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the investigation, Julie offered contradictory
statements about her work that raised futher doubts,'' said a
statement issued by Johnson. ``She also described her reporting
methods, which fell far short of accepted journalistic practices.''
She was fired on Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had a lot of fondness for (Amparano),'' Johnson said in
an interview. But ``nobody is bigger than our public trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Amparano, 39, is a regional director for the National
Association of Hispanic Journalists and a five-year Republic
veteran. Her attorney Stephen Montoya offered a ``flat out denial''
of wrongdoing, saying ``the practices that Julie employed in
writing her feature column are employed throughout the paper.''
Montoya adds that he and Amparano are searching for the sources in
question and ``weighing our options. The possibility of a
defamation action .
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, however, the Amparano furor does not seem to have
stirred up much passion outside the newsroom. As of Aug. 25,
Republic reader advocate Richard de Uriarte said he'd received only
about 20 public comments on the firing. ``In comparison to the loss
of a bridge column, it's nothing,'' he says.

   INDONESIA-TIMOR (Dili, East Timor) _ Proud, optimistic,
determined to have the last word, almost all the registered voters
here in East Timor cast their ballots Monday in a referendum on the
territory's future that one U.N. official said approached a
best-case scenario. For the first time since the U.N.-sponsored
process began nearly four months ago, it was a day largely free of
violence and intimidation by military-backed militias determined to

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Jerusalem) _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders
expressed guarded optimism Monday that they could cinch a deal to
revive the frozen Wye River peace agreement by the time Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright arrives in the Middle East on Thursday.
But as senior negotiators threw themselves into a final round of

Rampant stealing, Khodorkovsky conceded, was certainly bad for
Russia. But, he quickly added, that is not his game _ it was the

SHOULD TAXPAYERS SUBSIDIZE PRIVATE SCHOOLS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In this democracy of ours, some places are
experimentally turning against the free, nondiscriminatory public
schools to prop up private religious schools with taxpayers' money
for individual tuition costs.
</P>
<P>
   If carried out nationally, this shift of educational emphasis
could drain the secular public schools and authorize a widespread
separate religion-based training system for young children at their
most impressionable age.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a federal judge in Ohio said last week that this
notion is constitutional nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   He ultimately allowed Cleveland school officials to go ahead
with plans for a citywide school voucher program that would give
some 3,400 low-income students public money for education in
private schools, most of them religious-based. But in setting a
Dec. 13 trial date for the case, he did not back off his contention
that the program has ``the primary effect of advancing religion.''
</P>
<P>
   His criticism sent an overdue zinger through the political
world.
</P>
<P>
   If he finally rules against the voucher program and is upheld by
higher courts, the decision will be a much-needed legal correction
in a partisan controversy that has pitted Republicans against
Democrats for the past decade. The issue has become a central test
of the direction of education in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP, favored by fundamentalists and the organized Catholic
establishment, wants to encourage religious schools by forcing
taxpayers to subsidize pupils who attend them. Except for
presidential candidate Bill Bradley, the Democrats _ long backed by
the National Education Association, the biggest teachers' union _
want to strengthen public schools with generous aid from the
taxpayers for better teaching tools.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, it does not seem possible to do both
simultaneously. Even if the financial resources were there, the
ideological gap is too enormous to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Both public and private schools are in financial trouble. They'd
like federal help. Who wouldn't?
</P>
<P>
   But one direction represents the American way, and the other a
return to the overbearing religious influence our forefathers and
mothers fled Europe to escape.
</P>
<P>
   The best argument for parochial schools is a practical rather
than theological one. They have a better reputation for discipline
and learning than the public schools. Why not help poor ghetto kids
get the kind of good education at private institutions that rich
kids get? Sob stories about poor minority children in Cleveland
denied a decent education have flooded the media.
</P>
<P>
   But private schools can refuse pupils they don't want and are
not required to educate every dummy on their doorstep, as public
schools are. Nor are they held up as rigorously to media scrutiny
as public schools, which are accountable to elected local school
boards. By their very nature private schools can hide their
decisions and need not obey public antidiscrimination or disability
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, however, really about which school best teaches
reading and writing and arithmetic. It is about the extent to which
public money should be used to expose children to a specific
religious doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that religious schools do not impose their
beliefs on their pupils. This is disingenuous. Even if the message
is not expounded in a classroom textbook, a religious context is in
the atmosphere, the dialogue, the prayerful attitude, the
references, the social pressure. In a learning environment, it does
not take much to make it overwhelming. And we who may not share
those religious views are supposed to pay to spread the word!
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge in Ohio was the second to attack a voucher
plan on the grounds that it violated the constitutional separation
of church and state. The first was a federal court ruling in Maine
earlier this year that three families did not have the right to
spend public money for their children's tuition at a private
Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has just begun a statewide school voucher program pushed
by Gov. Jeb Bush, brother of the would-be next president. This
program is also under a legal challenge. The issue is clearly on
its way to the Supreme Court, which is the final authority on
constitutional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has never displayed much collective respect for the
Constitution, despite rhetorical flourishes about its importance.
Our legislators currently harbor a host of constitutional
amendments that range from the frivolous to the dangerous. So it is
not surprising that the GOP-controlled Congress would demand a
voucher system despite ample warning that it crosses the
traditional line protecting the country from the promotion of any
one specific religion.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have used their voucher vision as an alternative to
financially supporting sensible policies that promote national
testing standards, better salaries for teachers, security systems
to protect students, and anti-smoking and drug campaigns. The
voucher plan gives them an excuse to cut education spending.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, vouchers would reduce public school enrollment,
which affects how much state aid school systems get. Voucher-aided
private schools might also lure away the better pupils, leaving
public schools with the kids with educational and discipline
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But to understand what the voucher champions are really up to,
consider this: Many of them also crusaded for two decades to kill
the Department of Education, downgrading the importance of learning
by taking it out of the Cabinet.

KANSAS TEACHERS VOW TO DISCUSS EVOLUTION UNTIL ORDERED TO STOP

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRATT, Kan. _ Despite controversy and confusion swirling around
her like dust devils in the wheat fields, Lu Bitter, a science
teacher at Pratt High School, is clear about one thing: She will
continue teaching the theory of evolution, as she has for 27 years,
until she is ordered to stop.
</P>
<P>
   And if she was a betting woman, she would wager that across the
state, science and biology teachers will do the same, despite the
recent decision by the Kansas State Board of Education to remove
any mention of evolution from the state's new science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Anything beyond that is, well, evolving.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the state board threw science education in this
state into turmoil and reignited a perennial debate about whether
evolutionary theory or creationism has a place in American
classrooms, teachers and administrators in 304 school districts
across Kansas still are trying to determine what effect the
decision will have on them.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than banning outright the teaching of evolution and
anything related to it, such as the origin of the universe, the
board, in what was described as a compromise, opted to leave it it
up to local school districts to decide if those subjects would be
included in their curricula. It also ruled that no questions on
evolution will be included in standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   In some school districts, this is a problem to face down the
road when they get around to revising their science curricula. But
in some, such as Pratt, which was in the process of doing so when
the state board acted, it has become a volatile, potentially
divisive issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly can't tell you what is going to happen here, mostly
because we haven't seen anything from the state yet,'' said Bitter.
``When we get the standards from the state, we might have some
other theories mentioned more, but I don't think we are going to
have to teach creationism.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. But the teachers in Pratt may have to teach something
closely akin to it.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days before the state board's controversial vote, a small
group of parents in Pratt appeared before the local school board
and requested that a book titled ``Of Pandas and People: The
Central Question of Biological Origins'' be included in the list of
science textbooks to be considered for the proposed new curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it was a legitimate request by parents seeking
input into what books should be used in the classrooms of their
schools. But coming, as it did, so close to the state board's
decision, the request raised questions about whether Pratt, a town
of about 7,000, will become one of the newest battlegrounds in a
war that began nearly three-quarters of a century ago when a
teacher in Tennessee by the name of John Scopes was convicted of
the crime of teaching evolution.
</P>
<P>
   That conviction was overturned and eventually led to a ruling by
the U.S. Supreme Court that teaching creationism violated the
constitutional separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of Pandas and People'' does not posit God as the creator. It
is ostensibly a textbook that promotes the theory of ``intelligent
design,'' or the idea that life is so complex and miraculous that
it could not have come about without the guidance of a master
architect, or some intelligent force.
</P>
<P>
   But it also is widely believed to be the textbook of the
creationists who have tried, unsuccessfully, to introduce it to
schoolbook lists in Idaho, Alabama and Texas and who have sold it
to local school districts in several states. The book is considered
by the National Association of Biology Teachers, among others, to
be little more than creation theory minus the ``creator.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mammoliti, a biologist with the state Department of
Wildlife and Parks who presented ``Of Pandas and People'' to the
Pratt school board early this month, insisted that there is no
hidden agenda in his attempts to get the book on the textbook
lists. He also insisted that the timing of his presentation was
coincidental to the action by the state board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommended `Of Pandas and People' be used as a
supplemental textbook because it provides another interpretation of
the same scientific evidence,'' Mammoliti said. ``We made it clear
that we did not want evolution taken out of the curriculum and that
we thought it important that evolution continue to be taught. We
just think it should be taught in a less dogmatic way.''
</P>
<P>
   There are seven people on the Pratt school district board. Two,
including board President Willa Beth Mills, who reportedly hopes to
see elements of creationism included in the district's science
curriculum, supported including ``Of Pandas and People.'' The other
five have not revealed their thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Which, inevitably, in a small town like Pratt, has led to much
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply don't know what they (the board) are going to do,''
said Bitter, whose husband was a former president of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Koenigs, the assistant superintendent for Pratt schools,
sought to downplay any suggestion that the creationism vs.
evolution issue was causing divisions within the community. However
he acknowledged that the state board's actions two weeks ago had
compromised the district's efforts to write a new science
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our curriculum is on pause until we get the standards from the
state,'' Koenigs said. ``I know that one side of this issue (those
opposed to the teaching of evolution) is claiming a big victory,
but my prediction is that many of the school districts will
continue to teach evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Koenigs also downplayed the importance of the theoretical
creationism/evolution debate to the practicalities of teaching,
pointing out that in Pratt evolution takes up no more than three
days out of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much ado about nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before retiring, Janell Mead spent 20 years teaching evolution
at Pratt High School without community objection. In fact, she
said, the only real controversy to hit the campus before the last
few weeks was when ``secular humanism'' was debated. And even that
was dropped before it became a divisive issue.
</P>
<P>
   Mead, who studied genetics and evolution in college, said she
was concerned that those in the community, like herself, who argued
against creationism would be branded as un-Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not anti-Christian,'' she said. ``I teach Sunday
school. I know I'm not an atheist. In fact I don't think I know any
atheists. I would like to think that they (the creationists in the
community) are a vocal minority, but I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Many school districts across Kansas have gone on the record that
despite the action by the state board, they will continue to
include the teaching of evolution and related subjects in their
curricula.
</P>
<P>
   But Mead and Bitter, both veteran teachers with standing in
their community, and other pro-evolutionists expressed concern
about the effect of the board's action in smaller, more
fundamentally religious communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of the biology teachers in this state are in
small towns,'' said Steve Case, the coordinator for the Kansas
Collaborative Research Network, an Internet research resource, and
one of the members of the team that wrote the original state
science standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to expect a teacher in a particularly religious,
pro-creationist community to stand up and say that evolution is
science and should be taught? I think a lot of teachers are going
to take the path of least resistance and bow to the local
pressure.''

TEXAS TOWN STICKS TO ITS GUNS ON SPANISH-ONLY LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL CENIZO, Texas _ Mayor Rafael Rodriguez and other leaders of
this dusty community founded by immigrants say they never expected
they would ignite a national firestorm over an ordinance requiring
that official town business be conducted in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reported death threats and violence, Rodriguez said
there were no plans to retreat from the ordinance, or another town
law that calls for firing city employees who help the U.S. Border
Patrol apprehend illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they will kill us and burn City Hall,'' the mayor
said Saturday. Alluding to divine powers, he said he was not
worried because ``our security is from above.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who came to the United State illegally but is now an
American citizen, said conducting business in Spanish is necessary
to give more residents an opportunity to understand and participate
in their local government. The mayor himself speaks very little
English.
</P>
<P>
   With 1,500 residents, El Cenizo is home to poverty and unpaved
streets. It began as a housing development, hugging the banks of
the Rio Grande some 10 miles south of Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   The two ordinances, approved by Rodriguez and the city's two
commissioners earlier this month, have made international headlines
and provided talk show fodder across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore-based syndicated show ``Geronimo and O'Meara''
featured El Cenizo on one of its programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your people cannot understand my language, they should get
on their burros and go back to Mexico,'' said a caller to the show,
according to a transcript published by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinances stipulate that city business, including council
meetings, will be conducted in Spanish and that English translation
will be provided with 48 hours' notice.
</P>
<P>
   In compliance with state and federal laws, written ordinances
will be adopted in English and translated into Spanish, according
to documents filed at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the town has been declared a ``safe haven'' for
undocumented immigrants and employees face dismissal if they assist
Border Patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   El Cenizo City Commissioner Flora Barton said there had been as
many as 100 calls about the ordinances, many have laced with hatred
and, sometimes, racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been happening every day,'' said Barton, who said she
received a call from a listener on the ``Geronimo and O'Meara''
program.
</P>
<P>
   In another call, a man threatened her life, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept saying ugly things,'' Barton said during an interview
at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to Mexico; if you do not, you will not be here long,''
Barton recalled being told.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the barrage, a new phone has been installed to
identify the numbers of incoming calls and city officials have been
in touch with law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic groups in New Mexico are demanding that an Albuquerque,
N.M., radio station ban the ``Geronimo and O'Meara'' radio program.
</P>
<P>
   The town leaders never thought they would generate such
attention with ordinances they say look out for the rights of its
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not do it for publicity or to have people against us,''
Barton said. ``We did it for the residents of El Cenizo; we need to
help each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many U.S.-Mexico border communities, most residents speak
Spanish and many are either immigrants, married to immigrants or
the children of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people know English, but they prefer Spanish,'' said
Soledad Vasquez, 34, the owner of a convenience store. ``It does
not matter where you go (along the border), people speak Spanish.
Our parents are from Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vasquez said the community is slowly evolving from its
immigrant roots. ``My nieces speak English. They do not even speak
Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel M. Reyna, the lead attorney for Texas Rural Legal Aid in
Laredo, has said city leaders are doing what they can in a place
where many people have limited English skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a developing democracy opening government's doors to the
people,'' Reyna said shortly after the ordinances were passed.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Dennis will continue to produce heavy rain showers and
gusty winds from southeastern Virginia to northeast North Carolina
on Tuesday. Dennis will slow its forward progress during the day,
becoming nearly stationary offshore of the Outer Banks. The storm
will most likely remain in this vicinity for several days, leading
to very high surf and the potential for large amounts of beach
erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a strong Canadian high-pressure system will push
eastward across New England. After an unseasonably cool morning,
interior sections of the Northeast will warm to near normal
afternoon readings, while gusty winds out of the northeast keep
shoreline locations slightly below normal. Farther south, a
disturbance at 18,000 feet over the western Gulf of Mexico will
trigger scattered showers and thunderstorms over parts of coastal
east Texas and southern Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   A potent low-pressure system pushing through the Canadian
Prairie will drag a strong cold front across the northern Rockies
and northern Plains. Ahead of this front, scattered showers and
thunderstorms will erupt from Kansas through the Dakotas. Some of
the storms in the Dakotas will be severe with large hail and
damaging winds possible.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, moisture laden Pacific air behind the front will
ascend the mountains, leading to numerous showers on the western
slopes of the Cascades and the Bitterroots. Elsewhere, isolated
afternoon thunderstorms will develop from Arizona to Utah as a jet
stream disturbance passes overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Inadvertent Heat
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Dennis inadvertently brought a heat wave to eastern
Florida this past weekend. From Melbourne to Miami, highs on Sunday
rose into the middle and upper 90s. Miami Beach was the hottest
site with a reading of 98 degrees, within a degree or two of their
all-time record. The counter-clockwise wind circulation around the
offshore storm combined with subsiding air at the periphery of the
hurricane to produce a dry, hot, persistent wind from the west.
Ample sunshine assisted in raising temperatures to their highest
levels of the season. Onshore breezes will return Tuesday.

 &HT;    Middle school teacher tracks Dennis
 &HT;    By David Blount
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ While nervous eyes watched weather forecasts
and hoped Hurricane Dennis would steer far away from North
Carolina, at least one area man welcomed the storm's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Holdsworth, 53, has been a weather buff since sitting
through Hurricane Hazel in 1954. A teacher at Southern Nash Middle
School, Holdsworth in 1995 decided to pursue his life's dream and
graduated from Mississippi State University with a degree in
meteorology.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsworth operates his own by-contract weather forecasting
business in Rocky Mount named Down East Weather Associates and is
hoping to catch a glimpse of Dennis along the Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can find out where to go, we will definitely check it
out,'' Holdsworth said. ``It isn't moving very fast and everything
is still up in the air. From a human standpoint, you don't want to
see anything happen. From a scientific standpoint, you want to be
able to study the storm a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdsworth said he hoped to ride out the hurricane while
monitoring the storm's strength on his computer and weather
equipment. He also hopes to videotape the effects of the storm and
produce a hurricane feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Bertha (in 1996),'' he said. ``That was my first
hurricane since 1964 in Florida. I was bound and determined to
witness a hurricane so we went and rode it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdsworth said he was disappointed by the effects of Bertha.
Ideally, he said, every meteorologist wants to see a Category 5
storm with no damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's impossible, of course,'' he said. ``Bertha was pretty
weak and Fran was a little stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   After Dennis continued its slow track to the north Saturday,
Holdsworth began to wonder if he would be able to make the trip to
see the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to sit tight for now,'' he said. ``I have a
meeting at school on Tuesday that I have to attend so I might not
make it down.''
</P>
<P>
   While some may wonder why Holdsworth would scramble toward the
coast to see a storm that thousands of others would flee, he claims
the data collected in a hurricane is valuable for future forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more information we can collect, the better,'' he said.
``We are interested in the measurements of air pressure, wind speed
and rainfall to help us to predict how these storms move and react
to other weather patterns. Right now we use computer generated
models, but they don't work very well with tropical systems.''

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Jerusalem) _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders
expressed guarded optimism Monday that they could cinch a deal to
revive the frozen Wye River peace agreement by the time Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright arrives in the Middle East on Thursday.
But as senior negotiators threw themselves into a final round of
meetings, the two sides apparently remained deadlocked on several
key issues. These included the terms for the release of Palestinian
prisoners by Israel and a target date for concluding the framework
of a permanent peace accord. By Deborah Sontag.

   AT&AMP;T-RATES (Undated) _ AT&AMP;T is cutting rates for long-distance

<P>
   FAITH-POLITICS (Undated) _ Presidential candidates have always
made a point of having themselves photographed as they step out of
church on Sunday, carrying a Bible perhaps, and shaking the
minister's hand. But in the early campaign for the 2000 elections,
the rite of political piety has moved far beyond the sacramental
photo opportunity. This time around, the candidates are engaging in
``God talk'' that is more explicit, more intimate and more
pervasive than at any time in recent decades, historians and
political analysts say. By Laurie Goodstein.
</P>
<P>
   TEACHER-SHORTAGE (undated) _ As the nation's children swarm back
to school, principals from Baltimore to Palm Beach, Fla., and from
the Texas panhandle to inner-city Los Angeles, say they are
grappling with perhaps the most acute teacher shortage in recent
memory, with student enrollments continuing to swell and a rising
tide of educators flowing out of their classrooms to retirement.
The problem is not a depleted national supply of teachers, but
rather geography and qualification. By Jacques Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-TIMOR (Dili, East Timor) _ Proud, optimistic,
determined to have the last word, almost all the registered voters
here in East Timor cast their ballots Monday in a referendum on the
territory's future that one U.N. official said approached a
best-case scenario. For the first time since the U.N.-sponsored
process began nearly four months ago, it was a day largely free of
violence and intimidation by military-backed militias determined to
block what seems to be a growing momentum for independence from
Indonesia. By Seth Mydans.

family of high technology schemers into a cocky, charismatic youth.
He drops out of school and leaves his country to dodge military
service. In college he alienates his teachers by cutting class. He
breaks his mother's heart by falling in love with an older foreign
woman and fathering an illegitimate child, and eventually marrying
her.
</P>
<P>
   Moonlighting at science, while working as a minor civil servant,
he publishes a series of papers challenging conventional notions of
space, time and the nature of light, and works his way up the
academic ladder, becoming estranged from his wife, who is depressed
and jealous of other women. He begins an affair in another city.
</P>
<P>
   So has life episodically unfolded, over 12 years, seven volumes
and thousands of pages of the Collected Papers of Albert Einstein,
a massive effort to publish all the 43,000 or so documents Einstein
left behind at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study when he
died in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the eighth and thickest installment of this saga,
Volume Eight, was published by the Princeton University Press in
two parts totaling 1,118 pages, carrying Einstein through four of
the most heroic and stormy years of his life, from 1914 to 1918,
when, among other things, he finished work on his crowning
achievement, the general theory of relativity.
</P>
<P>
   Its most startling revelation is that in the spring of 1918,
Einstein considered breaking off his engagement to his cousin Elsa
Einstein and marrying her 20-year-old daughter, Ilse, instead. And
the new volume calls into question the degree of Einstein's
commitment to antiwar politics in wartime Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, though, the papers here illuminate the
tortured and confused path by which Einstein finally completed his
long quest to extend the principle of relativity to explain gravity
and the universe. Even Einstein, it seems, found it hard to be
Einstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these pages,'' said Dr. Robert Schulmann, a Boston
University historian and director of the Einstein Papers Project,
``we can closely observe Einstein on his solitary path to general
relativity, on which personal relations are sometimes callously
sacrificed in the name of scientific ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   Volume Eight marks middle age for Einstein and middle age as
well for one of the most monumental and star-crossed efforts in the
history of science. The collection has already transformed
scholars' view of Einstein, shedding a sometimes unflattering light
on his personal life, and launching a wave of new biographies and
television specials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't do any work, not just on Einstein but on early
20th-century science, without referring to these volumes,'' said
Dr. Gerald Holton of Harvard University, a physicist, historian and
Einstein scholar.
</P>
<P>
   A warts-and-all approach was exactly what the founders of the
Papers Project had in mind and the trustees of the Einstein estate
feared. A publishing agreement between Princeton University Press
and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, to which Einstein left his
papers and which he helped found, was signed in 1971, but work was
delayed for several years by a lawsuit filed by Dr. Otto Nathan, a
Princeton economist and Einstein's executor.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, who was protective of Einstein's public image,
challenged the appointment of Dr. John Stachel, a Boston University
physics professor with whom he had clashed, as sole editor. Only a
committee could do justice to the breadth of Einstein's interests,
Nathan argued.
</P>
<P>
   An arbitrator ruled in favor of Stachel in 1981, but the work
was already off to a late start. It was further delayed by the
spectacular discovery of Einstein's love letters to his college
sweetheart and first wife, Mileva Maric, which disclosed the birth
of their illegitimate daughter, Lieserl, in 1902. (She is believed
to have been born in Serbia, and her fate is unknown.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Schulmann said, continuing research has only
increased the project's work. Diligent scrounging in attics and
archives, and the courting of collectors and descendants of
Einstein's friends and family, have produced another 25,000 papers.
</P>
<P>
   The original archive is now in Jerusalem and is open to
scholars, as are copies in the libraries of Princeton and Boston
University, where the Papers Project is headquartered. To the
occasional chagrin of independent historians and journalists, the
so-called supplemental archive that the project has assembled is
not open.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is another archive that is off-limits even to
the Papers Project. An undetermined number of letters have been
``sequestered,'' in Schulmann's phrase, in a classified archive at
the Hebrew University until 2006. Schulmann said he did not know
what was in the sealed archive and admitted it was
``uncomfortable'' for a historian to be in the position of
presenting only a partial record.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant discovery to date of the Papers Project has
been Einstein's letters to Mileva.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent volumes have revealed unflattering details of
Einstein's marriage, including the affair with Elsa and a bossy
memorandum detailing the conditions under which he would go on
living with Mileva.
</P>
<P>
   The editors are unapologetic for airing dirty linen. ``To me
this makes him more human,'' said Schulmann, who added that he
still liked Einstein and admired the way he thumbed his nose at
authority. ``The Einstein we're trying to recover in these volumes
is a living, breathing personality with faults. We want to see what
kind of personal style he had and what kind of scientific style he
had.''
</P>
<P>
   That style is vividly on display in Volume Eight, which Holton
described as the project's ``high point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways it was the best of times and the worst of times
for Einstein,'' Holton said. He finished working out general
relativity, but within a few months of his arrival, his wife and
children had left him and World War I broke out, stranding him in a
sea of German militarism and wartime deprivation.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein's theory, which explains how matter and energy
``curve'' the geometry of space-time to create the phenomenon known
as gravity, has been called one of the greatest intellectual feats
of all time. Einstein completed the theory in the fall of 1915
after eight years of struggle. Intriguingly, Einstein had actually
written down the correct formulation as early as 1912 or 1913, but
then abandoned it in favor of a different version called the
``Entwurf,'' meaning design or blueprint, which he had cooked up
with his old friend, the mathematician Marcel Grossmann.
</P>
<P>
   One of Einstein's strengths was that he trusted his gut
feelings, said Dr. Michel Janssen, a professor of physics and
philosophy at Boston University and co-editor of Volume Eight. But
sometimes, Janssen said, he could fool himself.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Einstein discarded his original formulation of
general relativity by coming up with a problem he called the ``hole
argument,'' which addressed the question of whether the universe
was uniquely determined by the arrangement of its contents.
Einstein believed that it must be, but that his original
formulation would violate that principle.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1915, however, when the Entwurf theory was
falling apart for other reasons, and the mathematician David
Hilbert of Goettingen University was also on the trail of general
relativity, Einstein changed his tune. He adopted a resolution of
the hole argument that he had previously rejected and reinstated
his original theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Einstein is good at believing what he wants to believe at
various stages of the game,'' Janssen said. ``In 1913, the last
thing he wants is to escape from the hole argument. He has too much
invested in his Entwurf. In 1915, he wants the hole argument to
evaporate. Einstein was a bit of an opportunist.''
</P>
<P>
   Einstein's personal life was marked by a streak of callousness
and aloofness, Schulmann said. Nowhere is that more evident than in
the strange letter, dated May 25, 1918, that Ilse Einstein sent to
her close friend Georg Nicolai, a doctor, well-known antiwar
crusader and Einstein family friend, with the words, ``Please
destroy this letter immediately after reading it'' scrawled across
the top in big letters. At the time Einstein, who had moved to
Berlin four years earlier to take a lucrative appointment to the
Prussian Academy of Sciences and become director of the newly
formed Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Physics, was 38 and in the
process of divorcing Mileva, presumably so that he could marry his
cousin Elsa. Ilse, the older of Elsa's two daughters, was serving
as Einstein's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was a plea for advice. In it Ilse related how a
simple ``jest'' one afternoon had suddenly escalated into a serious
proposal that Einstein marry her instead of her mother. Einstein,
she said, had confessed that he loved her. Moreover her mother, she
reported, was prepared to step aside, if that was what would make
Ilse happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albert himself is refusing to take any decision; he is
prepared to marry either Mama or me,'' Ilse wrote. ``I know that A.
loves me very much, perhaps more than any other man ever will, he
also told me so himself yesterday,'' she went on.
</P>
<P>
   The feelings, however, were not quite reciprocal. Ilse loved
Einstein like a father, she wrote, but she had no desire to be
close to him physically. Her instinct, she confessed, was not to
marry him. ``It will seem peculiar to you that I, a silly little
thing of a 20-year-old, should have to decide on such a serious
matter; I can hardly believe it myself and feel very unhappy doing
so as well. Help me!''
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that the relationship with Ilse was ever
consummated. Einstein and Elsa were married the next year and
remained husband and wife until her death in 1936. (Ilse later
married Rudolf Kayser, a writer and literary critic who
subsequently wrote a biography of Einstein. She died of
tuberculosis in 1933.)
</P>
<P>
   Ilse's letter first came to the attention of the Einstein
scholars in the early 1990s. At least one of the other editors,
Schulmann said, thought the letter might be a product of Ilse's
imagination. ``I take it very seriously,'' said Schulmann, noting
that Nicolai was a former lover of Ilse, as well as an older man,
in whom it would be natural for her to confide.
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw the letter and the situation it described as an
example of Einstein's vaunted ability to detach himself from the
people around him. ``The most telling point is that he doesn't
care,'' Schulmann said. ``That's the Einstein we know. He is
indifferent to the question of whether he marries one or the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ilse and her confidant Nicolai also emerge in the new volume as
key influences on Einstein's political activities during the war.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Einstein was one of only
three people to sign an ``Appeal to Europeans'' deploring the
destruction of international culture, making him a hero to the
pacifist movement, and he attended meetings of a pacifist political
club, the Bund Neues Vaterland. Historians have long thought that
Einstein drew up the manifesto, but the evidence, Schulmann said,
suggests that it was actually written by Nicolai, an antiwar
crusader, and author of a book called ``The Biology of War.''
</P>
<P>
   But, again, detachment characterized Einstein's actions. At the
same time that he was attending antiwar meetings, presumably at the
behest of Ilse and Elsa, Schulmann said, Einstein consulted for a
maker of submarine gyroscopes and even tried to design an airplane
for the military. In his letters he often said that the war did not
intrude on him. ``Why shouldn't one let the servants live happily
in the madhouse?'' he wrote to a Swiss friend.
</P>
<P>
   After the Bund was outlawed in 1916, Einstein stopped attending
meetings and resisted Nicolai's continuing schemes. Einstein
``identified with the underdog and the outcast,'' Schulmann
observed, ``but he was not prepared to march in the ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   The slow pace of publishing the papers has provoked criticism
from other scholars. In an interview, Dr. David Cahan, a historian
of German physics at the University of Nebraska, said that
publishing a series of bound volumes over the years was too slow
and costly and wrongly concentrated resources on the editorial
process rather than on the historical process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see the E.P.P. put everything on the Web and
simultaneously transform its quarters at B.U. into a true and open
research and conference center devoted to Einstein scholarship,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Holton said, the option of publishing the Einstein
papers in a facsimile form was considered back at the beginning and
rejected in favor of the traditional style of extensive annotation
and accompanying essays. Schulmann said, ``The goal is to provide
as thick a context as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how long it will take the project to finish its
task, which is projected to encompass at least 25 volumes.
Schulmann said it would take another 10 volumes to carry Einstein's
story to 1933, when he left Berlin and came to America. There is
already so much material that project officials are beginning to
leave some things out. Walter Lippincott, the director of the
Princeton University Press, likes to joke that he will be dead and
his children will be dead by the time the last volume rolls off the
presses.
</P>
<P>
   Holton is undaunted. He noted that it took a lifetime to publish
the papers of Thomas Jefferson.

talking about nothing. Now they do the same thing on a computer _
with as many friends, near and far, as their young brains can
juggle at once without exploding. Teens today spend hours at a
sitting shooting the electronic breeze with online buddies,
sometimes five or six at a time, no matter if they're across the
street or across an ocean. ``It's hot beyond belief. Young kids can
be in touch with their group at any time. And they can be talking

HOW PERIL TURNS LONER AMOEBA INTO A SOCIAL CREATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When times are good and there are plenty of bacteria to eat,
Dictyostelium discoideum _ a species of soil amoebas _ are loners.
These microscopic one-celled animals are content to crawl through
their environment, absorbing whatever food they come across.
</P>
<P>
   But when famine or other catastrophes strike, something
remarkable happens: exchanging chemical signals with their freely
moving neighbors and using their protruding pseudopoda (false legs)
for propulsion, the amoebas seek each other out and stick together
to create a multicelled creature that can sense both light and heat
and can travel faster and farther than any of its component cells
traveling alone.
</P>
<P>
   The aggregated cells within the animal then differentiate into
two distinct types _ stalks and armored spores _ and the starving
Dictyostelium is ready to sow its dormant spores into the winds,
seeking a more hospitable environment.
</P>
<P>
   All this has been known for many years. But a team of biologists
and physicists at the University of California at San Diego has
invented a revealing new technique for observing Dictyostelium and
has devised a mathematical model to account for its behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of an organism to switch between unicellular and
multicellular forms is not unique to Dictyostelium; myxobacteria,
yeasts and sponges can do something similar. But to some biologists
and physicists, Dictyostelium has a special attraction. For one
thing, it is relatively easy to study. And, says Dr. William F.
Loomis of the University of California team, the multicellular mode
of Dictyostelium offers insights into the structures of all
multicelled animals, including people.
</P>
<P>
   Loomis, a professor of biology, worked with a team of physicists
headed by Dr. Herbert Levine, also of San Diego, to study
Dictyostelium's sophisticated strategies for dealing with stress
and hunger. Preliminary results of their experiments were published
recently in the journal Physical Review Letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the organism,'' Loomis said in an interview. ``You get
familiar with it and end up with a burning curiosity to understand
it. It's simple enough that a person can understand all of its life
cycle, and in 1970 I thought we could achieve that understanding in
10 or 15 years. But by 1990 I knew better, and I still have much to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists have been intrigued by transitions in the same
species between one-celled and multicelled forms. How is it, for
example, that one-celled creatures living independently of one
another can join together to form a new, multicelled entity that
exhibits self-awareness, like that of the supposedly higher life
forms?
</P>
<P>
   Might the metamorphosis from the one-celled state of
Dictyostelium to its multicelled state have something in common
with the highly structured flocking of birds, schooling of fish,
the collective movement of ants and even the movements of human
pedestrian and vehicular traffic?
</P>
<P>
   To seek answers the San Diego team realized that studying the
life cycles of amoebas in their ordinary three-dimensional
environment involves many difficulties. To simplify observation,
Loomis and his colleagues devised a containment system that forced
amoebas into a flat two-dimensional environment. Their technique is
to smear a very thin layer of single-celled Dictyostelium amoebas
on a microscope slide and seal the organisms, bereft of nutrients,
away from the outer world under an impenetrable film of a substance
called agarose.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Loomis said, was the creation of a kind of window
into the life cycle of Dictyostelium, like the windows used to view
subterranean ant colonies.
</P>
<P>
   After a short time the Dictyostelium cells, deprived of food in
Dr. Loomis' experiment, began to assemble into their multicellular
incarnation, in preparation for differentiating into stalk cells
and spore cells, the latter engineered by nature to withstand an
indefinite famine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stalk cells are little towers rising above the ground
providing perches for the spores up in the air, where they can be
dispersed,'' Loomis said. ``The differentiation of Dictyostelium
cells into two distinct types designed for different functions is
like turning part of some material into golf tees and another part
into golf balls. Having a tee to hold up the golf ball makes it
easier to hit the ball down the fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Loomis replayed this scene in two dimensions instead of
the familiar three, there were some surprises. The independent
single cells soon aggregated into a thin, pancake-shaped
multicellular organism. Then, as the pancake formed, came another
surprise: it began rotating under its own power, and continued
turning for some 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remarkable thing about this behavior is that these
organisms are not penned in by any kind of external fence like
horses running around in a coral, and yet they rotate,'' Loomis
said. Moreover, the multicellular pancakes often form doughnutlike
holes in their centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holes are of great interest because similar holes form in
turning flocks of birds and schools of fish that get themselves
into loops, and a common factor may be at work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Simple rules can explain some of this behavior. When a fish is
approached too closely by another fish in the same school, Loomis
said, it moves slightly away, and this simple response by many fish
can trigger the onset of circular motion for the whole school. An
empty hole in the middle of the rotating school forms because the
amount of bending a fish backbone can undergo as it swims in a
circle is limited, preventing further tightening of the circle.
</P>
<P>
   Analogous mechanisms may explain a variety of collective
movements in different organisms, the scientists suggested, and
their paper proposed a mathematical model that could account for
such behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It is essentially this: All individual cells of Dictyostelium
(and analogous organisms) constantly change shape, using their
pseudopodal protuberances to propel and reorient themselves. In
their multicellular configuration, the organisms secrete adhesive
proteins that tend to draw them together.
</P>
<P>
   If one cell begins to move past another, the two cells will
reorient themselves and try to draw closer together, checking the
separation. This trend throughout the entire aggregate eventually
becomes coherent as cells line up with one another, and collective
rotation results. This behavior probably helps the organism sort
out its stalk and spore cells as they form and prepare for their
different roles, Loomis theorizes.
</P>
<P>
   But because single cells at the outer edge of a turning
Dictyostelium pancake cannot move fast enough to keep up with the
rotation of cells closer to the axis of the pancake, they lag
behind, and the result is a pancake whose shape under the
microscope looks remarkably like a spiral galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   The team tested their model with a computer simulation, in which
deformable cells were bunched together, each cell pressing against
its neighbors, changing shape in response to forces applied to it,
and moving randomly. After 100 to 1,000 computer equivalents of
flipping a coin the movements and orientations of the individual
cells became coherent and the simulated pancake began to rotate.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is tempting to suppose that a common factor
influences the formation of galaxies and amoebic conglomerates,
Loomis says that their size scales rule it out. ``You can't really
compare phenomena that happen on a scale of microns with those
unfolding over thousands of light years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dictyostelium has established itself as a powerful tool for
biologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows us to study the processes common to all multicelled
organisms,'' Loomis said. ``Dictyostelium offers understanding in
terms of highly disciplined physical analysis. It's kept me
interested for 30 years and still intrigues me.''

 &HT;    High-flyin' chicks
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks have plenty of reasons to cluck.
</P>
<P>
   As their highly anticipated new album, ``Fly,'' reaches stores
today, the perky country music trio is hotter than a sparkler _
media darlings du jour. They are everywhere, from the pages of
Seventeen magazine to giggling sound bites on ``Entertainment
Tonight.'' Designer Todd Oldham begs them to wear his clothes.
Julia Roberts romps through her latest movie to their music.
Dressed in ripped leather costumes, their blond hair streaked in
black, the group was this year's camera grabber at the Grammy
Awards, where they won for best country album and duo/group. The
women are nominated for four Country Music Association trophies,
which will be handed out Sept. 22, including the coveted
entertainer of the year, which they just might win. Move over,
Garth Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Dolly Parton's ascension in Hollywood in the early
1980s has a country music act created such a buzz outside Nashville
circles. But the Chicks haven't done it by catering to pop. Their
music is solidly country _ a breezy, fun style rooted in the
traditional bluegrass backgrounds of sisters Emily Robison (banjo,
dobro) and Martie Seidel (fiddle, mandolin) and the powerhouse
vocals of lead singer Natalie Maines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are having a profound impact on country music,
and an important, positive impact,'' says country singer Dwight
Yoakam. ``They are continuing the illustration of the case in point
that females can and will continue to help shape country music into
the next decade.''
</P>
<P>
   A mere 19 months ago, few outside Texas had ever heard of the
group with the big smiles and cutesy name. They were a quirky
novelty act that dressed like Dale Evans and mostly played
conventions in and around Austin. After nearly a decade of
rejection, they were ``discovered'' by Monument Records' producer
Blake Chancey, who says he had to close his eyes when he listened
to them to get past their somewhat cartoonish looks. Even after a
major record deal, the trio was turned down for an appearance on an
Atlanta TV show in 1998 for having a name that was ``politically
incorrect'' (i.e., the word ``Dixie'').
</P>
<P>
   With the release of the album ``Wide Open Spaces'' in January
1998, however, fans of all ages responded to their music. It
spawned five hit singles, and went on to sell 7 million copies,
making the Dixie Chicks overnight superstars.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon was glaringly apparent at the group's July 25
show in Atlanta, where they opened for Tim McGraw, a date booked
long before anyone had gauged their mass appeal. At a backstage
party hosted by country radio stations Kicks 101.5 and Y-106.7, the
trio was smothered by the normally blase VIP crowd like a blond
float at a Mardi Gras parade. As cameras flashed and bodies pressed
against them, the Chicks wore dazed smiles and dutifully signed
autographs until handlers whisked them back to their lipstick red
bus.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the meet-and-greet, lead singer Natalie Maines
called the coach her ``safe haven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love meeting fans, but I started feeling very panicky. When
there are a lot of hands on me like that, I start freaking out
'cause I don't know these people. Everything has happened so fast.
One day you could walk through a mall, the next day you couldn't.
You have to know when you step outside, you're a Dixie Chick.''
</P>
<P>
   Producer Chancey says he had no clue just how popular the trio
was going to be until he celebrated his 4-year-old nieces' birthday
in Florida. ``It was a theme party, and everyone showed up dressed
as their favorite Dixie Chick,'' he says. ``The record hadn't been
out all that long. That's when I realized, `Omigod, this is going
to be huge.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the formula behind the Chicks' appeal is a combination
of solid musicianship and successful imaging.
</P>
<P>
   The acoustic instruments that make up most of the group's sound
are more than props. Robison and Seidel are superb pickers who have
a knack for knowing how to turn traditionalism into something fresh
and new. ``When is the last time you heard a banjo on a country
record?'' Chancey asks. On lead vocals, Maines has a set of pipes
like a whistle on a Mississippi steamboat, packed with twang and
sass.
</P>
<P>
   RCA recording artist Sara Evans says, ``I knew I really loved
them when I heard them sing `Stand By Your Man' at the Academy of
Country Music Awards last year. Natalie has a wonderful voice, and
she just hit that note right on. That's a hard song to sing, and
they sounded perfect. I looked at my husband and said, `These girls
are great!'''
</P>
<P>
   On top of the tight sound, the Chicks' exude an image of
countrified girl power _ best girlfriends who can be harmlessly fun
hell-raisers. They have tiny chicken tracks tattooed on their feet,
one for each No. 1 record. Onstage, they banter about Maines'
recent divorce, and are self-deprecating about their looks. Maines
quips, ``Emily's goal in life was to be on `Hee Haw,' but I told
her `Sorry. They don't take double A's on that show.''' The new CD
even comes with a tune called ``Sin Wagon,'' in which the Chicks'
say they want to ``do a little mattress dancin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Maines certainly exudes a devilishness straight out of ``Thelma
&AMP; Louise,'' as if she'd take a dare on a moment's notice. She says
what she thinks, quite often making her label executives grimace.
Onstage, she dances and sings with such energy you worry she's
going to pop out of her tiny body in a puff of spontaneous
combustion. Her style has apparently always been a bit of a
joyride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was 3 I was like this. There was this time I was
sitting at a piano banging on it, and my dad came in and told me to
stop,'' Maines recalls. ``I wouldn't, so he said, `If you play one
more key, you are going to the bathroom and get spanked.' I looked
directly in his eye, lifted one finger and pressed one key. He
couldn't believe I had the nerve. He didn't spank me, and, in a
way, I think that's when he knew I could go out there in the world
and stand on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Chicks and their producer say they didn't feel under
the gun while recording ``Fly,'' or pressured to repeat the success
of their ``Wide Open Spaces.'' ``I think we felt more confident, if
anything,'' Maines says. ``Our voices blended better, our producers
were more comfortable. We didn't want to remake `Wide Open Spaces,'
but we didn't want to go pop. I think we took some risks
creatively.''
</P>
<P>
   And what if the Chicks lay an egg?
</P>
<P>
   ``If it bites me in the butt tomorrow, so what,'' Maines laughs.
``They can take my money, but they can't take my happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   CHICK IT OUT
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  History: The band was formed in Dallas in 1989 by sisters
Emily Robison, 27, and Martie Seidel, 29, along with two friends.
They played western swing, mostly on street corners, and wore campy
cowgirl outfits with fringe. In 1995 Nashville producer Blake
Chancey told them to ditch the costumes and signed them to a record
deal. Six months before going into the studio, Robison and Seidel
decided to change lead singers, and asked Maines, 24, to join the
group. The result was the album ``Wide Open Spaces,'' which sold 7
million copies.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The sound: Robison and Seidel's parents were private-school
teachers in Dallas who insisted their daughters take music lessons.
Robison became proficient on dobro and banjo, Seidel on fiddle.
Maines attended the Berklee School of Music in Boston, but was
heavily influenced by her father, Texas steel guitarist Lloyd
Maines.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The name: Dixie Chicks is derived from the tune ``Dixie
Chicken'' by Little Feat.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The hits: ``I Can Love You Better Than That,'' ``There's Your
Trouble,'' ``Wide Open Spaces,'' ``You Were Mine,'' ``Tonight the
Heartache's on Me,'' ``Ready to Run.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The new album: ``Fly,'' in stores today.
</P>
<P>
   TRES CHICK
</P>
<P>
   There's been nearly as much buzz about the Dixie Chicks' look in
the past year as their music, and Melanie Shelley intends to keep
it that way. She's the Nashville hairstylist who oversees the
band's image as part of a consulting team known as the Glam Squad.
</P>
<P>
   From her funky headquarters near downtown Nashville, a vintage
1950s' beauty parlor called Trim Classic Barber &AMP; Legendary Beauty,
she meets regularly with the Chicks to come up with the quirky
hairstyles and costumes that define their style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would describe the look as 100 percent fun,'' she says.
``The Chicks aren't afraid of color, of pushing the boundaries of
what's tasteful and what's not. They can't stand not to change, and
that allows me to be super creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley is the one who put those black streaks in the band's
hair for their splashy Grammy appearance. (``A lounge hostess
look,'' she calls it). Costume concepts, from hair barrettes to
platform shoes, are typically sketched out on a board, presented to
the band, then sent to designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone approves, but everyone notices,'' Shelley says.
``Nobody looks at TLC and says, `I think they are going too far or
changing too often.' They are a girl group who really loves their
bodies and fashion. To me, the Dixie Chicks are a country's TLC.''

 &HT;    A Catalyst for young entrepreneurs
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Catalyst ($4.50), the newest magazine in the Atlanta market,
debuts this week with slick graphics and short articles aimed at
entrepreneurs and high-tech professionals under 40.
</P>
<P>
   Catalyst is intended to be primarily a business publication with
complementary articles on food, fashion and recreation, says Laura
Nix of the Leader Publishing Group. ``It's all about how technology
and the Internet not only affect business, but how it affects our
lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   The cover story for the bimonthly magazine features thumbnail
sketches of entrepreneurs Andrea Arena, founder of 2 Places at 1
Time; Jeff Levy, co-founder of Relevant Knowledge; Alan Daniels,
chairman of Realestate.com; Alexis Abramson, founder of Mature
Mart; and Tom Noonan, president of Internet Security Systems.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting article is Terri Thornton's look at the
battle between chain bookstores, independents and Amazon.com. The
secret to survival, says Outwrite Bookstore owner Phillip Rafshoon,
is finding a niche and offering better service. ``We give more than
a bookstore experience,'' he says. ``We offer passion for what we
do.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Home tour: To prove that the city is more than a hodgepodge of
subdivisions, Atlanta ($3.50) devotes 20 pages to 50 of the most
beautiful homes in the metro area. Writer Kevin Benefield visits
Tara-like mansions such as Roswell's Barrington Hall and Cobb
County's Tranquillas, Neel Reid and Philip Shutze creations in
Druid Hills, Ansley Park and Buckhead, and charming bungalows in
the Virginia-Highland neighborhood. Elsewhere in the magazine,
Rebecca Poynor Burns tells us eight things we must know about David
Hasselhoff of ``Baywatch.'' Why Hasselhoff? Editor Lee Walburn
explains that the actor grew up in Atlanta before discovering a TV
gold mine in a show where women wear skimpy red bathing suits and
run up and down the beach in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Risky business: Time ($3.50) investigates why more Americans
than ever are taking chances with their lives and investments. Some
get their kicks parachuting off 650-foot concrete dams while others
resort to day trading. Experts say the dangerous trend is a result
of Americans seeking the widest range of human experiences. ``If
you don't assume a certain amount of risk,'' says paraglider pilot
Wade Ellet, 51, ``you're missing a certain amount of life.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Testing the tests: Nerve-wracking exams have become a normal
part of life for most students, as SAT scores determine who gets
into the best colleges and who gets left behind. Tests have been
around for decades, but Newsweek ($3.50) finds there is even more
emphasis today on high scores. Some students complain that real
learning is being neglected because teachers are more interested in
boosting test scores. And even some educators are questioning the
value of some standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lynch's return: It would seem that the man who gave us the
bizarre and fascinating TV series ``Twin Peaks'' would have free
rein with any of the networks. Not so, says Tad Friend in the Sept.
6 issue of The New Yorker ($3). When David Lynch proposed a series
called ``Mulholland Drive'' to ABC, the network eagerly invested $7
million in a two-hour plot. Now there are problems with content.
ABC, for instance, was concerned about the number of
cigarette-smoking characters in the show and decreed that
``characters who smoke should manifest a hacking cough.'' Says a
frustrated Lynch: ``I feel it's possibly true that there are aliens
on earth, and they work in television.''

IN HOT PURSUIT OF A QUASAR, A MYSTERY IS SOLVED 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astronomers think they have solved the mystery of the strange
object that has confounded them ever since its discovery three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is not any kind of star or galaxy. Nor is it some entirely
new celestial phenomenon. As a few astronomers had suspected, the
object is almost certainly an extremely rare type of quasar.
</P>
<P>
   Quasars, which have been known since the 1960s, are sources of
tremendous energy found in the center of distant galaxies and
thought to be powered by matter falling into massive gravitational
sinks called black holes. But until 10 nights ago, quasar experts
had been unable to find clear identifying clues in the object's
spectrum of light.
</P>
<P>
   Then new observations were made by one of the world's two most
powerful telescopes at Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Looking at the
object's faint light in near-infrared wavelengths, astronomers
detected a distinct pattern of hydrogen emissions, a signature of
quasars. The hydrogen peak on the graph of the object's light
spectrum was at exactly the right place.
</P>
<P>
   After double-checking and analyzing the findings, astronomers at
Keck and the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena
concluded last week that the object was a strange variation of a
broad-absorptionline quasar, the like of which has probably been
seen only three times before.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we think the mystery is solved,'' Dr. S. George Djorgovski,
the Cal Tech astronomer whose team made the original discovery,
said in a telephone interview on Friday. ``The object falls into
the category of a curiosity, a puzzling one, rather than something
truly new.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of rising scientific and public interest in the mystery,
Dr. Frederic Chaffee, director of the Keck Observatory, personally
conducted the new infrared observations at the telescope at Mauna
Kea on the island of Hawaii. He used his director's discretionary
time on the telescope in joining the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Chaffee's observations appeared to yield answers to other
questions about the object: its distance and age. The new reading
of the light spectrum produced an estimate of the object's red
shift, indicating its receding velocity in an expanding universe.
Astronomers use red shifts to figure out the distance of objects
from Earth and thus their age. The mystery object's red shift of
1.2 translates to an age for the object that is about half the
present age of the universe, or some 5 to 7 billion years old.
</P>
<P>
   Solving the mystery ended a frustrating period for astronomers,
who are accustomed to identifying and describing just about
anything they see in the same night they see it.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery object was detected in 1996 by a Cal Tech team
conducting the Digital Palomar Sky Survey. The astronomers were
observing the northern sky in three colors _ blue, red and
near-infrared. When computers routinely scanned the data for any
unusual sightings, the pinpoint of light in the constellation
Serpens appeared to have unusual colors, but no clues pointing to
any of the usual cosmic suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we studied it, we couldn't figure out what it was,''
Djorgovski's team reported on the Internet. ``So we asked many
other astronomers, and they didn't know either.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at the June meeting of the American Astronomical
Society in Chicago, Djorgovski challenged fellow astronomers to
help explain the mystery. They came up with some good guesses, he
said, but no definitive evidence. Others volunteered ideas after
seeing an article about the mystery in The New York Times two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal Tech team was exasperated by some of the ideas,
especially the inevitable UFO explanations, but intrigued by
others. One of the ``most arresting explanations'' for the mystery,
Djorgovski said, came from astronomers at the University of
California at Los Angeles and the University of Alabama at
Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers produced the light spectrum of a dying red giant
star encircled by dust, probably hydrocarbons. Observed in 1980 and
dubbed the Red Rectangle, it is still something of an enigma
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Wdowiak, the Alabama astronomer, said that several
peaks in the Red Rectangle's spectrum seemed to match those for the
mystery object. ``There are some differences, but some important
features in common,'' he said. ``The two spectra have got the same
kind of character.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he agreed that the similarities were striking,
Djorgovski concluded that this was a coincidence. By this time, he
had been won over by the Keck results and the analysis of several
quasar astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the astronomers who proposed the apparently correct
explanation several months ago was Dr. Richard White of the Space
Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. He noted that one aspect
of the mystery object's spectrum looked something like part of the
spectrum of the broad-absorptionline quasars.
</P>
<P>
   These particular quasars, representing about 10 percent of all
known quasars, have a characteristic spectrum in which their
emitted light is blocked by different elements and molecules in the
gas surrounding them. The Keck observations identified two such
absorption lines, one of magnesium and the other of iron.
</P>
<P>
   The absorption line of iron, astronomers said, seemed to be a
defining manifestation of an especially rare class of these
broad-absorption quasars. White's group has identified three
iron-absorption objects out of a recent survey of 600 quasars.
</P>
<P>
   As satisfying as it may be to have his explanation supported by
observations, White said, the discovery still left unanswered
questions. Foremost of these is the absence of strong radio
emissions from the mystery object. Such emissions are common for
most quasars and are detected in the three other objects resembling
this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a fundamental level,'' White said, ``We don't understand
the difference in quasars that are radio sources and those that are
not.''
</P>
<P>
   While relieved to have the mystery solved, Djorgovski predicted
that astronomers would be faced with more and more puzzling
phenomena as current sky surveys peer deeper into the universe with
new telescopes and more efficient light-gathering instruments.

STATUS OF THE HIPPO IS UPGRADED. ITS COUSIN IS A WHALE, NOT A PIG 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine having always been told that your closest relative is a
pig, then waking up one morning to find that no, your nearest
cousin is a whale.
</P>
<P>
   This decisive change in social standing has recently befallen
the hippopotamus, which will doubtless receive new respect
everywhere but in Kansas, where the Board of Education discourages
any thought that different species might be related to one another
through evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Kansas, the whale is obviously a mammal that returned
to the sea, but determining its closest terrestrial relatives is
hard because its form has been so extensively modified. It has lost
its hind limbs altogether and its forelimbs have morphed into
flippers.
</P>
<P>
   One might suppose that the easiest way for a land animal to
become a whale would be to turn first into a hippopotamus. Hippos
are almost halfway to whales, as they are hairless, nurse their
infants underwater and communicate by underwater sound.
</P>
<P>
   But mammalogists long thought otherwise. The hippo's nearest
relatives were the pig and the peccary, they declared. Enormous
controversy greeted the suggestion in 1985 by Vincent Sarich, a
pioneer of molecular-based evolution, that the hippo's closest
cousin was the whale.
</P>
<P>
   Now that DNA is so easy to sequence, molecular evolutionists
have been refining the family trees drawn up the old-fashioned way,
on the basis of an animal's outward appearance. Several recent
DNA-based reconstructions of the even-toed ungulates, the order
that includes camels, giraffes, pigs, hippos and whales, have
confirmed Sarich's original suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   The latest of these studies, published in today's issue of
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is based on the
viruslike elements that have copied themselves throughout the
genomes of many species. The DNA of these extinct viruses help mark
forks on a family tree because they are either present or absent at
a given position in a species' DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, led by Dr. Norihiro Okada of the Tokyo Institute of
Technology, believe the extinct virus method is less ambiguous than
other DNA-based methods of reconstructing family trees. It is so
good, Okada has written, that one can dispense with the usual
statistical analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary, Dr. David M. Hillis, a molecular evolutionist
at the University of Texas at Austin, said the extinct viruses,
known to biologists as SINE and LINE insertions, were good but not
perfect markers of evolution, and that dispensing with statistical
analysis was ``highly inadvisable.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite disagreements over methods, molecular evolutionists are
now at one on the whale's family tree. The story goes like this.
First there was an ancestral even-toed ungulate. Then the family
tree split between camels and all the rest. Next the pigs and
peccaries split off, followed by giraffes and deer, leaving just
the ancestor of all hippos. Romping in the water, some hippos
ventured into the ocean. These seafaring hippos then branched into
the two superfamilies of the baleen whales (finbacks, blue whales)
and the toothed whales (dolphins, porpoises).
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell it in Topeka.

   CHINA-SMUGGLING _ ATLANTA _ Immigrant smuggling from Asia has
become big business in the last 10 years. We've seen recent cases
where Asian women promised a better life were smuggled to USA to
work as prositutes to pay off their debts. And more than 130
Chinese endured weeks at sea in poor conditions to get here. Why do
people pay up to $50,000 - dozens of times their annual income in
China - to endure slave-ship conditions to come here? Do they know
they'll end up in sweatshops, brothel or Chinese restaurants?

   w/ASIAN-PROSTITUTES _ ATLANTA _ For five years, four separate
organizations _ one of them a Chinese tong _ ran houses of
prostitution in suburban Atlanta, which they stocked with young
women from Viet Nam, Thailand, Korea, Malaysia and China. The
women, many of them teenagers, were, for all intents and purposes,
slaves. Smuggled into the U.S. for prices between $35,000 and
$40,000 a piece by men known as snakeheads, the women worked for
$100 a customer. Of that money, $30 would go to the brothel where
they were kept under armed guard (often houses or apartments
furnished only with mattresses and condoms). The remainder repaid
the men snakeheads, the jockeys and agents who had smuggled them
into the country and arranged for false identities. Johns were

   (UNDATED) - The irony was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to television bigwig after television bigwig try
to explain how the Big Four networks managed to produce a slate of
26 new fall shows without a single minority character in a lead
role, I went back to my hotel room and clicked on the TV.
</P>
<P>
   On came an old favorite: ``The Jeffersons.'' Everyone on the
screen was Black (neighbors Tom Willis and Harry Bentley weren't in
the scene). And seemingly everyone loved the show.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of threats of lawsuits and boycotts by the NAACP and
Latino groups upset at the lack of racial diversity on network TV,
that question consumed everyone at a gathering of television
critics in California earlier this summer _ critics, network
executives and actors and writers alike.
</P>
<P>
   Asking network executives a controversial question is often like
asking a 5-year-old how the cookie jar got broken _ the answers are
creative, the excuses more so. Thus, the responses ranged from
lukewarm justifications (we went with actors we knew, so we didn't
have time to cast minorities in the pilots) to back-pedaling
promises (we've added three new minority characters) to out-and-out
apologies (we'll try to do better).
</P>
<P>
   This being television, money also played a big role. Many shows
added minority characters after pilots were shot and then screened
for advertisers, when advertising rates were set _ and after the
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But the questions and answers were really just academic
exercises. The truth of the matter remains that if you're looking
for a Black, Latino, Asian or Native American lead character on a
new NBC, CBS, ABC or Fox show this fall, you can keep on looking.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller networks, such as Black Entertainment Television and
Telemundo, pick up the slack to some degree. But NAACP President
Kweisi Mfume dropped a bombshell this summer that made it clear
that, to paraphrase the great movie ``Network,'' minorities were
mad as hell and they weren't going to take it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a boycott happens remains to be seen. But the threat
hung heavy in the California air. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Casting unintentional
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``I don't believe they're intentionally doing this (excluding
minority talent),'' said Ralph Farquhar, creator and executive
producer of ``The Parkers,'' a new show on UPN that features a
mostly Black cast (Farquhar is Black). ``But people have to pay
attention, you know? The makeup of America . . . has changed
radically over the past 20 or 30 years, and yet TV doesn't
necessarily reflect the diversity and the composition of the
American population.''
</P>
<P>
   To Steven Bochco, the color really at issue is green.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a network point of view, I don't think racism is an
issue,'' said Bochco, who created ``L.A. Law'' and ``NYPD Blue,''
and co-created ``City of Angels,'' a CBS midseason drama set in an
urban hospital with a largely Black cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think economics is an issue. When things that you try don't
succeed, there's a reluctance to try them again. When they do
succeed, you try them over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That said, if I'm a Black artist in this community, I don't
give a (expletive) what the reason is. The reality is, I don't have
a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Les Moonves, president of CBS Television, disagreed with the
money theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any network executive _ I know we certainly
don't _ sits there and says, `Gee, if we make this show all White,
we're going to get more (advertising) dollars from Madison Avenue,'
'' he said. ``I don't think anybody thinks that way, and if they
do, they shouldn't be in these jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   But someone's thinking something, and it resulted in a
lily-White new fall schedule. Robert Johnson, chairman of Black
Entertainment Television, thinks he knows how it happened. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The risk factor
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``I think the problem is the networks don't like to take risks,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an economic environment where the networks face a
multichannel environment. . . . You're, you know, one click away
from 60, 70, pretty soon 100 channels. So, if I'm a network
executive _ who's probably White _ I'm sitting back saying, `My job
depends on delivering that half-hour show that's going to get the
ratings for that slot. . . . So, what am I going to do?
</P>
<P>
   `` `I'm going to launch a show that I think, one, advertisers
will like . . . because it will deliver a White audience that the
advertisers value more. I'm not going to go and try to do something
risky and creative with Black people and White people. I'm
certainly going to stay away from Black-and-White sex, so that
takes out any romance stories involved with Black men and White
women.
</P>
<P>
   `` `I'll probably take out any show that shows a Black man as a
dynamic businessman sort of lording over White people, because
that's going to offend the angry White male.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And you go on and on down the line, and pretty soon the guy
says, `OK, let's do ``Seinfeld.'' New York. No Black people.' And
it turns out to be a great hit, and there ain't no Black people.''
</P>
<P>
   Diversity on television has long been a roller-coaster ride,
with minority characters sometimes played by Anglo actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to tell you, growing up, seeing David Carradine as a
Chinese guy (ticked) you off,'' said Scott Sassa, president of NBC
West Coast, referring to ``Kung Fu.'' (Sassa is Asian.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Minority successes
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Yet shows with true minority leads have succeeded: ``Good Times,''
``The Jeffersons'' and all of Bill Cosby's shows had Black leads.
You can go back as far as ``I Love Lucy'' and find not only Ricky
Ricardo but an inter-ethnic marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know all of a sudden why that memory lapse is there,''
said Diane Houston, executive story editor for ``City of Angels''
and an Oscar-nominated director. ``They were either good shows or
they weren't good shows. (Those shows) happened to be very good, or
they wouldn't have lasted, and we wouldn't be remembering them. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same cannot be said for the hastily put together Black
sitcoms that are on now. You don't have classic characters. The
thing that made ``The Jeffersons'' and ``Good Times'' and ``Cosby''
stand out is that the shows are centered around classic, universal
characters who happen to be Black, and bring with them that aspect
of culture.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right, of course. No one _ especially not minority actors
_ wants to see token minority characters added just to satisfy a
numbers game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute that you start denying someone a role because of
their color _ or giving them one _ you're playing into the entire
controversy,'' said Jonathan Prince, executive producer of ``Grown
Ups,'' another new show on UPN with a Black lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the wrong way to deal with it. Don't cast affirmative
action and don't cast non-affirmative action. Cast for merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're a minority actor, those words may ring
hollow. Sure, you may get a role. But what kind?
</P>
<P>
   Khalil Kain, a Black actor, landed a role as the owner of a
software company in a Black Entertainment Network movie scheduled
for this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the type of role that's offered to me regularly,
or ever offered to me before in my career,'' Kain said.
</P>
<P>
   So, what kind of role is he usually offered?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say half of my body of work is thugs, hoodlums,
criminals,'' Kain said. ``I've played them well, but that's what I
played.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Frivolous threat
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Not every minority in the business agrees with the threat of
boycotts and the like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think the NAACP, when it comes to priorities, has other
things they need to do,'' said Arsenio Hall, an actor and former
late-night talk-show host. ``There's a guy right now who's
unemployed in Michigan. I bet he can't understand why the NAACP is
dealing with entertainment first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gang violence, Black-on-Black crime is ridiculous. . . . There
are so many things going on that I think are at the top of the
list. After you deal with that stuff, let's get Urkel the right
time slot. Entertainers will battle this out here, but there's a
bigger picture of Black people who need the help of the NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. One could also argue that television is merely
entertainment. Yet meaningful entertainment reflects the people who
enjoy it. This fall's schedule doesn't come close to doing that.
And a knee-jerk quick fix _ poorly done shows that simply fill
quotas _ would do as much harm as good.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is diversity and there is meaningful diversity,'' NBC's
Sassa said. ``You not only want to see someone that looks like you
on TV, you want to see someone that is a role model, someone that
you want to be with, someone that you want to be like, someone that
you want to aspire to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, those kinds of characters do exist on network
television this fall _ just not in lead roles. Some of the most
interesting supporting characters in new series are played by
minority actors.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Haysbert, who is Black, landed the plum role of a
government doctor in ``Now and Again,'' a promising new drama on
CBS created by Glenn Gordon Caron, who also created
``Moonlighting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been dreaming about playing a role like this my entire
career,'' Haysbert said. ``And . . . hopefully, this will open some
doors for other actors . . . that don't walk around with their
pants halfway down their butts . . . swearing and using the ``N''
word every time they have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The supporting role of a rookie cop in ``The Badland,'' a Fox
police drama, was written for a Hispanic woman, said Roselyn
Sanchez, so it excited her. But she worried that her Hispanic
accent might cost her the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I just went there and I said, `I'm going to be ``very''
Latina, and I'm going to try to do my best,' '' she said. ``And
they went for me. And I'm very grateful, you know. . . . I'm just
proud that they took the chance and went with a Puerto Rican accent
for real.''
</P>
<P>
   With luck _ actually, with a concerted effort _ maybe those
kinds of characters will be featured as leads in series next fall,
not just as supporting parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to tell you, I'm enlightened by what is going on,''
said Kevin Williamson, creator of ABC's ``Wasteland'' (and writer
of ``Scream''). ``I think we should do more. It certainly raised my
awareness and I would love to see pilots . . . as diverse as they
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I'm one diverse person myself, you know (Williamson is
gay), and I'd love to see it happen across the board. And I've
certainly been made aware of it and I'm certainly going to do my
best to do my part.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong words. We'll find out next fall whether he _ and the rest
of network television _ can back them up. &QL;

   VITAL STATISTICS
</P>
<P>
   Capital: George Town (Grand Cayman)
</P>
<P>
   Geography: Grand Cayman is the largest island, at 76 square
miles. The other islands are Little Cayman and Cayman Brac.
</P>
<P>
   Population: 37,000, mainly of mixed European and African
descent.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: Cayman Island dollar (Exchange rate: US$1  &QC;  CI$.80).
</P>
<P>
   Official language: English
</P>
<P>
   Political status: British Dependent Territory
</P>
<P>
   Religion: Christianity
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE
</P>
<P>
   The first place to go for information should be the Internet:
www.caymanislands.ky or www.caymans.com. The Cayman Islands
Department of Tourism also has offices in Miami, Houston, New York,
Chicago, Los Angeles and Toronto, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   As for guidebooks, Fodor's or Frommer's provide pretty good
overall information. Another guide, ``Caribbean With Kids'' (Open
Road Publishing) is also good. But beware: It puts the Cayman
dollar exchange rate at ``US$1 equals CI$1.20.'' (According to
banking officials, the rate remains fairly constant at US$1  &QC; 
CI$.80.)
</P>
<P>
   Once you're in the Caymans, be sure to pick up both ``Horizons''
and ``Key to Cayman'' magazines. Both are complimentary
publications that contain information on just about everything
there is to do there.
</P>
<P>
   The Caymans, south of Cuba in the Caribbean Sea, are less than
two hours flight time from Houston and just over an hour from
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING AROUND
</P>
<P>
   The best way to get around and see most of Grand Cayman is to
rent a car. The cheapest rates are offered by the locally owned car
rental companies.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller families and those with older kids, you can also
rent 4x4 Jeeps, and motorized and non-motorized bikes.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING GOING
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the place that the kids will want to spend most of
their time is the beach. It's a good thing too, since it's free.
The other water activities are basically snorkeling or diving, and
they can cost. There are plenty of people offering rental equipment
for both services.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other spots and activities on Grand Cayman:
</P>
<P>
   --Submarine rides (Atlantis Submarines; Nautilus, The Undersea
Tour)
</P>
<P>
   --Stingray City (Take a ferry boat over to one of the best-known
dive sites in the world and swim with the stingrays. There are
actually two: a deeper one for divers; a sandbar for waders and
snorkelers.)
</P>
<P>
   --Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park (A 65-acre showcase of
Cayman's flora and fauna in living color.)
</P>
<P>
   --Mastic Trail (A restored 200-year-old footpath that great for
hiking.)
</P>
<P>
   --Cayman Turtle Farm (A chance to get up close and personal with
green sea turtles.)
</P>
<P>
   --Pedro St. James Castle (Known as the ``birthplace of democracy
in the Cayman Islands,'' it is the oldest structure in the
islands.)
</P>
<P>
   --Cayman Islands National Museum (A great cultural arts stop for
kids who love this sort of thing.)
</P>
<P>
   --Hell (A tiny community so-named for its rugged surreal pointed
rock formation near town. It's kitschy. It's kooky. It's catchy.)
</P>
<P>
   --Shipwrecks (There are numerous spectacular wrecks lying off
the coast on every side of Grand Cayman.)
</P>
<P>
   GETTING GRUB
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem. For kids, the more than 120 restaurants run the
gamut: from expensive to affordable, from authentic island cuisine
to fast food. Don't worry if you're having trouble getting the kids
to eat that turtle steak or conch stew. There's no McDonald's, but
other old reliables like Burger King, Wendy's and Pizza Hut are
just around the corner. There are even coffee shops for when you
need that extra shot of caffeine.

<P>
   GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands _ We needed this family vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Four months of shuffling correspondents throughout the Eastern
Hemisphere to report on the bombing of Yugoslavia and its aftermath
had me cursing at the mere mention of the name ``Milosevic.''
Worse, my family was leaving me notes in lieu of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   To re-connect we came here, to the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, this gorgeous three-island chain may be one of
the best kept secrets for family vacations in the Caribbean
off-season _ generally the summer and early fall.
</P>
<P>
   Flights, car rentals and rooms can be found at reasonable
prices. Restaurants run the gamut: from expensive to affordable,
from authentic island cuisine to Pizza Hut. The primary
entertainment (read that, the beach) is free.
</P>
<P>
   And there are a few things you can't put a price on: No theme
park crowds. No panhandlers. A low crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   For about what it costs to jet a family of five down for a week
of Disney or Universal Studios, we treated ourselves to turquoise
blue water, sugar white beach sand, and marine life in spectacular
colors both below and above water.
</P>
<P>
   Although we visited this summer, the fall has an added bonus:
Pirates Week, when Caymanians abandon their British reserve with
parades, costume parties and treasure hunts. The October festival
is one of only two main events all year; the other being the
Carnival-style Batabano holiday in April.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, we have three young daughters. My wife, Klemie, took
them down a week ahead of me to visit family on the main island,
Grand Cayman. The ``oohs,'' ``aahs'' and ``whoas'' that began
flowing from the girls even as they gazed out the plane window
before landing _ 2-year-old Elisabeth included _ was worth the
exhausting, frustrating, taxing trip down. (I'm still paying for
that one.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time I arrived the following week, visiting the beach had
become a daily routine for Klemie and the girls. They'd even staked
out a semi-private, partially shaded piece of it called ``Our
Spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Even hundreds of yards from shore, the water is crystal clear
and rarely deeper than 10 feet, allowing the kids to do a little
shallow-water snorkeling. If it wasn't for the large coral rocks
and little fish swimming around your feet, you'd think you were in
a big warm swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   There was a downside: Tearing the girls away from the beach also
became a daily routine. This was primarily a problem with
Elisabeth, who could not fathom why she couldn't live in the water
and thus, had to be carried away kicking and screaming most days.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and did I mention the sand? There is sand _ lots and lots of
sand. It's everywhere. It's on you, your clothes, in your car and
if you're not careful, your food.
</P>
<P>
   Three little girls provide a further challenge with sand. It
gets in their hair. Well, actually they tend to pour it in one
another's hair. I was never able to figure out the genesis of this
ritual. But given that I have sworn a vow of restraint against
meddling in our little girls' ebony locks, my beautiful wife was
forced to take up this challenge alone.
</P>
<P>
   I did mention that my wife is beautiful, right?
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness there's a lot more to Grand Cayman, the main
island, than the beach. It remains environmentally pristine,
despite the continued incursion of big-name hotels, restaurants and
shops. But overall, the island had changed noticeably from the last
time Klemie and I visited 11 years ago. . . alone. . . with no kids
. . . oh, sorry I drifted there for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip, we rented a car and spent the majority of our time
exploring: everything from sights on and off the beaten path to
character-filled shops to local restaurants. (We had five rolls of
film to prove it.)
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, we ate at our hotel, the Sleep Inn. The hotel
cost included a daily complimentary breakfast buffet. Not bad for
US$140 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth's second birthday gave us a reason to celebrate one
evening by trying out one of Grand Cayman's nicest restaurants, The
Wharf. The setting is gorgeous, allowing you to eat in an
air-conditioned veranda dining room or on a seaside patio. We chose
the latter.
</P>
<P>
   But while the ladies preferred the safety of foods they've
tasted before, I had turtle steak _ a beef-like delicacy in the
Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The night's entertainment involved hand-feeding tuna to some
massive, hungry tarpon off The Wharf's small dock. Rachel, our
adventurous 10-year-old, decided to give it a shot. But 5-year-old
Taylor thought better of it after a closer view revealed that she
was smaller than the fish. Elisabeth? Well, she was too busy
tearing into her birthday chocolate mousse to care.
</P>
<P>
   We tried another authentic restaurant called Ocean View at White
Hall Bay, located on the waterfront, downtown _ and down the price
scale. It's less formal, but the food was just as good, and with
big portions. The charming old hostess who greeted us was also the
cook and waitress. I don't think we got better service or food
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But we certainly got worse. As our exploring took us from Grand
Cayman's West Bay to the East End area, we found hole-in-wall dives
that reminded us that just because it's authentic, doesn't mean
it's good.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for island shops, as well. There are plenty of places
where you can buy T-shirts, jewelry, shells and cigars _ duty free.
And ``50% Off'' signs are everywhere, a result of the off-season.
Most of the major shops are in or near downtown. But there are
others to be found exploring the island; including shops that
people have set up out of there homes.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you decide to shop, don't be in a big hurry. We saved
most of our shopping for the last couple of days and that was
plenty of time. And don't forget, the Cayman Islands are pretty
relaxed and reserved. Most shops close at 5 p.m. on Saturday and
stay closed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of exchange for cash is US$1 equals CI$.80. Don't sweat
trying to figure it in your head. Everyone from the fisherman
selling the day's catch on the dock to the Tiffany's jeweler can
figure it for you _ and you can be pretty sure they won't try to
stiff you. I took the easy route and exchanged much of my cache of
U.S. dollars for C.I. dollars when I first arrived.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good thing, too. You don't want to be bogged down
counting coins when you're listening to interesting characters like
Carey Hurlstone, the owner of Dr. Carey's Black Coral Clinic, spin
one of his island tales. A burly guy with a booming voice, ``Mr.
Carey'' _ he likes to be called that _ prefers to walk around
shirtless, showing off the myriad tattoos covering his weathered
skin. He also was one of the many native Caymanians we ran into who
was either somehow related to my wife or knew one of her many
relatives here.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Carey polishes and crafts black coral into jewelry, one of
the islands' best-known traditions. He mesmerized my daughters with
stories of acquiring the precious commodity from the sea. And he
showed off other unusual items in his shop. (He owns giant shark's
teeth and the largest collection of marbles I've ever seen.)
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, places we visited that were more on the
tourist path. Among them are two great nature and history stops.
One is Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park, which sports all of
Cayman's flora and fauna in living color. The other is Pedro St.
James _ known locally as Pedro's Castle _ which touts itself as the
``birthplace of democracy in the Cayman Islands.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of nature, we got up close and personal with huge green
sea turtles at the world's only turtle farm. The girls loved this
because they saw how turtles go from eggs to hatchlings and grow to
weigh a quarter-ton or more. There's even a tank where they picked
up and held smaller turtles.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Another world-famous tourist spot is Hell, a tiny community here
so-named for its rugged surreal pointed rock formation near town.
It has learned to trade on its name, and no one is better at
exploiting it than Ivan Farrington, the owner of the Devil's
Hangout Gift Shop who dresses as none other than the devil himself.
Farrington was actually very nice. He gave the girls a bunch of
postcards from his shop. He gave Klemie a peck on the cheek. And he
gave me . . . well, hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, Mr. Farrington ,you've got an interesting place here,'' I
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to turn it into paradise but business went to hell,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, OK. So what kind of town is it,'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hell of a town,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh. How warm do you think it is today,'' I asked, looking
to change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hot as hell,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, I think that's enough. We're heading out now , Mr.
Farrington,'' I said, exasperated. ``Take care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to Hell!'' he said, smiling and waving.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I found time to go fishing. Ever since I'd arrived I'd
been trying to get together with a guy named ``Red'' Smith, who
worked at our hotel. He was also distantly related to my wife, and
offered to take me out on his little 12-footer to teach me ``line''
fishing _ the popular way natives fish here sans rod and reel.
</P>
<P>
   We hooked up the day before the family was set to leave. Klemie
and the girls set off for the beach one last time. Smith and I set
off from a little cove in the North Sound with his Yamaha outboard
motor pushing us about two miles out over beautiful green water
that was clear enough to see the coral-covered bottom.
</P>
<P>
   I got the hang of line fishing quickly enough to haul in more
than a dozen small grunts and grouper in a little more than an
hour. The problem came when we tried to leave. The motor wouldn't
start. I guess I should have known this could be a problem when I
first saw that it was held together by duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   As I turned toward what I thought was land (and noticed how far
away it was), I gleaned that the water was getting choppy. It
occurred to me that we could be getting back rather late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what do we do,'' I asked, straining to remain calm as
screaming came to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah man. You wanted adventure, eh,'' he said with a big
smile. ``Grab that oar, man. We'll be there before you know it.''
</P>
<P>
   We were lucky the current was with us. It took a good hour and a
half, but we made it back just after nightfall. We passed the time
talking about everything under the setting sun: fishing, politics,
marriage, children.
</P>
<P>
   But not once did I ever hear the words ``Kosovo'' or ``the
Balkans.'' That's what I call a family vacation.

   GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands _ We needed this family vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Four months of shuffling correspondents throughout the Eastern
Hemisphere to report on the bombing of Yugoslavia and its aftermath
had me in hives at the mere mention of the name ``Milosevic.''
Worse, my family was leaving me notes in lieu of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   To re-connect we came here, to the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a summer vacation? What about Disney or Universal
Studios,'' a friend asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not if I want to avoid hearing the words 'Kosovo' or
'Balkans,''' I answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about the kids,'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? Turquoise blue water, sugar white beach sand, and marine
life in spectacular colors both below and above water,'' I replied.
``This will be big fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about the cost,'' he queried, sounding a bit more
perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the off-season,'' I said. ``Flights, car rentals and
rooms are more reasonable. Restaurants run the gamut: from
expensive to affordable, from authentic island cuisine to Pizza
Hut. The primary entertainment (read that, the beach) is free.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there are a few things you can't put a price on: No theme
park crowds. No panhandlers. A low crime rate.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as my wife Klemie noted to me later, the ``oohs,''
``aahs'' and ``whoas'' that began flowing from our three daughters
as they gazed longingly out the plane window on the trip over _
2-year-old Elisabeth included _ were worth the exhausting,
frustrating, taxing trip down. (I'm still paying for that one.)
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim starts here.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a situation made more trying by Delta Airlines' flight
problems, and the fact that my wife _ she grew up here _ decided to
fly down a week earlier with the girls to spend time with her
parents. Let's just say that it was so bad that my four favorite
ladies had to switch to two other airlines to get to Grand Cayman,
while their luggage eventually showed up on Delta about 12 hours
after their trip began.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time I arrived the following week, visiting the beach had
become a daily routine for Klemie and the girls. They'd even staked
out a semi-private, partially shaded piece of it called ``Our
Spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Even hundreds of yards from shore, the water is crystal clear
and rarely deeper than 10 feet, allowing the kids to do a little
shallow-water snorkeling. If it wasn't for the large coral rocks
and little fish swimming around your feet, you'd think you were in
a big warm swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   There was a downside: Tearing the girls away from the beach also
became a daily routine. This was primarily a problem with
Elisabeth, who could not fathom why she couldn't live in the water
and thus, had to be carried away kicking and screaming most days.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and did I mention the sand? There is sand _ lots and lots of
sand. It's everywhere. It's on you, your clothes, in your car and
if you're not careful, your food.
</P>
<P>
   Three little girls provide a further challenge with sand. It
gets in their hair. Well, actually they tend to pour it in one
another's hair. I was never able to figure out the genesis of this
ritual. But given that I have sworn a vow of restraint against
meddling in our little girls' ebony locks, my beautiful wife was
forced to take up this challenge alone.
</P>
<P>
   I did mention that my wife is beautiful, right?
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness there's a lot more to Grand Cayman, the main
island, than the beach. It remains environmentally pristine,
despite the continued incursion of big-name hotels, restaurants and
shops. But overall, the island had changed noticeably from the last
time Klemie and I visited 11 years ago. . . alone. . . with no kids
. . . oh, sorry I drifted there for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip, we rented a car and spent the majority of our time
exploring: everything from sights on and off the beaten path to
character-filled shops to local restaurants. (We had five rolls of
film to prove it.)
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, we ate at our hotel, the Sleep Inn. The hotel
cost included a daily complimentary breakfast buffet. Not bad for
US$140 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth's second birthday gave us a reason to celebrate one
evening by trying out one of Grand Cayman's nicest restaurants, The
Wharf. The setting is gorgeous, allowing you to eat in an
air-conditioned veranda dining room or on a seaside patio. We chose
the latter.
</P>
<P>
   But while the ladies preferred the safety of foods they've
tasted before, I had turtle steak _ a beef-like delicacy in the
Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The night's entertainment involved hand-feeding tuna to some
massive, hungry tarpon off The Wharf's small dock. Rachel, our
adventurous 10-year-old, decided to give it a shot. But 5-year-old
Taylor thought better of it after a closer view revealed that she
was smaller than the fish. Elisabeth? Well, she was too busy
tearing into her birthday chocolate mousse to care.
</P>
<P>
   We tried another authentic restaurant called Ocean View at White
Hall Bay, located on the waterfront, downtown _ and down the price
scale. It's less formal, but the food was just as good, and with
big portions. The charming old hostess who greeted us was also the
cook and waitress. I don't think we got better service or food
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But we certainly got worse. As our exploring took us from Grand
Cayman's West Bay to the East End area, we found hole-in-wall dives
that reminded us that just because it's authentic, doesn't mean
it's good.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for island shops, as well. There are plenty of places
where you can buy T-shirts, jewelry, shells and cigars _ duty free.
And ``50% Off'' signs are everywhere, a result of the off-season.
Most of the major shops are in or near downtown. But there are
others to be found exploring the island; including shops that
people have set up out of there homes.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you decide to shop, don't be in a big hurry. We saved
most of our shopping for the last couple of days and that was
plenty of time. And don't forget, the Cayman Islands are pretty
relaxed and reserved. Most shops close at 5 p.m. on Saturday and
stay closed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of exchange for cash is US$1 equals CI$.80. Don't sweat
trying to figure it in your head. Everyone from the fisherman
selling the day's catch on the dock to the Tiffany's jeweler can
figure it for you _ and you can be pretty sure they won't try to
stiff you. I took the easy route and exchanged much of my cache of
U.S. dollars for C.I. dollars when I first arrived.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good thing, too. You don't want to be bogged down
counting coins when you're listening to interesting characters like
Carey Hurlstone, the owner of Dr. Carey's Black Coral Clinic, spin
one of his island tales. A burly guy with a booming voice, ``Mr.
Carey'' _ he likes to be called that _ prefers to walk around
shirtless, showing off the myriad tattoos covering his weathered
skin. He also was one of the many native Caymanians we ran into who
was either somehow related to my wife or knew one of her many

<P>
   GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands _ Divers. Honeymooners. Families.
</P>
<P>
   Encircled in powdery white beaches that seem to float calmly in
clear turquoise blue waters, the three islands that make up this
Caribbean chain _ Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac _
have been expanding in the type of tourist they attract. For many
of the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a little hustle and bustle with your rest and
relaxation, Grand Cayman won't let you down,'' according to
``Fodor's 99 Caribbean'' guidebook. ``If it's pure R&AMP;R you seek,
you'll find pockets of sweet seclusion, especially on Cayman Brac
and Little Cayman.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Columbus, on his fourth Caribbean voyage, sighted
the islands in 1503 and noted the large turtle population in the
surrounding waters. He named the islands Las Tortugas _ ``The
Turtles'' in Spanish _ but over the next 100 years the name was
changed to ``Caymanas'' or Caymans, derived from the Carib Indian
word for crocodile.
</P>
<P>
   This tiny group of islands has always seemed to hold a special
place in the heart of some wayward group _ from the adventurers who
made them a regular stop to load up on turtle meat, to the pirates
rumored to favor the coves of the sparsely populated islands, to
the divers who have made the Caymans one of the world's top diving
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Cayman Islands _ they are actually the tips of
underwater mountains _ are clearly best-known as a divers'
paradise. They are surrounded by shallow reefs and then sheer walls
that drop off thousands of feet to the ocean floor, making diving
here both unique and exciting.
</P>
<P>
   There are literally hundreds of places to dive and scores of
professionals to dive with. To be sure, there are resorts catering
to divers. But any hotel on the islands worth its salt offers scuba
diving and snorkeling excursions to its patrons.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite, well-known site is Little Cayman's Bloody Bay Wall,
rated the third-best dive site in the world by the late Jacques
Cousteau. Its drop-off begins at 18 feet, then plunges sharply to
1,200 feet. The array of coral, sponges and fish of various shapes,
sizes and colors in the coastal water is nothing short of
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   As stories of gliding through these waters spread, however, the
attractiveness of the Caymans grows with young honeymooners and
older couples. From jewelry and cigar shopping to fine dining to a
simple evening stroll on a quiet beach, the islands _ particularly,
Grand Cayman _ offer the perfect romantic background.
</P>
<P>
   The Cayman Islands Tourism Ministry has seized upon, and sought
to enhance this image with its ``Relax, Cayman Islands Style,''
advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Couples can be seen all over doing just that _ relaxing. Some do
it by swimming with the stingrays at Stingray City. Some dine under
the stars on the seaside patio at The Wharf restaurant here in
George Town. And some escape to the serene isolation of Cayman Brac
where they can hike a nature trail through a 180-acre parrot
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   It is activities like the latter, however, that are opening the
Caymans to yet another group _ families _ in the Caribbean
off-season (generally the summer and early fall).
</P>
<P>
   With airline flights, car rentals and hotel rooms offered at
reasonable prices, many families are finding the Caymans a relaxing
alternative to the harried theme park vacation. What's more, to go
along with the pricier restaurants, there are plenty of familiar
and affordable fast-food eateries.
</P>
<P>
   The primary entertainment (read that, the beach) is free.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty more where that comes from. One of the best known
is Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park, which sports all of Cayman's
flora and fauna in living color. Another is Pedro St. James _ known
locally as Pedro's Castle _ which touts itself as the ``birthplace
of democracy in the Cayman Islands.'' Both are great nature and
history stops. And the Cayman Turtle Farm allows kids to get up
close and personal with giant green sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important for families, however, is the safe
environment of the Caymans. Panhandling is illegal and the crime
rate is very low. And in the off-season, crowds are largely
nonexistent.

`A GESTURE LIFE': FITTING IN PERFECTLY ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT LOST
WITHIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, Franklin Hata, the hero of Chang-rae Lee's
moving new novel, ``A Gesture Life,'' looks like the living
embodiment of the American Dream: an immigrant from Japan whose
years of hard work and impeccable manners have seemingly erased his
foreignness and made him a respected pillar of the suburban
bourgeoisie. Doc Hata, as he is known, owns one of the loveliest
homes in the lovely New York town of Bedley Run, and he is
respected by his neighbors as the ``living, breathing expression of
what people here wanted _ privacy and decorum and the quietude of
hard-earned privilege.'' As a local shopkeeper, he was revered by
his loyal customers; as a retiree, he now enjoys ``an almost
Oriental veneration as an elder.''
</P>
<P>
   As in Lee's first novel, ``Native Speaker'' (1995), however,
belonging and assimilation come at a cost _ in Hata's case, the
cost of self-knowledge and genuine emotional connection. As his
adopted daughter, Sunny, observes: ``All I've ever seen is how
careful you are with everything. With our fancy big house and this
store and all the customers. How you sweep the sidewalk and
nice-talk to the other shopkeepers. You make a whole life out of
gestures and politeness. You're always having to be the ideal
partner and colleague.''
</P>
<P>
   Hata's ``gesture life'' has consigned him to a peaceful, but
strangely lonely, existence in Bedley Run. His one romantic
involvement _ with a widow named Mary Burns who lives down the
street _ will fizzle out in a sad, Chekhovian drama of missed
opportunities and unspoken emotions. And Hata will eventually
resign himself to a ``bachelor dotage of one-pot meals'' and
``one-log fires and the placid chill of a zone-heated house.''
Better not to risk being vulnerable, he thinks: With his practiced
routines (his daily laps in the pool, his daily walks through town,
his meticulous upkeep of the house), he can enjoy a perfectly
serene life free of upset and potential pain.
</P>
<P>
   Hata's concern with emotional decorum and his ``good station''
in the community has turned his relationship with Sunny _ a
mixed-race girl whom he adopted, as a single parent, when she was 7
_ into a civil war of unmet expectations and festering resentments.
He has pressured her to excel at school, at music, at sports, and
as a teen-ager she has rebelled with willfulness and passion. She
has turned sullen and sarcastic and has begun hanging out with a
group of older boys who are constantly in trouble with the law.
When she becomes pregnant at the age of 18, Hata insists that she
have a dangerously late abortion _ less out of a desire to protect
her options in life than out of a compulsion to preserve his own
good name.
</P>
<P>
   As Lee cuts back and forth between Hata's current life in Bedley
Run and his long-ago youth in Japan, the reader is gradually made
to understand the roots of his emotional reticence and obsessive
need for acceptance. Even in Japan, it seems, Hata felt himself to
be an outsider: Korean by birth, he was adopted by a wealthy
Japanese family who recognized his scholastic potential, and he
struggled as a boy to be worthy of their sponsorship. When World
War II began and he enlisted in the army, a similar desire to
please his superiors _ and become the model soldier _ informed his
every move.
</P>
<P>
   It was during the war that the formative event in Hata's life
occurred: He met and fell in love with one of the Korean ``comfort
women,'' who were coerced by army officials to service the men
sexually. His doomed passion for K, as he calls her, and his
failure to act persuasively on her behalf, will shape the rest of
his life: forever after he will be on guard against the undertow of
his own emotions; forever after he will regard his own passivity
with a mixture of revulsion and regret.
</P>
<P>
   Lee lays out these events in precise, elliptical prose that
echoes Hata's own fastidious detachment. He conjures up, with equal
authority, the brutal, acrid world of Hata's wartime service and
the bucolic, Cheeveresque world of Bedley Run, using small, telling
details to suggest each realm's complicated rules of social
engagement. At the same time he allows the reader to see why Hata
remains an outsider in both places: always trying too hard to fit
in, always trying too hard to say the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people in the wartime sequences feel like
one-dimensional pawns acting out overly melodramatic roles (an
inebriated commander, a mercenary doctor, a psychotic soldier), but
the people in Bedley Run, from Hata's gregarious friend, Renny
Banerjee, to his realtor, Liv Crawford, are delineated with warmth
and humor and insight. As for Sunny, she evolves for the reader
from an inexplicably cold, ungrateful child into a conflicted young
woman who shares Hata's sense of alienation and practiced instinct
for survival. When she unexpectedly resurfaces in Hata's life after
a long absence, she forces him to come to terms with their
fractured relationship and his own secret past.
</P>
<P>
   By creating two parallel narratives _ one concerned with Hata's
current dealings with Sunny, the second with his encounters with K
during the war _ Lee elegantly creates suspense out of the
seemingly static story of a man trying hard not to feel. He has
written a wise and humane novel that both amplifies the themes of
identity and exile he addressed in ``Native Speaker,'' and creates
a wonderfully resonant portrait of a man caught between two
cultures and two lives.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A diner sits down to a salad containing mushrooms and lettuce.
In the universal genealogy of life, the mushrooms are more closely
related to the lettuce than to the diner, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. As part of an outpouring of research that is
revolutionizing notions about the genetic, biochemical, structural
and evolutionary relationships among living things, fungi like
mushrooms have now been revealed as being closer to animals like
humans than to plants like lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation is just one of many emerging new ideas about
family ties in the upper reaches of the earth's
3.5-billion-year-old tree of life, in particular ties among plants
and between them and other higher forms of existence. Scientists
are consequently having to rethink some long-held ideas about
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The tree of life, which essentially maps the path of evolution,
has simple single-celled organisms at its base and plants, animals
and fungi _ and a newly delineated kingdom that includes kelp _ at
its crown.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the history of science, experts have drawn the tree
by comparing the gross surface features of various creatures.
Fungi, for example, were lumped with plants because they look much
like them and grow in one spot. But now, by comparing organisms'
genetic material and microscopic internal structures, scientists
are drawing the tree all over again.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be, for instance, that higher organisms were divided
into two kingdoms, plants and animals. The revised crown of the
tree of life now includes five kingdoms: red algae, green plants,
animals, fungi and a more recently discovered group called
stramenopiles, most of which look like plants but are not, because
they do not perform photosynthesis. ``Brown'' water plants like
tiny diatoms and giant kelp share so many characteristics with
stramenopiles that they have been lumped with them. All five of
these kingdoms have lineages that trace back to different
one-celled organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Among this grouping of kingdoms, the green plants have been the
most intensively reanalyzed. They had been divided simply into
green algae and land plants; now they are seen to be a far more
various but closely related set of groupings, from fresh-water
algae on one end of the evolutionary scale to flowering plants on
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some kinds of organisms are being reassigned from one
kingdom to another. Some slime molds, for instance, have long been
classified with fungi, but now are considered stramenopiles.
</P>
<P>
   As the tree of life has been redrawn, scientists have also had
to revise some of their ideas about how evolution has proceeded. It
now appears, for instance, that plants first colonized the land not
from the oceans but from fresh water _ with some of the land plants
recolonizing the ocean as green seaweed. And as the revision
proceeds, scientists are moving tantalizingly close to identifying
the first land plant and the first flowering plant.
</P>
<P>
   The revision is also providing road maps that could enable
scientists to speed up the search for naturally occurring medicines
and the development of new strains of drought-resistant crops. But
it is primarily the sheer intellectual excitement of figuring out
one of nature's grand designs that has lately galvanized the
efforts of hundreds of scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is at least as exciting as exploring the cosmos,'' says Dr.
Brent Mishler, a biologist and green-plant specialist at the
University of California at Berkeley, who is a leader in the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The reanalysis accepts and builds on a recent, fundamental
realignment of all living things into three basic groups: simple
bacteria, archaea and eukarya (or eukaryotes). Simple bacteria have
no cell nuclei. Archaea are bacteria of ancient origin that today
often live in hostile environments like hot springs and are
believed by many scientists to have represented the first life on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   Eukarya _ the group that includes people _ are characterized by
complex cells that have nuclei and specialized internal structures
to process energy. They are the basis of all higher life; the cells
of plants, animals, fungi and stramenopiles are eukaryotes.
</P>
<P>
   The first simple bacteria emerged at least as far back as 3.5
billion years ago, about a billion years after the earth's
formation. Eukaryotic cells had materialized by at least 2 billion
years ago, maybe earlier.
</P>
<P>
   They evolved, scientists believe, by ingesting other species of
cells and then, instead of digesting them, adopting them as
permanent, genetically reproducible parts of themselves _ like the
chloroplasts that enable plants to convert solar radiation into
chemical energy and the mitochondria that process that energy in
both plant and animal cells. Because plants give off oxygen in
photosynthesis, they also produced an oxygen-rich atmosphere,
eventually enabling oxygen-breathing animals like people to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   The higher groupings of life _ what some scientists call the
eukaryote crown groups _ may have appeared in something of an
evolutionary ``big bang'' about a billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In this efflorescence of life, some eukaryotic cells combined to
form multicelled organisms and then began to diversify
dramatically. Although their flowering has been spectacular, they
constitute only a few small branches of the entire tree of life.
Microbes of immense variety still rule the planet, and compared to
them the crown eukaryotes are ``almost evolutionary
afterthoughts,'' said Dr. Mitchell Sogin, an evolutionary biologist
at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, recent research on the higher forms, particularly
plants, has been especially revealing. This was clear from a flood
of evidence presented this month at the 16th International
Botanical Congress in St. Louis, a worldwide gathering of botanists
which takes place every six years. There, a team of 200 scientists
from 12 countries reported the first results of a five-year,
federally supported research effort on the green-plant portion of
the tree of life.
</P>
<P>
   The result of the project, called Deep Green, is said to be the
most complete reconstruction of any part of the tree so far. While
much uncertainty over details remains, the scientists said, the
main outlines of green-plant genealogy and evolution now are clear.
</P>
<P>
   Green plants, in the form of algae, first appeared in the
cavalcade of evolution about the same time as the explosion of
multicelled life a billion or so years ago. For perhaps 500 million
years, the algae were confined to the water. Without water, they
could not reproduce; the only way sperm cells could reach egg cells
was to swim or float to them. But eventually, according to the new
thinking, some of these algal species found their way from the
ocean to fresh water, where they inhabited shoreline environments
that were sometimes dry and sometimes wet.
</P>
<P>
   Special genetic adaptations to dryness and to damaging
ultraviolet radiation from the sun enabled these pioneer algae to
survive when water receded, according to this idea, and they were
able to reproduce when the water rose. Mosses and ferns fit this
category even today _ they grow in spots that are sometimes wet _
and they were the first land plants.
</P>
<P>
   The next landmark in plant evolution was the appearance of seed
plants, called gymnosperms, about 425 million years ago. This
eliminated the need for sperm cells to swim free in the
environment; now the male reproductive cells were contained in
pollen. The innovation proved much more effective a means of
reproduction, and with it, the first big plants like cone-bearing
trees developed, and green plants for the first time became
ecologically dominant on land. Conifers are today's descendants of
these plants.
</P>
<P>
   The latest of these fundamental branchings was the appearance of
flowering plants about 150 million years ago. These plants, called
angiosperms, have an advantage in that their seeds are protected by
the fleshy bodies of their fruits. The lineages of many angiosperms
run in a virtually straight line from then till now: Several groups
of modern angiosperms, like sycamores, walnuts, oaks and dogwoods,
also graced the countryside in the era of the dinosaurs more than
65 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had been wandering around with those dinosaurs, the
landscape wouldn't have looked that unfamiliar to you,'' Dr. Peter
Crane, the director of Britain's Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, said
in St. Louis. There would be some differences, he and others said;
most of the flowers of that era were smaller and less colorful than
modern ones, and neither big flowers like sunflowers nor grasses
had yet evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have not yet identified the original single-celled
organism from which all plants evolved, or the first land plant, or
the first flowering plant. But they are on the scent.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, an early alga called mesostigma, still growing on
the earth, was presented as a ``living fossil'' believed to have
evolved just before the first land plants. Two other freshwater
algae are seen as promising candidates as the closest living
relatives of the land plants.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a small cream-colored flower called amborella, found
only on the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific, was
revealed in St. Louis as the oldest known living flowering plant.
While it is not the ``Eve'' of angiosperms, Mishler said, it is
close to that original ancestor and thus provides a model for what
it might have been like.
</P>
<P>
   At each stage of plant evolution, scientists now believe, only
one family lineage was able to surmount the considerable
environmental obstacles to its emergence. For instance, just one
among many groups of algae succeeded in making the transition to
land. The result is that all plants are more closely related than
had once been thought.
</P>
<P>
   This emerges quite clearly in the case of red, green and brown
chloroplasts, the engines of photosynthesis and the structures that
define plants. For a long time, scientists thought that red, green
and brown plants acquired different types of chloroplasts at
different times. But now it appears that all chloroplasts stem from
one group of blue-green bacteria and are in fact more closely
related to one another than are the plants themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, it now appears that all forms of higher life,
for all their divisions, are more closely related than is commonly
believed; people are closer to green plants, for example, than to
the E. coli bacteria that inhabit the human intestinal tract, and
closer still to fungi. One consequence of the latter relationship,
experts say, is that treating fungal infections in people is an
exacting business; the wrong treatment might harm the person as
well as the fungus.
</P>
<P>
   Humans are brothers and sisters not just to each other, it
seems, but to the rest of life as well.

FORD HEADS TO ABC, WITH AN EYE ON `GMA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an era when many big news stories are interwoven with legal
issues, attorney-turned-TV-journalist Jack Ford has managed to be
in the right place at the right time with the right expertise.
</P>
<P>
   It paid off big-time Monday as Ford was named a coanchor on
ABC's prime-time newsmagazine, ``20/20.'' To take that post, Ford
will give up his job as NBC's chief legal correspondent, and will
also bid farewell to the anchor desk on the weekend ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford's early-to-rise days are not behind him: He has also
been named a regular substitute on ``Good Morning America,''
meaning that he is a strong candidate to succeed Charles Gibson if,
as expected, Gibson steps down next year from ``GMA.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, the 49-year-old Ford confessed he finds
it ``astonishing'' to have landed the ``20/20'' post. ``All of a
sudden, ABC comes over and says `We've got this job for you,''' he
said. ``And you realize this is one of the handful of the best jobs
in journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, he should be used to the sound of opportunity knocking.
In September 1994, after a three-year stint as an anchor at Court
TV, Ford was named legal correspondent for NBC. Here's what
happened next, in his own words: ``You walk in the door and the
first thing you have is the O.J. Simpson trial. Then there's the
second Simpson trial, the Oklahoma City bombing trial, and the
presidential impeachment trial for only the second time in our
constitutional history.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, a onetime prosecutor and trial attorney, is perhaps the
most prominent of a group of lawyers _ others include Rikki Klieman
of Court TV and Greta van Sustern of CNN _ who have parlayed their
legal expertise into a TV career. From the Simpson trial to the
Louise Woodward case to President Clinton's impeachment, the
networks have increasingly placed a premium on reporters and
commentators who understand the intricacies of the law.
</P>
<P>
   That was reflected in the demands placed on Ford at NBC. In
addition to his weekend ``Today'' duties, he cropped up all over
the weekday NBC schedule, offering legal analysis on the ``Today''
show, on ``Dateline,'' on ``NBC Nightly News.'' He also was a
substitute anchor for Tom Brokaw on the ``Nightly News'' and for
Tim Russert on ``Meet the Press,'' but he acknowledged Monday that
he knew it was crowded at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to the starry news lineup assembled by NBC News
president Andrew Lack, Ford said: ``I had become something of a
victim of his success. He's got great, talented people in all the
positions there.'' A former football player at Yale, Ford resorted
to a sports analogy to explain the attraction of the ABC job:
``It's nice being the backup on somebody else's team, but this is a
chance to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the ``Good Morning America'' job, Ford stressed that
he has been offered no guarantees. ``Would I be flattered if
someone considers me the heir apparent? Of course I would,'' he
said. ``But I'm not coming over here with any promises made. We'll
just see how it evolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it has not been finalized, Ford is likely to coanchor the
Monday edition of ``20/20'' with Connie Chung. Gibson is currently
the coanchor on Monday nights, but he has reportedly expressed a
desire to lessen his workload after recently undergoing an
angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In other ABC news, foghorn-voiced reporter Sam Donaldson has
decided to relinquish the White House beat with which he has become
so vividly identified. Donaldson is expected to leave the beat,
which he returned to in a blaze of publicity in 1998, in the next
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-year-old Donaldson, who recently underwent vocal cord
surgery, is still deliberating whether he will leave his coanchor
slot on Wednesday night's ``20/20,'' according to ABC News
spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. ``That decision is Sam's, and he has not
come to that decision yet,'' she said. Donaldson will remain as
coanchor of ``This Week,'' the Sunday interview show.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ford, his last appearance on weekend ``Today,'' which he
has coanchored since May 1995, will be Saturday. Sarah James and
John Seigenthaler will fill his slot for the immediate future, but
no permanent coanchor has been named yet to sit opposite Soledad
O'Brien, according to NBC spokeswoman Allison Gollust.

`BYE-BYE BABUSHKA': RUSSIA'S BURDENSOME HISTORY, ETCHED INTO FACES
AND SOULS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the collapse of communism and the breakup of the Soviet
Union, journalists have been producing reports on the new face of
Russia. Rebecca Feig, the American director of the affecting
documentary ``Bye-Bye Babushka,'' provides instead a few old faces,
grandmothers who lived for decades under the Communist system and
now are left to their memories.
</P>
<P>
   Marina Igorevna, 91, was a peasant on a communal farm in a
village near Siberia for her entire life. Larisa Josefovna and
Tamara Vassiyelevna are professors who dissented from Soviet
policies. Tonya Gregoriyevna joined the Communist Party in 1940 and
remains a dedicated Leninist.
</P>
<P>
   In a comment on what she found, Ms. Feig waxes rhapsodic about
the babushkas, or grandmothers, who ``gave off a life force that
was elusive to me.'' She discerned in their weathered faces ``a
lifetime of strength, struggle and survival. They seemed to have so
little and yet so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for her documentary, the portraits go deeper than
such damp reactions. Viewers may wonder how much these women ever
had, as they hear of Baba Marina's endless labors, binding grain
sheaves and cooking kasha; encounter Baba Tonya's rote faith in a
bankrupt ideology; and learn of the government's suppression of
people like Larisa and Tamara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wouldn't I be a Communist?'' asks the still-sturdy and
plain-talking Baba Marina, as she goes about making bread the
old-fashioned way and displays her ``warm and good'' little bedroom
to her visitor. It's hard to know whether to be touched or saddened
by her gratitude for a warm room after laboring for so long in the
Russian frost and by her lack of apparent anger at the forces that
ruled her life. Party members had books, she reports; ``I had
nothing.'' She identifies herself, without apparent irony, as
``just an honored collective worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Baba Tonya, the loyal party member, now 78, tells proudly of her
labors on behalf of the Motherland. She once headed collectives,
and now sells Communist newspapers on the street. Here, to clips
from Sergei Eisenstein's ``Revolution,'' she recites a long quote
from Lenin on the October Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Baba Larisa and Baba Tamara tell of their protests and
punishments. ``There was no socialism in our country,'' says
Tamara, the professor of Marxism. Larisa's husband died in prison,
where he was sent for protesting the 1968 invasion of
Czechoslovakia. She is unsparing about the past: ``Well, that about
sums up my life.'' Along with such testimony, we see propaganda
movies featuring bright Young Communists swearing allegiance to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   At Baba Marina's birthday party, in one of the happier moments
of this not very happy work, comrades from her collective join in
comic songs for her: ``Oh, mama don't marry me to him.'' Like her
friends, she recalls the deaths of husbands and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it turns out,'' she says, with what may be resignation or a
dry bitterness not long before her death, ``I have had a good life.
That's it.''

GROUP CALLS SCHOOL ANTI-VIOLENCE MEASURES INEFFECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Metal detectors and other popular anti-violence
measures alone won't protect school children from harm, a leading
juvenile-crime-fighting organization said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   What will work _ according to the group, Fight Crime: Invest in
Kids _ are programs for mentoring and for expanding after-school
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for the `quick fix' to school violence, and
it just doesn't exist,'' said James Alan Fox, an expert on crime at
Northeastern University in Boston and a member of Fight Crime, a
national advocacy organization of more than 500 police chiefs,
academics and victims of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said some anti-violence measures instituted around the
country in the wake of the Columbine High School shootings in
Littleton, Colo., simply won't work by themselves and, in some
cases, may cause more problems than they solve. In the April
Columbine massacre, two students killed a dozen classmates, a
teacher and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said metal detectors, while stopping youngsters from
bringing large guns into a school, can't prevent a student from
killing his victims in the schoolyard, as in the Jonesboro, Ark.,
shooting in March 1998, in which four children and a teacher were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   He also warned against banning certain articles of clothing,
such as the long, black trench coats worn by the Columbine killers,
saying this strategy could make alienated students feel persecuted.
He added that requiring students to wear school uniforms has not
stopped teen-agers from finding ways to stand out through such
things as hair styles and tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids can always find ways to get around rules, and,
unfortunately, they can always find ways to kill each other,'' Fox
said. ``What we need to do is stop them from wanting to hurt each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the most effective antidotes to teen violence is
the mentoring approach, where an adult becomes a role model for a
child or children, teaching them _ before they might turn hostile _
how to deal effectively with other youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that children who have gone through early development
programs like Head Start are five times less likely to become
chronic lawbreakers when they become teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that the sooner you reach a potentially
violent child, the better your chances are of helping him or her
choose another path,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For older children, Fox said, the best way to stop violence is
to expand after-school activities that keep students off the
streets between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m., when teen-agers commit most
their crimes. He suggested that schools bring back extra-curricular
activities, such as intramural sports, chorus and drama club, that
have been cut in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also said that communities should consider building smaller
high schools, limiting them to around 500 students. He said
youngsters in smaller schools tend to participate in more
activities and to feel a stronger bond to their school than
children in larger schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students in these huge institutions no longer feel connected
to their schools, their communities and their fellow students, and
this disconnection can be potentially dangerous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Newman, president of the three-year-old Fight Crime:
Invest in Kids group, released a survey Monday showing that three
fourths of parents were willing either to pay more in taxes or pass
up tax cuts to provide more after-school activities and early
child-development programs like Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   He said the survey, conducted by Opinion Research Corporation
International, a polling firm based in Washington, D.C., of 1016
randomly selected parents found that two thirds of them ranked
these programs, along with Social Security and Medicare, as
priorities that they considered more important than tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In the poll, conducted from Aug. 12-15, those surveyed said they
were more concerned about violence in the classroom than the
quality of the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``People figure that it doesn't matter how good or bad your
school is if the students are afraid getting shot,'' Newman said.

HORROR FILMS: THE CHILLS! THE THRILLS! THE PROFITS!  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ In David Koepp's new film, ``Stir of Echoes,''
opening on Sept. 10, Kevin Bacon plays a working-class lug from
Chicago who begins to have unsettling supernatural visions after
being hypnotized. On that same day moviegoers can watch Patricia
Arquette experience strange apparitions of her own in Ruben
Wainwright's ``Stigmata.''
</P>
<P>
   Horror is hot. First ``The Blair Witch Project'' came screaming
out of cyber-nowhere to become the magazine-cover phenomenon of the
summer. Then a little-heralded Bruce Willis creeper called ``The
Sixth Sense,'' which did not even highlight its star in its
advertising, exploded at the box office and has refused to die,
earning $138.9 million in its first 23 days of release and holding
onto the No. 1 slot for four consecutive weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Has the mass film audience turned some sort of
millennium-generated pop-cultural corner, sprouting a sudden and
insatiable appetite for dark woods, ghostly visions and
psychological horror?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it just a really, really eerie coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that what happened is an immense coincidence,'' said M.
Night Shyamalan, a 29-year-old writer, actor and director who sold
the ``Sixth Sense'' screenplay to Disney a couple of years ago for
$3 million, then among the highest prices ever paid for a
screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surprise indie sleeper film of the summer happened to be a
horror film,'' Shyamalan said, ``and then my film came out right
after it only because everyone shoved their movies toward the end
of the summer to get away from `Star Wars' and the new Austin
Powers movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence may have been at work, but there is clearly some
desire among filmgoers for a good, scary experience, one left
untapped by ``The Haunting,'' an earlier summer release that relied
heavily on large-scale effects and was overwhelmed by the ``Blair
Witch'' stampede.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never really goes away, this appetite for horror films,''
said Jeanine Basinger, chairwoman of film studies at Wesleyan
University in Connecticut. ``The millennium is approaching. We have
all of these tragedies on our minds. In modern life it's just one
damn thing after another, and we seek to explain it to one another.
And if there's some experience that gives closure to it, gives an
explanation or at least gives us reassurance that we're not the
only ones having the scaries, it reassures us.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sklar, a New York University professor and author of
``Movie-Made America,'' a highly regarded history of American
filmmaking, agrees that if the spectacular success of these two
recent horror films is more than a coincidence, it might find its
roots in unease about the millennium. People, he said, are
``spooked by all the things that are coming up at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sklar pointed out that the horror genre, one of the oldest in
the movies, has always been cyclical, and that its moments of
highest popularity have coincided with moments of extreme social
and cultural dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   Horror films like Robert Weine's ``Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' in
1919 and F.W. Murnau's ``Nosferatu'' in 1922 were popular in Europe
during the silent era, as the Continent was recovering from World
War I. The golden age of Hollywood horror films came in the early
1930's as this country was struggling with economic depression.
Directors like James Whale (``Frankenstein,'' ``The Invisible
Man,'' ``Bride of Frankenstein'') and Tod Browning (``Dracula,''
``Devil Doll'') were establishing horror as a dominant genre.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, as Americans were coming to grips with the atomic
age and the Cold War, fears about annihilation and foreign
aggression were played out in ``The Day the Earth Stood Still''
(1951), ``The Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' (1956) and numerous
films about alien invaders, giant bugs and nuclear experiments gone
awry.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle, Sklar said, has always been the same: a burst of
serious, creative films that eventually transform into comedies
(``Frankenstein,'' for instance, becomes ``Abbott and Costello Meet
Frankenstein'') before the right cultural moment engenders a
revival. Perhaps, he said, the successes of ``The Blair Witch
Project'' and ``The Sixth Sense'' show that the audience is poised
for another such revival.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it is a good thing for the filmmakers. The coming months
promise a parade of either flat-out horror films or those with
elements of supernatural or psychological unease, including David
Fincher's ``Fight Club,'' Martin Scorsese's ``Bringing Out the
Dead,'' Frank Darabont's ``Green Mile,'' Tim Burton's ``Sleepy
Hollow,'' Peter Hyams' ``End of Days'' (in which Arnold
Schwarzenegger does battle with Satan), Wes Craven's ``Scream 3''
and a remake of 1959s ``House on Haunted Hill,'' directed by
William Malone.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a touch of old-style horror on the home-video
front, with the release this month of two classics of the genre,
including the original ``Dracula,'' with Bela Lugosi, and George
Romero's ``Night of the Living Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   This sudden resurgence of the psychological horror film _ as
opposed to its close cousin, the slasher flick _ has a lot of
Hollywood executives asking themselves whether it is a fluke or a
fundamental change in audience tastes. The betting seems to be that
the back-to-back successes of ``Blair Witch'' and ``Sixth Sense''
was more of a quirky tremor than a tectonic shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has been more of a coincidence,'' said Dick Cook,
chairman of the Walt Disney Motion Picture Group. ``A few months
ago no one had ever heard of `Blair Witch.' Then all of a sudden it
has become a huge, huge phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Cook and Shyamalan acknowledge that they were worried that
``Sixth Sense'' would get lost in the hype surrounding ``Blair
Witch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the scary part,'' Cook said. ``You certainly are
concerned that with the momentum and the mountain of publicity and
all that surrounded `Blair Witch,' would `Sixth Sense' attract an
audience?''
</P>
<P>
   Shyamalan said he was convinced that he had made a movie that
could attract a large audience, perhaps even a huge one, and then
``Blair Witch'' came out of nowhere to draw all the attention.

 HOLLYWOOD: the attention.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it, man,'' he said. ``I thought, `Wait
until the world sees we're going to be the big sleeper movie of the
year.' There hadn't been a great horror film in years. Then `Blair
Witch' opens, people are going in droves, it's on the cover of
Newsweek and Time. `Oh man,' I thought, `we're never going to get
any box office.' My last two movies, nobody on the planet saw them.
I thought, `I can't believe it's happening again.'''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Blair Witch'' didn't swallow up the entire horror
audience. It seemed to have merely whetted its appetite. ``The
Sixth Sense'' opened solidly in first place and has dropped only
slightly over the subsequent weekends. There was also an
interesting shift in the demographic makeup of the movie's audience
over its four-week run, initially dominated by the
18-to-34-year-olds who are the traditional audience for horror
movies and changing in its subsequent weekends to attract more
younger and more older viewers, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no marketing you can do to create this kind of
sustainability,'' he said. ``Two or three movies a year have this
kind of playability, and whenever you have that, you're sure to
have some success. Then, once in a while, when all the stars are
lined up perfectly, it turns into a cultural phenomenon which makes
it into a mega-success.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the success of ``Sixth Sense'' is attributed to strong
word of mouth, since the film did not receive the kind of huge
marketing blitz that often generates big summer hits. ``People are
coming out saying, `Whoa!''' said Ms. Basinger of Wesleyan. ``We
don't see that much mature scare stuff. We've been in an era of
slasher scare movies. These are schlock.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Scream,' which I love, is winking at the viewer. This one
does not wink at you and say, `Hey, it's really OK' This is a movie
that scares you down in the center, where it really hurts, a movie
that speaks to real fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Wes Craven, who directed both ``Scream'' (1996) and ``Scream 2''
(1997) and whose ``Scream 3'' is due out in December, said that the
success of ``Sixth Sense'' indicated not so much a rejection of
gory horror as an appetite for all types of horror films, if well
executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt that gore is what makes something scary,'' he
said. ``It's all about whether you can intrigue an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Shyamalan said he was particularly pleased that his film was a
greater success this summer than ``The Haunting,'' which in his
view relied more on big special effects than on psychological
tension and character development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say it was reversed, and `The Haunting' made $200 million, and
we made $50 million,'' he said. ``Studio executives would be
saying, `Well, that's what the audience wants, big special effects
more than anything else.' So even if it's just temporary, at the
moment people are saying, `Hey, let's work on the character.'''
</P>
<P>
   But several studio executives said they were reluctant to draw
any hard conclusions about the back-to-back successes of ``Blair
Witch'' and ``Sixth Sense,'' which, they said, actually had very
little in common outside of a few shared horror elements. Unlike
``Blair Witch,'' ``Sixth Sense'' was largely uplifting and
optimistic. ``Any movie that is about death being not so bad or so
final usually works,'' said Amy Pascal, president of Columbia
Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is always a tendency to read too much into these
pop-cultural coincidences, Ms. Basinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three movies come out, and everybody wants to say: `Is
this a trend? Does it say anything about our society?''' she said.
``You know what? Not a hell of a lot. These movies were developed
two or three years ago in complete separation. Who knows what it
means?''
</P>
<P>
   Does she think moviegoers are turning away from gore and
violence in favor of psychological horror and suspense?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, that'll be the day,'' Ms. Basinger said. ``I don't
think we've ceased to be bloodthirsty just because of Littleton,
Colo.''

 &HT;    THE EMERGING BATTLE OVER FAT PIPES TO CYBERSPACE
 &HT;    With BROADBAND-DATA and BROADBAND-PLAYERS
 &HT;    For release Wednesday, Sept. 1
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON As the new millennium approaches, the long-awaited
advent of high-speed access to the Internet promises to change the
way millions of Americans go online. As early users know, these
fast broadband services already allow data, music and video images
to zip over either cable systems or juiced-up phone lines, doing
away with the finger-tapping tedium of the World Wide Wait.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, nearly every U.S. telecommunications
company and Internet service provider intends to support such ``fat
pipe'' traffic, which previously has been available mainly to large
enterprises. In the not-so-distant future, a slew of
``last-mile-to-the-home'' network operators plan to offer direct
access to consumers via their local telephone, cable-TV, satellite
and wireless cellular networks.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, several firms are also at work on power line
technology that they claim would allow the existing electrical grid
to be used to send data, voice or video signals at speeds that
would leave the current cable modem or telephone-based systems back
in the dust. If those plans succeed, users could gain blazing
access to the Internet at any electrical socket.
</P>
<P>
   William Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, estimates that about 40 percent of U.S. households have
home computers and about half of them are hooked up to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Says Kennard: ``Almost every one of those computers has more
computing power than can be accommodated over narrowband pipes. So
we have to have a real sense of urgency about this because if we
can get broadband deployed more quickly and more ubiquitously, it's
going to open up a whole new horizon for Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research Inc., which analyzes high-tech trends for
Wall Street clients, estimates that by year's end 1.25 million U.S.
households will have an express connection to cyberspace. Within
four years, Forrester predicts that one in four online homes will
employ broadband access, providing an always-on capability at
speeds at least 100 times faster than today's dial-up modems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadband will generate addictive content, combining the
interactivity of the Web with the immersiveness of television,''
says Forrester's Mark Hardie.
</P>
<P>
   Another private consulting unit, Washington-based Strategis
Group, predicts that total broadband-services revenues will grow
globally from $67 billion in 1998 to $161 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   As broadband technology spreads, Congress, the courts and
government regulatory bodies will weigh whether Internet service
providers such as America Online Inc. should be allowed to use the
cable companies' proprietary lines to offer their own high-speed
services.
</P>
<P>
   The prime focus: AT&AMP;T Corp., the long-distance telephone
Goliath, which has put some $120 billion on the table to buy two of
the nation's largest cable systems, Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI)
and MediaOne Group.(cq) AOL and its allies are pressing regulators
to force AT&AMP;T to give its rivals access to its high-speed cable
pipes as a condition for approving its planned purchase of
MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the FCC has spurned their pleas, although some local
governments have voted to impose ``open access'' requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional access providers say AT&AMP;T is creating a
broadband monopoly by refusing to share access to its cable
networks. But AT&AMP;T supporters contend the company's proprietary
strategy holds the only realistic hope of creating genuine
competition to the powerful Bells, in both the high-speed Internet
and telephone markets.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-August, AT&AMP;T began removing TCI signs throughout the
country and replacing them with its own logo. If the FCC similarly
approves the MediaOne deal _ it is expected to act early next year
_ the combined colossus will have access to nearly two-thirds of
U.S. cable-TV households.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokesman James McGann said the prime purpose behind the
mergers is to enable the company to compete with the regional phone
companies on local telephone and Internet service. ``If AOL wanted
to build a broadband network, with its huge (stock) market value,
they could easily do it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the regional Bells have geared up to market their own
consumer broadband services via high-tech telephone lines. Their
online speeds are competitive. Their approach also does away with
the need for an extra modem line. But the Bells' digital subscriber
line, or DSL, technology still requires a separate cable hookup.
</P>
<P>
   Technical experts note that the cable companies have designed
their broadband services in such a way as to make direct links with
AOL or other service providers virtually impossible. While new
equipment could solve this problem, it would also make the
million-plus cable modems already leased or sold to customers
useless.
</P>
<P>
   A new report by the Yankee Group, a consulting firm, concludes
that ``the delivery of high-speed Internet access falls into a
legal and regulatory vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent private study for its clients, the firm said the
issue boils down to whether high-speed data over a cable system is
a ``cable service'' or whether it is a ``telecommunications
service'' that is being offered via cable. (Perhaps, the study
allowed, it is ``a third, as yet undefined, service for which new
rules and regulations will have to be developed.'')
</P>
<P>
   Based upon current law, if it is a cable service, then local
municipalities do not have the right to regulate it. This is
generally the view of the cable industry. But if it is a
telecommunications service, then local municipalities do have the
right to regulate it. This is generally the view of AOL and some
local municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking the high ground in the emerging broadband battle, both
sides have enlisted batteries of high-priced lawyers and lobbyists.
Among those engaged in the fight are at least two former U.S.
senators, three former members of the House, and Michael McCurry,
the former White House spokesman. On Capitol Hill their efforts
have so far tended to cancel each other out, dimming prospects for
any major action soon on the legislative front.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no consensus on how best to move ahead,'' says Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz. McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, who favors a drastic overhaul of the FCC's role _ one
that would no longer require the Bell regional phone companies,
such as BellSouth, to share their upgraded networks with their
competitors for dial-tone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ever you wanted to see a battle to the death in which there
is almost no prospect of a winner emerging unscathed, take a good
look at the fight over cable 'open access,''' says Bill Frezza,
general partner at Adams Capital Management, a high-tech investment
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Frezza adds: ``The stakes are huge. AT&AMP;T's multibillion-dollar
cable strategy is predicated on its ability to bundle access and
services in order to earn the return on investment required to
upgrade the nation's cable TV systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL's future hinges on its ability to maintain its dominance
as broadband services go mainstream. Federal regulators loathe
losing control to local authorities, who are happy to balkanize the
Internet. And consumers crave choice as they patiently wait for
cable modem service to reach their communities.''
</P>
<P>
   (According to AOL president Bob Pittman, the company plans to
add broadband content through a separate tier to be called ``AOL
Plus.'' In addition, AOL is testing a ``bandwidth sniffer'' that
automatically determines what bandwidth the customer has and
delivers the appropriate content.)
</P>
<P>
   Frezza notes that the Bells' local copper telephone line
infrastructure requires little capital improvement to make it
usable by third parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not so with cable,'' he says. ``Countless billions in upgrades
are required to bring most cable systems up to the level where
broadband two-way traffic can be supported. The business case for
making these upgrades is remarkably flimsy. Much of the hoped-for
return hinges on capturing not just the access portion of the
business but content services as well. Take away this upside and
any pretense of a business case collapses.''
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T critics say regulators must insure that the company's
immense power in the communications marketplace cannot be used to
shape how independent rivals challenge its cable arm or to suppress
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulators and consumers are at a crossroads,'' says Vinton
Cerf, a senior vice president at MCI WorldCom and pioneer developer
of the Internet. ``One path,'' Cerf maintains, ``leads to an open,
competitive Internet. The other leads to an Internet whose users
are locked in to closed, proprietary networks by a handful of
operators.''
</P>
<P>
   He concludes: ``Only by ensuring that all players have equal
access to the 'last mile' connecting users to the network will
regulators be able to guarantee that the Internet continues to
benefit from explosive investment, innovation and price
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing recently in the Wall Street Journal, FCC chairman
Kennard observed: ``We cannot regulate against problems that have
yet to materialize in a market that has yet to develop. Moreover,
we cannot have 30,000 local cable communities trying to make their
own predictions and placing their own regulatory bets on the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its drive to foster a national broadband policy, the
FCC recently filed a friend-of-the-court brief in a case pending
before the U.S. Ninth Circuit of Appeals in San Francisco. It
argues that the commission should have sole authority over
broadband providers.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing thus far not to intervene in the budding broadband
market, Kennard says ``we are following advice as old as Western
civilization itself: First, do no harm _ a high-tech Hippocratic
Oath.''

   NEW YORK _ Adam Fuss has made a career out of bucking
photographic trends.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, when cutting-edge artists were busily
appropriating sundry signposts of popular culture in ironic and
postmodern ways, Fuss took the modernist route. He made insistently
experimental and abstract photograms, creating some of
photography's most arresting images by placing various objects on
photographic paper and exposing them to light. The images included
molten sunflowers, hypnotic concentric circles with a white-hot
core, brutalist sculptural forms, Abstract Expressionist tangles
and fantastical silhouettes of water babies.
</P>
<P>
   Fuss continues to experiment and to produce abstract images of
undeniable beauty, even as artists like Cindy Sherman eschew that
esthetic. ``My Ghost,'' a show of his work that opens at Cheim &AMP;
Read in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan on Sept. 9, includes
Fuss' ever more blurry photograms and a number of his extraordinary
reinterpretations of that quintessential 19th-century photographic
medium, the daguerreotype.
</P>
<P>
   Just as his photograms bear scant resemblance to those made by
earlier artists like Man Ray, Fuss' daguerreotypes are a radical
departure from the earlier, precisely representational studies of
people and places. His spare daguerreotypes bear images like a
grieving woman's silhouette, an incandescent butterfly, a ghostly
self-portrait and a shadowy christening dress.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent hot and humid day in his Chelsea studio, which was
cooled only by the breezes wafting in from open windows along one
wall, Fuss recalled the genesis of his daguerreotype project.
</P>
<P>
   He saw daguerreotypes more than a decade ago, he said, and
thought they were ``a magical medium.'' His interest was sharpened
after he attended a 1989 lecture and demonstration at the New-York
Historical Society by Robert Shlaer, a daguerreotypist who lives in
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall Fuss took a workshop given by Kenneth Nelson, a
daguerreotypist, at the George Eastman House in Rochester. With
subsequent advice from Jerry Spagnoli, a Manhattan daguerreotypist,
Fuss rigged up the necessary equipment in his studio.
</P>
<P>
   Following a process invented by Louis J.M. Daguerre in the early
1830s, a daguerreotypist begins by polishing a silvered copper
plate to a mirror finish. He then photosensitizes the plate with
iodine vapors before inserting it in a camera to make an exposure.
If he chooses, which is what Fuss prefers, he can dispense with a
camera and place an object directly on the plate and expose the
pair to light.
</P>
<P>
   The exposed plate is developed with mercury or, as Fuss does it
in his studio, through a technique discovered by the French
physicist Edmund Becquerel in 1840, with a red light for about 10
to 20 hours. (For the mercury development process, Fuss goes to
Rochester.)
</P>
<P>
   Fuss says his studio equipment is all homemade because he can
not buy what is needed to make a daguerreotype. He recalled
Nelson's saying, ``There are less people making daguerreotypes than
there are who have climbed Mount Everest.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In The Journal of the West in January 1989, W.R. Young III
wrote: ``The daguerreotype is ... unique in photography. Success
with the process requires a familiarity with chemistry, physics and
laboratory safety procedure, as well as physical dexterity, keen
powers of observation, careful note keeping, library research
skills, tenacity and a scientific bent.'' (The chemicals involved
in producing a typical daguerreotype _ mercury, bromine, iodine _
are highly toxic.)
</P>
<P>
   Since his youth, Fuss has been a close observer of his
surroundings and nature's oddities and alchemic powers. When he was
a boy living in West Sussex, England, he was intrigued by the
combustible marsh gas in a nearby pond. Not content to collect the
gas in a bottle and set it on fire, he put a match to dead leaves
he piled on the surface of the pond, where gas from the bottom of
the pond had bubbled up.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, he was mesmerized as well by the mysterious black
mirror that was the surface of the pond. It is hardly surprising,
then, that at this point in his career he should be teasing
expressionistic images out of another kind of mirror surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach to daguerreotypes is purely as a contemporary
photographer,'' Fuss said. Continuing his photograms by other
means, he has, for instance, placed a butterfly on a 5-by-7-inch
photosensitized plate, the finished combination photogram and
daguerreotype yielding an image of glowing translucence.
</P>
<P>
   Fuss' initial group of daguerreotypes, which were made late last
year, was first shown in Calcutta. That exhibition had already been
planned, he said, but there was another reason he wanted his new
work to appear there.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year of the announcement of the daguerreotype's
invention, in 1839, ``there were people making daguerreotypes in
Calcutta,'' Fuss said. ``It got there very quickly,'' he added.
``And I think of this moment in history as being the beginning of a
renaissance in the daguerreotype, and I like the idea of it
returning to Calcutta very early in that renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Romer, director of conservation and museum studies at the
George Eastman House and a daguerreotypist, also sees a resurgence
in interest in this medium. ``There are more people experimenting
with daguerreotypes than at any period since the commercial demise
of the process in the early 1860s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To make life-size photogram daguerreotypes of his larger
objects, like a christening dress, Fuss has been experimenting with
20-by-24-inch daguerreotype plates. He is one of the few modern
daguerreotypists to work with plates this size.
</P>
<P>
   The christening dress and a rabbit motif are carry-overs from
two earlier photogram series. ``My Ghost,'' featuring a christening
dress, first appeared a few years ago; ``Love,'' a startling series
of dead rabbits with intertwined intestines, was created in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   With the rabbit and the dress now pared down to minimalist
silhouettes or hazy outlines, and with daguerreotypes giving an
illusion of being three-dimensional, Fuss' photogram daguerreotypes
are more ethereal and haunting. Among his daguerreotypes is one of
a mask with upright ears. The mask is a delicate celadon and the
background slate gray. Fuss explained that this was a rabbit's face
peeled off the skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dress image is like the body of a child without life,'' he
said. ``The rabbit is the idea of a life without a body.''
</P>
<P>
   As enigmatically beautiful as they are, Fuss' images are
inextricably tied to darkly exhilarating questions of life and
death, change and loss. Given this sense of the evanescent in his
work, the elusive nature of the daguerreotype image seems
particularly apt. Reflecting a light surface, the image appears as
a negative. Reflecting a dark material, the image appears as a
positive. But brightly illuminated, the daguerreotype springs
instantly and magically to life.

 &HT;    MAJOR PLAYERS IN THE BROADBAND BATTLE
 &HT;    With BROADBAND.

 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the lineup of the major players and their current
positions in the emerging battle over broadband services:
</P>
<P>
   Player: AOL
</P>
<P>
   Stance: AT&AMP;T is forging a broadband monopoly by refusing to
share entry to its dominant cable networks. Regulators should
require AT&AMP;T and other cable networks to offer ``open access'' to
America Online and other Internet service and content providers. If
the company refuses, the FCC should block its pending merger with
cable's Media One Group.
</P>
<P>
   Player: AT&AMP;T
</P>
<P>
   Stance: Asserts the right to retain control over broadband lines
after having paid close to $120 billion for privately owned
networks. Maintains its entry into the broadband cable market
offers the only realistic hope of creating genuine competition with
the powerful regional Bells in both high-speed Internet and local
telephone markets.
</P>
<P>
   Player: Regional Bells
</P>
<P>
   Stance: Congress and the FCC need to recognize that these issues
cut much more deeply than the quarrel between AT&AMP;T vs. AOL over
broadband Internet access. Argue that they need to be freed from
their tight regulatory harness if they are to compete effectively
against both AT&AMP;T and the cable operators for broadband and
long-distance customers.
</P>
<P>
   Player: FCC
</P>
<P>
   Stance: Generally favors a nonregulatory, market-determining
approach while privately prodding cable operators to embrace the
Internet's tradition of openness so that more Americans can gain
access to high-speed Internet services. Warns of chaos if local
regulators pile in with their own rules for new broadband pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Player: Cities
</P>
<P>
   Stance: In Portland, Ore., officials tell AT&AMP;T that it must open
its network to outside Internet service providers as a condition of
merging with the local cable company. When AT&AMP;T sues, a federal
judge supports Portland's views. That legal ruling has set off a
flurry of copycat actions among other local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Player: Courts
</P>
<P>
   Stance: In San Francisco, the 28-judge U.S. Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals has agreed to hear arguments over whether localities
have the right to force open cable networks. This key issue, which
has never been litigated, is likely to be eventually decided by the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Player: Congress
</P>
<P>
   Stance: House and Senate lawmakers seek to offer relief to both
sides in offering at least nine bills that address the competing
needs of cable and telephone giants. Even as their lobbyists enter
the fray, most congressional leaders show scant interest in
stirring anew the battle that led to passage of the 1996
Telecommunications Act, which permitted the current spate of
mergers and buy-outs.

 &HT;    FOUR-FIFTHS OF COLLEGE ATHLETES RECALL HAZING INCIDENTS
 &HT;    Eds: With HAZING-DATA
 &HT;    620&AMP;add
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (s) sports categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Four out of every five NCAA college athletes have
undergone humiliating or dangerous hazing by their teammates,
according to a study released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some rookies were cursed at, paddled, branded or kidnapped.
Others were pressured to enter drink-til-you-puke contests or
perform other illegal acts, said the report by Albert University in
western New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only one out of every eight student athletes would
describe what they underwent as ``hazing.'' And 60 percent of the
2,009 athletes who filled out an anonymous questionnaire said that
even if they were hazed, they wouldn't report it to their coach,
school or police.
</P>
<P>
   Hazing is seldom reported, agreed the 1,498 college officials
who also answered anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the coaches and athletic directors and more than 70
percent of the student affairs deans agreed that hazing isn't
reported to them. One major reason: Only 25 percent of students
believe that if their college or university knew of a hazing
incident, it would take strong disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have on the other side, coaches saying, 'We have rules and
they're good rules, but I can't enforce a rule with hearsay,' ``
said Nadine Hoover, the principal investigator for the study.
``Given the combination of the secrecy around the behavior, and the
desensitization and even denial that it's really happening, getting
somebody to report it is very unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   She stressed that hazing should not be confused with positive
``team-building'' initiation rites _ such as making rookies
carrying the balls to the field or court, or ordering them to join
their teammates at skit nights, team roasts or team parties.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers defined hazing as ``any activity expected of
someone joining a group that humiliates, degrades, abuses or
endangers, regardless of the person's willingness to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   A startling 68 percent of male athletes and 63 percent of female
athletes who responded to the national survey reported undergoing
what the researchers described as ``questionable'' activities that
were designed to humiliate or embarrass them. Those included being
yelled, cursed or sworn at, being forced to wear silly clothing, as
well as tattooing, body-piercing, head-shaving or branding.
</P>
<P>
   Just over half of both male and female athletes said that as
newcomers trying to fit in they had participated in drinking
contests or other alcohol-related hazing, which is illegal for
those under age 21 in every state. In fact, 42 percent had started
earlier, consuming alcohol with future teammates while on
recruiting trips to a campus during their high school years.
</P>
<P>
   And 27 percent of the men and 16 percent of the women on NCAA
teams said they had been involved in activities that the
researchers described as ``unacceptable, dangerous and potentially
illegal.'' They extended from being pushed to commit crimes _
making prank phone calls or harassing others, destroying or
stealing property _ to being paddled, whipped, beaten, kicked,
kidnapped or tied up and abandoned. Even if the victim is willing,
such violent hazing is illegal in most of the 41 states with
anti-hazing laws.
</P>
<P>
   Swimmers, divers and soccer or lacrosse players were most likely
to be hazed. At the other extreme, basketball and tennis players,
fencers and track athletes were least likely to be hazed.
</P>
<P>
   Hazing levels for most sports fell between those extremes, and
few big differences were found among schools in Divisions I, II or
III. The researchers said that low response rates prevented
accurate measurement of hazing levels for football, cross-country
and squash.

   ``As a university president, I find the results of our study on
hazing to join athletic teams horrifying,'' said Edward G. Coll of
Albert University. He arranged for the study after some freshmen at
his school had to be hospitalized after veteran football players
tied them up and forced them to drink. He received technical help
from the NCAA and funding from an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Coll called upon other college presidents to join him in
establishing a ``zero-tolerance policy,'' in order to break the
chain of hazing in which rookies are harassed by older teammates
who were hazed in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   While fraternities and sororities can sometimes use their
private status to frustrate enforcement of collegiate anti-hazing
policies, ``athletic hazing is different,'' Coll said. ``These are
our teams, supported by our money, supervised by our coaches ....
on our playing fields in our gyms and locker rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The study reveals that hazing ``is pervasive and appalling,''
said Ron Stratton, a former track star and Portland State coach who
is vice president for educational services at the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recruit student athletes to come to our member
institutions,'' Stratton said. ``To the degree we put their lives
in danger physically or emotionally, our athletic administrators
will have to take responsibility for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling upon college presidents to deal with the problem,
Stratton added, ``This is an institutional problem, not an NCAA
problem, at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of coaches, athletic directors and student affairs
deans, as well as at least one-third of the students, agreed on the
same set of specific strategies that could diminish hazing.
</P>
<P>
   Offered 11 choices, their top selections were:
</P>
<P>
   - Strong disciplinary and corrective measures for known cases.
</P>
<P>
   - Setting clear standards for hazing-free recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   - Creating alternative bonding and recognition events for teams.
</P>
<P>
   - Involving law enforcement in monitoring, investigating and
prosecuting hazing incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The questionnaire was answered by 20 percent of the 10,000
students and 26.5 percent of the coaches and college officials to
whom it was mailed.

COLUMNISTS' ADVICE NOT ALWAYS WORTH TAKING
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Wednesday, Sept. 1)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if alcohol, tobacco and presidential elections were not bad
enough, it now appears that medical columnists can be hazardous to
your health.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Canadian Medical Association, information
published by medical columnists in newspapers is sometimes so wrong
that it can kill elderly patients.
</P>
<P>
   After surveying dozens of medical columns in Canadian
English-language newspapers in 1995, a team of doctors judged 50
percent of the advice to be ``inappropriate'' and 28 percent
``dangerous and potentially life-threatening,'' according to a
Reuters news story.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said some errors might have been introduced during
the editing process and suggested that only those with medical
knowledge should alter newspaper columnists' stories.
</P>
<P>
   Although I am not a medical columnist per se, this story made me
wonder how much inappropriate and/or life-threatening advice I have
passed along to readers over the years, and more importantly how I
can pin the blame on my editors in case I am ever sued.
</P>
<P>
   Just yesterday, for example, I advised readers to send me
$90,000 in exchange for one (1) authentic Florida palmetto bug
captured in my garage. I did not, thankfully, suggest that the
palmetto bug had any medicinal properties, but that is not to say I
wouldn't have had I had more space.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago it was suggested in a column bearing my name
that Vice President Al Gore take his vacation in Bradenton, Fla.,
rather than on Longboat Key, and that he should consider spending
the night, 15 minutes at a time, in some of the many fine motels
lining 14th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this was medical advice of the most dangerous and
irresponsible kind and I am still waiting for the sniveling editor
who committed this outrage to identify himself or herself and
apologize to Gore, his family, and the owners and customers of the
many fine motels lining 14th Street.
</P>
<P>
   In another column, I urged readers to vote only for those
candidates who support federally subsidized lawn care. Tax cuts are
all well and good, I argued, but nothing beats having a fat
Washington bureaucrat come by once or twice a week to mow your
grass and pull your weeds, free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, it is clear that I failed to take into account any
possible pre-existing medical conditions of fat Washington
bureaucrats such as high blood pressure or heart disease, nor did I
give any thought to the fact that anyone, fat Washington bureaucrat
or otherwise, is likely to keel over dead from sunstroke after 15
minutes of pulling weeds in the Florida heat, assuming the fire
ants don't do him in first.
</P>
<P>
   Next on the train of dubious advice was a column I wrote
suggesting that families that eat garlic bread with their spaghetti
dinners are less likely to fight among themselves than families who
don't eat garlic bread. Unfortunately, some readers interpreted the
words ``less likely'' to mean ``not likely at all'' and blamed me
when their next spaghetti-and-garlic-bread family dinner
degenerated into the kind of scene one normally associates with
English soccer riots and stock market ``adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and most dangerously irresponsible of all, was the
column with my name on it that stated that one can reduce stress
and achieve feelings of well-being by plunging ones nose into the
armpit of an overheated elderly woman.
</P>
<P>
   The column went on to say a bunch of other equally rude and
ridiculous things, every one of which sprang full-blown from the
fevered imagination of some craven, unidentified copy editor who
clearly does not share my respect and admiration for this area's
many fine senior-citizens, especially those who happen to be
subscribers with access to telephones and/or writing paper.
</P>
<P>
   All of which just goes to show that you can't be too careful
about what you say.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in my case, what I didn't say.
</P>

   As Russia's impoverished scientific institutions face ever more
severe cuts in financing, Moscow's main station on the Antarctic
continent has been forced to close. If the participation of Russian
institutions in Antarctic research is to continue, scientists say,
they will require increasing international support.
</P>
<P>
   Among the latest victims of Moscow's austerity measures is
Molodezhnaya Station, the headquarters station of Russia's network
of bases on the white continent. Molodezhnaya (pronounced
Mah-luh-DYOZH-na-ya), which had a peak summer population of
scientists and technicians of more than 200, was ordered two years
ago to begin closing down and by now no one is left there except a
half dozen caretakers who are moth-balling the station for
indefinite closure.
</P>
<P>
   Staffs at other Russian Antarctic stations have been severely
reduced and Russian support operations throughout the continent
have been cut to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Molodezhnaya, founded in 1963, lies on East Antarctica's Prince
Olav Coast, south of the Indian Ocean. Besides coordinating
activities at other Russian bases, Molodezhnaya was a center for
glaciology, geology and life sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vladimir Papitashvili, a specialist in Arctic and Antarctic
geophysics, has conducted research for Soviet and Russian
institutions in polar regions since the 1970s. He said in an
interview that Molodezhnaya was not being closed forever. ``It will
be preserved for future use, although that won't come during my
lifetime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Molodezhnaya has relatively comfortable quarters for its staff
and visiting scientists, and it has both a port and a good
packed-snow airstrip, which the Russian polar agency had considered
as a possible hub for a future Antarctic air transport network. But
the other 17 nations conducting research in Antarctica and their 43
year-round stations have shown little interest in the proposed
Antarctic air service, and the Russian revenue-earning scheme seems
unlikely to bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Papitashvili, a Georgian, now conducts polar research for the
University of Michigan and for the Danish Meteorological Institute
in Copenhagen. With the coming of the Southern Hemisphere spring in
September he plans to return to Vostok Station _ a Russian base on
the South Polar Plateau that is now partly assisted by non-Russian
air transport, equipment and scientists, including Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being the world's low-temperature record holder
(minus 128.6 degrees Fahrenheit, recorded on July 21, 1983), Vostok
Station and the two-mile thickness of ice on which it rests overlie
an enormous lake, whose water has been sealed off from the outer
world for perhaps as much as 1 million years.
</P>
<P>
   Any life forms found in Lake Vostok would be of extraordinary
interest, but an international team of drillers at Vostok Station
has stopped short of the liquid water, until a way is found to
sample the water without contaminating it with organisms from the
world above.
</P>
<P>
   Because of financial problems, the Russian staff of scientists
at Vostok has been halved. The station is exceptionally difficult
and expensive to maintain because it is beyond the range of
suitable Russian aircraft. Nearly all its supplies must be brought
overland from Russia's coastal Mirnyy Station, which is supplied by
ship when the ea ice breaks up.
</P>
<P>
   The harrowing supply run from Mirnyy to Vostok, 870 miles, is
made by a tractor-hauled sledge train. The train takes one month to
reach its destination.
</P>
<P>
   Papitashvili said that during most of the 42 years since Vostok
Station was founded, two trips were made each year by the supply
train, but recently the schedule was reduced to just one round trip
to save money. Because the train must bring 300 tons of fuel to the
base each year, correspondingly less room is left for other
supplies, although in summer, American C-130 transport planes,
equipped with skis, have begun bringing light equipment to Vostok
from McMurdo Station.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Russian government is considering closing Mirnyy Station and
transferring its function as the supply port for Vostok to another
Russian coastal station, Progress, that was established 12 years
ago. Progress, on the shore of Prydz Bay south of Africa, was
recently designated as the new Russian headquarters station,
replacing Molodezhnaya.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is not the only nation facing problems maintaining its
Antarctic stations, scattered across a continent the size of the
United States and Mexico combined.
</P>
<P>
   Great Britain has also had to cut back. In 1956, the British
Antarctic Survey established Faraday Station near the northern tip
of the Antarctic Peninsula, some 700 miles south of Tierra del
Fuego. The location was ideal for the study of marine wildlife, but
in the early 1990s Britain decided to divest itself of Faraday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of abandoning or moth-balling the base, London turned it
over to Ukraine in 1996, which has renamed the station Academician
Vernadskiy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good deal for both nations,'' said Erick Chiang,
operations chief for the United States' National Science Foundation
in Antarctica. ``Ukraine got its own ready-made base in Antarctica,
and Britain unloaded the maintenance cost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll see more of that kind of deal in the coming
years,'' Chiang said. ``Antarctica really needs to be more fully
internationalized.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, Indonesia _ Proud, optimistic, determined to have the last
word, almost all the registered voters here in East Timor cast
their ballots Monday in a referendum on the territory's future.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the U.N.-sponsored process began nearly
four months ago, it was a day largely free of violence and
intimidation by military-backed militias determined to block what
seems to be a growing momentum for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Monday was on whether to accept an offer by President
B.J. Habibie of a new, autonomous status within Indonesia. In
January, Habibie announced that if the offer was rejected,
Indonesia would simply let East Timor go free.
</P>
<P>
   The day's only serious violence was the stabbing death of an
East Timorese who had been working for the United Nations in the
small western town of Ermera as he was on his way home at the end
of the day, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The overall atmosphere of calm drew a cheer from U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who sent his ``warmest
congratulations'' to the people of this former Portuguese colony
that was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and has fought a separatist
insurgency ever since.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official said it would take about a week for the votes to
be counted, for the process to be evaluated by an independent panel
and for Annan to make a determination on whether to endorse the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy today,'' said Fatima Desa, 17, trying out her
high school English as she waited to vote in her Bugs Bunny
T-shirt. ``I am happy because I am East Timorese and this is my
country.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western diplomat said Monday's heavy turnout _
estimated by the United Nations at more than 90 percent of the
450,000 registered voters _ indicated a likely victory for full
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Valenzuela, deputy chief of the U.N. electoral office
here, said, ``The figures we have here comply with what they might
be on a best-case scenario, with people coming in in massive
numbers in a regular flow.''
</P>
<P>
   The most extraordinary development of the day was the sudden
absence from the scene of the anti-independence militias that have
terrorized East Timor for months. These ragtag thugs have been
organized, armed and protected by the Indonesian military as a last
stand in its 24-year battle to subdue this territory of 800,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven of the country's 850 polling places were forced to
suspend operations for brief periods because of small disturbances
or rumors of possible trouble, the U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
   Carina Pirelli, chief of the Electoral Assistance Division at
the U.N. in New York, said of the seven shutdowns, ``I would not
rate them as high-intensity incidents.'' All reopened and completed
their voting procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's special representative to East Timor, Jamsheed Marker,
was full of praise for the ``superb'' performance of the police,
who have appeared unable and unwilling to confront the militias
until now.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Martin, director of the U.N. mission here, attributed the
sudden professionalism of the security forces to foreign pressure.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Jakarta-based diplomat who is observing the vote said:
``I think there has genuinely been a lot of heat put on the police
and military from Jakarta. Finally they have become convinced that
the world is focusing on them and their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military has been pretty unscrupulous about pushing for
the pro-autonomy forces to win. But it's looking like they may be
prepared to accept a loss and go on to other problems, of which
they have plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the military has resisted Habibie's notion of letting
East Timor go is a fear that this could encourage a number of other
separatist movements that have gained momentum in this period of
weak government and military disarray in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The nation is in the midst of a long and politically
debilitating electoral process that is due to produce a new
president by the end of the year. The same assembly _ known by its
Indonesian initials as the M.P.R. _ that will vote on the
presidency must also vote on whether to accept the results of
Monday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Marker said this would be essentially a formality. Given
political realities, he said, ``it will be very difficult if not
impossible for the M.P.R. to reverse whatever the result.''
</P>
<P>
   For many voters, though, the question was a more simple one of
pride in their national identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last we have a chance to decide for ourselves,'' said Joao
Batiste, 30, a pro-independence supporter who voted Monday in a
neighborhood of Dili that has been terrorized for months by the
militias. ``I have been waiting for this moment for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, Zeka da Costa, 20, said, ``After fighting for 24
years, our time has come.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Their pride was tinged with defiance in their neighborhood on
the eastern edge of Dili, where hundreds of the people who were
voting Monday had fled into the nearby hills after a rampage by the
militias on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the people here, dressed in their threadbare Sunday
best, it was a day of intense emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Florentina dos Santos arrived at the polling place wearing black
mourning clothes and carrying a framed photograph of her husband of
just two days, Virgilio, who was shot dead on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wiping away tears, she held out the photograph of her husband,
smiling under his baseball cap, and begged, in vain, to be allowed
to cast his vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   A little later a tiny white ambulance arrived. Two nuns emerged,
along with a stretcher carrying Ussulau de Jesus Cepeda, 23, who
was wounded in the same militia attack.
</P>
<P>
   As they carried him in to vote, with his intravenous drip
dangling above him, Cepeda looked around and said: ``I want
freedom. It's now or never.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Monday, Annan affirmed the commitment of the
United Nations to provide an interim administration to East Timor
whether it chooses independence or autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   During its quarter century of control here, Indonesia has simply
taken over the tasks of government administration and technical
expertise that are needed for a functioning state.
</P>
<P>
   Those outside experts will be withdrawn whether East Timor
becomes independent or autonomous, a status in which Indonesia
would cede control of everything except defense, foreign relations
and some judicial and financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The hope of a new East Timor may lie with people like Teraja
Dorego, a student, who stood patiently in a long line of voters,
holding her laminated registration card.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole family is voting for independence, and all my friends
too,'' said Miss Dorego, who was wearing her best gray sweater. ``I
want independence because I am East Timorese and we want to have
our own country.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 17, Miss Dorego is at the minimum age for voting. She
represents the future in this remote and utterly poor land where as
many as 80 percent of the people cannot read or write.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she hoped to be when she grows up, she smiled and
whispered, ``I want to be a doctor.''

   Transport in Spain
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I will be in Spain early next year and will be
traveling from Madrid to Torremolinos, then on to Valencia and
finally to Barcelona. We do not plan to rent a car or fly from one
city to the next. What is the better way to go: by bus or train? _
Rhoda Peterson, Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Here is some basic information on intercity travel in Spain
by bus and rail to help you decide which mode of transportation is
better for you based on time and cost. Fare and schedule
information applies to this month; prices and timetables for the
period that you plan to travel have not been set yet.
</P>
<P>
   By bus, the trip from Madrid to Torremolinos can be made on
Daibus, (34-91) 468-5141, with eight buses daily. The first leaves
at 8:30 a.m., the last at 11 p.m. The trip takes about six and a
quarter hours and the fare is $16.70 (at 159 pesetas to $1).
</P>
<P>
   From Torremolinos to Valencia, Vacoma, (34-96) 348-7980,
currently has daily departures at 12:20, 6:35 and 11:25 p.m. The
trip takes 10 to 11 hours; cost: $38.75.
</P>
<P>
   From Valencia to Barcelona, Ubesa, (34-96) 340-0855, now has
nine departures Monday to Saturday and seven on Sunday. The trip
takes about four and a quarter hours. The fare is $18.20.
</P>
<P>
   By Renfe, the state railway, you can get from Madrid to Malaga
(next to Torremolinos) in about four and a quarter hours on an
express train (Talgo 200) for $62.80 in first class (preferente)
and $43.30 in tourist class. An Intercity train costs less _ $40.20
in first class, $30.80 in tourist _ but takes about seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   Service from Malaga to Valencia is much less frequent (usually
two trains a day) and there is no express service. An Intercity
train takes nine and a half hours, with a tourist fare of $36.40.
An overnight train takes about the same time and costs $43.30 with
a sleeping bunk and $34.50 in tourist class.
</P>
<P>
   From Valencia to Barcelona, there is a much greater selection of
service and frequency (more than a dozen trains a day). A Euromed
train, for example, makes the trip in just under three hours at
speeds nearing 140 miles an hour; the first-class fare is $45.20
and tourist fare is $30.80. The Arco, which takes about 3 hours 40
minutes, is $35.20 in first class and $27 in tourist. The Intercity
service, about 3 hours 20 minutes, is $29 in first class, $22.60 in
tourist.
</P>
<P>
   For information on Spanish railways, call (34-91) 328-9020 in
Madrid or www.renfe.es/hir/ingles.html. You can reserve tickets in
the United States from Iberojet Travel, (800) 222-8383 or
www.iberojet.net, or Rail Europe, (800) 438-7245 or
www.raileurope.com, for an extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Tourist Office of Spain is at 666 Fifth Ave., 35th Floor,
New York, N.Y. 10103; (888) 657-7246 or www.okspain.org.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels in Santiago
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are going to be in Santiago, Chile, later this year. Can
you give us the names of some moderately priced hotels? _ Abe
Margolies, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. You can try one of the following hotels:
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Montebianco, 2911 Isidora Goyenechea, (56-2) 2330427,
fax (56-2) 2330420, is a new hotel in the Las Condes district, a
middle-class neighborhood. The rate of $80 includes breakfast and
rooms have patios, TV, telephone and private bath.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Neruda, 164 Avenida Pedro de Valdivia, (56-2) 2310010,
fax (56-2) 2311007, is in Providencia, adjacent to Las Condes. It
costs $120 a night with breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Los Espanoles, 2539 Los Espanoles, (56-2) 2321824, fax
(56-2) 2331048, costs $80 a night with breakfast. This 50-room
hotel is in Providencia and has 24-hour room service and free
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Director, 3600 Vitacura, (56-2) 2460101, fax (56-2)
2287503, is a modern 96-room hotel near downtown. It has many
amenities (gym, pool, sauna); $145 without breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   A Day on a Steam Train
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am looking for a day trip on a steam or electric locomotive
for my 9-year-old son. It has to be close to my home and near
public transportation because I do not drive. _ Yvonne Cook,
Brooklyn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The most convenient journey for you and your son appears to
be one that involves two trains _ a steam locomotive and a more
modern conveyance, an Amtrak train _ and a boat ride, too, if you
wish.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley Railroad in Essex, Conn., operates the Essex Steam
Train. The restored locomotives follow a 12-mile route along the
Connecticut River Valley. The 50-minute train ride connects with an
optional riverboat cruise back down the river; the boat and train
trips together take about two and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
   The line was established in 1871, linking Saybrook on Long
Island Sound with communities along the river valley all the way up
to Hartford. But the valley was so sparsely populated that the line
never made much money and eventually stopped running. It was
revived as a tourist attraction in 1971, with restored cars.
</P>
<P>
   To reach Essex from New York, you can take Amtrak to Old
Saybrook, Conn., and take a cab for the 15-minute ride to the steam
train.
</P>
<P>
   When you arrive in Old Saybrook, you can call the East Shore Cab
Co., (860) 388-2819; the cab fare to Essex will be $6 to $7. On the
way back to Old Saybrook, you can call Essex Cab, (860) 767-7433,
which would charge about $12.
</P>
<P>
   After this weekend, the steam train switches to its fall
schedule, in effect through Oct. 31, with trips Wednesday through
Sunday (and Columbus Day) at 10:30 a.m., noon, 1:30 p.m. and 3 p.m.
(no boat ride available with the last train departure). On Oct. 29
and 30, there are special Ghost Trains at 6 and 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The combination train-boat fare is $16.50, ages 3 to 11 $8.50.
For the train ride only, it is $10.50, children $5.50; prices
include tax, but there's a surcharge to ride in the parlor car ($3)
and open car ($2).
</P>
<P>
   And on Nov. 6, 7, 11, 13 and 14, Thomas the Tank Engine will be
there for rides and photographs; adults $11, 12 and under $9.
</P>
<P>
   To contact the Essex Steam Train, call (860) 767-0103 or
www.valleyrr.com on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   To give you an idea of the frequency of service on Amtrak, on
Sept. 22 (a Sunday), there is a train out of Penn Station at 6:58
a.m. that reaches Old Saybrook at 9:38 a.m. The unreserved adult
coach fare is $31 one way. There are return trains at 4:16 and 6:28
p.m. One or two children ages 2 to 15 can travel at half the adult
fare when traveling with an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Amtrak at (800) 872-7245 or www.amtrak.com.

NEGOTIATORS PUSH TO REVIVE MIDEAST PEACE ACCORD BY THURSDAY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders expressed cautious
optimism Monday that they could forge a comprehensive deal to
revive their frozen peace agreement by the time Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright arrives in the Middle East on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But as senior negotiators threw themselves into a final round of
meetings, the two sides apparently remained deadlocked on several
key issues. These included the terms for the release of Palestinian
prisoners by Israel and a target date for concluding the framework
of a permanent peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed possible, then, that Albright would be thrust back
into the role of mediator on her arrival. In the Middle East, it is
a familiar role for the Americans, who brokered the frozen
agreement in Wye, Md., last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the new Israeli prime minister, had hoped that the
first negotiations under his leadership could be concluded without
brokers. He has an ambitious agenda for forging a broad regional
consensus on peace, under a tight deadline _ 15 months is his goal
_ that demands efficiency in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   By the weekend, though, the Israelis and Palestinians had
reached an inefficient impasse, and President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt stepped in to help. His diplomatic troubleshooter, Dr. Osama
el-Baz, shuttled between Barak and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, reportedly urging Arafat to focus on long-range, rather
than short-term solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mubarak will meet with Arafat in Egypt to discuss
the remaining differences with the Israelis on a detailed plan to
carry out _ and go beyond _ the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   All parties have seized on Albright's visit as a self-imposed
deadline for reaching a deal. Mubarak optimistically hopes to play
host to a signing ceremony for a new memorandum of understanding
between the Israelis and the Palestinians on Thursday, when he
receives Albright in Alexandria on her first stop in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Barak adopted a tough-guy posture toward the Palestinians on
Sunday, threatening to break off talks, but on Monday he seemed far
more accommodating and hopeful of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm assuming that in two or three days we'll reach an
agreement,'' Barak said. ``And I believe that together we will have
reached a solution that is better than Wye as it is written.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging late Monday from a negotiating session at the King
David hotel, Saeb Erekat, the senior Palestinian negotiator, told
Palestinian reporters that not much progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still exerting our maximum effort but these issues do
not require further negotiation,'' Erekat said. ``They require
political decisions from President Arafat and Mr. Barak.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Erekat, expressing confidence that a deal
could be struck by Thursday, had suggested that the Israeli leader
might have ``cold feet'' about reaching an agreement because he was
``new.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had issued a curious threat to the Palestinians on Sunday.
He had said that if no agreement were reached to modify the Wye
memorandum, Israel would carry it out as is, ``by the book'' _
which is what the Palestinians have long been demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat said that Barak's ultimatum created a ``win-win''
situation for the Palestinians. Either way, the frozen agreement
would be thawed out.
</P>
<P>
   What Barak reportedly meant, however, was that the Israelis
would be literal-minded and less flexible, abiding by the letter of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Since the agreement does not specify what kinds of prisoners
would be released, for instance, the Israelis would release whom
they chose _ criminals rather than political prisoners, say _
instead of negotiating a release formula with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took office in early July, Barak has been trying to
persuade Arafat to modify the Wye agreement and to link carrying it
out with the next step: the thorny negotiations for a final peace.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have been very resistant and suspicious of
Barak's motives.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting between Barak and Arafat at the end of July, two
senior negotiators, one from each side, were assigned to work
through the resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Erekat and Gilad Sher for the Israelis, have forged
a close, trusting relationship, clearly working well together as
they gingerly attacked difference between them as problems but not
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli negotiator has called their talks ``intellectually
stimulating.'' Erekat has joked about Sher, ``He is my new love.''
</P>
<P>
   It has represented a sea change of difference in atmospherics
from the tense, hostile Israeli-Palestinian negotiations conducted
under Barak's predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu _ almost always with
the Americans as baby sitters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But some issues remain as thorny and difficult to resolve as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the prisoner release, in particular, is keenly
sensitive for Arafat. There were several small demonstrations in
the West Bank and Gaza Monday, mothers holding outsized, framed
photographs of their jailed sons. And if Arafat is perceived by his
people to be compromising his demand for the release of 650
political prisoners _ the Israelis call them security prisoners _
there could be significant unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of empathy for the delicacy of the situation,''
an Israeli negotiator said Monday. ``We understand the human aspect
of the problem. But it's a sensitive issue in Israeli society,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis want to include criminals in the prisoner release,
and they do not want to release any members of Islamic
fundamentalist groups. The Palestinians demand that only political
prisoners be released _ those who were arrested before the Oslo
agreement, the first step toward peace, was signed in 1995 _ and
that they be released without regard to the severity of their crime
or to their affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement is reached this week, the first prisoners would
be released by the end of the second week of September, an Israeli
official said, and the second group in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Israelis and Palestinians reportedly came to an
agreement on the overall timetable for staged Israeli withdrawals
from the West Bank, which would begin immediately and continue
through the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak wants to link the final withdrawal under the Wye
agreement with progress in the permanent status negotiations,
which, among other things, will determine the fate of the Jewish
settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   He has said that he wants to talk about the division of land in
the West Bank more comprehensively, partly so as to create
contiguous Palestinian areas, and not to chop up everything in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis think that enough progress can be made in the
permanent status talks to reach a framework agreement by January or
February of next year. A permanent status agreement could be
reached by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   They want to include those dates as deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinians, who prefer to see no dates inscribed in
the new document, think the final date is too far off.

HEAD OF THE CLASS: RICHARD RILEY CHAMPIONS EDUCATION WITH LOW-KEY
PASSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., Ala., S.C., Pa.) (dw) 
 By SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 N.Y. Times Regional Newspaper Group   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - In a way, Richard Riley has yet to graduate from
school.
</P>
<P>
   At 66, Riley is still consumed by tests and teachers, reading
and mathematics, classrooms and college.
</P>
<P>
   But as secretary for the U.S. Department of Education, Riley's
homework these days is a little more daunting - preparing students
for the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many challenges, as many challenges as there are
children out there,'' Riley said in his distinctive reedy drawl.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet and unassuming, Riley steadfastly preaches the value of
education, urging Congress to commit more money to America's
schools, exhorting parents to take a greater interest in the
academic lives of their children, pressing business leaders to
support education reform in their communities, and calling on
states to enact tougher licensing standards for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a record 53.2 million elementary and secondary school
students will pack into America's classrooms. College enrollment
has also risen to a new record of 14.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education has been Dick Riley's highest priority since we were
governors together,'' President Clinton said in a statement. ``As a
Southern governor and now as education secretary, he has always
understood how central education is to the futures of our children
and our society.''
</P>
<P>
   A former governor of South Carolina, Riley has served as
education secretary since 1993. The longest serving education
secretary since the post was created in 1979, Riley is also,
according to many observers across the political spectrum, the
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Riley is probably my favorite,'' said Rep. William
Goodling, a longtime Pennsylvania Republican and chairman of the
House Education and Workforce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   As the new school year kicks off, Riley will travel for three
days throughout the South on a yellow school bus, highlighting
local programs that work and touting the administration's education
goals _ which include having all students read by third grade,
ending social promotion, stepping up new school construction, and
making it easier for all students to attend college. His bus tour
starts this Tuesday with stops in Chattanooga, Tenn., Birmingham
and Gadsden, Ala., and includes a stop the following day in
Greenville, S.C., his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bus trip is another way of saying what's happening out
there in the states is what important to us, rather than staying
here and talking about rules and regulations,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Republicans fight the Clinton administration over
some education initiatives _ the White House, for example, strongly
opposes education vouchers favored by conservative lawmakers _
Riley's integrity and commitment have never been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Riley is something of an anomaly in Washington: Unfailingly
gracious, he appears devoid of a political ego, shunning the social
whirl and limelight. He seems not to have one single enemy in a
city that thrives on partisan clashes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to compare Riley with William Bennett, who served under
President Reagan and remains perhaps the most well known education
secretary, Goodling paused for a second. ``Mr. Riley has never
given anybody the impression that he has all the answers and he
knows it all,'' Goodling said. ``He never gives anybody the
impression that there's a quick fix or there's an easy answer and I
think that's to his benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   David Griffith, a lobbyist with the National Association of
State Boards of Education, said Riley's greatest accomplishment may
simply be that conservatives talk a lot less about abolishing the
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to remember but in 1994, there was concern about
whether the Department of Education would actually exist anymore,''
Griffith said. ``It is much to his credit that that talk is
certainly on the fringes now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina Rees, an education analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank, said simply that the American people are
``not ready'' to dismantle the department, which the foundation had
advocated.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, by the way, is doing ``a fine job,'' she said, as he
preaches flexibility and freedom for states and school districts, a
key concern of conservatives. Still, Rees took issue with a Clinton
proposal to hire 100,000 new teachers, describing it as a federal
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ``I've been impressed with some of the
initiatives,'' including Riley's call for more accountability on
the part of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Much in Washington is made of Riley's perseverance and
determination, a character trait that some trace to Riley's long
battle with a painful and disabling back disease. With the
condition, known as rheumatoid spondylitis, bone spurs slowly grow
out of the backbone. Riley has been left with a stooped appearance
and he is unable to move his neck. But when the disease developed
in 1955, Riley refused to take painkillers, fearing they would
cloud his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Riley is especially highly regarded in South Carolina, where he
enacted a major education reform package in 1984 that toughened
standards for students, teachers and school administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Harpootlian, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic
Party and a friend, called Riley ``one of the big plusses about the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always demonstrated the belief ... that in America, a
quality education is a great equalizer, that you can solve most of
society's ills with a great education.''
</P>

ALASKA TRIES TO LIMIT INROADS TO ALASKA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 5) 
(jt) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the U.S. Forest Service issued a permit in 1984 for the
first commercial helicopter to land tourists on the Juneau Ice
Field, it limited the landings to 400. Today four helicopter
companies are allowed a total of 19,039 landings a year on the
100-mile-long ice field, and have petitioned for twice that. They
also want to land at two of the ice field's 10 zones that were
declared off limits to helicopters in 1987.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether the helicopter companies get their wish will depend on
regulations that emerge from passage of a Forest Service
environmental-impact study that is now in the draft stage. The
final version is scheduled to go into effect for five years after
the current five-year regulations expire at the end of this year.
At issue are arguments about noise pollution, the impact of
helicopters on mountain goats and other animals, access to public
land on the ice field and, most recently, air safety. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That last issue arose on June 9, when a sightseeing helicopter
belonging to Coastal Helicopters crashed on Herbert Glacier on the
ice field, about 20 minutes north of Juneau, killing the pilot and
all six passengers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating,
and so far the pilot does not appear to have violated any flight
regulations. And while the crash is thought to have been the first
of a sightseeing helicopter on an ice field (a tourist was killed
when a helicopter collided with a small plane over Juneau last
year), the accident has sharpened the underlying differences
between environmentalists, who are adamant about preserving
Alaska's remaining wilderness, and those who believe that the
future of Juneau and other Alaskan cities depends to a large extent
on tourism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Mazor, president of the Juneau Convention and Visitors
Bureau, defends the proposed increase in helicopter landings as
vital to the economic future of Juneau, the landlocked Alaska
capital of 30,000 residents. ``Ten years ago Juneau had twice as
many government jobs as jobs in the private sector,'' he said,
``while today there are about 9,200 private sector jobs and 6,100
government jobs.'' That turnabout, he said, is a result of
shrinking oil reserves in Alaska, which forced cutbacks in
government employment, and a rapidly expanding private-sector
tourist industry.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade ago we probably had 150,000 cruise ship passengers
stop in Juneau during the summer,'' Mazor said. ``Now it's about
590,000.'' Those visitors, who are in port for less than a day,
account for most of the estimated $75 million annually that Juneau
business earns from tourist expenditures at restaurants and stores,
and on such tours as excursions to a fish hatchery or to Mendenhall
Glacier _ and helicopter sightseeing. (They may soon account for
even more of Juneau's revenue if the city adopts a head tax of $5 a
passenger _ as it is expected to Oct. 5 _ in retaliation for the
dumping of pollutants in Alaskan waters by the Royal Caribbean
International cruise line.)
</P>
<P>
   The briefest helicopter tour takes about 30 minutes, includes a
landing on a glacier long enough for passengers to walk around, and
costs about $125 a person. The 60- to 90-minute tours, which
average $150 to $200 a person, stop at two glaciers; at each stop
the pilot shuts the engine and leads passengers on a short walk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two helicopter companies combine glacier sightseeing with a
half-hour dog-sled trip. One company drops off passengers, who trek
across the ice field for an hour or two with a guide to a pickup
point.
</P>
<P>
   And the Forest Service has received requests for tours that
feature ski planes, off-road vehicles, overnight trekking,
hut-to-hut guided tours, cross-country skiing, snowmobiles, and a
combination of float planes and helicopters _ as well as for tours
of mining claims combined with glaciers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Sierra Club looks askance at any increase
in helicopter landings or any opening of other areas of the Juneau
ice field to aircraft.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want helicopter landings kept at their present levels,''
said Richard Hellard, who is chairman of the conservation committee
of the Sierra Club in Alaska. ``We're particularly concerned about
quiet in the back country, because it destroys the wilderness
experience that people are seeking. And what happens to our
community by the constant roar of helicopters taking off and
landing?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club is not opposed to tourism, Hellard said, only
unrestrained tourism. ``We want a Juneau that 20 years from now is
still a place where people want to visit, not a depleted wilderness
reserve or a tourist trap.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mazor wants the same things, he said, but doesn't want Juneau
residents having to choose between eliminating essential city
services, or _ in a state that has neither a sales tax nor income
tax _ finding other income sources. ``So it comes down to whether
we can put up with four months of tourism, including helicopter
flights, for the tremendous benefits we receive in return,'' he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hellard does not fundamentally disagree. ``But what we need to
know, and what nobody's talking about, is, How much is enough? How
much is too much?'' he said. ``So far, nobody on the other side's
even raising those questions, much less trying to answer them.''

MITSUBISHI ROLLS OUT NEW ECLIPSE SPORTS-HATCHBACK FOR 2000
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mitsubishi, an industrial giant in Japan but a bit player in the
U.S. car market, rolls out an all-new version of its Eclipse
sports-hatchback for 2000, hoping that this remake of the company's
best-selling little car might help boost its overall sagging sales.
</P>
<P>
   Since entering the U.S. market with its own branded products in
the mid-80s, Mitsubishi has struggled here. For years it had sold
cars under the Chrysler Corp. umbrella, badged as Dodge or Plymouth
models. Like Chrysler had been for years in the United States,
Mitsubishi was second-class among automakers in Japan. Hooking up
with Chrysler didn't help the company build its image here or
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But seeing its larger Japanese counterparts Toyota, Nissan and
Honda enjoy great success in the United States made Mitsubishi
yearn for a piece of the American pie. The company decided to try
to establish itself as a brand separate from Chrysler. Now,
Mitsubishi no longer provides its vehicles to DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   One of its first products for the U.S. market, the miserable
little Precis subcompact (a clone of the comparably miserable
Hyundai Excel), did nothing to build Mitsubishi's brand image among
U.S. consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1989 rollout of the first Eclipse began a decade-long
success story for this sporty hatchback/convertible model and
brought some prestige to the brand. During most of that period,
Mitsubishi sold 50,000 or more Eclipses annually in the United
States. That's certainly not high volume by most U.S. standards _
Ford, Honda and Toyota midsize sedans are sold here at annual rates
often far exceeding 300,000 cars. But for a small company, it has
been a fairly impressive number.
</P>
<P>
   The first Eclipse was something of a departure from what other
automakers offered U.S. consumers, bringing up to 190 horsepower to
a market segment where 140 horsepower was considered high-powered.
</P>
<P>
   A remake for 1995 made the Eclipse even better, with more power,
a roomier interior and more sporty performance.
</P>
<P>
   But Eclipse aficionados _ in fact, anyone who likes a good
sporty coupelike car _ will appreciate the completely redesigned
2000 model. Since the more expensive Mitsuibishi 3000GT sports car
has now been discontinued, the new Eclipse has been taken slightly
upscale to help replace the 3000GT.
</P>
<P>
   This vehicle is new from the ground up. Its longer and wider
than its predecessor, there is more interior space (including extra
room for the two back-seat passengers), and there is more power in
the base engine, which, thankfully, is built by Mitsubishi rather
than borrowed from Chrysler as the previous 2.0-liter base engine
was.
</P>
<P>
   Rated at 155 horsepower (manual transmission) or 145 horsepower
(automatic transmission), the new 2.4-liter four-cylinder gives the
base RS ($17,697 manual/$18,497 automatic) and midlevel GS ($19,047
manual/$20,047 automatic) decent if not dazzling performance.
</P>
<P>
   For dazzling performance, you'll have to spend a few more bucks
for the top-of-the-line GT model, which lists for $20,187 with
five-speed manual transmission and $21,187 with four-speed
Sportronic automatic, which allows the driver to manually shift the
transmission without having to use a clutch.
</P>
<P>
   The GT comes with Mitsubishi's 3.0-liter V-6 engine, rated at
205 horsepower and 205 foot-pounds of torque. Although its
horsepower is lower than that of the 210-horsepower, turbocharged
2.4-liter four-cylinder in the higher-priced Eclipse models of last
year, this is a much smoother engine because of its extra two
cylinders and the absence of a turbocharger.
</P>
<P>
   Making this engine normally aspirated _ that means without a
turbocharger or supercharger _ immediately adds a measure of
reliability and longevity that a turbocharged engine lacks. And
many American consumers now are demanding V-6 engines and refusing
to buy four-cylinder cars, no matter what their horsepower is.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for performance buffs, however, all three models
of the new Eclipse come only with front-wheel drive. Last year's
all-wheel-drive configuration has been discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, too, is the truly fun convertible model. I believe we can
expect to see the new body style offered in convertible form within
the next year or two, but don't hold your breath waiting for
all-wheel drive to return. Mitsubishi didn't sell many of those, so
the company has no plans to offer all-wheel drive in the new model.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with front-wheel drive, torque steer is not a
problem with the new Eclipse, which was a pleasant surprise to me
as I put the V-6 model through its paces on some interesting, curvy
roads. (Torque steer is the tendency of a front-drive car to turn
toward the wheel that is getting the power during hard
acceleration, and it can be rather scary if it comes unexpectedly
during a turn.)
</P>
<P>
   If you like muscular, sporty car exteriors, you'll probably love
the new Eclipse's styling. It looks like a much more expensive
sports car than a high-teens, low-$20,000s sporty hatchback. In
fact, even though this is a hatchback, which allows for easy
loading of skis, surfboards and other sports equipment favored by
the typical Eclipse buyer, the smooth, clean lines of the car make
it appear to be a sports coupe.
</P>
<P>
   The redesigned interior gives the driver and front passenger
separate cockpit-style seating pods, helping to add significantly
to the Eclipse's sporty image.
</P>
<P>
   Standard features abound even on the base RS model. They include
air-conditioning, power windows and door locks, AM/FM/compact-disc
in-dash stereo with four speakers, 15-inch alloy wheels, manual
remote-control outside mirrors, interior air-filtration system, an
engine-immobilizing anti-theft system, and a tilt steering wheel.
Options include a dealer-installed rear spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   The midlevel GS model adds 16-inch alloy wheels, power glass sun
roof, rear stabilizer bar, dual power remote outside mirrors, fog
lamps, cruise control, remote keyless entry, AM/FM/CD stereo with
six speakers, leather-wrapped steering wheel and adjustable lumbar
support. The Sportronic automatic transmission and a six-disc
in-dash compact disc changer are among the available options.
</P>
<P>
   With the uplevel GT comes the V-6 engine, 17-inch alloy wheels,
twin-piston front brake calipers, rear disc brakes, side airbags
and upgraded seat fabric. The sun roof that comes on the GS is
optional on the GT ($850). Other options include leather front
seats, antilock brakes, side air bags for driver and front
passenger, Sportronic automatic, traction control (automatic
transmission only), rear wiper, and a premium audio system with
four-disc in-dash compact disc changer (all together in a premium
package for $2,040).
</P>
<P>
   Roadhandling is best in the uplevel model, but even the base
model handles well thanks to the vehicle's much-improved structural
rigidity and suspension system.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy ratings are rather decent, ranging from 20 miles
per gallon in the city and 27 mpg on the highway for the V-6
automatic to 23 city/31 highway for the four-cylinder with manual
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel tank holds 16.4 gallons of gasoline.

   A Bit of Tudor Fantasy Comes to Prague
</P>
<P>
   Londoners may think their Globe Theater is unique, but visitors
to Prague can see a faithful reproduction of the Elizabethan
playhouse, supposedly less than an inch different in size from the
original. The Prague theater will be one of the attractions of the
Prague 2000 _ European City of Culture festival next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Except for steel stairways, the entire theater is made of wood,
with no ceiling, and walls that are open to the surrounding
greenery. Globe '99, as the project is called, opened on July 21
with a performance of ``Romeo and Juliet'' by a Brno student group
called Theater Studio of Pure Joy. For the next few years
performances will take place only in summer; the management hopes
eventually to turn it into an all-year affair. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Karel Klima, the project's manager, observed the reconstruction
of the Globe in London two years ago and started planning his own
Globe in Prague. After almost two years of preparation, the actual
construction took less than three months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plays on the list for September include ``As You Like It,'' in
English, performed by Misery Loves Company, a Prague ensemble, and,
in Czech, ``Othello'' and a musical version of ``Midsummer Night's
Dream,'' both performed by the Brno Municipal Ensemble, as well as
``Aucassin et Nicolette,'' a 13th-century tale of romantic love.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Globe is on the sprawling Exhibition Ground (Vystaviste),
which also includes a sports stadium, two other theaters and a
19th-century fountain. Tickets (about $6 each) can be purchased at
the Vystaviste kiosk or through Ticket Express, Vystaviste Praha,
17005 Prague 7, Holesovice; (420-2) 1067. Information: (420-2)
2010-3204.

   Pursuing Fall Colors on New England Rails
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who aren't deterred by reports on how the drought may
diminish New England's fall colors have at least two scenic train
trips to choose from next month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scenic Rail Excursions, operated by the Green Mountain Railroad,
offers rail tours of the scenic southern Vermont countryside in
restored coaches pulled by a diesel locomotive. The Ludlow Limited
departs from Bellows Falls, stops in Ludlow for half an hour, then
continues up to the summit in Mount Holly, the highest place on the
railroad tracks. Departure dates are Oct. 2, 3, 9, 10 and 11. The
round-trip fare between Bellows Falls and Ludlow is $25, $16 for
ages 3 through 12; Bellows Falls to the summit is $30, $20 for
children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reservations and information: Green Mountain Railroad, Post
Office Box 498, Bellows Falls, Vt. 05101, (800) 707-3530.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mystic Valley Railway Society is sponsoring an autumn
excursion in Massachusetts. The Berkshire Limited is a 300-mile
round-trip journey on a chartered Amtrak train between Boston and
Pittsfield, Mass., leaving Boston on Oct. 23 at 9 a.m. and
returning at 6 p.m. The train will cross the Connecticut River and
pass through the hill country of Charleton, through the communities
of Jacob's Ladder, by and over Whistler's Arches and through the
rugged Westfield River Gorge just west of Springfield. The fare of
$65 includes a lunch served at your seat.  &QL;

   On-Line Directory Maps Trails for Hikers
</P>
<P>
   Hikers have a new Web site. Launched in August,
www.trailmaps.com provides information and maps for more than 4,000
hiking trails in five Western states: California, Colorado,
Montana, Oregon and Washington. The site is expected to have
information for trails in the rest of the country by the end of the
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A search function that includes choices of elevation, season and
distance finds trails that range from difficult hikes that require
back-country permits to easy, scenic hikes for the whole family. A
particular hike is featured each week, with difficulty rating,
trail map and legend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The directory of national parks also provides information about
permits, fees, lodging, concessions and special programs, as well
as a boot-fitting guide, with hints for the most common fit
problems. Under the heading In the Marketplace, more than 7,000
gear products are available, including books, maps and CD-ROMs
related to various trails. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Related sites include www.mountainzone.com, which covers hiking,
climbing, mountain biking, skiing and snowboarding, and
www.skiresorts.com, providing news and information about winter
resorts.

   Design Your Own Hotel Room in London
</P>
<P>
   Ever check into a hotel and wish your room were blue instead of
yellow? A new hotel in London will offer guests the opportunity to
play interior decorator and change the color and mood of their
rooms with the spin of a lighting dial. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guest rooms at St. Martins Lane, the latest hotel to bring
together the talents of the designer Philippe Starck and the
hotelier Ian Schrager, could be described as cool white envelopes.
With a flip of a bedside dial that contains the full spectrum of
colors, guests can change the color _ and brightness _ of the
reading lights over the beds, which are strong enough to alter the
shade of the room. Since rooms have floor-to-ceiling windows, color
preferences of the guests can be seen from the outside, and the
hotel's glass exterior will continuously, if subtly, change hue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 204-room hotel in Covent Garden, which is scheduled to open
on Tuesday, is one of two hotels Schrager plans for London. Room
rates at the St. Martins Lane, in a former office building, start
at $200. It will offer a 24-hour gym, 24-hour brasserie, video art
installations in the elevators, a supervised children's play area
and a branch of Asia de Cuba, the restaurant in Schrager's Morgans
hotel in New York.

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I have an employee who does a good job, but all
of us have to walk on eggs when we deal with her. If something goes
differently from what she wants, she can instantly become very
difficult. How do you deal with someone like this? T.K. &QL; 
A. If you have to walk on eggs when dealing with an employee, it is
often a matter of time before something cracks. And, since you are
dealing more with personality than job skills, this is a
particularly difficult matter to unscramble.
</P>
<P>
   By saying that this employee does a very good job, you are
obviously satisfied with her technical skills and ability to get
her job done. However, if there can be problems every time she
interacts with another person or department, perhaps her overall
performance is not that positive. In a word, her volatility is
likely to interfere with her work as well as the work of those who
must interact with her.
</P>
<P>
   It may be helpful to give her feedback when she displays her
difficult behaviors and let her know about the kinds of problems,
career limitations and consequences that can accompany such
behavior. You can also suggest more productive ways for her to act
and react.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, since she does a good job technically, it may
also be worthwhile to try to build the job around her strengths and
minimize the amount of interaction she needs to have with others.
The idea is to let her do what she does best, and prevent her from
doing what she does worst. &QL; 
Q. Our company claims to be ``family-friendly,'' but everyone works
incredibly long hours, and no one takes advantage of the company's
so-called flexibility. I want to take some time off when my wife
has her baby, but several people have told me that doing so will
hurt my career. What do you suggest? S.M. &QL; 
A. What do you think is going to happen to the performance, and
ultimately the career, of a disgruntled employee who expected to
take some time off to be with his wife and new baby, but instead
spends countless hours at the office?
</P>
<P>
   However, before making a decision based on some observations and
the comments of some co-workers, you should do more data gathering.
It is possible that the family-friendly policies are in force, and
you merely needed to talk to more people. In this regard, if you
have a solid working relationship with your manager or Human
Resources representative, you should ask him or her about the
company's policy and expectations regarding time off for a new
baby.
</P>
<P>
   You may also want to suggest ways that you can take more time
off and still cover various aspects of your job, such as through
telecommuting or more variable hours. If the company is truly
family-friendly, management will work with you on this matter. And,
if the company is not family-friendly, then its claim is a lie. In
that case, you will actually be doing your career and your family a
favor by standing up for what you wanted to do in the first place. &QL; 
Q. I was at a meeting with my manager and some members of senior
management, and whenever I talked, my manager kicked me. I didn't
know if he wanted me to keep talking or be quiet, so I ignored him.
After the meeting, he said I was talking too much, and he was
kicking me to get me to stop. I'm annoyed and don't know what to
tell him. M.P. &QL; 
A. In the parlance of body language, a kick generally means for
people to stop and mules to go. However, a manager is acting like a
mule if he is kicking employees during a meeting. But if an
employee is galloping down the wrong path in a meeting, some
managers feel the only way to rein things in is with a boot.
</P>
<P>
   This means that you should look at your behavior as well as that
of your manager. On the one hand, is it possible that you may have
been a little too verbal? On the other hand, is it possible that
you and your manager were ill-prepared? If a manager has worked
with his or her staff and anticipated the questions, issues and
concerns that may arise in a meeting, the likelihood of an employee
heading in the wrong direction is dramatically decreased.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, you should tell your manager that you do not want to
be kicked or touched in any way. And if he feels you are out of
line in a meeting, tell him that you would prefer he use his words
instead of his feet. &QL;

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Jerusalem) _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders
expressed guarded optimism Monday that they could cinch a deal to
revive the frozen Wye River peace agreement by the time Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright arrives in the Middle East on Thursday.
But as senior negotiators threw themselves into a final round of
meetings, the two sides apparently remained deadlocked on several
key issues. These included the terms for the release of Palestinian
prisoners by Israel and a target date for concluding the framework
of a permanent peace accord. By Deborah Sontag.

the rite of political piety has moved far beyond the sacramental
photo opportunity. This time around, the candidates are engaging in

LIFE AFTER `FOOTLOOSE': KEVIN BACON GOES SUPERNATURAL
</HEADLINE>
 KEVIN-BACON-IN-STIR-OF-ECHOES-STARBEAT-ART-NYTSF  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Kevin Bacon in the upcoming film ``Stir
of Echoes.'')
 By IAN SPELLING  
 &HT;    Kevin Bacon is waiting for a sign.
 &HT;    A knock on the ceiling.
 &HT;    A rush of cold air.
 &HT;    A door that blows open, suddenly...
 &HT;    ``I've never had any kind of psychic experience,'' says the
``Footloose'' star. ``I've never seen a ghost, never had anything
paranormal happen to me, but I'm totally open to it. If there are
spirits out there that want to contact me and say, `Hi,' ... I'm
for it... I'll sign autographs.''
 &HT;    Bacon shot to fame in 1984 in the musical ``Footloose'' (1984),
but today he's promoting a scary new supernatural thriller called
``Stir of Echoes.''
 &HT;    The actor hasn't entirely made up his mind about the whole grand
subject of the afterlife, but he says he'll stay tuned.
 &HT;    ``I'm not a firm disbeliever. I just haven't had anything happen
and I need to be convinced,'' he adds.
 &HT;    Tom Witzky, Bacon's character in his new movie, needs
convincing, too. And during the course of the movie, he becomes
entirely convinced.
 &HT;    A working-class hero who lives with his wife Maggie (Kathryn
Erbe) and young son Jake (Zachary David Cope) in a modest Chicago
house, Tom agrees to let his sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana Douglas)
hypnotize him.
 &HT;    Soon after, he experiences horrific visions of an unspeakable
crime, visions that nearly push him over the edge.
 &HT;    Given the success of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' ``The
Haunting'' and ``The Sixth Sense,'' the timing seems perfect for
``Stir of Echoes,'' which is based on Richard Matheson's 1958 novel
of the same name and which will be released September 10.
 &HT;    Bacon puts down down his leather-bound Filofax, doffs his black
sunglasses and lies back on the couch at his publicist's Manhattan
office to talk about ghosts, rock 'n' roll and marriage.
 &HT;    ``What I was drawn to in `Stir of Echoes' was that if you took
out the ghost and the murder mystery aspects, I'd still be
interested in this character, a guy at a crossroads,'' says Bacon,
 &HT;    ``On one side he sees his youth, his rock and roll, his chance
to live out his dream all dissipating, and on the other side he
loves his wife and kid, and feels he's a good father. That was
interesting, right there,'' he adds.
 &HT;    In one particularly disturbing scene, Bacon feverishly digs up
the family's backyard in a manic scene which echoes Jack
Nicholson's lunatic performance in ``The Shining.''
 &HT;    Bacon smiles at the comparison.
 &HT;    ``This may be my downfall, but I always like to err on the side
of being a little too big, of pushing things a little too far,'' he
says. ``I think, often times, film actors were just told to `dial
it down, dial it down.''
 &HT;    ``I'll look at a performance and think, `Wake the f--- up! Do a
little acting. Do something.'
 &HT;    ``I want to see some semblance of a performance if I'm paying my
money to see something. I tend to appreciate actors who go over the
top.''
 &HT;    Bacon rubs his goatee and runs his fingers through his hair.
 &HT;    ``I was very lucky on `Stir of Echoes.' From the very first
meeting (writer-director) Dave Koepp said, `I want to push it. I
want to test the limits.'''
 &HT;    Truth be told, ``Stir of Echoes'' is a typical Bacon film in
that it's another atypical choice in a career of atypical choices.
 &HT;    Now 41 years old, Bacon's resume includes ``Animal House''
(1978), ``Friday the 13th'' (1980), ``Diner'' (1982), ``Footloose''
(1984), ``JFK'' (1991), ``Apollo 13'' (1995) and ``Wild Things''
(1998), as well as a batch of independent films, assorted stage
appearances, a thriving music career and a 1996 stint as a
director.
 &HT;    ``As far as the films go, I've always just gone back and found
these little independents that have something I want to do as an
actor,'' he says.
 &HT;    Later this year Bacon can be seen in the family film ``My Dog
Skip,'' and he is currently filming a big-budget popcorn flick,
``The Hollow Man,'' with Elizabeth Shue and Josh Brolin.
 &HT;    ```Hollow Man' is probably a good film for me to do, but I also
need to do `Digging to China' (1998) and `Telling Lies in America''
(1998) and `My Dog Skip.'''
 &HT;    Beyond mixing studio and independent features, Bacon tackles
villains and saints, action and comedy, drama and thrillers.
 &HT;    Does anything scare him?
 &HT;    ``There's nothing I'd be afraid to do,'' he says. ``Some things
might scare me, actually, but I wouldn't not do something because
it scares me.''
 &HT;    Bacon keeps busy when he is not making films. Off the set, he
has spent the last few years performing and recording with his
older brother Michael in a band called The Bacon Brothers, which
will release a new album and go on tour early next year.
 &HT;    As for his marriage, Bacon and actress Kyra Sedgwick have been
together for nearly a decade and are the parents of two children.
The family divides its time between homes in Manhattan and
Connecticut.
 &HT;    ``The last thing Kyra and I want to do is hold ourselves up as
poster children for a happy, healthy marriage,'' Bacon says. ``Life
for us is as difficult as it is for anybody.
 &HT;    ``We're a two-career family and I don't care what the two
careers are, that makes it a struggle. Kyra and I just lucked out.
We found each other.''
 &HT;    As the conversation reaches an end, Bacon can practically smell
the ``Footloose'' and ``Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon'' questions in
the air.
 &HT;    After all, ``Footloose'' remains Bacon's biggest hit and ``Six
Degrees'' -- a game that posits the theory that everyone in
Hollywood is removed from Bacon by no more than six people -- is
not only a water cooler favorite in Tinseltown but now a board
game.
 &HT;    Bacon, however, is caught a little off-guard by the question _
if he could jettison either ``Footloose'' or ``Six Degrees'' from
his life, which would he drop?
 &HT;    ``I'm grateful I had a `Footloose' in my life,'' he says. ``It
had a tremendous impact on my career, but the movie came out more
than 15 years ago. I have worked since then.
 &HT;    ```Six Degrees' is more of an odd piece of pop culture. I had
nothing to do with it. It just goes along. It doesn't bother me and
I don't work it.''
 &HT;    And the answer to the question?
 &HT;    ``If one of them had to go away?'' he says, smiling. ``I'd let
the game go. The work is work, and I've got to live with what I put
out there.''

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Heather
Locklear in ``Spin City.'' 
  By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Heather Locklear is one of the most famous blondes in La La
Land, but she can't compete with Laa-Laa, a Teletubby.
 &HT;    Ava, her 18-month-old daughter, doesn't care if her mother is
watching one of three final episodes of ``Melrose Place.''
 &HT;    She wants to watch her Teletubby tape. And she wants it now.
 &HT;    Locklear's husband, rock star Richie Sambora, defers to both
females.
 &HT;    It's Monday night at their Malibu home, and mother and child are
at odds.
 &HT;    But this ain't no ``Melrose Place'' _ and there's no mud
wrestling here.
 &HT;    ``Honey, mommy wants to watch grown-up TV,'' says Locklear, who
as Amanda Woodward on ``Melrose Place'' could handle any crisis.
 &HT;    She's brought down the mob, survived a helicopter crash, a fatal
disease and a few bad color jobs.
 &HT;    But dealing with a two-year-old _ now there's a challenge.
 &HT;    ``Laa-Laa, Laa-Laa, Laa-Laa,'' cries Ava.
 &HT;    Whereas Amanda Woodward might have spent seven years in
television's alternate universe, slinking around her apartment with
a bottle of wine in one hand and a guy's tie in the other, Locklear
herself lives in a simple world of diapers and dinosaurs.
 &HT;    ``Now the man in my life is Barney,'' she says, referring to the
prehistoric lizard preferred by infants everywhere.
 &HT;    ``I can't believe the mother in me who tells the baby, `We have
to switch this off because you're not learning anything.'''
 &HT;    Locklear has learned that there are second, third and fourth
acts on television.
 &HT;    Barely had she taken a breath after ``Melrose'' ended last May
when she accepted a role opposite Michael J. Fox on the political
comedy series ``Spin City.''
 &HT;    Fox is a longtime fan of Locklear's, and when the show's
producers were casting about for the part of the campaign manager,
his vote went to Locklear. (The two will team up as co-presenters
for the 51st Annual Emmy Awards, on September 12.)
 &HT;    Locklear says that when she was offered the ``Spin City'' part,
she was taken aback.
 &HT;    ``It was a little terrifying because we do the show in front of
a live audience,'' she says, adding that she has not always lived
by the showbiz dictum ``Never let them see you sweat.''
 &HT;    ``I have sweated. There has been a little dry mouth,'' she
admits.
 &HT;    Locklear has been a network staple since 1981, with starring
roles in dramas including ``TJ Hooker,'' ``Dynasty'' and ``Melrose
Place.''
 &HT;    But catch her on a rare night at her LA home and one thing is
clear: she is not a vixen. She just played one on TV.
 &HT;    Sounding like a typical harried mom, she apologizes profusely
for being just three minutes late, and concedes that before she
accepted the role in ``Spin City,'' she felt few qualms about the
end of ``Melrose Place.''
 &HT;    ``I knew in my heart that it was time to move on. We had a good
run. I can't complain.''
 &HT;    Her Amanda character goes down in television history as one of
the baddest of the bad girls. And the skirts she wore on the show
will be remembered for their brevity.
 &HT;    ``You know who really started that trend? The actresses on
`Knots Landing.' They wore suits where you seriously hoped that
there wasn't a strong breeze that day. I guess I don't care who
started it. I got to wear some fabulous outfits,`` Locklear says.
 &HT;    Born in Los Angeles in 1961, she was a quiet, shy girl who
harbored secret ambitions to act. As a UCLA student, she perfected
the California surfer girl look and was cast in a series of
national commercials.
 &HT;    Then, in 1982, she played a police officer on the crime series
``TJ Hooker,'' a show she says she enjoyed working on save for the
tight polyester uniform which she was forced to wear and in which
she sweated away several pounds.
 &HT;    After the show ended in 1987, Locklear signed up for
``Dynasty,'' the long-running series in which she played man-eater
Sammy Jo Carrington.
 &HT;    On one ``very, very strange'' episode, she says, her part called
for her to mud-wrestle a rival, played by actress Emma Samms.
 &HT;    ``We fought in specially sterilized mud, which supposedly could
breathe and had air bubbles in it. That's so we wouldn't drown when
shoving each other's faces in it,'' she sighs.
 &HT;    When Locklear joined the cast of ``Melrose Place'' as a special
guest star in 1993, ratings jumped 50 percent and producer Aaron
Spelling signed her to a long-term contract.
 &HT;    ``I had been working for 20 years, but `Melrose' just catapulted
me to a different level of fame. Young guys would come up to me and
say, `In Heather We Trust' or they would bow down at my feet and
say, `We're not worthy,''' Locklear marvels.
 &HT;    ``Inside I was, like, `Wow, I can't believe this is happening.'
I also kept my head on my shoulders realizing that along with the
ups come the downs,'' she adds.
 &HT;    One of the downs, Locklear says, included a dismal marriage to
rocker Tommy Lee, Motley Crue's tattooed drummer.
 &HT;    When the two divorced, Locklear decided to live the single life
for a while.
 &HT;    Then along came Sambora, who plays guitar for the band Bon Jovi.
 &HT;    ``It's funny: I met Richie four years earlier and I knew he was
the right guy, but I was married. One little glitch,'' Locklear
says, laughing.
 &HT;    After her divorce, a friend set her up with the musician.
 &HT;    ``I clearly remember our first date. He kept trying to get me to
be alone with him. We were in New York and he kept saying, `Come to
my room.' I was like, `I'll meet you in the bar. I'll meet you with
friends.' He said, 'No, why don't you just come up to my room. I'm
not going to do anything.'''
 &HT;    She agreed.
 &HT;    ``He had a huge bunch of roses waiting and he was a total
gentleman,'' Locklear says.
 &HT;    A few months later, she proposed.
 &HT;    ``I think I proposed ... And he proposed with the ring.''
 &HT;    Five years later, the two are enjoying the role of new parents
as well as the everyday chores that are part and parcel of their
lives.
 &HT;    ``Tonight the big event is going to the supermarket for turkey
burgers,'' Locklear says, adding that there will be no mob scene in
the produce aisle.
 &HT;    ``People in my neighborhood see me all the time, and they could
care less,'' she adds.
 &HT;    ``I'm just a mom with no makeup and her hair up in a ponytail.
I'm just like everyone else.''
 &HT;    Another day in La La Land.

FROM `ER' TO KOSOVO: NOAH WYLE'S SUMMER OF '99
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Noah Wyle in
``ER.'' 
 &HT;    By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Most network stars spend the summer months either padding their
resumes with movie roles or retreating to an exotic hideaway.
 &HT;    Not Noah Wyle.
 &HT;    ``I had a really unbelievable summer,'' says ``ER's'' resident
charmer, who spent the first two weeks of his hiatus in war-ravaged
Kosovo.
 &HT;    ``I was invited by an organization called Doctors of the World
to go to southern Serbia, visit refugee camps and observe the work
these doctors were doing.
 &HT;    ``I spent the bulk of my time in a camp called Senicose, which
had about 12,000 people in it, and only six doctors caring for
them. It was unbelievable. I've never seen such acts of heroism in
aid of such acts of senseless brutality.
 &HT;    ``I came back shaken to the core,'' says Wyle, who returned home
to extend some altruism of his own.
 &HT;    Back in 1991, three years before he earned international fame as
``ER's'' dashing Dr. John Carter, he helped establish Los Angeles'
non-profit Blank Theater Company, a showcase for neophyte
playwrights aged 18 or under. The company recently staged its
eighth annual Young Playwright's Festival.
 &HT;    ``We choose ten plays and fly kids out here. We cast their plays
with professional actors, most of whom are recognizable faces from
film and television,'' Wyle says.
 &HT;    ``Then we bring in professional directors,'' he adds, noting
that among this year's visiting directors were Gary Marshall
(``Pretty Woman,'' 1990) and his sister Penny Marshall (``Big,''
1988.)
 &HT;    Wyle seems delighted at the prospect of helping to shape the
next Tennessee Williams or Wendy Wasserstein, and says the festival
has already given about 80 young playwrights their first taste of
professional experience.
 &HT;    ``That's pretty gratifying,'' says Wyle, who was himself
provided a leg up by his stepfather, who became his artistic mentor
and helped shape his creative ambitions.
 &HT;    Wyle was born and raised in Hollywood, and he was just six years
old when his parents were divorced. When his mother re-married,
Wyle became stepson to a film producer and restorer who raised him
on a diet of Hollywood classics. , The two watched James Stewart's
Hitchcock films repeatedly, and Wyle also fell in love with the
films of Spencer Tracy, Errol Flynn and Charlie Chaplin.
 &HT;    ``Those are the people I was taught to look up to,'' Wyle says,
adding that these early lessons would eventually serve him well.
 &HT;    After struggling to gain a foothold in films, taking small but
meaty parts in films such as ``A Few Good Men'' (1992) and ``Swing
Kids'' (1993), he was offered a role that James Stewart himself
would have felt comfortable with.
 &HT;    The part was in a risky and ambitious new series set inside a
Chicago emergency ward, and Wyle took on the role of med student
John Carter.
 &HT;    When ``ER'' hit the airwaves, it had been more than 20 years
since ``Marcus Welby, M.D.'' cracked the Neilsen top 10. Medical
dramas were long gone from prime time, and television doctors
appeared, for the most part, in aspirin commercials.
 &HT;    ``I signed a four-year contract, fully expecting ER to last for
about seven weeks,'' laughs Wyle.
 &HT;    From the outset, it was Carter's naivete that appealed most to
him.
 &HT;    ``(The character) was starting out at such a low level of
proficiency. He was either going to wash out or become an excellent
physician, or maybe a bit of both. I think we've charted those
waters pretty carefully over the last five years.''
 &HT;    Those five years made Wyle a wealthy man.
 &HT;    While he prefers not to discuss his income, one can assume that
contract re-negotiations, which will keep him in the show through a
seventh season, have netted him about the same as co-star Eriq
LaSalle: $27 million.
 &HT;    Wyle, adopting his traditional wet-behind-the-ears mode, says
that it's more important to him that his return to the show will
provide an opportunity for personal growth both for himself and for
his character.
 &HT;    ``When I started on the show I was extremely intimidated by the
actors I was working with, and tried not to call attention to
myself. I think that's exactly how John Carter approached his work.
Like John, I've spent the past five years searching out good role
models, looking for guidance, and asking lots of questions,'' Wyle
says.
 &HT;    ``I never thought I'd reach professor emeritus status, but now,
going into year six, I feel like I'm a member of the old guard,''
he adds.
 &HT;    ``And that's how Carter's feeling now that he's a second-year
resident and is sort of calling the shots around the ER ... I guess
it's true that we've matured at the exact same rate.''
 &HT;    Wyle is also anticipating an exciting year beyond ``ER.''
 &HT;    When he re-signed with the show two years ago, his contract came
hand-in-hand with a Warner Brothers development deal. So the actor
is reviewing film scripts, two of which are being ``groomed for
development,'' and he is considering a television series written by
a friend.
 &HT;    ``We've got our fingers crossed,'' he says.
 &HT;    On the homefront, Wyle's prospects seem equally bright _ he
proposed to his girlfriend on Valentine's Day and purchased a
rambling ranch previously owned by actress Bo Derek (``Bolero,''
1984).
 &HT;    With his financial, professional and personal futures all in
apparent order, Wyle says he has few worries.
 &HT;    He used to fret about a television ailment known as ``Ted
Danson's Syndrome,'' wherein an actor is forever linked to a
particular character on a long-running show, and finds it hard to
make a mark in any subsequent endeavor.
 &HT;    ``But last year I looked around and said: `Why would I want to
parlay this into something else so quickly?' This is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' Wyle says.
 &HT;    ``This type of show comes around once in a career, and I really
want to play my hand out the way it's been dealt to me until it's
done.''
 &HT;    Wyle still struggles, however, with the need to reconcile his
shyness and the urge to embrace the rewards of celebrity.
 &HT;    ``It's a conflict I grapple with on a daily basis: my desire to
have solace and time to recharge my batteries and the fear that I'm
becoming a recluse and cutting myself off from the exact stimuli I
should be involved in. I have a tendency to want to go home and
spend time with my friend and my dogs and read my books.
 &HT;    ``But at the same time, when you're on a show like this, the
invitations pour in to meet such exciting people and become
involved in such exciting projects ...
 &HT;    ``For me, the trick is striking a balance between what your
instincts are telling you to do and what your head thinks you
should do,'' Wyle says.
 &HT;    ``It's hard. It really is.''
 &HT;    As Jimmy Stewart once said, ``It's a wonderful life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   One day long ago, before fire or the wheel, ancient man slipped
on the prehistoric equivalent of a banana peel and fell on his
fanny.
</P>
<P>
   And another ancient man laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Thus did the funny bone evolve, tickled by ridicule, nourished
by hostility and cradled by a measure of relief that it was the
other guy who took the fall.
</P>
<P>
   What's changed since then?
</P>
<P>
   Not much, except that the cable channel Comedy Central has
discovered the secret of eternal yucks: keep an endless supply of
banana peels on hand and be confident that humanity will be ever
eager to watch the next poor schnook take that fateful misstep.
</P>
<P>
   Pratfalls, fraternity pranks, wise guys, goofballs, misfits: the
human condition seen through cracked eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   If it makes you cringe with modesty or self-recognition, Comedy
Central will find a way to examine it.
</P>
<P>
   Behold the animated foul-mouthed urchins of ``South Park'' or
the perverse high school corridors of ``Strangers With Candy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping well beyond the boundaries crossed long ago by
``Saturday Night Live,'' the late-night roster on Comedy Central
ventures deep into the dark side of vaudeville, mining the
absurdity of everything from flatulence to incest.
</P>
<P>
   For these brave men and women on comedy's frontier, only
squeamishness is a dirty word. The network has freshened its
lineup, with new original programming as well as new episodes of
popular standbys like ``The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,''
``Upright Citizens Brigade'' and ``Dr. Katz, Professional
Therapist.''
</P>
<P>
   Two new series, ``The Man Show'' and ``Comedy Central's Vs.,''
capitalize on smirking, winking and nudging.
</P>
<P>
   Few double-entendres go unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comedy Central Pre-sents,'' a showcase for stand-up comedians,
had its series premiere this summer, and a fourth newcomer, ``Frank
Leaves for the Orient,'' about a dissatisfied guy in his 30's who
runs off to Japan to become an English teacher, began airing in
August.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Vs.'' (pronounced versus), the host, Gregg Proops (of ABC's
``Whose Line Is It Anyway?''), is a lascivious Wink Martindale.
</P>
<P>
   In this simple game show two culturally mismatched teams compete
for cash by answering questions in the manner of ``Win Ben Stein's
Money,'' one of the channel's most successful shows.
</P>
<P>
   Categories might include ``I just diet in your arms last night''
or ``Come on Shania, ride my twain.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus you have three-member teams like soccer moms vs. the
dominatrixes. (Or, as Mr. Proops says in one of his naughty asides,
``It's seat belts and Kool Whip versus choke chains and
bullwhips.'')
</P>
<P>
   Also Harvard graduates vs. community college students, bikers
vs. prison guards, and used car salesmen vs. Consumer Reports
writers.
</P>
<P>
   But it is ``The Man Show'' that has become Comedy Central's new
summer centerpiece, featuring Ben Stein's co-host, Jimmy Kimmel.
</P>
<P>
   How to describe it?
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central's own public relations department calls it ``an
unapologetic look at the things men like, do and think.''
</P>
<P>
   And what might these things be?
</P>
<P>
   They are, not necessarily in order of preference, eating,
drinking and watching nubile young women in skimpy outfits jump on
trampolines.
</P>
<P>
   A kind of lodge meeting for men who feel Oprah and feminism have
too much influence in American culture, ``The Man Show,'' a happy
hour with edge, is the invention of Kimmel and Adam Carolla, its
unabashed-chauvinist hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The show has ambush interviews, sketch comedy and a signature
bit featuring a piano-playing singer of bawdy songs named Billy
Foster, known as the Fox, whose remarkably wide gullet allows him
to chug a mug of beer in one gulp.
</P>
<P>
   As Kimmel put it in an interview, ``Basically he drinks beer for
a living.''
</P>
<P>
   This would seem to play to one of Comedy Central's strengths, a
market in which 63 percent of the audience is between 18 and 49,
almost 60 percent of it male.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-year-old network, which has 56 million subscribers,
has just reported its 15th consecutive quarter of full-day ratings
growth. Its prime-time ratings rose 40 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind the curtain at Comedy Central is Larry Divney, a
56-year-old broadcast-advertising executive who was named president
and chief executive in February.
</P>
<P>
   A true son of the 1950s who grew up with the last gasp of
network radio, Divney is ``not much of a sitcom fan, but I love
comedy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most men I've got the remote in my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   As comedy heroes, he cites Ernie Kovacs, George Carlin (``If I
could be anybody, I'd want to be George Carlin'') and David
Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen in part because he is an insider in a network with a
singular mission _ he has worked at Comedy Central since its
creation in 1991 _ Divney says he would be more of a ``business
president'' than the maximum leader at the creative core.
</P>
<P>
   In succeeding Doug Herzog, who left last year to become the head
of programming for the Fox network, Divney says, ``The best tribute
we could give Doug is to take it to another level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be thought of as whoopee cushion humor,''
Divney says, endorsing a preference for the ``more satirical look''
embodied by ``The Daily Show,'' the network's half-hour sendup of
news programs in general and sanctimonious news programs in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Or by the often surreal sketch comedy of the ``Upright Citizens
Brigade,'' whose members have ``no government ties but unlimited
resources'' to create chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm someone who likes to laugh at life,'' he says. ``I don't
find Littleton funny. I don't find vandalism funny and property
damage funny. I find people funny. Humor helps get us through a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Can you go too far?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but we don't mean to be mean-spirited,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line moves. The environment changes.''
</P>
<P>
   That environment may be changing with the barroom humor of ``The
Man Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to do stuff that makes us laugh and appeal to a lot of
guys,'' Kimmel said from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   At 31, he is a full generation younger than Divney, but the two
seem to share sensibilities, a kind of Mad magazine state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel, who grew up in Las Vegas and attended college there and
in Phoenix, left school for radio in Seattle, where he began to
develop characters like Jimmy the Sports Guy, ``me doing sports in
a very aggressive way.''
</P>
<P>
   With the deadpan Ben Stein, Kimmel has honed the smart-aleck
persona that runs like a theme through many of Comedy Central's
top-rated shows.
</P>
<P>
   Yet somehow the banana peel in its many forms is at the heart of
Kimmel's sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest influence on his comedy, he says wistfully, was his
boyhood pal Cleto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd stay up all night sending pizza to people's houses.''

 &HT;    Black AIDS rate 10 times white
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ African-Americans are nearly 10 times more likely than
whites to develop AIDS _ and to die from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   New national statistics released Monday by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention confirm that blacks continue to lead
the AIDS epidemic with alarmingly high rates of new infections,
AIDS cases and deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is especially dire in Georgia. Of the 8,776
Georgians living with AIDS, 5,686, or 65 percent, are black,
according to the CDC. Nationally, African-Americans represent 40
percent of the 271,327 people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC presented its figures at the National HIV Prevention
Conference in Atlanta, which it co-sponsored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a tremendous crisis impacting the African-American
community,'' said Cornelius Baker, executive director of the
National Association of People With AIDS. Baker called the AIDS
epidemic ``one of the worst catastrophes since slavery'' to affect
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Two studies presented at the conference indicate that a major
factor is bisexuality among black men. These studies challenge the
popular perception that many black women acquire HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS, through injecting illegal drugs. Instead,
researchers say, many black women are being infected through
heterosexual sex with black men who also have sex with men.
</P>
<P>
   One study, conducted at gay venues in New York City, found that
20 percent of black men said they had sex with men and women. In
comparison, 12 percent of Hispanics and 4 percent of white men
reported bisexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, involving 1,001 HIV-positive black men in
Michigan, found that 36 percent of those who had sex with men also
had sex with women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heavy stigma against homosexuality in the African-American
community leads to bisexuality,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Of young gay men, blacks have the highest prevalence of HIV,
according to another study.
</P>
<P>
   As many researchers and policy-makers have pointed out, poor
access to health care among blacks also is a problem. Because many
HIV-positive blacks can't get the costly drugs that can control the
virus, they're more likely than whites to develop AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   And many African-Americans still harbor deep distrust of the
U.S. health care system, due to the infamous Tuskegee study, in
which black men with syphilis were left untreated for more than 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legacy of Tuskegee looms large when it comes to HIV and
other sexually transmitted diseases,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, who
heads the CDC's HIV prevention center.
</P>
<P>
   Of the CDC's $600 million-plus HIV prevention budget, $137
million is earmarked for programs specifically aimed at
African-Americans, Gayle said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was 3 a.m. on a Saturday night and Samantha
Gregorio was all dressed up with no place to go.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing glitter eyeshadow and absurdly tall platform shoes, she
huddled in a doorway outside the Sound Factory on West 46th Street,
a relentless downpour making a mockery of her painstakingly crafted
face.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her friends, along with 1,000 or so other young people,
were inside the cavernous club on Manhattan's far West Side, but
the 17-year-old high school senior from Whitestone, N.Y., in the
borough of Queens, had failed the identification check at the door.
``I tried to use my older sister's license and I got snagged,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Crammed beside her in the doorway were a dozen other sad and
soggy clubbers, a gallery of Sound Factory rejects who had broken
one or another of the stringent rules that have come to govern New
York City night life in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   There was a young man tossed out for fighting, a purple ring
quickly enveloping his right eye. Nearby, a girl with Pippi
Longstocking braids was so intoxicated she had thrown up on her
shoes. And next to her were a pair of Brooklyn men who said they
had been ejected for selling Ecstasy, a designer drug that many
consider an essential part of the clubbing experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York isn't the fun town it used to be,'' Ms. Gregorio
said, sounding more like 27 than 17. ``It feels more like Cleveland
than Sin City.''
</P>
<P>
   Long a mecca for anything-goes night life, New York and its
big-box dance clubs have become heavily regulated places where
drugs, underage drinking and unseemly behavior are zealously
discouraged. Chastened by increased police scrutiny, powerful
neighborhood opposition and the government's highly public war
against the night-life magnate Peter Gatien, New York's clubs have
become increasingly intolerant of activity that might draw unwanted
attention from the authorities or the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, when prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to convict
Gatien on charges that he turned two of his clubs into drug
bazaars, the city's largest dance establishments have adopted
security measures to rival those of El Al, the hypervigilant
Israeli airline.
</P>
<P>
   Not that New York's night life scene has become puritanical.
Many of those 16 to 25 who make a habit of club-hopping said they
could always find a way to sneak in their drugs, and on recent
weekends, many club patrons admitted to being high on Ecstasy. When
all else fails, they said, they simply swallow their pills before
entering.
</P>
<P>
   But gone is the era when clubs like Studio 54 and Regine's
practically encouraged their patrons to snort cocaine at the bar.
These days, metal detectors and full body searches have become de
rigueur. Most clubs employ battalions of security guards, some of
whom work undercover and solicit the crowd for illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Many clubs maintain a photo gallery of ejected patrons behind
the velvet rope. And in an attempt to rein in drug use, almost
every establishment has bathroom attendants who peer under stalls
and stop more than one person from entering at a time.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening at the Limelight in the Chelsea
neighborhood, Jacques Stephens, 25, said he was told he couldn't
roll his own cigarettes because it might send the wrong signal to
would-be marijuana smokers. ``Things have gotten so tight that if
someone causes the least bit of trouble, they'll get whisked out
onto the street so fast and quietly no one notices,'' said
Stephens, a party promoter who goes by the name Ju Dred. ``Even if
you're the host, they'll just toss you out and there's nothing you
can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased security, said club patrons, disc jockeys and
promoters, has put a chill in New York's famously free-wheeling
night life. Colin Strange, 31, a producer of techno music who
travels extensively, said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had succeeded
in criminalizing night life to the point that almost every large
American city's offerings were considered superior to those in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get patted down just to enter a club or you can get
thrown out for dancing in the wrong spot, it really destroys the
fun of going out,'' he said. ``Dance clubs and raves are about
freedom and escapism, and it's hard to feel relaxed when you get
manhandled and treated rudely.''
</P>
<P>
   Club owners acknowledged that security and surveillance had
become more rigorous, but they said they were adapting to higher
standards set by the city. ``We likely violate people's civil
rights, but it's a situation that this administration has put us
into,'' said Gatien, whose clubs have been subject to many police
raids, closures and investigations over the last few years. ``Of
course we are concerned about offending people or being too
intrusive, but it's a reality we have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials couldn't be more pleased, saying the harsher
climate is proof their efforts are paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington, who oversees the administration's
club campaign, said complaints of New York's becoming duller than
Kansas were reasons to celebrate. ``If the criticism is that people
can't get drugs and weapons into clubs, then I'll accept it,'' he
said. ``If a parent doesn't have to worry if their kid will come
home from a club alive, then I think we're doing our job.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Robert Messner, a lawyer who runs the Police Department's civil
enforcement unit, which has won nearly 350 court orders to close
``troublemaking'' businesses this year, credits the city's
well-publicized crackdown with taming the unruly side of the club
world. ``The message has gotten out that if you don't want to have
a problem, you're going to have to police yourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the city's nuisance abatement law, three arrests at a club
are enough to shut it permanently. The Tunnel, Limelight and Sound
Factory were all padlocked after the police made drug arrests at or
near the clubs, but all of them later reopened. ``The activity
doesn't have to be facilitated by the club owner,'' Messner said.
``The law doesn't take into account the innocence or guilt of the
management.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the clubs have introduced a remarkable battery of
measures to keep trouble away. At most places, the vetting process
begins on the sidewalk, where security guards look for the dilated
pupils and wobbly gaits of those under the influence. They also
scan the crowd for faces that might match those on their ``most
wanted'' posters.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tunnel, which may be the city's most thoroughly policed
club, bouncers pass out palm cards that warn entering patrons
against illegal drug use. The message is repeated by a pair of
employees in the entry vestibule. And inside the sprawling club at
West 27th Street and 12th Avenue, the same admonishment is posted
on nearly every wall.
</P>
<P>
   Before paying the admission fee, often upwards of $25, patrons
are thoroughly searched: pockets are emptied, bags rummaged through
and cigarette packs pulled apart. Those who want to drink alcohol
have their identification checked again and then must wear a
bracelet all night to prove they are over 21. To prevent sharing it
with a friend, the band shreds upon removal.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Silbering, the city's former special narcotics
prosecutor, who is now a private security consultant, came up with
most of the Tunnel's anti-drug strategy. In addition to the 25
uniformed guards working the club, he said, he employs a handful of
undercover agents whose identities aren't known even to Gatien's
staff.
</P>
<P>
   On the average night, he said, 20 or so patrons are ejected,
mostly for using drugs. ``Are you going to catch everybody?'' he
asked. ``No, but by creating a chilling atmosphere, we can deter
some people from bringing in drugs or using them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the tactics also lead to fewer paying customers. At
the Tunnel one recent Saturday night, the crowd was noticeably
sparse, something many patrons attributed to the security. John
Rullan, 18, of Oceanside, N.Y., said he had been mistreated that
evening after a girl approached him for a light. As he was digging
in his pocket, he said, a guard grabbed his arm and marched him
into a room, where he was subjected to a search that included the
removal of his shoes, socks and trousers. ``They were looking for
pills, but I didn't have any,'' he said. ``They apologized and let
me go, but I'm through with the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of those who spoke to a reporter at a half-dozen
clubs in recent weeks said they had no trouble taking in drugs,
especially Ecstasy, a substance that was invented in the 1970s and
banned by the Federal government in 1985. Many of those who spend
Friday and Saturday nights at places like the Tunnel, Sound
Factory, Twilo and Vinyl said the experience would be humdrum
without Ecstasy, which they said was perfectly suited to the clubs'
elaborately orchestrated light shows and the sternum-thumping house
music.
</P>
<P>
   The drug can be swallowed shortly before entering, and several
people bragged about their modes of concealing the drug. Some women
said they stashed tablets inside tampons or under bras, while
others admitted to hiding them in places a guard would not dare
search.
</P>
<P>
   For those who arrive empty-handed, ``house dealers'' _ those who
sneak in quantities to sell at $25 a pop _ can sometimes be found,
although approaching an undercover security guard by mistake will
bring instant ejection.
</P>
<P>
   Because it has amphetamine-like qualities, Ecstasy often spurs
people to dance for hours on end, and dehydration is a serious risk
to those who do not consume enough water. But the biggest danger
comes with combining Ecstasy and other drugs, something called
``candy flipping.'' In January, an 18-year-old died at the Tunnel
after taking a combination of Ecstasy and ketamine, an animal
anesthetic commonly known as Special K.
</P>
<P>
   At Twilo on a recent Friday night, many patrons bopped around
the club holding colorful fluorescent tubes known as glow sticks, a
psychedelic accouterment often used by those ``rolling'' on
Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Ilana Yitzhaki, 19, a student from New Brunswick, N.J., who once
worked at the Tunnel, estimated that the majority of the crowd was
rolling that evening. ``It really brings people together, and helps
you let your guard down,'' she said. ``Just look around, and see
how everyone is smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatific grins were rampant, but the thick-necked security
guards were noticeably scowling. Wearing tiny earphones and eyeing
the throngs suspiciously, they pointed their flashlight beams into
the faces of anyone who paused on a stairway or blocked the ramp
leading to the restrooms.
</P>

   Mike Bindra, Twilo's general manager, said the tight security
was for the good of the 2,000 or so people who come through the
club on an average weekend night. The price of entry is $25 to $30,
depending on the D.J. ``We're trying to make it difficult to sell
or even do drugs on the premises,'' he said. ``We want people to
come here to dance, not to sprawl out on the floor and be a big
mess. Sure, the security can be an inconvenience, but then again,
so is living in Manhattan.'' &QL;

LIFE AFTER `FOOTLOOSE': KEVIN BACON GOES SUPERNATURAL

 (Includes a color slide of Kevin Bacon in the upcoming film ``Stir

 By IAN SPELLING  
 &HT;    Kevin Bacon is waiting for a sign.
 &HT;    A knock on the ceiling.
 &HT;    A rush of cold air.
 &HT;    A door that blows open, suddenly...
 &HT;    ``I've never had any kind of psychic experience,'' says the
``Footloose'' star. ``I've never seen a ghost, never had anything
paranormal happen to me, but I'm totally open to it. If there are
spirits out there that want to contact me and say, `Hi,' ... I'm
for it... I'll sign autographs.''
 &HT;    Bacon shot to fame in 1984 in the musical ``Footloose'' (1984),
but today he's promoting a scary new supernatural thriller called
``Stir of Echoes.''
 &HT;    The actor hasn't entirely made up his mind about the whole grand
subject of the afterlife, but he says he'll stay tuned.
 &HT;    ``I'm not a firm disbeliever. I just haven't had anything happen
and I need to be convinced,'' he adds.
 &HT;    Tom Witzky, Bacon's character in his new movie, needs
convincing, too. And during the course of the movie, he becomes
entirely convinced.
 &HT;    A working-class hero who lives with his wife Maggie (Kathryn
Erbe) and young son Jake (Zachary David Cope) in a modest Chicago
house, Tom agrees to let his sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana Douglas)
hypnotize him.
 &HT;    Soon after, he experiences horrific visions of an unspeakable
crime, visions that nearly push him over the edge.
 &HT;    Given the success of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' ``The
Haunting'' and ``The Sixth Sense,'' the timing seems perfect for
``Stir of Echoes,'' which is based on Richard Matheson's 1958 novel
of the same name and which will be released September 10.
 &HT;    Bacon puts down down his leather-bound Filofax, doffs his black
sunglasses and lies back on the couch at his publicist's Manhattan
office to talk about ghosts, rock 'n' roll and marriage.
 &HT;    ``What I was drawn to in `Stir of Echoes' was that if you took
out the ghost and the murder mystery aspects, I'd still be
interested in this character, a guy at a crossroads,'' says Bacon,
 &HT;    ``On one side he sees his youth, his rock and roll, his chance
to live out his dream all dissipating, and on the other side he
loves his wife and kid, and feels he's a good father. That was
interesting, right there,'' he adds.
 &HT;    In one particularly disturbing scene, Bacon feverishly digs up
the family's backyard in a manic scene which echoes Jack
Nicholson's lunatic performance in ``The Shining.''
 &HT;    Bacon smiles at the comparison.
 &HT;    ``This may be my downfall, but I always like to err on the side
of being a little too big, of pushing things a little too far,'' he
says. ``I think, often times, film actors were just told to `dial
it down, dial it down.''
 &HT;    ``I'll look at a performance and think, `Wake the f--- up! Do a
little acting. Do something.'
 &HT;    ``I want to see some semblance of a performance if I'm paying my
money to see something. I tend to appreciate actors who go over the
top.''
 &HT;    Bacon rubs his goatee and runs his fingers through his hair.
 &HT;    ``I was very lucky on `Stir of Echoes.' From the very first
meeting (writer-director) Dave Koepp said, `I want to push it. I
want to test the limits.'''
 &HT;    Truth be told, ``Stir of Echoes'' is a typical Bacon film in
that it's another atypical choice in a career of atypical choices.
 &HT;    Now 41 years old, Bacon's resume includes ``Animal House''
(1978), ``Friday the 13th'' (1980), ``Diner'' (1982), ``Footloose''
(1984), ``JFK'' (1991), ``Apollo 13'' (1995) and ``Wild Things''
(1998), as well as a batch of independent films, assorted stage
appearances, a thriving music career and a 1996 stint as a
director.
 &HT;    ``As far as the films go, I've always just gone back and found
these little independents that have something I want to do as an
actor,'' he says.
 &HT;    Later this year Bacon can be seen in the family film ``My Dog
Skip,'' and he is currently filming a big-budget popcorn flick,
``The Hollow Man,'' with Elizabeth Shue and Josh Brolin.
 &HT;    ```Hollow Man' is probably a good film for me to do, but I also
need to do `Digging to China' (1998) and `Telling Lies in America''
(1998) and `My Dog Skip.'''
 &HT;    Beyond mixing studio and independent features, Bacon tackles
villains and saints, action and comedy, drama and thrillers.
 &HT;    Does anything scare him?
 &HT;    ``There's nothing I'd be afraid to do,'' he says. ``Some things
might scare me, actually, but I wouldn't not do something because
it scares me.''
 &HT;    Bacon keeps busy when he is not making films. Off the set, he
has spent the last few years performing and recording with his
older brother Michael in a band called The Bacon Brothers, which
will release a new album and go on tour early next year.
 &HT;    As for his marriage, Bacon and actress Kyra Sedgwick have been
together for nearly a decade and are the parents of two children.
The family divides its time between homes in Manhattan and
Connecticut.
 &HT;    ``The last thing Kyra and I want to do is hold ourselves up as
poster children for a happy, healthy marriage,'' Bacon says. ``Life
for us is as difficult as it is for anybody.
 &HT;    ``We're a two-career family and I don't care what the two
careers are, that makes it a struggle. Kyra and I just lucked out.
We found each other.''
 &HT;    As the conversation reaches an end, Bacon can practically smell
the ``Footloose'' and ``Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon'' questions in
the air.
 &HT;    After all, ``Footloose'' remains Bacon's biggest hit and ``Six
Degrees'' -- a game that posits the theory that everyone in
Hollywood is removed from Bacon by no more than six people -- is
not only a water cooler favorite in Tinseltown but now a board
game.
 &HT;    Bacon, however, is caught a little off-guard by the question _
if he could jettison either ``Footloose'' or ``Six Degrees'' from
his life, which would he drop?
 &HT;    ``I'm grateful I had a `Footloose' in my life,'' he says. ``It
had a tremendous impact on my career, but the movie came out more
than 15 years ago. I have worked since then.
 &HT;    ```Six Degrees' is more of an odd piece of pop culture. I had
nothing to do with it. It just goes along. It doesn't bother me and
I don't work it.''
 &HT;    And the answer to the question?
 &HT;    ``If one of them had to go away?'' he says, smiling. ``I'd let
the game go. The work is work, and I've got to live with what I put
out there.''

HEATHER LOCKLEAR VS. THE TELETUBBY

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Heather
Locklear in ``Spin City.'' 
  By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Heather Locklear is one of the most famous blondes in La La
Land, but she can't compete with Laa-Laa, a Teletubby.
 &HT;    Ava, her 18-month-old daughter, doesn't care if her mother is
watching one of three final episodes of ``Melrose Place.''
 &HT;    She wants to watch her Teletubby tape. And she wants it now.
 &HT;    Locklear's husband, rock star Richie Sambora, defers to both
females.
 &HT;    It's Monday night at their Malibu home, and mother and child are
at odds.
 &HT;    But this ain't no ``Melrose Place'' _ and there's no mud
wrestling here.
 &HT;    ``Honey, mommy wants to watch grown-up TV,'' says Locklear, who
as Amanda Woodward on ``Melrose Place'' could handle any crisis.
 &HT;    She's brought down the mob, survived a helicopter crash, a fatal
disease and a few bad color jobs.
 &HT;    But dealing with a two-year-old _ now there's a challenge.
 &HT;    ``Laa-Laa, Laa-Laa, Laa-Laa,'' cries Ava.
 &HT;    Whereas Amanda Woodward might have spent seven years in
television's alternate universe, slinking around her apartment with
a bottle of wine in one hand and a guy's tie in the other, Locklear
herself lives in a simple world of diapers and dinosaurs.
 &HT;    ``Now the man in my life is Barney,'' she says, referring to the
prehistoric lizard preferred by infants everywhere.
 &HT;    ``I can't believe the mother in me who tells the baby, `We have
to switch this off because you're not learning anything.'''
 &HT;    Locklear has learned that there are second, third and fourth
acts on television.
 &HT;    Barely had she taken a breath after ``Melrose'' ended last May
when she accepted a role opposite Michael J. Fox on the political
comedy series ``Spin City.''
 &HT;    Fox is a longtime fan of Locklear's, and when the show's
producers were casting about for the part of the campaign manager,
his vote went to Locklear. (The two will team up as co-presenters
for the 51st Annual Emmy Awards, on September 12.)
 &HT;    Locklear says that when she was offered the ``Spin City'' part,
she was taken aback.
 &HT;    ``It was a little terrifying because we do the show in front of
a live audience,'' she says, adding that she has not always lived
by the showbiz dictum ``Never let them see you sweat.''
 &HT;    ``I have sweated. There has been a little dry mouth,'' she
admits.
 &HT;    Locklear has been a network staple since 1981, with starring
roles in dramas including ``TJ Hooker,'' ``Dynasty'' and ``Melrose
Place.''
 &HT;    But catch her on a rare night at her LA home and one thing is
clear: she is not a vixen. She just played one on TV.
 &HT;    Sounding like a typical harried mom, she apologizes profusely
for being just three minutes late, and concedes that before she
accepted the role in ``Spin City,'' she felt few qualms about the
end of ``Melrose Place.''
 &HT;    ``I knew in my heart that it was time to move on. We had a good
run. I can't complain.''
 &HT;    Her Amanda character goes down in television history as one of
the baddest of the bad girls. And the skirts she wore on the show
will be remembered for their brevity.
 &HT;    ``You know who really started that trend? The actresses on
`Knots Landing.' They wore suits where you seriously hoped that
there wasn't a strong breeze that day. I guess I don't care who
started it. I got to wear some fabulous outfits,`` Locklear says.
 &HT;    Born in Los Angeles in 1961, she was a quiet, shy girl who
harbored secret ambitions to act. As a UCLA student, she perfected
the California surfer girl look and was cast in a series of
national commercials.
 &HT;    Then, in 1982, she played a police officer on the crime series
``TJ Hooker,'' a show she says she enjoyed working on save for the
tight polyester uniform which she was forced to wear and in which
she sweated away several pounds.
 &HT;    After the show ended in 1987, Locklear signed up for
``Dynasty,'' the long-running series in which she played man-eater
Sammy Jo Carrington.
 &HT;    On one ``very, very strange'' episode, she says, her part called
for her to mud-wrestle a rival, played by actress Emma Samms.
 &HT;    ``We fought in specially sterilized mud, which supposedly could
breathe and had air bubbles in it. That's so we wouldn't drown when
shoving each other's faces in it,'' she sighs.
 &HT;    When Locklear joined the cast of ``Melrose Place'' as a special
guest star in 1993, ratings jumped 50 percent and producer Aaron
Spelling signed her to a long-term contract.
 &HT;    ``I had been working for 20 years, but `Melrose' just catapulted
me to a different level of fame. Young guys would come up to me and
say, `In Heather We Trust' or they would bow down at my feet and
say, `We're not worthy,''' Locklear marvels.
 &HT;    ``Inside I was, like, `Wow, I can't believe this is happening.'
I also kept my head on my shoulders realizing that along with the
ups come the downs,'' she adds.
 &HT;    One of the downs, Locklear says, included a dismal marriage to
rocker Tommy Lee, Motley Crue's tattooed drummer.
 &HT;    When the two divorced, Locklear decided to live the single life
for a while.
 &HT;    Then along came Sambora, who plays guitar for the band Bon Jovi.
 &HT;    ``It's funny: I met Richie four years earlier and I knew he was
the right guy, but I was married. One little glitch,'' Locklear
says, laughing.
 &HT;    After her divorce, a friend set her up with the musician.
 &HT;    ``I clearly remember our first date. He kept trying to get me to
be alone with him. We were in New York and he kept saying, `Come to
my room.' I was like, `I'll meet you in the bar. I'll meet you with
friends.' He said, 'No, why don't you just come up to my room. I'm
not going to do anything.'''
 &HT;    She agreed.
 &HT;    ``He had a huge bunch of roses waiting and he was a total
gentleman,'' Locklear says.
 &HT;    A few months later, she proposed.
 &HT;    ``I think I proposed ... And he proposed with the ring.''
 &HT;    Five years later, the two are enjoying the role of new parents
as well as the everyday chores that are part and parcel of their
lives.
 &HT;    ``Tonight the big event is going to the supermarket for turkey
burgers,'' Locklear says, adding that there will be no mob scene in
the produce aisle.
 &HT;    ``People in my neighborhood see me all the time, and they could
care less,'' she adds.
 &HT;    ``I'm just a mom with no makeup and her hair up in a ponytail.
I'm just like everyone else.''
 &HT;    Another day in La La Land.

FROM `ER' TO KOSOVO: NOAH WYLE'S SUMMER OF '99
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Noah Wyle in
``ER.'' 
 &HT;    By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Most network stars spend the summer months either padding their
resumes with movie roles or retreating to an exotic hideaway.
 &HT;    Not Noah Wyle.
 &HT;    ``I had a really unbelievable summer,'' says ``ER's'' resident
charmer, who spent the first two weeks of his hiatus in war-ravaged
Kosovo.
 &HT;    ``I was invited by an organization called Doctors of the World
to go to southern Serbia, visit refugee camps and observe the work
these doctors were doing.
 &HT;    ``I spent the bulk of my time in a camp called Senicose, which
had about 12,000 people in it, and only six doctors caring for
them. It was unbelievable. I've never seen such acts of heroism in
aid of such acts of senseless brutality.
 &HT;    ``I came back shaken to the core,'' says Wyle, who returned home
to extend some altruism of his own.
 &HT;    Back in 1991, three years before he earned international fame as
``ER's'' dashing Dr. John Carter, he helped establish Los Angeles'
non-profit Blank Theater Company, a showcase for neophyte
playwrights aged 18 or under. The company recently staged its
eighth annual Young Playwright's Festival.
 &HT;    ``We choose ten plays and fly kids out here. We cast their plays
with professional actors, most of whom are recognizable faces from
film and television,'' Wyle says.
 &HT;    ``Then we bring in professional directors,'' he adds, noting
that among this year's visiting directors were Gary Marshall
(``Pretty Woman,'' 1990) and his sister Penny Marshall (``Big,''
1988.)
 &HT;    Wyle seems delighted at the prospect of helping to shape the
next Tennessee Williams or Wendy Wasserstein, and says the festival
has already given about 80 young playwrights their first taste of
professional experience.
 &HT;    ``That's pretty gratifying,'' says Wyle, who was himself
provided a leg up by his stepfather, who became his artistic mentor
and helped shape his creative ambitions.
 &HT;    Wyle was born and raised in Hollywood, and he was just six years
old when his parents were divorced. When his mother re-married,
Wyle became stepson to a film producer and restorer who raised him
on a diet of Hollywood classics. , The two watched James Stewart's
Hitchcock films repeatedly, and Wyle also fell in love with the
films of Spencer Tracy, Errol Flynn and Charlie Chaplin.
 &HT;    ``Those are the people I was taught to look up to,'' Wyle says,
adding that these early lessons would eventually serve him well.
 &HT;    After struggling to gain a foothold in films, taking small but
meaty parts in films such as ``A Few Good Men'' (1992) and ``Swing
Kids'' (1993), he was offered a role that James Stewart himself
would have felt comfortable with.
 &HT;    The part was in a risky and ambitious new series set inside a
Chicago emergency ward, and Wyle took on the role of med student
John Carter.
 &HT;    When ``ER'' hit the airwaves, it had been more than 20 years
since ``Marcus Welby, M.D.'' cracked the Neilsen top 10. Medical
dramas were long gone from prime time, and television doctors
appeared, for the most part, in aspirin commercials.
 &HT;    ``I signed a four-year contract, fully expecting ER to last for
about seven weeks,'' laughs Wyle.
 &HT;    From the outset, it was Carter's naivete that appealed most to
him.
 &HT;    ``(The character) was starting out at such a low level of
proficiency. He was either going to wash out or become an excellent
physician, or maybe a bit of both. I think we've charted those
waters pretty carefully over the last five years.''
 &HT;    Those five years made Wyle a wealthy man.
 &HT;    While he prefers not to discuss his income, one can assume that
contract re-negotiations, which will keep him in the show through a
seventh season, have netted him about the same as co-star Eriq
LaSalle: $27 million.
 &HT;    Wyle, adopting his traditional wet-behind-the-ears mode, says
that it's more important to him that his return to the show will
provide an opportunity for personal growth both for himself and for
his character.
 &HT;    ``When I started on the show I was extremely intimidated by the
actors I was working with, and tried not to call attention to
myself. I think that's exactly how John Carter approached his work.
Like John, I've spent the past five years searching out good role
models, looking for guidance, and asking lots of questions,'' Wyle
says.
 &HT;    ``I never thought I'd reach professor emeritus status, but now,
going into year six, I feel like I'm a member of the old guard,''
he adds.
 &HT;    ``And that's how Carter's feeling now that he's a second-year
resident and is sort of calling the shots around the ER ... I guess
it's true that we've matured at the exact same rate.''
 &HT;    Wyle is also anticipating an exciting year beyond ``ER.''
 &HT;    When he re-signed with the show two years ago, his contract came
hand-in-hand with a Warner Brothers development deal. So the actor
is reviewing film scripts, two of which are being ``groomed for
development,'' and he is considering a television series written by
a friend.
 &HT;    ``We've got our fingers crossed,'' he says.
 &HT;    On the homefront, Wyle's prospects seem equally bright _ he
proposed to his girlfriend on Valentine's Day and purchased a
rambling ranch previously owned by actress Bo Derek (``Bolero,''
1984).
 &HT;    With his financial, professional and personal futures all in
apparent order, Wyle says he has few worries.
 &HT;    He used to fret about a television ailment known as ``Ted
Danson's Syndrome,'' wherein an actor is forever linked to a
particular character on a long-running show, and finds it hard to
make a mark in any subsequent endeavor.
 &HT;    ``But last year I looked around and said: `Why would I want to
parlay this into something else so quickly?' This is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' Wyle says.
 &HT;    ``This type of show comes around once in a career, and I really
want to play my hand out the way it's been dealt to me until it's
done.''
 &HT;    Wyle still struggles, however, with the need to reconcile his
shyness and the urge to embrace the rewards of celebrity.
 &HT;    ``It's a conflict I grapple with on a daily basis: my desire to
have solace and time to recharge my batteries and the fear that I'm
becoming a recluse and cutting myself off from the exact stimuli I
should be involved in. I have a tendency to want to go home and
spend time with my friend and my dogs and read my books.
 &HT;    ``But at the same time, when you're on a show like this, the
invitations pour in to meet such exciting people and become
involved in such exciting projects ...
 &HT;    ``For me, the trick is striking a balance between what your
instincts are telling you to do and what your head thinks you
should do,'' Wyle says.
 &HT;    ``It's hard. It really is.''
 &HT;    As Jimmy Stewart once said, ``It's a wonderful life.''

ACLU, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SUE BUSH OVER PROTEST 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The American Civil Liberties Union and two
environmental groups sued Gov. George W. Bush and the Texas
Department of Public Safety on Monday, alleging that
environmentalists' free-speech rights were violated when they were
arrested earlier this year for demonstrating in front of the
Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution does not stop at the public sidewalk next to
the governor's mansion,'' said Rick Abraham, executive director of
the environmental group Texans United, and one of those arrested.
</P>
<P>
   He said the humiliation of being thrown in jail, strip-searched
and forced to sleep on the floor in a crowded jail ``is not
something people should have to go through just because they want
to exercise their constitutional right to disagree with what a
governor, a politician, a presidential hopeful wants to shove down
our throats.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the sidewalk around the mansion for years has been a site
of public protests, DPS troopers earlier this year arrested the
environmentalists on charges of obstructing a sidewalk after they
refused to move to a designated protest site across the street.
</P>
<P>
   The charges later were dismissed by Travis County Attorney Ken
Oden. Oden, however, said the four environmentalists who were
arrested could have been charged with a lesser city violation _
failure to obey a lawful order. DPS, however, did not refile the
charges against the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU and environmentalists contend that the policy was
implemented once Bush decided to run for president as a means of
silencing critics who contend Bush's environmental record is weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision on how to handle protests at the Governor's
Mansion are made by the Department of Public Safety,'' said Bush
spokesman Ray Sullivan. ``DPS wants to protect the safety of
pedestrians and protesters around the Governor's Mansion. They've
been concerned that, when protesters block the sidewalks or rights
of way, that may encourage people to walk in the street or
otherwise avoid the protest, putting them in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan also said the governor's staff is ``curious whether the
ACLU will include President Clinton in the lawsuit, since the White
House also has a designated protest area (outside the White House)
and more stringent rules than the DPS.''
</P>
<P>
   DPS spokesperson Tela Mange said the agency has not seen a copy
of the lawsuit but it has a policy of not commenting on pending
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged, however, that DPS has no written rules on
protesting on the sidewalk around the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking the court to secure the most basic of
fundamental rights _ that of political expression in a public
forum,'' said David Kahne, an ACLU attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Because the governor's office and DPS have given conflicting
signals on the policy on protesting outside the mansion and because
``the police can make up, enforce and change rules against
expressing opinions,'' the police can arrest individuals on the
basis of the message they are carrying, Kahne added.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks no monetary award; it was filed in Travis
County. The plaintiffs include the ACLU, Texans United and
Downwinders at Risk.

<P>
   One day long ago, before fire or the wheel, ancient man slipped
on the prehistoric equivalent of a banana peel and fell on his
fanny.
</P>
<P>
   And another ancient man laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Thus did the funny bone evolve, tickled by ridicule, nourished
by hostility and cradled by a measure of relief that it was the
other guy who took the fall.
</P>
<P>
   What's changed since then?
</P>
<P>
   Not much, except that the cable channel Comedy Central has
discovered the secret of eternal yucks: keep an endless supply of
banana peels on hand and be confident that humanity will be ever
eager to watch the next poor schnook take that fateful misstep.
</P>
<P>
   Pratfalls, fraternity pranks, wise guys, goofballs, misfits: the
human condition seen through cracked eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   If it makes you cringe with modesty or self-recognition, Comedy
Central will find a way to examine it.
</P>
<P>
   Behold the animated foul-mouthed urchins of ``South Park'' or
the perverse high school corridors of ``Strangers With Candy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping well beyond the boundaries crossed long ago by
``Saturday Night Live,'' the late-night roster on Comedy Central
ventures deep into the dark side of vaudeville, mining the
absurdity of everything from flatulence to incest.
</P>
<P>
   For these brave men and women on comedy's frontier, only
squeamishness is a dirty word. The network has freshened its
lineup, with new original programming as well as new episodes of
popular standbys like ``The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,''
``Upright Citizens Brigade'' and ``Dr. Katz, Professional
Therapist.''
</P>
<P>
   Two new series, ``The Man Show'' and ``Comedy Central's Vs.,''
capitalize on smirking, winking and nudging.
</P>
<P>
   Few double-entendres go unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comedy Central Pre-sents,'' a showcase for stand-up comedians,
had its series premiere this summer, and a fourth newcomer, ``Frank
Leaves for the Orient,'' about a dissatisfied guy in his 30's who
runs off to Japan to become an English teacher, began airing in
August.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Vs.'' (pronounced versus), the host, Gregg Proops (of ABC's
``Whose Line Is It Anyway?''), is a lascivious Wink Martindale.
</P>
<P>
   In this simple game show two culturally mismatched teams compete
for cash by answering questions in the manner of ``Win Ben Stein's
Money,'' one of the channel's most successful shows.
</P>
<P>
   Categories might include ``I just diet in your arms last night''
or ``Come on Shania, ride my twain.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus you have three-member teams like soccer moms vs. the
dominatrixes. (Or, as Mr. Proops says in one of his naughty asides,
``It's seat belts and Kool Whip versus choke chains and
bullwhips.'')
</P>
<P>
   Also Harvard graduates vs. community college students, bikers
vs. prison guards, and used car salesmen vs. Consumer Reports
writers.
</P>
<P>
   But it is ``The Man Show'' that has become Comedy Central's new
summer centerpiece, featuring Ben Stein's co-host, Jimmy Kimmel.
</P>
<P>
   How to describe it?
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central's own public relations department calls it ``an
unapologetic look at the things men like, do and think.''
</P>
<P>
   And what might these things be?
</P>
<P>
   They are, not necessarily in order of preference, eating,
drinking and watching nubile young women in skimpy outfits jump on
trampolines.
</P>
<P>
   A kind of lodge meeting for men who feel Oprah and feminism have
too much influence in American culture, ``The Man Show,'' a happy
hour with edge, is the invention of Kimmel and Adam Carolla, its
unabashed-chauvinist hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The show has ambush interviews, sketch comedy and a signature
bit featuring a piano-playing singer of bawdy songs named Billy
Foster, known as the Fox, whose remarkably wide gullet allows him
to chug a mug of beer in one gulp.
</P>
<P>
   As Kimmel put it in an interview, ``Basically he drinks beer for
a living.''
</P>
<P>
   This would seem to play to one of Comedy Central's strengths, a
market in which 63 percent of the audience is between 18 and 49,
almost 60 percent of it male.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-year-old network, which has 56 million subscribers,
has just reported its 15th consecutive quarter of full-day ratings
growth. Its prime-time ratings rose 40 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind the curtain at Comedy Central is Larry Divney, a
56-year-old broadcast-advertising executive who was named president
and chief executive in February.
</P>
<P>
   A true son of the 1950s who grew up with the last gasp of
network radio, Divney is ``not much of a sitcom fan, but I love
comedy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most men I've got the remote in my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   As comedy heroes, he cites Ernie Kovacs, George Carlin (``If I
could be anybody, I'd want to be George Carlin'') and David
Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen in part because he is an insider in a network with a
singular mission _ he has worked at Comedy Central since its
creation in 1991 _ Divney says he would be more of a ``business
president'' than the maximum leader at the creative core.
</P>
<P>
   In succeeding Doug Herzog, who left last year to become the head
of programming for the Fox network, Divney says, ``The best tribute
we could give Doug is to take it to another level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be thought of as whoopee cushion humor,''
Divney says, endorsing a preference for the ``more satirical look''
embodied by ``The Daily Show,'' the network's half-hour sendup of
news programs in general and sanctimonious news programs in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Or by the often surreal sketch comedy of the ``Upright Citizens
Brigade,'' whose members have ``no government ties but unlimited
resources'' to create chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm someone who likes to laugh at life,'' he says. ``I don't
find Littleton funny. I don't find vandalism funny and property
damage funny. I find people funny. Humor helps get us through a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Can you go too far?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but we don't mean to be mean-spirited,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line moves. The environment changes.''
</P>
<P>
   That environment may be changing with the barroom humor of ``The
Man Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to do stuff that makes us laugh and appeal to a lot of
guys,'' Kimmel said from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   At 31, he is a full generation younger than Divney, but the two
seem to share sensibilities, a kind of Mad magazine state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel, who grew up in Las Vegas and attended college there and
in Phoenix, left school for radio in Seattle, where he began to
develop characters like Jimmy the Sports Guy, ``me doing sports in
a very aggressive way.''
</P>
<P>
   With the deadpan Ben Stein, Kimmel has honed the smart-aleck
persona that runs like a theme through many of Comedy Central's
top-rated shows.
</P>
<P>
   Yet somehow the banana peel in its many forms is at the heart of
Kimmel's sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest influence on his comedy, he says wistfully, was his
boyhood pal Cleto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd stay up all night sending pizza to people's houses.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON - Four out of every five NCAA college athletes have
undergone humiliating or dangerous hazing by their teammates,
according to a study released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some rookies were cursed at, paddled, branded or kidnapped.
Others were pressured to enter drink-til-you-puke contests or
perform other illegal acts, said the report by Alfred University in
western New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only one out of every eight student athletes would
describe what they underwent as ``hazing.'' And 60 percent of the
2,009 athletes who filled out an anonymous questionnaire said that
even if they were hazed, they wouldn't report it to their coach,
school or police.
</P>
<P>
   Hazing is seldom reported, agreed the 1,498 college officials
who also answered anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the coaches and athletic directors and more than 70
percent of the student affairs deans agreed that hazing isn't
reported to them. One major reason: Only 25 percent of students
believe that if their college or university knew of a hazing
incident, it would take strong disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have on the other side, coaches saying, 'We have rules and
they're good rules, but I can't enforce a rule with hearsay,' ``
said Nadine Hoover, the principal investigator for the study.
``Given the combination of the secrecy around the behavior, and the
desensitization and even denial that it's really happening, getting
somebody to report it is very unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   She stressed that hazing should not be confused with positive
``team-building'' initiation rites _ such as making rookies
carrying the balls to the field or court, or ordering them to join
their teammates at skit nights, team roasts or team parties.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers defined hazing as ``any activity expected of
someone joining a group that humiliates, degrades, abuses or
endangers, regardless of the person's willingness to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   A startling 68 percent of male athletes and 63 percent of female
athletes who responded to the national survey reported undergoing
what the researchers described as ``questionable'' activities that
were designed to humiliate or embarrass them. Those included being
yelled, cursed or sworn at, being forced to wear silly clothing, as
well as tattooing, body-piercing, head-shaving or branding.
</P>
<P>
   Just over half of both male and female athletes said that as
newcomers trying to fit in they had participated in drinking
contests or other alcohol-related hazing, which is illegal for
those under age 21 in every state. In fact, 42 percent had started
earlier, consuming alcohol with future teammates while on
recruiting trips to a campus during their high school years.
</P>
<P>
   And 27 percent of the men and 16 percent of the women on NCAA
teams said they had been involved in activities that the
researchers described as ``unacceptable, dangerous and potentially
illegal.'' They extended from being pushed to commit crimes _
making prank phone calls or harassing others, destroying or
stealing property _ to being paddled, whipped, beaten, kicked,
kidnapped or tied up and abandoned. Even if the victim is willing,
such violent hazing is illegal in most of the 41 states with
anti-hazing laws.
</P>
<P>
   Swimmers, divers and soccer or lacrosse players were most likely
to be hazed. At the other extreme, basketball and tennis players,
fencers and track athletes were least likely to be hazed.
</P>
<P>
   Hazing levels for most sports fell between those extremes, and
few big differences were found among schools in Divisions I, II or
III. The researchers said that low response rates prevented
accurate measurement of hazing levels for football, cross-country
and squash.

   ``As a university president, I find the results of our study on
hazing to join athletic teams horrifying,'' said Edward G. Coll of
Alfred University. He arranged for the study after some freshmen at
his school had to be hospitalized after veteran football players
tied them up and forced them to drink. He received technical help
from the NCAA and funding from an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Coll called upon other college presidents to join him in
establishing a ``zero-tolerance policy,'' in order to break the
chain of hazing in which rookies are harassed by older teammates
who were hazed in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   While fraternities and sororities can sometimes use their
private status to frustrate enforcement of collegiate anti-hazing
policies, ``athletic hazing is different,'' Coll said. ``These are
our teams, supported by our money, supervised by our coaches ....
on our playing fields in our gyms and locker rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The study reveals that hazing ``is pervasive and appalling,''
said Ron Stratton, a former track star and Portland State coach who
is vice president for educational services at the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recruit student athletes to come to our member
institutions,'' Stratton said. ``To the degree we put their lives
in danger physically or emotionally, our athletic administrators
will have to take responsibility for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling upon college presidents to deal with the problem,
Stratton added, ``This is an institutional problem, not an NCAA
problem, at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of coaches, athletic directors and student affairs
deans, as well as at least one-third of the students, agreed on the
same set of specific strategies that could diminish hazing.
</P>
<P>
   Offered 11 choices, their top selections were:
</P>
<P>
   - Strong disciplinary and corrective measures for known cases.
</P>
<P>
   - Setting clear standards for hazing-free recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   - Creating alternative bonding and recognition events for teams.
</P>
<P>
   - Involving law enforcement in monitoring, investigating and
prosecuting hazing incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The questionnaire was answered by 20 percent of the 10,000
students and 26.5 percent of the coaches and college officials to
whom it was mailed.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I have an employee who does a good job, but all
of us have to walk on eggs when we deal with her. If something goes
differently from what she wants, she can instantly become very
difficult. How do you deal with someone like this? T.K. &QL; 
A. If you have to walk on eggs when dealing with an employee, it is
often a matter of time before something cracks. And, since you are
dealing more with personality than job skills, this is a
particularly difficult matter to unscramble.
</P>
<P>
   By saying that this employee does a very good job, you are
obviously satisfied with her technical skills and ability to get
her job done. However, if there can be problems every time she
interacts with another person or department, perhaps her overall
performance is not that positive. In a word, her volatility is
likely to interfere with her work as well as the work of those who
must interact with her.
</P>
<P>
   It may be helpful to give her feedback when she displays her
difficult behaviors and let her know about the kinds of problems,
career limitations and consequences that can accompany such
behavior. You can also suggest more productive ways for her to act
and react.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, since she does a good job technically, it may
also be worthwhile to try to build the job around her strengths and
minimize the amount of interaction she needs to have with others.
The idea is to let her do what she does best, and prevent her from
doing what she does worst. &QL; 
Q. Our company claims to be ``family-friendly,'' but everyone works
incredibly long hours, and no one takes advantage of the company's
so-called flexibility. I want to take some time off when my wife
has her baby, but several people have told me that doing so will
hurt my career. What do you suggest? S.M. &QL; 
A. What do you think is going to happen to the performance, and
ultimately the career, of a disgruntled employee who expected to
take some time off to be with his wife and new baby, but instead
spends countless hours at the office?
</P>
<P>
   However, before making a decision based on some observations and
the comments of some co-workers, you should do more data gathering.
It is possible that the family-friendly policies are in force, and
you merely needed to talk to more people. In this regard, if you
have a solid working relationship with your manager or Human
Resources representative, you should ask him or her about the
company's policy and expectations regarding time off for a new
baby.
</P>
<P>
   You may also want to suggest ways that you can take more time
off and still cover various aspects of your job, such as through
telecommuting or more variable hours. If the company is truly
family-friendly, management will work with you on this matter. And,
if the company is not family-friendly, then its claim is a lie. In
that case, you will actually be doing your career and your family a
favor by standing up for what you wanted to do in the first place. &QL; 
Q. I was at a meeting with my manager and some members of senior
management, and whenever I talked, my manager kicked me. I didn't
know if he wanted me to keep talking or be quiet, so I ignored him.
After the meeting, he said I was talking too much, and he was
kicking me to get me to stop. I'm annoyed and don't know what to
tell him. M.P. &QL; 
A. In the parlance of body language, a kick generally means for
people to stop and mules to go. However, a manager is acting like a
mule if he is kicking employees during a meeting. But if an
employee is galloping down the wrong path in a meeting, some
managers feel the only way to rein things in is with a boot.
</P>
<P>
   This means that you should look at your behavior as well as that
of your manager. On the one hand, is it possible that you may have
been a little too verbal? On the other hand, is it possible that
you and your manager were ill-prepared? If a manager has worked
with his or her staff and anticipated the questions, issues and
concerns that may arise in a meeting, the likelihood of an employee
heading in the wrong direction is dramatically decreased.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, you should tell your manager that you do not want to
be kicked or touched in any way. And if he feels you are out of
line in a meeting, tell him that you would prefer he use his words
instead of his feet. &QL;

JUDGE RULES BUSH NEED NOT SUBMIT TO DEPOSITION IN WHISTLEBLOWER
CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lawyers for a fired state regulator cannot force
Gov. George W. Bush to submit to a deposition, despite conflicting
accounts about Bush's role in the official's dismissal, a district
judge ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John Cornyn, who convinced District Judge John
K. Dietz to quash Bush's deposition subpoena, portrayed the ruling
as a victory for common sense. Cornyn said Bush simply doesn't know
much about the events that led up to the termination of Texas
Funeral Service Commission Director Eliza May, and those who know
more haven't been questioned yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no personal knowledge of the facts in this case,''
Cornyn said of Bush. ``This was their opportunity to come forward
and present (contradictory) evidence and they didn't do it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   May, who filed the civil lawsuit against her former employer in
March under the Texas Whistle Blowers Act, claims Bush collaborated
with commission members to illegally oust her in February, but she
didn't include the Republican governor as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   May contends that after several high-level meetings and
communications _ some involving Bush's top staff _ various
officials carried out an unlawful ``conspiracy'' to appease
co-defendant Service Corporation International Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston-based funeral company's top executives are longtime
political supporters of the governor and his father, former
President Bush, and corporate officials have acknowledged they
applied political pressure in response to regulators' tactics. But
they adamantly contend that's their First Amendment right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad we finally got some relief from the ... innuendo
and rumor and speculation,'' Cornyn said, portraying the failed
attempt to force Bush's testimony as a publicity stunt designed to
capitalize on Bush's notoriety as a GOP presidential candidate. In
recent weeks, several national news organizations have joined Texas
media in covering May's charges against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were a search for the truth, Ms. May's lawyers would
have taken depositions from the 50 or so other witnesses _ even the
people she was complaining about in the meetings _ before she tried
to take the governor's deposition,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   May's attorneys didn't rule out an appeal of Dietz's ruling,
which came after five hours of testimony and arguments. But they
said they would soon begin taking depositions of key aides to Bush
to begin developing their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about getting Gov. Bush. This is a whistle blower
lawsuit. It involves a state employee's report of illegal activity,
and as a result of that, she was fired,'' said attorney Derek
Howard.
</P>
<P>
   He said questions persist regarding how much Bush knew about the
1998 regulatory spat between the commission and SCI. Bush submitted
a sworn affidavit saying he knew no ``relevant'' facts about the
dispute or May's dismissal, but May's attorney's labeled it
``false'' and ``inadequate'' because he didn't deny all knowledge
of relevant events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge said we can get the evidence we need from lower
level people, and we intend to do that,'' said May attorney Charles
Herring Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to discredit the plaintiff's underlying accusation _
that SCI improperly influenced the commission and perhaps others to
oust May _ Cornyn turned over newly sworn statements from the
commission members, past and present, who voted to fire her. All
said they were dissatisfied with her job performance and denied
acting in response to political pressure from Bush, his staff, SCI
or others.
</P>
<P>
   But May, a former Democratic Party official, took the stand
briefly to insist she was railroaded out of the job she was given
in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question about it. I felt pressure'' to drop her
investigation of SCI, she said, adding she never heard directly
from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   May said Bush appointees on the commission and Bush's top staff
exerted the pressure, ostensibly to curtail a still-unresolved
investigation which alleged that two SCI-owned funeral homes
employed embalmers who didn't have the correct licenses.

DENNIS SKIRTS COAST OF N.C. ON ITS WAY OUT TO SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Will be updated.) 
 (nk) 
 By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Hurricane Dennis continued north and east
just off the coast of North Carolina on Monday afternoon,
apparently sparing the state the kind of damage it suffered in
three other hurricanes since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the southern coastal part of the state began
re-opening barrier islands that had been evacuated Sunday night.
Northern coastal communities remained hunkered down late Monday
afternoon against the rain and wind from the storm, but seemed to
have avoided a direct hit.
</P>
<P>
   So far, all along the southeastern coast of the United States,
the eye of Hurricane Dennis has come close but not made landfall.
Forecasters predicted it would continue farther east and out to sea
Monday evening, with its eye continuing to avoid the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, predicted the hurricane would ``come to a screeching halt
out there'' Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, heaven only knows what it's going to do,'' Jarrell said.
``But we think it'll probably sit there for one, two or three days,
and then almost anything is possible after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no deaths were directly attributed to the storm as it
blew along the coast here Sunday night and Monday morning, a
head-on collision which killed two people Monday morning in Onslow
County north of Wilmington was blamed on 60 mph winds and heavy
rain associated with the storm. The storm did not appear to have
caused any major structural damage in the southern part of North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clontz, of the New Hanover County Emergency Management
Agency in Wilmington, said, ``We're thinking we're very lucky we
only got a glancing blow, compared to the three storms we've had in
the past few years. The rest of the state seems to be fairing very
well just like we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the whole country made out. It's like Dennis said,
`How close can I get to land and not cause any damage?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm cut electrical power to 60,000 people in the state,
according to the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management.
The disruptions stretched as far inland as the Raleigh area, where
about 10,000 customers were without power at one point. ``As far as
damage in the state,'' said Bill Furney of the North Carolina
Division of Emergency Management, ``we have a few roads out, and
bridges closed.''
</P>
<P>
   A state of emergency and a state of disaster, declared Sunday by
Gov. James B. Hunt, remained in effect Monday. More than 100 state
law enforcement officers and 374 National Guard officers assisted
in evacuation and stood by to help residents after the storm
passed.
</P>
<P>
   On Hatteras Island, where the brunt of the storm began to hit
around noon Monday, two gas pumps were blown over at Danny Couch's
service station. ``They were both embedded in concrete,'' Couch
said about 1 p.m. as the storm raged outside.
</P>
<P>
   Couch, 40, decided to sit out the storm. Even though the island
was under an evacuation order, residents were allowed to stay if
they remained on their own property.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Tucker, 39, from Michigan, also stayed on the island
with 24 family members who were making their annual visit to the
Outer Banks Motel on the beachfront. The motel owner let the family
stay at her house farther from the beach. ``We were here for
Hurricane Emily in 1993,'' said Ms. Tucker, ``but we evacuated for
that. This one didn't seem like it would be as bad. We haven't been
out yet, but I don't think there will be too much damage. We're
still hoping to get a good week out of our vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   The coast of North Carolina has been battered by three
hurricanes in recent years, Fran and Bertha in 1996 and Bonnie last
year.
</P>
<P>
   And as Dennis moved away from the coast Monday afternoon,
officials cautioned that the storm is still a threat to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are so unpredictable,'' said Furney. ``It could
stay off the coast for a day or two and gather strength and come
back in. We hope that doesn't happen. What we need is a good front
to come in from the coast and push Dennis back out to sea.''

 &HT;    Alabama lottery soon may rival Georgia's
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If any gathering was likely to be a hotbed of
sentiment against the proposed Alabama lottery, to be voted on Oct.
12 in a special election, it would have been the Republican
presidential straw poll last weekend in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   It was the lottery issue, after all, that helped Democrat Don
Siegelman oust incumbent Republican Fob James in last year's
governor's race, and Alan Keyes' victory in the straw poll was
proof that religious conservatives were solidly in attendance at
the event.
</P>
<P>
   There was, in fact, a good sprinkling of anti-lottery stickers
among the Republican regalia on display in Birmingham. But a poll
published the next day showed that opposition to the lottery is
weak even among Republicans and regular churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted by the University of South Alabama polling
group for newspapers in Birmingham, Huntsville and Mobile, also
indicated that most voters in the state have already made up their
minds: 61 percent for the lottery, 34 percent opposed and 5 percent
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans narrowly opposed the lottery, 50 percent to 47
percent. It was closer among those who said they attended church at
least once a week: 48 percent opposed the lottery, but 46 favored
it.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case when Georgia voters approved a lottery amendment
in 1992, African-Americans in Alabama showed much greater support _
78 percent _ than whites, who favored it by 57 percent. The
Birmingham mayoral election held on the same day is likely to boost
black turnout. Of 12 announced candidates so far, 10 are
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that barring a sea change of opinion across
the Chattahoochee, there will soon be competition for the Georgia
Lottery, which draws an estimated $85 million to $90 million a year
from Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama measure is a virtual carbon copy of Georgia's in
many respects, with funds to be earmarked for college scholarships,
pre-kindergarten programs and education technology. There are
differences in the two states' educational systems, however.
Alabama has a hybrid system of two-year academic and vocational
colleges, which will make it harder to sort out who qualifies for
scholarships when students from those schools apply to four-year
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Dent, who was press secretary to former Georgia Gov. Zell
Miller and now works for the Alabama Lottery Foundation, predicted
the political impact will be similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans will be on the defensive, and Democrats will get
all the credit. It's not an accident that the current attorney
general (Thurbert Baker) and lieutenant governor (Mark Taylor) in
Georgia were the House and Senate floor leaders who passed the
lottery legislation,'' Dent said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Miller advised Siegelman not to wait, as he did, for a
big-turnout election, but to put the lottery question to the voters
while it still had momentum. Selling the idea to Alabama voters has
been easier partly because of the success of the Georgia program.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Zell campaigned for the Hope Scholarship program, people
thought it was too good to be true. All we had to compare was the
Florida Lottery, and Florida was screwed up,'' Dent said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Lottery officials have expressed confidence that their
marketing prowess will enable Georgia to continue with no
significant impact from the new competition. Soon, it appears, that
confidence will be tested.

THE CANDIDATE AS DIVA AND ICON

<P>
   Columnist  &UR; Michelangelo Signorile  &LR; writes in the latest Advocate
that  &UR; Hillary Rodham Clinton &LR; , first lady and almost-candidate for
the Senate, has become an icon to gays and lesbians _ note to gays
and lesbians who are not movie fans: Signorile is teasing _ because
it's so easy to see her rise in terms of classic movie roles:
</P>
<P>
   - The first lady's physical transformation is reminiscent of
 &UR; Bette Davis  &LR; in ``Now, Voyager,'' turning herself from ``the dowdy
intellectual ... into (a) dazzling and cosmopolitan woman.''
</P>
<P>
   - The sense of drama in her life, writes Signorile, is ``as if
she were &UR; Julia Roberts &LR;  during her thriller period,'' making such
films as ``Filegate,'' ``Whitewater'' and ``It Takes a Village.''
</P>
<P>
   - The Lewinsky scandal is Clinton's ``All About Eve,'' says the
journalist, with  &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR;  as ``the conniving young
upstart.''
</P>
<P>
   - The first lady's taking charge afterward, becoming ``a woman
who wasn't going to take it anymore and who was ready to do
something for herself,'' brings to mind  &UR; Joan Crawford &LR;  in
``Mildred Pierce.''
</P>
<P>
   - Her latest role, writes Signorile, is ``the graceful and pious
 &UR; Audrey Hepburn  &LR; in `The Nun's Story,' '' a woman who describes why
she forgave her husband in Talk magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the role-playing, the first lady ``doesn't have a record
to speak of'' on gay rights issues, writes Signorile, ``nor has she
said a great deal on the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Issues should be more important than image, he realizes, but
maybe the Senate needs ``an industrious Joan Crawford for the new
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine gay men like her sense of style _ though I want to
go to sleep for six years just for having said that,'' says
playwright  &UR; Tony Kushner &LR; . ``I think she is basically a corporate
lawyer with towering ambitions and the morals of _ well, a
corporate lawyer. She's obviously brilliant and powerful. I'm for
her because the alternative is unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S.  &UR; Glenn Close &LR; ,  &UR; Bette Midler &LR; ,  &UR; Al Franken &LR; ,  &UR; Blair Brown &LR; 
and &UR; Elaine May  &LR; are expected to attend  &UR; Marlo Thomas &LR; ' fund-raiser
for Clinton in New York on September 8, says the New York Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - In response to news about the Yale Club's free-and-easy
summertime apparel, Harvard Club member  &UR; David Elliott &LR;  writes that
dress-downs _ ``gentlemen without coats and ties'' _ are permitted
at the Harvard Club on the weekends. During the week, he writes,
``the Club's popularity permits it to maintain high standards in
dress, unlike, it seems, the Yale Club, which appears to be
struggling for clientele.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Bob Geary  &LR; reports that a cricket has taken up residence in a
San Francisco pied a terre, one of the Central Station cells.
</P>
<P>
   - The menswear journal DNR describes the new Venetian
Resort-Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas: ``Throughout the property,
graceful arched bridges, flowing canals, vibrant piazzas and stone
walkways capture the spirit of Venice and its different
architectural periods. ... Later this year, (the hotel's) C2K
Carnevale 2000 will feature ... the first `Bay Watch' restaurant
and bar with seating for 270.''

   &UR; HOMAGE TO LEONARDO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lawrence Ferlinghetti &LR;  is one of 70 artists who have
contributed 10 works each about  &UR; Leonardo da Vinci &LR; , to be

anniversary of the prototype Renaissance man. (Da Vinci was
actually born in 1452 and died in 1519; the date is rough.)
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti told the artists' periodical studioNOTES that he
was browsing in City Lights Italia, a bookstore in Florence
unrelated in anything but name to City Lights in San Francisco,
when an art collector approached him and asked him to participate
in the da Vinci project.

ONE END OF THE RAINBOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 5) 
(jt) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may have been the homemade pupu platter, with coconut shrimp
_ fried crisp and fresh _ and barbecued spareribs oozing sticky,
magenta--colored sauce. It may have been the nightly mai tai's or
the morning French toast with coconut syrup and fresh mangoes, or
the fragrant plumeria blossoms just outside the door. But somewhere
around the fourth day of a weeklong sojourn in a rented beach house
on Hanalei Bay in Kauai, I understood what those legions of
disapproving colonial missionaries meant when they warned against
going native.
</P>
<P>
   The enduring appeal of Hawaii for visitors from the 49 other
states lies in just this effortless ability to make the mystical
seem routine, and vice versa. The exoticism of the island state is
palpable and omnipresent, in its flowers and fruit, its
pan-Polynesian diet, its soft moonlight and sudden double rainbows
after a storm. That can be true even on those stretches of Waikiki
pavement that are as commercialized and crowded as the Chicago
Loop.
</P>
<P>
   But for a taste of old Hawaii, the romantic retreat of song and
story, it would be hard to beat Kauai, the 551-square-mile outpost
of flooded taro fields, lush mountains, thick jungles, craggy
cliffs and pristine beaches that Hawaiians themselves call the
garden isle. My wife, Dee Dee, and I discovered some of its many
pleasures in May when our friends Ruth and Sean and their
3-year-old son, Quincy, invited us to join them in a 72-year-old
green-shingled cottage overlooking the bay where ``South Pacific''
was filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthie was raised in an old San Francisco family, and began
coming to Hawaii when the transport of choice was still the elegant
Matson Liner, the Lurline, and the trip took five days by sea. Our
guide in all things, she chose Hanalei, a sleepy little
hippie-surfer town on the island's misty, rainy north shore, for
our vacation, and after an Internet search came up with just the
place right on the beach: Hale Ola (House of Health), built in 1927
to lure a doctor to the island. At $3,000 for the week, the
two-story, four-bedroom house with wraparound balconies was a great
space. And since other friends, Madeline and Steve, joined the
party, it proved a great value, too, about $140 a couple a night.
</P>
<P>
   The house was well equipped and charmingly furnished, with
memorabilia of the original owners, plus framed photographs, 78-rpm
records, vintage Hawaiian sheet music and comfy tropical wicker
furniture covered in vintage tropical prints. Local lore holds that
it was strafed by Japanese Zeros flying back home from the raid on
Pearl Harbor. It was filled with the sort of casual bric-a-brac and
personal touches that made us feel like guests, not tenants. The
kitchen lacked nothing, and the wide porches made a perfect perch
for breakfast or a lazy afternoon read. There were neighbors close
by, but high hedges provided privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Kauai is a short jet hop from Honolulu. The island is just west
of Oahu and the westernmost main island in the chain except for
Niihau, the tiny, privately owned ``forbidden island'' that is the
sole province of the Robinson ranching family and some 200 workers
who live there in a kind of feudal kingdom. Before we knew it, we
were bustling through the pleasant open-air concourse of the
airport at Lihue and heading off on the 45-minute ride to Hanalei
in the silver Mustang convertible we'd rented on a lark.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthie had instructed us in no uncertain terms to stop at Ono
Charburger, a famous roadside stand near the beach town of Anahola
that serves local Kauai beef on big buns with sliced pineapple,
swiss cheese and teriyaki sauce, but we were so intent on not
missing the spot that we stopped by mistake at the first restaurant
we saw with ono (which simply means good) in the name: The Ono
Family Restaurant in Kapaa, also known as Auntie Ono's Kitchen. It
may not have been the assigned destination, but the burger was
top-notch, as was the fluffy fresh coconut cream pie. Thus
fortified, we pressed on around the coast road to Hanalei, which
means ``lei-shaped bay,'' and arrived in late afternoon in a kind
of eerie mist. That did not stop us from taking a swim in the balmy
water, or riding the good-sized waves on our stomachs on the boogie
boards found at the house.
</P>
<P>
   We also made an outing to the well-stocked, fairly expensive
grocery in the nearby modern resort town of Princeville, five miles
back up the hill. There is no real hotel in Hanalei proper, only
bed-and-breakfasts and rental houses, but the Princeville Hotel
sits like a white scar on the bluff where Mitzi Gaynor and Rossano
Brazzi once sang ``Some Enchanted Evening'' and is more than enough
hostel for the whole area. Princeville has a world-class golf
course and a collection of sterile-looking condominiums and is the
sort of place you'll like if you like that sort of thing. We were
happy to be within easy reach of its commercial establishments and
yet in our own quaint world.
</P>
<P>
   That night, we established what became a pattern of home-cooked
meals, often inspired by the folksy advice of the spiral-bound
``Maui Association for Family and Community Education 50th
Anniversary Recipe Book,'' which Ruthie bought in a local store,
and which featured a concoction that we never managed to make
called ``Sex in Pan,'' consisting of walnuts, cream cheese, Cool
Whip and vanilla and chocolate pudding.
</P>
<P>
   The week's achievements did include Ruthie's leg of lamb grilled
in peanut sauce; Madeline's pot stickers stuffed with ground pork
and shredded cabbage; pies made with coconut, mango and banana; and
a fresh pork butt marinated in liquid smoke, soy sauce and the
sodium-laden mix of sea salt and spices known as Hawaiian salt,
then slowly oven roasted in ti leaves.
</P>
<P>
   From that first night on with CD's of Hawaiian music playing in
the soft night air, we felt truly at home in our big second-floor
bedroom with its screen door and ocean-view veranda and shared bath
down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Overcast skies are not uncommon on the north shore of Kauai, an
almost perfectly round island with the 5,148-foot Mount Waialeale,
which may be the wettest spot on earth, with average annual
rainfall of about 40 feet, rising smack in the middle. But cloudy
weather made it easy to just hang around the house and read
guidebooks and Somerset Maugham short stories. We also explored the
quiet village of Hanalei, really nothing more than a short strip of
modest restaurants, sporting goods stores and a boutique or two,
and brought home some fresh opah (or moonfish) steaks from the
Hanalei Dolphin fish market, which we grilled with soy sauce, fresh
ginger and butter. When the clouds lifted and we stood in the ocean
facing the shore, green hills and waterfalls worthy of Gauguin
suddenly revealed themselves.

 UNDATED: revealed themselves.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dee Dee and I took off in search of clearer skies on the south
shore one day, stopping to rent snorkels, masks and fins on the
way, and visiting the historic Kilauea Lighthouse and its
surrounding bird sanctuary on a wind-swept point at the island's
northeast corner. We managed to stop at Ono Charburger, and its
giant Local Girl specialty was as promised. By the time we reached
Poipu and Koloa, the south shore towns where most of the island's
major resorts are, it was finally sunny and we fell fast asleep in
a double hammock on the charming grounds of the Hyatt Regency
Resort and Spa, where interlocking saltwater lagoons make up for a
roiling beach whose surf is often too dangerous for swimming. This
area was hit hard by Hurricane Iniki in 1992 but has now been
largely rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   When we awoke, there was just enough time for a quick snorkel at
Poipu Beach Park, a wonderful public beach with showers and
changing rooms. We stopped by the giant, lushly landscaped Marriott
in nearby Lihue for a drink before meeting Ruthie, Sean and Quincy
at Hamura's Saimin, a no-frills Japanese noodle parlor where
steaming bowls of the trademark soup arrived bearing slivers of
Hawaii's beloved staple meat product: Spam. The pinkish strips of
ham-like protein take some getting used to, but the broth was
unbeatable, as was the foamy piece of fresh passion-fruit chiffon
pie.
</P>
<P>
   One gloriously sunny day, we headed down the tiny two-lane road
that leads west from Hanalei, narrowing occasionally to one-lane
bridges, to one of the island's best snorkeling beaches, known as
Tunnels. Its underwater lava formations make a perfect habitat for
thousands of brilliantly colored fish. This beach, which like all
north shore beaches can have dangerously high surf in winter, has
the pronounced advantage of offering a gorgeous view of Makana
mountain, a cone-shaped coastal outcropping more commonly known as
Bali H'ai peak, which is what it was used for in the film version
of ``South Pacific.'' We happily paddled through bathwater-warm
shallows, surrounded by Day-Glo colored fish.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday we visited the weekly evening luau at Tahiti Nui, a
local dive with the simple, unaffected charm of an Elks Club but an
authentic floor show featuring an appealing cast and dances, songs
and stories from around the Pacific, including the requisite hula
skirts and coconut-shell brassieres. We skipped the food, which was
steam-table ordinary, because Madeline and Steve were arriving from
Los Angeles and we wanted to impress them with our homemade pupu
platter of Polynesian appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the whole gang of us rented kayaks from Kayak
Kauai in town and made the gentle paddle inland up the winding
Hanalei River, past fields and forests for an hour or so until
rocks made the stream impassable; we turned back for a shave-ice,
the Hawaiian version of the sno-cone, flavored with tropical
syrups, from a trusty roadside stand.
</P>
<P>
   All week, as our idyll unfolded, I had been dreading precisely
one thing: Dee Dee and Ruthie's fearless plan to hike the beautiful
but treacherous Kalalau Trail, which slithers along the wild Na
Pali Coast, one of the most spectacular stretches of scenery in all
the world and the place where parts of ``Jurassic Park'' were
filmed.
</P>
<P>
   The trail begins at Kee Beach, where the Kuhio Highway, Route
56, ends at the island's northwest edge. Parts of the path are only
a foot or so wide, with 1,000-foot sheer drops to the rocky
coastline below. Where it does descend to beautiful and isolated
beaches, the surf is often so dangerous, the guidebooks warn, that
unsuspecting hikers have been known to stand in apparently benign
calf-high waves only to be knocked over by a sudden roller, dragged
out to sea and drowned.
</P>
<P>
   This intelligence left me not so quietly quaking _ loudly
whining, in fact _ all week, and I was relieved when lack of time
left us hiking just the first dramatic four-mile round-trip leg, to
Hanakapiai Beach and back. It is a steep and moderately challenging
series of switchbacks, and though we began at 7:30 a.m. in a cool
forest, the rising sun made the return trip along exposed swatches
blisteringly hot.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sweeping views down to the banded blues of the ocean,
studded with a school of leaping dolphins, and ahead to the
undulating outcroppings of rock and foliage, were among the most
uplifting I've ever seen, and I was glad to have made the trek. I
was equally glad not to have had to face finding the courage to go
farther. We washed off the heat and grime with more snorkeling.
</P>
<P>
   One of our last purchases at the Princeville grocery was a
vintage Don Ho CD, and back in California in these summer sunsets I
sometimes put it on just to play the old Hawaiian standard that
begins, ``When you see Hanalei by moonlight, you'll be in heaven by
the sea.''

HUGE TURNOUT FOR EAST TIMOR VOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ Hundreds of thousands of people defied months
of violence and intimidation Monday to cast ballots in an historic
vote widely expected to bring independence to the disputed island
territory of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   After centuries of Portuguese colonial control and 24 years of
Indonesian rule, the determination to decide their own future was
so strong that some East Timorese slept at polling stations and
others lined up before dawn to insure they would not be denied a
chance to vote. One man was shuttled to a polling station in Dili
by ambulance, an intravenous drip attached to his arm. Several
frail elderly voters hobbled to the front of long waiting lines,
smiling triumphantly as they emerged.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of 430,000 registered voters turned up to
choose between autonomy under Indonesian sovereignty or full
independence _ a remarkable showing considering the upsurge in
violence between pro- and anti-independence factions that had
claimed at least a dozen lives in the last several days.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy turnout was widely interpreted to presage a decisive
vote for independence, but the results will not be announced until
next week. The outcome must also be approved by Indonesia's
national assembly, which convenes this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Jamsheed Marker, UN special envoy to East Timor, said Monday
night that ``it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to
reverse whatever the result.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, voting in the UN-sponsored referendum was
peaceful and orderly, with an air of solemnity at many polling
stations, a sense of festivity at others, and a cloud of fear
pervading only a few.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was marred, however, by attacks on three local United
Nations workers, one of whom died from stab wounds Monday night.
Pro-Indonesia militias have accused the UN of favoring
independence.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of intimidation, road blocks and threats by
pro-Indonesia militias that temporarily shut down seven of the 800
polling stations. There were no recorded attacks on voters,
however, and the balloting went off far more peacefully than most
observers had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The UN mission ``and Indonesian police did a very good job of
keeping the balloting process today free from intimidation and
violence,'' said Charles Costello, head of an observer mission from
the Carter Center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a scrap of shade cast by a single tree outside his
polling station, Antonio DeJesus Nunes, 45, said quietly, ``Today
is very, very important for me and all of East Timor. Today is what
I've been waiting for for 24 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia always told us what to do.'' said Nunes, a former
member of the pro-independence guerrilla group Falintil who was
waiting for the lines to thin. ``If independence wins, East Timor
has a new home. Good or bad, at least we will control our own
home.''
</P>
<P>
   But Saskia Kouwenberg of the International Federation for East
Timor Observers Project, warned ``there is no reason to sit back
and think this is all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Many have predicted a fresh civil war, regardless of the vote
result.
</P>
<P>
   doomsday scenarios were far from the mind of Inacia DeJesus, 35,
who couldn't contain a shy grin when asked how she felt about
voting. Shading herself from the blazing sun with a rainbow-colored
umbrella, DeJesus declared, ``I'm happy. This election will
determine the future of East Timor and my future, too. I have
always known how I would vote if I had the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked which side she favored, DeJesus glanced at the crowd
around her and demurred, ``It's a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Many voters waited patiently in the almost 90-degree heat for
hours, shielding their faces with copies of an election-day edition
of Suara Timor Timur (``The Voice of East Timor''), the territory's
daily newspaper, which had a copy of the ballot printed on the
back. The ballots were printed in English, Portuguese, Indonesian,
and Tetun, the local dialect. For illiterate voters, a picture of
the Indonesian flag accompanied the choice for autonomy, and the
pro-indepedence flag marked the vote for separation.
</P>
<P>
   Though there were countless red-and-white Indonesian flags
flying, it was hard to find anyone in the capital who would admit
to voting for autonomy. In several neighborhoods, posters of the
revered jailed guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao, who Indonesia has
promised to release shortly, plastered the walls. Grafitti declared
``We are masters _ Anti-autonomy!''
</P>
<P>
   In the western corner of the territory, a stronghold of
pro-Indonesia sentiment and paramilitary groups, many anxious
voters hesitated to talk to reporters, and some said they had been
told to vote for autonomy or be killed.
</P>
<P>
   One problem the UN was unable to solve was how to let people
vote who had fled their homes because of threats _ and thereby
abandoned their assigned polling stations. Tens of thousands of
people have been displaced by violence in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent fraud, everyone had to vote at an assigned post,
explained Tony Lapsley, a district electoral officer who had to
announce the bad news to scores of displaced villagers sheltering
outside his polling place.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Indonesian, Lapsley told the group how sorry he was
that they ``wouldn't be able to take part in this very historic
day,'' but that didn't make the disappointment any easier to take.
No one argued, but a few looked as if they might cry, and several
men stalked off, cursing.
</P>
<P>
   One man sputtered in frustration that he had been threatened in
Liquica, where more than two dozen people seeking shelter in a
Catholic church were massacred by pro-autonomy militias four months
ago. He fled with only the clothes on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hid in the jungle and only two days ago we came here and
asked to be able to vote, and now we can't. It's not fair!'' he
cried out. ``Now Timorese must get independence _ 100 percent!''

`POLITICAL PIETY' INCREASES IN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Wis., Ind.)  (mk) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Presidential candidates have always made a point of having
themselves photographed as they step out of church on Sunday,
carrying a Bible perhaps, and shaking the minister's hand.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early campaign for the 2000 elections, the rite of
political piety has moved far beyond the sacramental photo
opportunity. The candidates are engaging in ``God talk'' that is
more explicit, more intimate and more pervasive than at any time in
recent decades, historians and political analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   In a Houston church, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas describes his
decision to ``recommit my life to Jesus Christ.'' At a convention
of black Baptists, Vice President Al Gore declares himself ``a
child of the Kingdom and a person of strong faith.'' And at a
prayer breakfast in Philadelphia, Elizabeth Dole recounts a talk
she had with God. This is now common language on the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this presidential contest there is much more discussion of
personal faith than there has been in the past,'' said John Green,
who studies how politics intersect religion as director of the Ray
Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron, in
Ohio. ``I suppose if you went far back enough in American history
you'd probably find a year like this one. But if you just think of
the last 20 years, more candidates are talking more openly about
their personal faith now.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is not confined to politics. This is an era in
which public figures of all kinds are ``coming out'' about their
private spirituality. Madonna gives interviews about studying
Kabbala, or Jewish mysticism. The singer Lauryn Hill brings a Bible
on stage to accept a Grammy award and reads a Psalm aloud. The
actors Richard Gere and Harrison Ford meditate at a Tibetan
Buddhist ritual led by the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Politics, however, has its own rhythms, and there are particular
reasons why the candidates are now waving the flag of faith. The
most urgent reason, political analysts agree, is that in a nation
weary of White House scandal, the candidates must find ways to
signal that they can be trusted behind the Oval Office doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's driven by the post-Monica hangover, almost like a drunk
reaching for the black coffee,'' said a Bush adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Reeves, a historian at the University of
Wisconsin-Parkside, in Kenosha, and the author of ``A Question of
Character: A Life of John F. Kennedy'' (The Free Press, 1991), said
that the candidates ``are trying to distance themselves from the
squalor of the Clintons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The language itself isn't new at all,'' Reeves said. ``James
Garfield and Rutherford B. Hayes made the point that they were
church members and spoke very staunchly about their faith, their
church affiliations and the union of God and country. They did it
because the politics of the Gilded Age were so squalid and so
corrupt. Candidates, then and now, are trying to say that they
stand above the mess that people perceive.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush, a Republican, and Gore, a Democrat, are promoting
charities run by churches and religious organizations as an
antidote to government welfare. But this is not the first time that
presidential candidates have linked piety and public policy, Reeves
said. Abolition of slavery, prohibition and even Theodore
Roosevelt's environmentalism were all proclaimed as ``godly''
policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But right now, the presidential contenders are responding to
polls showing that Americans are focused on immorality as the basis
of many social ills. Asked whether they were more concerned about
the nation's moral problems or economic problems, 58 percent of
Americans said moral problems, while 38 percent said economic
problems, according to a poll of 1,022 adults in a CNN/Gallup
survey conducted in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has something to do with the presidential scandals, and
the school shootings like the one in Littleton,'' Green said.
``There is a sense of disquiet in the land, and I think these
candidates have picked this up in their polling, in talking to
people. And when people are faced with existential issues, they
tend to turn back to religion, and that's not just conservatives,
it's everybody. Religion is a source of moral grounding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidates especially know they must find ways to
appeal to the crucial evangelical voting bloc. For candidates like
Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes, Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes, this is no
challenge; they stand with religious conservatives firmly against
abortion and homosexuality and for organized school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But for a candidate like Bush, who is playing to the center on
those issues, his frequent religious testimony is ``almost like a
surrogate for the more hard-edged moral agenda of the party,'' said
the Bush adviser, who put the candidate's position this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``What he is doing is like saying to the social conservative
wing, `I can't say everything you want me to say, or propose
everything you want me to propose, but I want you to know that in
my heart or in my soul, I'm where you are personally. And what I
can accomplish, I will accomplish, and you can trust that.' In the
end, I think that formula will work, that he will be able to get
his fair market share of religious activists in the primaries.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cromartie, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public
Policy Center in Washington, said, ``A little bit of religiosity
can cover a multitude of sins, and it can cover a multitude of
political sins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see it with Elizabeth Dole,'' Cromartie said. ``A lot
of religious conservative folk are really unimpressed with her
ability to waffle on just about everything, but when they hear her
talking religious language, they think, `She may not be clear on
abortion, and on a multitude of other issues I care about, but she
loves Jesus.'''
</P>
<P>
   But not all the ``God talk'' can be chalked up to mere
posturing. Many of this crop of candidates are churchgoers who say
they read the Bible regularly and look to God and Scriptures for
guidance. Mrs. Dole, long before she or her husband were
presidential candidates, gave speeches ``witnessing'' her turn
toward God. After his Army service in Vietnam, Gore attended
divinity school briefly. And Bush says his faith in God is what
helped him give up alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore summoned religion writers to the White House in May
for an interview, he was asked whether he was trying to reclaim
religion from the conservatives. ``No,'' he said, ``I'm just trying
to be who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   But one unspoken rule is that the only candidates who benefit by
emphasizing their religious bona fides are Protestants. Former
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, of Greek Orthodox heritage
and married to a Jew, avoided religious talk. President Kennedy,
the first and only Roman Catholic president, had to deflect slurs
about handing over the country to Vatican control. Buchanan and
Keyes, both Roman Catholics, use religious language that is
indistinct from that of evangelical Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   The evangelical talk of being ``born again,'' greeted as exotic
back in 1976 when used by Jimmy Carter, is now commonplace.
Clinton, a Southern Baptist, has displayed an ease with evangelical
language and Biblical reference that he put to use in his campaigns
and as president.
</P>
<P>
   It is paradoxical, says Nathan Hatch, professor of history and
provost at the University of Notre Dame, that religious talk is so
commonplace as the nation becomes increasingly diverse religiously
and ethnically. ``It's a far more diverse culture, so there's far
less one can assume'' about morality and religion, Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, said Reeves, the historian, invoking ``American
civil religion, one nation under God, is almost a prerequisite''
for a presidential candidate today. ``The public eats it up,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be wonderful if you saw a candidate come along now
who said, `I'm an atheist,' just for a change of pace?'' Reeves
said.
</P>
<P>
   And what chance would that candidate have of winning? ``None,''
Reeves said.

USS NEW JERSEY PREPARES FOR FINAL VOYAGE INTO HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The city of Bremerton's half-century history as a
homeport for battleships will come to an end in two weeks when the
retired USS New Jersey heads out to sea on its last mission.
</P>
<P>
   The battleship, which amassed 16 battle stars in combat in World
War II, Korea and Vietnam, and served from Central America to
Lebanon in the 1980s, will become a naval-maritime museum in its
namesake state.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was stricken from the naval register Jan. 4, ending a
56-year career that included four periods of active service and 21
years in mothballs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard near Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Victory, a seagoing tug operated by Crowley Marine
Services of Seattle, will tow the 58,000-ton warship nearly 6,000
miles from Bremerton via the Panama Canal to a temporary pier at
the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, said Todd Busch, a
contracts manager for the towing firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the longest tow we've ever done, but it is a
lengthy tow, no question about that,'' Busch said. The trip is
expected to take about seven weeks with an estimated arrival date
on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Navy veterans who served on the New Jersey during World War II
and later conflicts have scheduled a reunion in the Seattle area
the weekend of Sept. 9-12, said battleship vet Ralph Wasmer.
``We'll go down there on the 12th to bid her farewell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Victory was scheduled to arrive in Seattle early Tuesday
to begin preparing for the New Jersey tow, following an even longer
mission, Busch said. The 149-foot-long tug and its crew of eight is
returning after towing the decommissioned aircraft carrier USS
Oriskany more than 15,000 miles from San Francisco Bay to Beaumont,
Texas, requiring a circumnavigation of South America and transit of
the Straits of Magellan, Busch said.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan worked out between the Navy and New Jersey state
officials, the battleship will be temporarily stored in
Philadelphia while the state finishes a competition process to
select the organization and permanent moorage site on the Delaware
River.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of New Jersey wanted to move the battleship closer
to the state,'' Pat Dolan, a Navy spokeswoman, and the Navy agreed
to temporarily transfer the ship to the state.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey tow will come just 16 months after its sister
ship, the USS Missouri, left Bremerton for the final time to become
a memorial at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Like its more famed sister
ship, the New Jersey fell victim to gains in naval weapons
technology and shrinking Pentagon budgets that made it financially
prohibitive for the Navy to continue operating them.
</P>
<P>
   Each battleship required a 1,500-man crew which boosted annual
operating costs to more than $80 million per ship, including $45
million in payrolls, despite the fact that newer Aegis missile
cruisers packed more firepower with a crew one-fourth the size. It
cost the Navy $20 million to mothball each of the battleships and
required more than $100,000 per year in upkeep for each ship,
officials said. The Navy also estimated it would cost at least $95
million to reactivate one of the ships.

SURVEY SHOWS INTENSE HAZING AMONG COLLEGE ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new survey has found that 80 percent of all
college athletes go through hazing as part of a team initiation
process, with as many as one in five being forced to engage in
potentially criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
   The survey released Monday shows that athlete hazing involves
excessive heckling to beating and kidnapping new team members,
debunking the notion that hazing on college campuses occurs
primarily within fraternities and sororities.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the hazings involved alcohol and about 20 percent of the
students admitted committing an illegal act such as forcing
teammates to destroy or steal property or engage in lewd sexual
acts, according to the survey of 2,027 college athletes from 224
NCAA schools.
</P>
<P>
   The survey included athletes from the University of
Massachusetts at Boston, the University of Massachusetts at
Dartmouth, Brandeis University, Bowdoin College, Tufts University,
Middlebury College, Brown University, and the University of New
Hampshire. Not represented, however, were two of New England's
sports powerhouses, the University of Connecticut and Boston
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let these survey results serve as a wake-up call to this
nation and its colleges and universities,'' said Edward G. Coll,
president of Alfred University in New York, the school that
conducted the study in conjunction with the NCAA earlier this year.
``Our results show evidence that hazing to join an athletic team is
a huge problem on our campuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazing, an activity that degrades or abuses a new member of a
group, is illegal in 41 states, including Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Most colleges and universities make their athletes pledge in
writing that they will not engage in hazing and will report it if
such activities occur, but the survey found that most athletes are
reluctant to report hazing, even if it happens to them.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of the students questioned said they would not
report hazing, and only 12 percent of the respondents admitted to
being hazed, even though an overwhelming majority, 80 percent, said
they had engaged in activities that could be considered hazing
under most state laws.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mullen, the athletic director at University of
Massachusetts at Dartmouth, said even though UMass has a strict
policy against hazing, the school has difficulties enforcing it
because students do not report violations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the school investigated two hazing cases and both
turned up inconclusive because students who may have witnessed the
activities did not come forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to make it anonymous for them, but still there's
this notion that hazing is acceptable, that it builds brotherhood
or camaraderie,'' Mullen said. ``Some coaches turn their heads and
say it's OK, even though we threaten them with their jobs if they
tolerate such behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Stratten, the vice president of educational services for
the National Collegiate Athletics Association, said, ``It's really
appalling what's going on. Schools really need to open their eyes
on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   While hazing is already forbidden under NCAA guidelines,
Stratten said it is up to individual schools to seek out and punish
those who violate the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this is a national issue, enforcement needs to
take place on a local level,'' Stratten said. ``We can't keep an
eye out on the hundreds of thousands of athletes out there, so the
schools need to do their part.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to the survey, only 25 percent of athletes
reported that their schools took disciplinary measures against
students involved in hazing. Other students reported their coaches
and athletic directors ``turning a blind eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that both men and women engaged in some form of
hazing, but women were less likely to be involved in violent
activities, according to the survey. While 27 percent of male
athletes said they had subjected teammates to violence such as
binding and gagging or whipping, 16 percent of female athletes
reported doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   But women were more likely than men to be involved in
alcohol-related activities, such as forced consumption or drinking
contests, than any other form of hazing.
</P>
<P>
   Football players, swimmers, divers, lacrosse players, and water
polo players most frequently reported hazing than any other sport
in the survey. Students involved in tennis, fencing, and track
reported the least amount of hazing.
</P>
<P>
   Coll, who commissioned the study after several football players
at Alfred were hospitalized last year from hazing, said the results
were particularly disturbing because unlike most fraternities or
sororities, which are independently owned and under limited control
by universities, athletic teams are guided completely by college
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are teams supported by our money, supervised by our
coaches, and whose activities are conducted on our playing fields,
and in our gyms and locker rooms,'' Coll said. ``If members of
athletic teams are hazing the rookies, then it is our problem, and
our liability as well.''

DROP IN RATE OF AIDS CASES SLOWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the number of AIDS deaths continues to drop nationally,
the rapid rate of decline that had been attributed to new drugs is
starting to slow dramatically, public health officials reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the 42 percent drop in the number of AIDS deaths
nationally between 1996 and 1997, the rate of decline was only 20
percent between 1997 and 1998, according to figures presented at a
meeting in Atlanta. In 1998, 17,047 people with AIDS died, down
from 21,222 AIDS deaths in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts AIDS deaths statistics for 1998 are not yet
available, but those on the front lines of battling the disease
here say they are already hearing stories about people infected
with the AIDS virus failing to do as well on the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are hitting the wall again,'' Larry Kessler,
director of the AIDS Action Committee of Massachusetts, said in a
telephone interview. While the new drugs have helped many,
``they're not a cure, and they're not a vaccine,'' Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler and other health officials have known all along that
sooner or later the virus would figure out a way to outsmart these
latest AIDS drugs, which are known as protease inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The virus has a mind of its own,'' said Kessler, who added
that he was discouraged. ``I can't say we're surprised,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the National HIV Prevention Conference in Atlanta
Monday, public health officials estimated that about 40,000
Americans became newly infected with the AIDS virus in 1998, a
figure that has remained stable from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   But certain populations, such as young gay men and blacks,
continue to have a much higher rate of infection with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS, than the general population, according to
studies presented Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one seven-city survey of nearly 3,500 15- to
22-year-old gay men found that an average of 7 percent were
infected with HIV. Young gay black men had the highest rate of
infection, 14 percent. The survey included Los Angeles, Miami, New
York, and San Francisco, but no Massachusetts city.
</P>
<P>
   While figures for AIDS deaths in 1998 are not yet available for
Massachusetts, the state's latest AIDS surveillance data show that
more than 8,800 people diagnosed with AIDS in Massachusetts have
died since the epidemic began in the early 1980s. As of Aug. 1,
5,869 people with AIDS are still alive, according to the figures.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Massachusetts AIDS deaths fell 60 percent, following a
35-percent decline the year before. The state has tended to do
better than the national average at battling the epidemic because
of its extensive public health programs.
</P>
<P>
   But if studies presented at the meeting Monday by public health
officials from New York and Seattle are any indication,
Massachusetts might also expect to see a dramatic slowdown in the
rate of decline in AIDS deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those cities had at one point experienced a more than 60
percent drop in AIDS deaths, as Massachusetts had, but officials
said Monday that the decline slowed to only 25 percent in New York
in 1998 and to 27 percent in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 1998 AIDS death statistics will not be available
until November, Jean Flatley McGuire, director of the state's
HIV/AIDS bureau, said by telephone from Atlanta, where she is
attending the national AIDS meeting.
</P>
<P>
   She added that there could be any number of factors entering
into the national slowdown in AIDS deaths. ``I don't think there's
any one story behind this,'' McGuire said.
</P>
<P>
   People who might have died in earlier years without the drugs
may have had their death postponed until 1998, McGuire said. Or
some of those who died in 1998 may have been among the HIV-infected
patients that researchers have known all along will get few
benefits from the drugs, she said.

HACKER USES MICROSOFT WEB SITE TO READ E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A hacker gained access to millions of electronic mail messages
Monday by exploiting a bug in the software used by Microsoft Corp.
to run its popular Hotmail Web site. Worse yet, he revealed how he
did it, forcing Microsoft to shut down the service and scramble to
make repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail provides free e-mail accounts to more than 40 million
people worldwide. Monday the Swedish newspaper Expressen reported
that an unidentified hacker had set up a Web site that would give
visitors access to the mailbox of any Hotmail subscriber simply by
typing in the subscriber's user name. No password was necessary.
Since the user name of every Hotmail subscriber is included in his
or her e-mail address, it would be easy to find the user names of
total strangers and read their e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokeswoman said the company shut down the Hotmail
site Monday morning, as soon as technicians confirmed the existence
of the problem. The bug was closed and service was restored within
a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, word spread of another Web site that let
people gain unauthorized access to Hotmail. Microsoft says this
happened because one of its mail servers had not yet been updated
with software to repair the bug. As of Monday evening, Hotmail was
in operation and Microsoft insisted the problem had been repaired.

<P>
   The director of an installation intended to house the world's
most powerful lasers resigned his post on Friday after a flurry of
anonymous faxes to officials at his California laboratory and the
Department of Energy in Washington disclosed that he lacked a
doctoral degree.
</P>
<P>
   E. Michael Campbell, associate director for lasers at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., left his
position but remains an employee of the laboratory on leave, a
laboratory spokesman said. Campbell is recognized as one of the
world's leading experts in ultra-high-energy lasers.
</P>
<P>
   Livermore's director, Dr. Bruce Tarter, said Campbell's
resignation had been for strictly personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Livermore laboratory, operated by the Department of Energy,
conducts research in nuclear weapons and nonmilitary projects,
including the development of nuclear fusion as a source of power.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell held a pivotal position at Livermore as director of a
$1.2 billion program to build the National Ignition Facility, which
will conduct research in weapons and fusion and play an important
role in assuring that America's aging nuclear arsenal is ready for
a war.
</P>
<P>
   The main weapons research at the installation will focus on the
Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program, which monitors the
readiness of the nation's nuclear warheads, in part with
mathematical models and laboratory experiments. Since the signing
of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1993, the United States has
barred test explosions of real nuclear weapons, and has sought to
develop alternative methods of testing.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell will be replaced by George Miller, Livermore's
associate director for national security. Miller is expected to
undertake a far-reaching evaluation of the status of the National
Ignition Facility.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Richardson, a laboratory spokesman, said Monday that
Campbell had falsely allowed the laboratory to believe he had a
doctorate from Princeton University, but that Campbell's reasons
for resigning had nothing to do with the installation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' Richardson said, ``Mike had completed his Ph.D.
course work when he joined Livermore in 1977, but he never finished
his dissertation.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether a doctorate was required for holding Campbell's
position, Richardson said, ``We require all senior managers to hold
a doctorate or its equivalent in experience.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Livermore's former director, John Nuckolls, did
not have a doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   Livermore press releases during the last several years have
always referred to Campbell as Dr. Campbell, and he apparently did
nothing to correct the title.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell could not be reached for comment either at his office
or his home in Danville, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The author of many scientific papers, Campbell received the
Department of Energy's 1985 Excellence in Weapons Research Award,
the 1990 American Physical Society's Award for Excellence in Plasma
Physics, and the 1994 E.O. Lawrence Award for his leadership in
hydrogen fusion research. He is a fellow of the American Physical
Society.
</P>
<P>
   When completed in 2003 the National Ignition Facility will focus
192 laser beams on a tiny target, which will be instantly heated to
the temperature of the sun's core. The targets, tiny hollow spheres
of plastic filled with deuterium and tritium, are expected to
explode in a flash of fusion energy that could one day be harnessed
for electric power.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the tiny pellets are miniature hydrogen bombs, and
their behavior is expected to simulate on a small scale the
behavior of full-size thermonuclear weapons.

SURVEY SHOWS INTENSE HAZING AMONG COLLEGE ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new survey has found that 80 percent of all
college athletes go through hazing as part of a team initiation
process, with as many as one in five being forced to engage in
potentially criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
   The survey released Monday shows that athlete hazing involves
excessive heckling to beating and kidnapping new team members,
debunking the notion that hazing on college campuses occurs
primarily within fraternities and sororities.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the hazings involved alcohol and about 20 percent of the
students admitted committing an illegal act such as forcing
teammates to destroy or steal property or engage in lewd sexual
acts, according to the survey of 2,027 college athletes from 224
NCAA schools.
</P>
<P>
   The survey included athletes from the University of
Massachusetts at Boston, the University of Massachusetts at
Dartmouth, Brandeis University, Bowdoin College, Tufts University,
Middlebury College, Brown University, and the University of New
Hampshire. Not represented, however, were two of New England's
sports powerhouses, the University of Connecticut and Boston
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let these survey results serve as a wake-up call to this

BOSTON-AREA INFLATION SETTING NATIONAL PACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Calif., Fla., Wash.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Inflation in the Boston area and other high-tech
hotspots is surging ahead of the rest of the country, driven by a
rising stock market and soaring real estate prices.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's consumer price index, or CPI, rose 2.7 percent for the
year ending July 1999 _ significantly faster than the US inflation
rate of 2.1 percent for the past year, according to an analysis by
Fleet Financial Group Inc. based on monthly inflation data released
by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Inflation in Boston was
fourth-highest among major US metropolitan areas, trailing other
high-tech meccas such as San Francisco and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's economic expansion during the 1990s has been marked
by an unusual period of low inflation. But the cost of living
varies widely from city to city: Miami's inflation rate was
languid, not even reaching 1 percent, while San Francisco's leaped
nearly 4 percent over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   A big jump in rental rates for housing and a steep increase in
the cost of medical care accounted for much of the rise in
Boston-area prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think the cost of living is rising here faster than the
rest of the country, it's true,'' said Nicholas Perna, Fleet's
chief economist, though he noted that inflation, nevertheless,
remains ``surprisingly low.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists say it is no coincidence that cities, namely Boston,
Seattle, and San Francisco, that are experiencing a stock
market-induced boom in their high-tech sectors _ a boom that feeds
local economies overall _ are among those cities seeing their local
prices rise most and their residents' paychecks squeezed hardest.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market boom is ``driving rents in those areas,'' which
are a big factor driving up inflation, said David Wyss, director of
US economic research for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass.
``Boston and San Francisco are among the cities with some of the
tightest housing markets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What economists call the ``wealth effect'' _ prosperity that
accompanies a swelling of stock, mutual fund, or retirement
portfolios _ has produced big increases in consumption, including
purchases of housing. In high-tech regions, the wealth effect is
magnified by concentrations of workers who are compensated with
stock options as well as salaries.
</P>
<P>
   As the value of these start-up companies has soared and its
stock price doubles or triples, workers trade valuable stock
options issued by their employers for more square footage in their
houses or apartments, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, the heart of the nation's high-tech industry and
headquarters for computer giants such as Sun Microsystems, Intel
Corp., and Cisco Systems, has become known for horror stories about
its housing market, including reports of some homes selling for
hundreds of thousands of dollars over asking prices.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco also had the fastest increase in inflation _ 3.8
percent _ over the past year of any city. Unusually sharp increases
in gas prices in California were another factor pushing up the Bay
Area CPI.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the housing boom shows no sign of abating. US sales
of new homes remained strong in July, unexpectedly rising 0.1
percent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 980,000 _
the second-highest level ever _ as consumers and builders prospered
from job and income growth, US Commerce Department figures released
Monday showed.
</P>
<P>
   The second-highest CPI in the country, after San Francisco, was
Seattle, which is also a participant in the nation's high-tech
boom. The home of behemoth Microsoft Corp. and scads of
entrepreneurs in related lines of business, Seattle had a 3.1
percent inflation rate over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The national CPI is the index watched most closely by the
Federal Reserve to determine whether inflation is in danger of
taking off. Although US inflation remains tame, the Fed has raised
interest rates by a half percentage point this year amid signs of
wage inflation, which board members fear could pop up in the CPI.
</P>
<P>
   But Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, speaking to economists at an
elite gathering last week in Jackson Hole, Wyo., noted the
importance of the wealth effect in setting monetary policy at a
time the US stock market is holding at record levels. Greenspan
said the central bank would ``increasingly focus on changes in
asset values'' in setting interest rates in an effort to keep
inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Boston's high-tech renaissance, a second big
force behind rising prices in the area was the soaring cost of
medical care, which jumped 7.1 percent over the past year.
Prescription drug costs as well as a high use of physicians who are
specialists are among the factors pushing up the cost of heath care
for Boston residents.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, by comparison, medical care costs were up 3.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rents for homes and apartments _ which are a proxy for other
housing costs, such as the price of buying a home _ are among the
most important components in the government's calculation of the
CPI. Housing absorbs about 15 percent of consumer spending,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
   And rents in Boston are rising faster than the rest of the
country, due to a lifting of rent control in Cambridge, Brookline,
and Boston, and to a high-tech boom that has led to a frenzy of
buying in Boston and surrounding cities. Boston-area rents rose 4.8
percent over the past year, according to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, which generates consumer price data for the government.
Nationwide, rents rose 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   California cities have an added source of inflation unique to
their state. Residents have been hit by new state environmental
regulations that require motorists to use specially formulated
gasoline. While gasoline prices at the pump are rising around the
country, because of higher oil prices, gasoline prices in
California are now around $1.75 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's inflation is still under control, Wyss said, but the
3.8 percent rate in San Francisco is worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the CPI gets around 4 percent it starts making people
nervous,'' he said.

ATT SHOOTS FOR LONG-DISTANCE DOMINANCE WITH 7-CENT RATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T rolled out a 7-cent-per-minute domestic long-distance
calling plan Monday, aiming to stave off profit-dampening
defections by residential customers to flat-rate calling plans
announced earlier this summer by chief rivals MCI WorldCom and
Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   But the average consumer trying to figure out which of the Big
Three phone companies will give them the best deal would be well
served to have solid math skills _ and maybe even an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   The key question consumers need to answer is when they rack up
most of their long-distance minutes: During the daytime, when
AT&AMP;T's rate beats rivals handily, or on nights and weekends, when
MCI and Sprint would undercut AT&AMP;T's per-minute rate by 42 percent.
All three deals require a minimum monthly payment of about $5 or $6
a month.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's strategy seems to be that consumers will appreciate a
true single rate for long distance without having to check the
clock before calling. ``It's amazing how complicated this industry
can make saying, `Hello,' '' AT&AMP;T chairman Michael Armstrong told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   People who sign up for AT&AMP;T's plan will get 7-cents-a-minute
long-distance calling all week long if they pay a fixed monthly
charge of $5.95, cut to $4.95 if people also use AT&AMP;T for
intra-state long distance calling (such as Boston to Framingham or
Cape Cod).
</P>
<P>
   MCI and Sprint offer rates as low as 5 cents a minute, with $5
or $6 monthly charge, but only on nights and weekends in MCI's case
or, in Sprint's, from 7 p.m. to midnight every day. At other times
their rates range from 10 to 25 cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, AT&AMP;T had offered a 15 cent per minute deal with no
monthly fee, or 10 cents per minute and 5 cents on Sundays for a
$4.95 fee.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications analysts Jeffrey Kagan said of the new 7-cent
plan, ``While this is not the lowest price, it is the simplest . .
. It should be successful at keeping their customers from jumping
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   While AT&AMP;T consumer services president Gene Lockhart said the
new rate would serve as a ``core product'' through 2000, Kagan
predicted, ``We will see all the competitors tweaking their plans
in coming months.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry observers questioned whether the race to the
bottom in long-distance calling charges means it no longer makes
sense for Bell Atlantic to be fighting hard to get into the
long-distance market in Massachusetts, New York and other states.
</P>
<P>
   Bell spokesman John Johnson said the company continues to
``think the long-distance market is still lucrative, perhaps more
so than the local business. And we think it's it's critical to be
able to bundle long-distance along with local services and Internet
and others. Customers practically demand it.''
</P>
<P>
   MCI's senior vice president of consumer marketing, John
Donoghue, saidof the 7-cent plan, ``It's certainly a better deal
than what AT&AMP;T customers are getting now, but it's not as good a
deal as they can get through MCI.''
</P>
<P>
   Donoghue said MCI finds its customers use 85 percent of their
calling minutes during the off-peak hours when it offers a 5-cent
rate. Someone making 100 minutes of monthly long-distance calls in
that pattern would pay MCI $1.20 to $2 a month less than the $11.95
AT&AMP;T would charge someone who also used AT&AMP;T for intra-state toll
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's Eileen Gaffen said her company has found residential
customers do their heaviest long-distance calling at night from 7
p.m. to 9 p.m., so it aimed its cheapest rate to nighttimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all price these days,'' Gaffen added, noting that the
J.D. Powers survey has ranked Sprint tops for customer service five
years running. ``People should look at the way they are treated by
their phone company.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T officials said the recent spate of cut-price calling plans
is eroding long-distance revenues more than they expected. But they
told analysts Monday they would meet Wall Street expectations of 5
to 7 percent company-wide earnings growth this year because of
unexpectedly strong growth in wireless calling and other business
sectors such as Internet access. Still, AT&AMP;T shares, the heaviest
traded shares on the New York Stock Exchange Monday, dropped $1.50
to $46.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, AT&AMP;T also unveiled a new wireless calling plan
called the Family Plan under which up to five family members can
make unlimited wireless calls to each other and to a home phone,
with a designated georgraphic area, for $30 to $50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals questioned whether this is really a good deal, however,
with Bell Atlantic Mobile touting its own $10-a-month plan allowing
unlimited calls to any other Bell Mobile customer, subject to some
restrictions.

MICROSOFT DUMPS ALPHA, BUT CHIP'S FUTURE SECURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What happened to Alpha Processor Inc. last week would be the
kiss of death for many computer firms. But nobody's hanging any
crepe at Alpha, even though they've just learned that the world's
biggest software company is abandoning them.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft announced last week that future versions of its
Windows NT operating system would not be tailored to run on Alpha's
high-powered processor chips. A long-promised version of NT that
would take full advantage of the Alpha's unique design will never
see the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, computers using Alpha processors have been shut out
from the vast market for workstations and servers running Windows
NT. It's bad news for Alpha Processor, the leading distributor and
marketer of Alpha chips. But Jeff Borkowski, Alpha Processor's vice
president of marketing, doesn't see it as a portent of doom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt it's a disappointment,'' said Borkowski,
``but the reality is there won't be a material effect on our
revenue line or our bottom line this year.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Borkowski says his company hopes to make Alpha-based
systems a favorite choice among heavy-duty users who may not want
to trust their computing tasks to Microsoft's NT software.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha Processor, of Concord, Mass., is owned by Korean
electronics firm Samsung Electronics Co. and Houston-based Compaq
Computer Corp. The Alpha was developed by Digital Equipment Corp.,
which was acquired by Compaq last year. Alpha Processor hasn't
released its earnings, but says that this year's revenues should
reach $100 million. About three-quarters of that comes from sales
of Alpha chips and motherboards to Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Alpha first appeared in 1992, versions of the chip
have consistently outperformed the industry-leading Pentium chips
made by rival Intel Corp. Alpha chips are now made by Samsung in
Korea and by Intel, under contract to Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpha's design made it incompatible with Intel processors.
The Alpha can't run Microsoft Windows software without an
additional program called an emulator, which makes the Alpha work
like a Pentium chip. But using an emulator slows the Alpha down,
thus eliminating the speed advantage that made the chip attractive
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Alpha-based computers never became commonly used on
corporate desktops. Instead, most Alphas are found in corporate
back offices, running tough and intensive computing tasks. Most of
the Alphas run OpenVMS, an operating system designed for larger
computers, or True64 Unix, an Alpha-modified version of the
powerful Unix operating system. There's also an Alpha version of
the free Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Compaq had vowed to produce a version of Windows
NT that would solve this problem, but now that plan has been
scrapped. The Alpha will forever support only non-Microsoft
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has basically been pretty clear that the market for
us is the Linux space,'' Borkowski said. Alpha Processor is betting
that the combination of Alpha speed with Linux reliability and low
cost will be a hit with small- and medium-size firms.
</P>
<P>
   Borkowski figures that about 300,000 Linux servers will be sold
worldwide next year. He says that if Alpha Processor can get a
quarter of that _ 75,000 servers _ they'll do fine.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha also has a steady following among scientists and
engineers. Microway Inc. of Kingston, Mass. will sell as many as
3,000 Alpha-based computers this year, many to these hardcore
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doubling in size every six to 12 months,'' said Microway
president Stephen Fried, ``and that's been going on ever since we
got into the Alpha business'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The abandonment of Windows NT for Alpha probably ensures that
the processor will always be a niche product, with little appeal to
many computer users. But Compaq, which actually owns the Alpha
technology, is continuing to upgrade and enhance the chip.
</P>
<P>
   A 750-megahertz version is due this fall, and a one-gigahertz
version should come out by next summer. Meanwhile, Samsung's Alpha
plant will start using some new chipmaking techniques to improve
performance and lower the Alpha's power consumption. In July,
Compaq announced it would spend $100 million to promote the use of
Alpha processors running True64 Unix. All of these signs suggest
that Alpha Processor may have a future after all.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Presidential candidates have always made a point of having
themselves photographed as they step out of church on Sunday,
carrying a Bible perhaps, and shaking the minister's hand.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early campaign for the 2000 elections, the rite of
political piety has moved far beyond the sacramental photo
opportunity. The candidates are engaging in ``God talk'' that is
more explicit, more intimate and more pervasive than at any time in
recent decades, historians and political analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   In a Houston church, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas describes his
decision to ``recommit my life to Jesus Christ.'' At a convention
of black Baptists, Vice President Al Gore declares himself ``a
child of the Kingdom and a person of strong faith.'' And at a
prayer breakfast in Philadelphia, Elizabeth Dole recounts a talk
she had with God. This is now common language on the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this presidential contest there is much more discussion of
personal faith than there has been in the past,'' said John Green,
who studies how politics intersect religion as director of the Ray
Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron, in
Ohio. ``I suppose if you went far back enough in American history
you'd probably find a year like this one. But if you just think of
the last 20 years, more candidates are talking more openly about
their personal faith now.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is not confined to politics. This is an era in
which public figures of all kinds are ``coming out'' about their
private spirituality. Madonna gives interviews about studying
Kabbala, or Jewish mysticism. The singer Lauryn Hill brings a Bible
on stage to accept a Grammy award and reads a Psalm aloud. The
actors Richard Gere and Harrison Ford meditate at a Tibetan
Buddhist ritual led by the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Politics, however, has its own rhythms, and there are particular
reasons why the candidates are now waving the flag of faith. The
most urgent reason, political analysts agree, is that in a nation
weary of White House scandal, the candidates must find ways to
signal that they can be trusted behind the Oval Office doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's driven by the post-Monica hangover, almost like a drunk
reaching for the black coffee,'' said a Bush adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Reeves, a historian at the University of
Wisconsin-Parkside, in Kenosha, and the author of ``A Question of
Character: A Life of John F. Kennedy'' (The Free Press, 1991), said
that the candidates ``are trying to distance themselves from the
squalor of the Clintons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The language itself isn't new at all,'' Reeves said. ``James
Garfield and Rutherford B. Hayes made the point that they were
church members and spoke very staunchly about their faith, their
church affiliations and the union of God and country. They did it
because the politics of the Gilded Age were so squalid and so
corrupt. Candidates, then and now, are trying to say that they
stand above the mess that people perceive.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush, a Republican, and Gore, a Democrat, are promoting
charities run by churches and religious organizations as an
antidote to government welfare. But this is not the first time that
presidential candidates have linked piety and public policy, Reeves
said. Abolition of slavery, prohibition and even Theodore
Roosevelt's environmentalism were all proclaimed as ``godly''
policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But right now, the presidential contenders are responding to
polls showing that Americans are focused on immorality as the basis
of many social ills. Asked whether they were more concerned about
the nation's moral problems or economic problems, 58 percent of
Americans said moral problems, while 38 percent said economic
problems, according to a poll of 1,022 adults in a CNN/Gallup
survey conducted in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has something to do with the presidential scandals, and
the school shootings like the one in Littleton,'' Green said.
``There is a sense of disquiet in the land, and I think these
candidates have picked this up in their polling, in talking to
people. And when people are faced with existential issues, they
tend to turn back to religion, and that's not just conservatives,
it's everybody. Religion is a source of moral grounding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidates especially know they must find ways to
appeal to the crucial evangelical voting bloc. For candidates like
Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes, Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes, this is no
challenge; they stand with religious conservatives firmly against
abortion and homosexuality and for organized school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But for a candidate like Bush, who is playing to the center on
those issues, his frequent religious testimony is ``almost like a
surrogate for the more hard-edged moral agenda of the party,'' said
the Bush adviser, who put the candidate's position this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``What he is doing is like saying to the social conservative
wing, `I can't say everything you want me to say, or propose
everything you want me to propose, but I want you to know that in
my heart or in my soul, I'm where you are personally. And what I
can accomplish, I will accomplish, and you can trust that.' In the
end, I think that formula will work, that he will be able to get
his fair market share of religious activists in the primaries.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cromartie, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public
Policy Center in Washington, said, ``A little bit of religiosity
can cover a multitude of sins, and it can cover a multitude of
political sins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see it with Elizabeth Dole,'' Cromartie said. ``A lot
of religious conservative folk are really unimpressed with her
ability to waffle on just about everything, but when they hear her
talking religious language, they think, `She may not be clear on
abortion, and on a multitude of other issues I care about, but she
loves Jesus.'''
</P>
<P>
   But not all the ``God talk'' can be chalked up to mere
posturing. Many of this crop of candidates are churchgoers who say
they read the Bible regularly and look to God and Scriptures for
guidance. Mrs. Dole, long before she or her husband were
presidential candidates, gave speeches ``witnessing'' her turn
toward God. After his Army service in Vietnam, Gore attended
divinity school briefly. And Bush says his faith in God is what
helped him give up alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore summoned religion writers to the White House in May
for an interview, he was asked whether he was trying to reclaim
religion from the conservatives. ``No,'' he said, ``I'm just trying
to be who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   But one unspoken rule is that the only candidates who benefit by
emphasizing their religious bona fides are Protestants. Former
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, of Greek Orthodox heritage
and married to a Jew, avoided religious talk. President Kennedy,
the first and only Roman Catholic president, had to deflect slurs
about handing over the country to Vatican control. Buchanan and
Keyes, both Roman Catholics, use religious language that is
indistinct from that of evangelical Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   The evangelical talk of being ``born again,'' greeted as exotic
back in 1976 when used by Jimmy Carter, is now commonplace.
Clinton, a Southern Baptist, has displayed an ease with evangelical
language and Biblical reference that he put to use in his campaigns
and as president.
</P>
<P>
   It is paradoxical, says Nathan Hatch, professor of history and
provost at the University of Notre Dame, that religious talk is so
commonplace as the nation becomes increasingly diverse religiously
and ethnically. ``It's a far more diverse culture, so there's far
less one can assume'' about morality and religion, Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, said Reeves, the historian, invoking ``American
civil religion, one nation under God, is almost a prerequisite''
for a presidential candidate today. ``The public eats it up,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be wonderful if you saw a candidate come along now
who said, `I'm an atheist,' just for a change of pace?'' Reeves
said.
</P>
<P>
   And what chance would that candidate have of winning? ``None,''
Reeves said.

COMMENTARY: SIAMESE TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ No one knows if China is going to invade
Taiwan, but if it does it will affect not only Asian politics but
also Asian rock'n'roll. You see, the most popular singer in China
today is Taiwan's sexy, silky-voiced Ah Mei.
</P>
<P>
   When Ah Mei recently performed in Beijing and thanked the
Chinese ministry of culture for letting her appear, the Chinese
audience reportedly booed at even the mention of their own
government. Rock'n'roll uber alles. Two countries, one Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   I recall this story because it helps to explain why _ for the
moment _ the most important thing happening in the Strait of Taiwan
is what is not happening. China, for all its distress at President
Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan for his assertion that Taiwan is a separate
``state'' from China, hasn't reacted in any substantive way. In
part this is because China always moves slowly, and in part it's
because Beijing may have concluded it's better to just wait until
Taiwan holds its new elections in March and replaces Lee, because
any alternative will be better.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing China's forbearance is surely about is Beijing's
awareness that Taiwan and China are now so intertwined that neither
can shoot the other without shooting itself. They have mutual
assured economic destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Consider just a few facts: In 1995-96 when China threatened
Taiwan, the Taiwan stock market crashed, but China's little markets
were unaffected. This time, when China rattled its saber at Lee it
knocked down Taiwan's stock market, the Taiex, by 20 percent. What
people didn't notice, though, was that the Shanghai Stock Exchange
B-share index plunged 40 percent! Two countries, one stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Western investment in China has dropped sharply this
year. Why? China has been the Amazon.com of countries _ a place
where people were ready to make huge bets, and take huge losses, on
the assumption of huge profits one day. But more and more Western
investors are questioning whether that huge payday will ever be
there, and the corruption and hassles don't seem worth it anymore.
At the same time, overseas Chinese from Thailand, Malaysia and
elsewhere in Southeast Asia have had to cut back their investments
in China because they got hit by the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves the Taiwanese _ who avoided the Asian economic flu
and don't mind the cowboy capitalism required for doing business in
China _ more important to China than ever. There are roughly 46,000
Taiwanese-funded enterprises operating in China today.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Far Eastern Economic Review, Taiwan's total
contracted investment in China is now $46 billion. ``Taiwan is
China's biggest capital supplier today, because (Taiwanese
businessmen) are ready to play by the local rules, but this may not
last forever,'' says Douglas Hsu, chairman of Far East Textile, one
of Taiwan's biggest firms. ``I am torn right now. China is a big
market. Where am I going to find an alternative to this market? But
I am living under this cloud of uncertainty with them. I am an
industrialist. I have enough problems building plants and finding
customers. I can't be worried about missiles flying back and forth.
This is a cloud, and if it stays there, (China) is going to pay a
price.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, China seems keen again about joining the World
Trade Organization _ which would also bring with it permanent
most-favored-nation trade status with the United States. Since 1990
China has earned $65 billion from trade with the Unitd States _
half of its total foreign reserve growth in that period. The WTO
rules are the lever that China's reformist prime minister, Zhu
Rongji, wants to use to overcome his domestic opponents and force
more openness on China. A war with Taiwan now would torpedo both
U.S. trade and approval for China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   None of this economic integration guarantees that China won't
invade Taiwan. Preventing Taiwan's independence is a popular, gut
issue for China, and no Chinese leader can ignore it and survive.
But what all this economic integration does guarantee is that if
China does invade Taiwan the economic costs are going to be
enormous _ much larger than commonly realized _ and therefore much
more destabilizing for all of China, and therefore much more
destabilizing for all of us.

AN ARCTIC TESTAMENT TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scurvy, frostbite, exhaustion, starvation, faulty maps, terror
of the unknown _ but of all the adversaries of the Arctic explorers
of the 19th century, the most dangerous foe was government
bureaucracy, says Dr. Jonathan M. Karpoff, a professor of finance
at the University of Washington School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Karpoff recently analyzed 35 government and 56 privately
financed Arctic expeditions from 1818 to 1909, originating from the
United States, Britain and elsewhere in Europe. The average death
rate was 9 percent on the public expeditions and 6 percent on the
private ones. Public explorations lost an average of 198 tons of
shipping; the private loss was 60 tons. Of expeditions lasting more
than one year, 47 percent of the public but only 13 percent of the
private ones were debilitated by scurvy, caused in part by lack of
vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be sure, most leaders of government-funded expeditions
performed courageously,'' Karpoff wrote, adding that many privately
financed trips were disasters. The differences, Karpoff wrote, were
primarily related to differences in the ways public and private
expeditions were organized.
</P>
<P>
   According to historical accounts, the people initiating and
organizing public expeditions actually led them only 27 percent of
the time, compared with 78 percent for the private journeys.
Because of this, Karpoff wrote, ``the organizers of the public
expeditions faced few of the negative consequences of poor planning
or erroneous theories.''
</P>
<P>
   Private leaders were more enthusiastic about the Arctic and less
hampered by rank or tradition, he noted. They were more likely to
listen to fur trappers, Inuits and their own crews on equipment,
clothing and shelter. Private parties relied more on fresh meat, a
better source of vitamin C than salt meat, the staple of many
public expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   While extrapolating from the class-ridden 19th century to the
modern age is difficult, Karpoff said that such programs as the
Human Genome Project and space exploration might benefit from the
Arctic's lessons of leadership and motivation.

   Looking for a cancer treatment? Which statement do you believe?
</P>
<P>
   _ Shark cartilage ``appears to work through the activity of at
least four complex proteins contained in the cartilage. The
proteins appear to inhibit the development of new blood capillaries
needed to feed a fast-growing tumor. Without a feeding network, a
tumor can't grow.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Shark cartilage is worthless against cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Both statements appear on the World Wide Web, amid dozens of
sites turned up in an Internet search for references to shark
cartilage, a diet supplement trumpeted as a remedy for breast and
prostate cancer. And while the second statement is clearly closer
to the truth, at least as documented by clinical research, the
first is among scores of misleading, inaccurate ``facts'' about
cancer and other diseases _ references accessible in moments to
anyone with a computer and an Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   The misinformation does not stop at unproven remedies. As a team
of researchers from the University of Michigan reported this month
in the journal Cancer, the Internet is rife with basic, and perhaps
life-threatening, factual errors.
</P>
<P>
   In their study, the researchers analyzed 371 Web sites with
references to Ewing sarcoma, an uncommon bone cancer that typically
afflicts children and young adults. The search revealed errors that
the authors called ``shocking,'' with about a third of the
references lacking any indication that the information had been
deemed accurate by independent experts through the time-honored
process of peer review.
</P>
<P>
   Six percent of the Web pages that were not peer-reviewed
contained ``clearly erroneous'' information. In other cases, the
information was seriously outdated or misleading.
</P>
<P>
   One such site, operated by the Encyclopaedia Britannica, said
Ewing sarcoma ``is particularly destructive, metastasizes early and
has a mortality rate of about 95 percent even with radical
therapy,'' when in fact it is among the most curable of cancers,
with a survival rate of 70 to 75 percent; the encyclopedia
corrected the statement, a spokesman said, after the error was
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   In their report the team, led by Dr. J. Sybil Biermann, called
the Internet the great equalizer and added: ``Experts, specialists,
authorities, professionals, alternative therapy promoters,
interested lay people, charlatans and hucksters all may set up
sites.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Biermann said: ``There are some excellent
reputable sites but also some that are highly misleading. No one
screens the claims people make on the Web, and I've seen sites
claiming spurious cures for a variety of cancers. What you read on
the Internet could end up killing you, if you believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers outlined the potential hazards of such
misinformation:
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents of a child diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma may be
devastated by a finding on the Internet of a 95 percent mortality
rate, and may even be driven to consider refusing therapy if they
are convinced that conventional medical science (even `radical'
therapy) yields such a dismal prognosis. Alternatively, they may
believe that an organization that lists an 85 percent cure rate may
provide better therapy than one that posts a cure rate more in line
with the peer-reviewed published trials.''
</P>
<P>
   As the team discovered when it used four search engines to find
references to Ewing sarcoma: ``Attempts to access medical
information from the Internet may be very cumbersome and
time-consuming. Patients may spend hours in fruitless, frustrating
searches, finding a few helpful sites but sifting through many dead
ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Biermann suggested that the amount of erroneous information the
team found might have been higher if the study had focused on a
more common disease. Available sites for more common cancers can
reach tens of thousands. For breast cancer alone, for example,
there are 60,548 Web pages, according to Dr. Donald Earl Henson of
the National Cancer Institute, who wrote an editorial about the
Michigan report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it has enormous potential to educate the public and
to comfort individual patients, the Internet in some cases may
actually lead to adverse medical care by spreading misleading or
even fraudulent information,'' Henson wrote. ``On the Internet,
there is no separation of peer-reviewed, scientifically proven
conclusions from anecdotal information or personal reflections.''
</P>
<P>
   When the information obtained from the Internet conflicts with
recommendations from physicians, patients may become confused and
uncertain, resulting in a delay in treatment or inappropriate
choice of therapies, he said. And when information found on the
Internet contradicts what patients learn from their physicians,
they may lose confidence in their doctors, which could compromise
their willingness to accept and endure necessary treatments, the
Michigan team suggested.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This is by no means the first time that a significant percentage
of Web sites dealing with health matters has been found to be
filled with inaccuracies. Last year, for example, pediatric
specialists from Ohio State University College of Medicine and
Public Health examined 60 Web sites established by major medical
institutions, medical schools and hospitals and found that only 20
percent of them gave up-to-date advice for treating childhood
diarrhea. The remaining 80 percent of sites had inaccurate
information, with advice that conflicted with the authoritative
guidelines established by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. H. Juhling McClung, lead author of the report in the journal
Pediatrics, said that although the institutions promulgating this
information were ``among our finest, a lot of it was garbage, just
garbage'' and ``no more accurate than information from Web sites
sponsored by herbalists and chiropractors.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne C. Ryer, the author of ``Health Net'' (Wiley, 1997), a
guide to online medical information, said ``unregulated, unedited
information'' on the Internet could be ``a recipe for disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be confusing, controversial, inaccurate, ill-advised,
even deadly if the advice is followed,'' Ms. Ryer added.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Maurie Markman, chairman of hematology and medical oncology
at the Cleveland Clinic Cancer Center, says that cancer information
on the Internet ``has the potential to cause tremendous harm
through erroneous, misleading and deceptive information.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the case of a woman with ovarian cancer whose husband
did an exhaustive online search for possible treatments, examining
nearly 200 experimental regimens worldwide. The husband concluded
that intensive therapy with a combination of drugs would be better
for his wife than the treatment she was receiving, even though her
doctors thought she was not strong enough to withstand a more
intensive regimen.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial on the benefits and risks of cancer information
on the Internet published last year in the Cleveland Clinic Journal
of Medicine, Markman wrote, ``Of greatest concern is the complete
lack of quality control for any information or advice provided.
Well-recognized and highly respected health care organizations and
experts have no more inherent authority when viewed on a computer
screen than a misinformed member of the public attempting to help
others, or than individuals or groups engaged in health care
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their findings on Ewing sarcoma, Biermann and colleagues
noted that ``the Internet can be a powerful, positive partner to
the health care provider in patient education.''
</P>
<P>
   They added, ``Better health care results when patients are more
involved with their treatment choices, more informed regarding
their disease and more invested in their health care.'' They urged
health care providers to maintain open minds and be willing to
explore new information, including information about alternative
and complementary therapies, that patients glean from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the Internet was here to stay and is expanding
rapidly, the Michigan team also suggested that doctors help to
identify or create accurate patient information Web sites and teach
the public how to evaluate information about cancer and other
health matters found on the Internet.

AIMING AT MICROSOFT OFFICE, SUN ACQUIRES STAR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)   (Eds., skedded earlier as SUN-WEB-SOFTWARE) 
(DW) 
 By STEVE LOHR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems Inc. is planning an ambitious campaign to move
everyday software applications like word processing and
spreadsheets away from the personal computer desktop and onto the
World Wide Web _ a strategy that amounts to a direct assault on
Microsoft's biggest business.
</P>
<P>
   Sun is announcing Tuesday that it has acquired Star Division
GmbH, a German producer of office productivity software, which
moved its headquarters to California last year. Its Star Office is
a bundle of programs _ word processors, spreadsheets, schedulers,
personal data base and presentation software _ in the same
application categories as the Microsoft Corp.'s Office suite, the
industry leader.
</P>
<P>
   Star Office has received favorable reviews in the trade press,
and it has a devoted following among users of the Linux operating
system, the only market where Star's productivity suite is No. 1.
Still, the Star Office product has yet to move beyond niche status.
</P>
<P>
   But at a New York news conference Tuesday, Sun is to lay out its
plan to to try to catapult Star Office into the mainstream of
computer software. The company, according to Sun executives, will
allow anyone to download Star Office over the Internet free. More
significantly, Sun intends to transform the product from software
that resides on the hard disk of a PC or work station into a
Web-based application that a user with Internet access can tap into
from an emerging array of devices other than PCs, like hand-held
computers and cellular telephones with screens.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, there is no greater focal point of
programming talent and venture investment than the new field of
Web-based applications. These are software applications that run
mainly on powerful central computers and can be reached over the
Internet by a user with a browser. Some early applications,
particularly Web-based e-mail, have been quite popular. Microsoft
itself owns one of the leading Web e-mail systems, Hotmail, and
earlier this year purchased Jump Inc., a maker of online personal
calendar software.
</P>
<P>
   Web-based applications are the software building blocks of what
some industry analysts see as a coming post-PC era. By that, they
do not mean the demise of the personal computer, but they see the
center of gravity in computing _ technology development and user
interest _ gradually shifting from the PC to the Internet and the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's plan for Star Office, analysts say, represents a bold
attempt to try to hasten the arrival of a post-PC era. But Sun is
not describing its move as a head-on confrontation with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was mainly about taking on Microsoft,'' said Edward J.
Zander, the president of Sun, ``we would have done this five years
ago and taken them on with a fat client,'' meaning desktop
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really behind this,'' Zander added, ``is that the
networked model of computing is finally starting to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for Microsoft, the rise of Web software is similar to the
challenge that the rise of microprocessor-based computing was for
IBM back in the days when mainframes still ruled the computer
industry. No one expects users to abandon Microsoft's PC software
technology, just as IBM mainframes never disappeared. But the
emergence of a low-cost software alternative could well pose a
threat to Microsoft's stratospheric profit margins, and thus its
stock price, employee incentives and business model.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another attempt by Sun to chip away at Microsoft's
dominance,'' said Richard Shaffer, principal of Technologic
Partners, a research firm. ``Anything that slows Microsoft is good
for Sun. That has been Sun's strategy for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the impact on Microsoft, Sun benefits from
anything that stimulates Internet computing. It is a leading
producer of the big server computers that power many major Web
sites, and it created the Internet programming language Java. While
Sun will make Star Office available free, it does plan to charge
for technical support and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   If any company has a chance at making inroads against
Microsoft's Office it may well be Sun Microsystems, which has the
money and technology expertise to market Star Office aggressively.
Sun, as part of a three-way deal struck last year, has close ties
to a pair of Internet powers, America Online and its subsidiary,
Netscape Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Star says its software is ``completely interoperable'' with the
Microsoft Office file formats, like .doc for word processing and
.xls for spreadsheets. Star Office runs on several operating
systems including Microsoft's Windows, Sun's Solaris, IBM's OS/2
and Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts agree that Sun faces a daunting challenge.
Microsoft's hold on the market for office-productivity software is,
if anything, even firmer than its grip on the market for
operating-system software with Windows. For millions of users
worldwide, Word, Excel and Powerpoint _ Microsoft's word
processing, spreadsheet and presentation programs _ constitute a
universal language of modern computer-mediated business. Getting
people to switch to anything else will be a formidable hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, analysts estimate, derives about half its revenue
from its Office product line, and it will fiercely defend that
franchise. Microsoft, they add, has a decade's worth of experience
with Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that Web-hosted applications are an
interesting concept,'' said David Readerman, an analyst with Thomas
Weisel Partners, an investment firm in San Francisco, ``but this is
going to get down to the real features and functionality of the
software. Millions and millions of people use Microsoft Office and
they like it. What is possibly going to be so compelling that they
would want to switch?''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price for Star, a private company with 200
employees, was not disclosed. But Sun has long been familiar with
Star since Andreas von Bechtolsheim, a founder of Sun and a
computer work station pioneer, made a personal investment in Star
in 1992. Marco Boeries, who founded Star in 1985, will become a
vice president of Sun and general manager of its software
applications unit.

 &HT;    Asian women expected jobs, not prostitution
 &HT;    By R. Robin McDonald
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some knew they were coming to America to become
prostitutes. Others believed they were paying $40,000 to travel
from Asia to legal jobs in America as hostesses, seamstresses or
waitresses.
</P>
<P>
   But when they got to Atlanta, all the young women became sex
slaves, forced into service in 13 apartments and two motel rooms
that made up just one part of a national network of illegal
brothels. Federal investigators say the women, some as young as 15,
were guarded by Asian gang members in squalid rooms furnished with
little but mattresses and condoms. They were sold for sex as often
as 10 times a day.
</P>
<P>
   The women _ who signed contracts with smugglers known as
``snakeheads'' in Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Korea, China, and
Malaysia _ were largely invisible even in the Asian communities in
northern DeKalb County and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And every few weeks, they were moved from city to city as
brothel owners bought and sold their contracts, according to search
warrant affidavits and federal grand jury indictments unsealed last
week. The owners kept the women moving to avoid detection by law
enforcement and to ensure repeat customers who demanded sex with
different women.
</P>
<P>
   Customers paid $100 a trick, the federal indictments said. The
brothel kept $30. The remaining $70 went to the brokers who held
their contracts. Brothel owners insisted that the prostitutes make
themselves attractive to their customers. If they failed to attract
enough clients, the men who owned their contracts often threatened
the prostitutes and the families they had left behind, federal
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 sex acts later, when they had repaid their brokers,
the women were freed. But they soon learned they were were illegal
aliens with no money, no visas, no legal identification, no work
skills and nowhere to go, federal agents said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, federal investigators say, some of them
returned to the brothels, this time as madams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we looked into this case is because of the
smuggling and the involuntary servitude,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Janis Gordon. ``There are always going to be prostitutes.
...It's the forced nature of this prostitution.'' On Aug. 17 _
after a two-year investigation by the FBI and the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service _ federal prosecutors in Atlanta
unsealed four indictments charging 13 people with smuggling Asian
women into the U.S. and forcing them into prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of those people are now in custody. Six remain at large.
All but one are legal residents of the United States. At least two
came to America as refugees after the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities say those under indictment were associated
with four separate organizations that, for the most part, operated
in friendly competition.
</P>
<P>
   The federal indictments and affidavits _ some based on
accounting records seized from suspected brothels in and around
Chamblee and northeast Atlanta _ detail vividly the lives the
smuggled women led as prostitutes. They also document the lucrative
nature of the suspect operations and shine a spotlight on organized
crime in Atlanta's Vietnamese and Chinese communities.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two years _ from Nov. 1, 1995, to March 9, 1998,
when it was raided _ one of those brothels was in a brown,
one-story house near Shallowford Road and I-85. The wooded lot was
enclosed by an eight-foot chain link fence topped with barbed wire.
It was guarded by two large dogs and armed men with suspected ties
to Vietnamese gangs, federal affidavits say. It was the only house
on a dead-end road, DeKalb police say, and attracted little
attention from anyone but its clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators learned from customers who frequented the brothel
that it was furnished with seven mattresses in five bedrooms. Other
than the mattress, each bedroom had only a garbage can, condoms, a
bottle of mouth wash, a jar of lubricant, and a pile of folded
towels.
</P>
<P>
   It attracted 30 to 40 customers a night. On weekends, as many as
100 men visited, a federal affidavit said. During the 28 months it
was in operation, the brothel earned more than $1.5 million, Gordon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the prostitutes were teen-agers, many of them
minors, federal affidavits say. As many as 400 prostitutes, many of
them juveniles, passed through the brothel before it was raided
last year, Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have charged Ninh Vinh Luong, also known as
Ah Lynn, with owning and operating the brothel. After the 1988
raid, federal authorities say, Luong moved the brothel to the
Beacon Hill Apartments in Chamblee. The brothel cleared $267,000 in
six months, Gordon said, before Luong abandoned that location after
neighbors became suspicious. ``People would beep horns and shine
lights to intimidate the customers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dominic Pham, president of the Vietnamese Community of Georgia,
said he believes few of Atlanta's Vietnamese residents knew of the
brothels' existence. ``Those that are aware of that,'' he said,
``are scared to report to the police. They are scared of revenge
from whoever they report, from the gangs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lani Wong, chairwoman of the Atlanta chapter of the National
Association of Chinese-Americans, said news of the indictments was
a shock. ``Everybody feels so outraged about this thing
happening,'' she said. ``We cannot imagine people doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Luong told federal pre-trial service workers that until his
arrest he was a janitor at a Chinese restaurant on Buford Highway.
But federal authorities contend Luong was ``the kingpin'' of at
least four brothels, Gordon said in a detention hearing last week.
</P>
<P>
   And for a janitor, Luong was an elaborate spender, federal
authorities say. They say he spent thousands of dollars on food and
alcohol for his friends at Atlanta nightclubs and gambled in Las
Vegas, Atlantic City and Biloxi.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said Luong is also suspected of membership in the Hip
Sing tong, a criminal offshoot of the Hip Sing Association.
</P>
<P>
   Hip Sing _ one of the Chinese community's most prominent
fraternal organizations _ is a century-old association rooted in
the secret societies of ancient China. In America, it often serves
as an unofficial Chinese chamber of commerce. But some of its
members have been targeted by federal authorities investigating
organized crime in America's Asian communities. In Atlanta and New
York, indictments have charged association members with running
illegal gambling dens, laundering money, extortion, loan-sharking,
and bribery and hiring Asian street gangs to protect criminal
enterprises with violence.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, elders of the Hip Sing Association in Doraville
were indicted on charges of operating an illegal casino that
laundered drug money. Among those convicted of money-laundering was
Ah Chu ``Teddy'' Chan, who then owned the Bamboo Luau Chinese
Restaurant on Cheshire Bridge Road in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say that one of the suspected brothel madams
named in the federal indictments is Micha ``Ah Fa'' Johnson, Teddy
Chan's girlfriend. She is on the run from federal authorities. To
Ha ``Ah Ha'' Vuong, a third suspected brothel owner indicted by the
grand jury, is also believed to be ``a fairly high level member''
of Hip Sing, a federal affidavit said. Vuong is a co-owner of the
First China Restaurant on Buford Highway in Doraville. He also is a
fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities say that both First China and the Bamboo
Luau were recruiting grounds for brothel managers and their
employees, who solicited restaurant customers and taxied them to
the brothels.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those customers, who were videotaped going in and out of
the brothels by federal agents, have now become federal witnesses,
prosecutors say.

 &HT;    Asian smugglers increasingly making Atlanta final destination
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Twice this month a rare public spotlight has shone
twice on the illicit underground business of human smuggling in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   First came the discovery on Aug. 12 of 132 Chinese men and boys
in the secret compartment of a freighter bound for Savannah and
Georgetown, S.C. Then, on Aug. 19, federal prosecutors in Atlanta
unsealed indictments accusing 13 people of smuggling Asian girls
and women into a life of forced prostitution in Atlanta and DeKalb
County.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, thousands of people from rural China have
promised to pay thousands of dollars to smugglers to bring them to
the United States and other countries. They spend years after they
arrive working in conditions of indentured servitude to repay their
debts.
</P>
<P>
   In the early and mid-1990s, smugglers on the way to New York
City brought their cargo through Hartsfield International Airport
in Atlanta, said Peter Kwong, a Hunter College professor and author
of a book on immigrant smuggling. Smugglers who went from China to
Central or South America and then crossed the Mexican border also
caught flights for New York from cities such as Houston and
Atlanta, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta now has a large enough Chinese community to include
underground employment agencies that match smuggled immigrants with
Chinese restaurateurs and other businesspeople looking for cheap
labor, Kwong said. Smugglers, known as ``snakeheads,'' have arrived
in metro Atlanta to make sure the illegal immigrants pay their
debts, said Kwong and Marc Johnson, police chief of Chamblee, one
of the most ethnically diverse cities in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Asian businesspeople in Chamblee say snakeheads tell them to
``hire these people (smuggled from China) or else,'' Johnson said.
The businesspeople, he said, ``don't take them as idle threats'' _
they comply whether or not they need employees, he said, because
they fear violence if they resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question it's going on'' in Georgia, Johnson said.
Aboard a smuggling ship
</P>
<P>
   Experts say thousands of Chinese sneak out of their country each
year and often wind up working in conditions of indentured
servitude to repay typical smuggling fees of $30,000 to $35,000,
costs that are 75 to 88 times higher than the average Chinese
income of $400 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Most passengers come from Fujian, a coastal province of 30
million people in southeastern China with a history of migration,
seafaring and overseas trade. Snakeheads offer hope to people in a
countryside of grinding poverty that benefited at first from
free-market reforms but saw its industrial experiment founder when
foreign investment poured into Fujian's big cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go to the villages and tell them what opportunities
they have in the U.S.,'' said Lani Wong, president of the Georgia
chapter of the National Association of Chinese-Americans. ``They
all think the United States is a golden opportunity. They don't
know that they'll probably end up working in a sweatshop.''
</P>
<P>
   They have been found in recent years in or near California,
Canada, Georgia, Guam, Japan, the Northern Mariana Islands, Midway
Island, New Jersey, New York and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The trips can be deadly. In June 1993, after the decrepit
freighter Golden Venture ran aground in New York Harbor, many of
the 300 Chinese on board leapt into the water to swim to freedom.
Seven drowned or died of hypothermia in a case that focused
national attention on human smuggling. Twenty-two people pleaded
guilty to organizing the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The stowaways on the Prince Nicolas were found beneath a hatch
that was bolted shut and covered with rope behind a locked door in
a part of the ship often filled with water to help it balance.
Three levels of wooden platforms used as bunks extended off
different sides of a ladder descending into the bowels of the ship.
</P>
<P>
   On other ships, investigators found dank living quarters where
stowaways ate meager portions of rice and gruel from bowls nailed
to tables. Federal agents have described opening a secret hatch and
being overcome by the stench of urine, feces and vomit. ``A
shameful practice''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the trips began after 1986, when the U.S.
Congress granted amnesty to illegal aliens who were here before
1982. Organized crime groups linked to the heroin trade saw the
potential for huge profits by smuggling people here and giving them
fake documents so they could receive amnesty and become legal
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants from Fujian ``are often the most ambitious,'' said
David Kyle, a sociologist at the University of California at Davis,
who has written a book on immigrant smuggling. ``They're not the
poorest of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more immigrants from Fujian came to America after a
decision made in the White House a year after the June 4, 1989,
massacre of hundreds of pro-democracy protesters by government
forces in Tiananmen Square, said Jana Mason of the U.S. Committee
for Refugees, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington D.C. She
said an Executive Order signed by President George Bush made it
easier for Chinese immigrants who feared persecution to receive
political asylum. Suddenly Chinese immigrants were citing fear of
forced abortion or sterilization _ the Chinese government limits
married couples to one child _ in requests for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those smuggled to New York City's Chinatown endure
80-hour work weeks and face torture and beatings with stun guns,
lead pipes and claw hammers if they do not repay the smugglers on
time, researchers say. In 1990 and 1991, New York police rescued
three Fujianese men who had been abducted, beaten and burned with
cigarettes for failing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to crack down on immigrant smuggling are hampered, Kyle
and Kwong say, by corruption in China and way stations around the
globe. Last week, the U.S. Embassy in Panama said top Panamanian
officials helped thousands of Chinese sneak into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has taken steps to combat smuggling. In
1993, a few weeks after seven Chinese from the Golden Venture died
within sight of America, President Clinton called immigrant
smuggling a ``major crime problem'' that engaged in ``a shameful
practice of unspeakable ... exploitation.'' He proposed reforms
Congress adopted in 1996, including increasing human-smuggling
sentences from five to 10 years and letting prosecutors target
smugglers with wiretaps and anti-racketeering laws.
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers discover Georgia
</P>
<P>
   Stepped-up American patrols for smuggling ships in the Pacific
have sent many ships through the Atlantic and Caribbean, Kwong
said. And trips by air have replaced sea voyages as the most
popular smuggling method. Flights are more expensive but much safer
for the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent exploitative enterprise in Georgia came to light
on Aug. 17, when federal prosecutors in Atlanta unsealed
indictments accusing 13 people of smuggling Asian girls and women
and forcing them to become prostitutes in Atlanta and DeKalb
County. Prosecutors say snakeheads handed out forged identification
papers and assigned agents known as jockeys to accompany the women
on flights from Asia. Court records say trip organizers often
bought airline tickets in their own names and gave their gate
passes to the women, relying on the inability of airline employees
to distinguish between male and female Asian names.
</P>
<P>
   In the Prince Nicolas case, agents of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service are trying to determine where the stowaways
were going and whether an employer awaited their arrival. The INS
said it might make arrests if it identifies a business waiting for
the Prince Nicolas immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The seven facing charges in the Prince Nicolas case face up to
30 years in prison and fines of $750,000. Four crew members,
including the captain, are charged with transporting, smuggling and
concealing illegal immigrants. Three ``stowaways'' face identical
charges. An affidavit requesting arrest warrants for the three
quotes witnesses who identified them as the ones who boarded the
Prince Nicolas, threatened the captain and ordered him to transport
the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Many Prince Nicolas stowaways not facing charges have requested
political asylum. It could take the government years to resolve
their requests. The INS has jailed them and crew members in metro
Atlanta until officials decide their fate.
</P>
<P>
   Wong, the Chinese activist in Atlanta, said the plight of
Chinese smuggled here is worsened by the fact that they face
deportation if they complain to American authorities because they
are, after all, illegal immigrants. ``They're dependent,'' she
said, ``on the very people who are exploiting them.

NURSE GOES ON TRIAL IN DEATHS OF 7 PATIENTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ind.)   (jw) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A former nurse who was a suspect very early on in a
string of as many as 100 unexplained deaths at an Indiana hospital
went on trial Monday in the killings of seven elderly patients.
</P>
<P>
   Orville Lynn Majors Jr., 38, was a licensed practical nurse at
Vermillion County Hospital in Clinton, Ind., 90 miles west of
Indianapolis. He has pleaded not guilty and has said he is a
scapegoat for shoddy medical practices at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the intense publicity about the case after Majors'
arrest in December 1997, the selection of 12 jurors and 10
alternates began Monday in Peru, 130 miles from the hospital, and
opening statements in the trial are scheduled for Sept. 7 in
Brazil, about 20 miles southeast of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths at the Clinton hospital began shortly after Majors
was hired in 1993. Five months later, another nurse, Marilyn
Alexander, noticed an abnormally high death rate in the intensive
care unit and began to note the deaths on her personal calendar,
according to an affidavit by the Indiana State Police summarizing
the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The next October, a second nurse, Debbie Sollars, told the
nursing supervisor that she was concerned about the death rate. The
same month, a third nurse, Bill Balla, studied the hospital log and
noted a correlation between the deaths and the times when Majors
was on duty.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses said they joked about the number of deaths, the police
said. The nurses on the late shift placed bets on which patient
would die the next day when Majors was working. When he moved to
the weekend shift, the deaths followed.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, 1994, Mary Ann Alderson, 69, was admitted to the
hospital at 10:30 p.m., having suffered chest pains after eating
pizza and drinking beer. It was a Saturday, and after a few hours
in the intensive care unit, she was transferred to a room on the
medical floor. She was sleeping and breathing easily. On Monday
morning, Ms. Alderson was told that she would go home the next day,
according to the police affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Majors was alone with her when he called for
help. Another nurse saw Majors cranking her bed down with his right
hand, while holding a syringe in his left, the police said. An
autopsy showed that she had no significant heart problem, and that
her death was consistent with an injection of potassium.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the director of the intensive care unit studied the
deaths and personnel records. After 24 to 31 deaths each year from
1990 to 1993, 101 patients died in 1994, even though admissions had
not increased.
</P>
<P>
   Majors was on duty when 79 of the deaths occurred in 1994 and
when 20 happened the year before. While Majors was on duty, a death
occurred every 23 hours. When he was not on duty, a death occurred
every 552 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana State Health Department confirmed 153 deaths from
May 1993 to March 1995, most caused by sudden respiratory failure.
Fifteen bodies were exhumed for autopsies. A spokesman for the
Indiana State Police has said that as many as 100 of the deaths
were probably homicides.
</P>
<P>
   The results of their statistical studies were barred from the
trial by Judge Ernest Yelton. Prosecutors said Majors was charged
in the seven deaths in which there was the clearest evidence that
he gave unauthorized injections.
</P>
<P>
   Medical charts showed that the deaths followed two patterns:
changes in the electrocardiogram reading, associated with excessive
potassium in the blood, or a dramatic increase in blood pressure.
The doctors concluded that the patients had been injected with
potassium or epinephrine.
</P>
<P>
   The police found vials of potassium chloride and an empty box of
epinephrine vials at a home that had been abandoned by Majors, and
in a van owned by his parents. As a licensed practical nurse,
Majors could not legally give injections.
</P>
<P>
   Majors denied any involvement, in paid appearances on talk
shows. Recently he has stopped giving interviews. He has operated a
pet shop and a flower shop in his hometown, Linton, an hour south
of the hospital. His nursing license was suspended in 1995 for five
years for giving unauthorized injections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynn would never harm anyone,'' said his mother, Anna Bell
Majors. She said he decided he wanted to work in health care the
day he saw his grandmother die.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital, which suspended Majors in 1995, was fined $80,000
by the State Health Department for negligence and code violations.
It has been renamed and leased to a private company.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not said what motive they see behind the
killings. The police affidavit cites potential witnesses who said
that Majors told them that old people were ``a waste,'' and
referred to patients and their families as ``white trash'' and
``whiners.''

 &HT;    Cox Interactive Media, MP3 to unveil Net radio service
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Everyone's been wondering what Atlanta-based Cox
Interactive Media would do with the large stake it recently bought
in MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in
Orlando, Fla., the companies will announce the birth of
MP3radio.com.
</P>
<P>
   But what in the world is MP3 radio?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine all the Web's best applications rolled up into one and
you might have something that looks a lot like MP3radio.com.
</P>
<P>
   MP3radio.com will offer radio stations a variety of products to
turn their Web sites into major online destinations. In addition to
MP3 downloadable music files, listeners will also be able to buy
tickets and CDs, find out where their favorite artists are playing
and catch up on a variety of related news and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably have a favorite radio station and that station
probably has a Web site,'' says Gregg Lindahl, president and chief
operating officer of MP3radio.com. ``But even if you've been there
once, you probably haven't been back. Radio does realize they must
have the tools to compete on the Internet. The competition on the
Web isn't just radio; it's every Web site out there.''
</P>
<P>
   MP3radio.com, the first joint venture of Cox Interactive Media
and MP3.com, the Web's most popular source of music downloads, news
and information, is designed to capitalize on the strengths of both
companies.
</P>
<P>
   MP3radio.com is part of CIM's $45 million investment in MP3.com.
As part of the deal, MP3.com and CIM agreed to develop new music
sites that would incorporate Cox's portal expertise and MP3 digital
download technology.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Interactive Media is a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, parent
company of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The first 60
affiliated radio stations are all owned by Cox Radio Inc., another
Cox Enterprises subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was expected that Cox and MP3.com would take advantage of
their relationship to expand the Cox radio reach on the Web,'' says
Forrester Research analyst Mark Hardie. ``By tying into MP3.com,
they are tying into the white hot center of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   MP3radio.com will build a series of music portals for its
affiliated stations across the country corresponding to seven radio
formats including alternative, top 40, country, rock and urban.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll provide a network of programming that is relevant to the
music community,'' Lindahl says. ``For example, for a country music
station, we might also provide news about auto racing. Alternative
music stations will include information about local bands and
clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   MP3radio.com will offer affiliated radio stations more than
25,000 MP3 files that are currently available on the MP3.com site.
``The ability to download music from a radio Web site is a way for
radio stations to promote their sites,'' Lindahl says. ``It gives
users something to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forrester's Hardie says the real issue is how to make money
from their Web site traffic. ``There is a crying need for filtering
and editorial. MP3.com is a big flea market and someone has to come
in and create more filtered offerings for radio stations that just
don't have the time. That would be a valuable resource.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, MP3radio.com hopes to offer music downloads from
nationally known hit makers as well as local favorites, but for the
time being the company is still waiting for the music industry to
accept music downloads as an alternative promotion and revenue
stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a music industry relations person who will work
with the artists and the labels to sort these issues out,'' Lindahl
says. As a longtime radio executive, he believes the relationship
between the radio industry and the music industry might help major
labels come around to the idea of MP3.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very symbiotic relationship between radio and the
music industry,'' he says. ``This is just another extention of
reach and branding for radio. It gives stations the ability to bond
with their listeners. I believe artists and record companies will
want to continue to be part of that bonding process.''

FOR HOLBROOKE, A NEW JOB, BUT THE OLD BALKAN DIFFICULTIES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Richard Holbrooke, America's new delegate
to the United Nations, stood at the edge of a mass grave near Stara
Cikatova, 25 miles west of here, up a long and dusty road past
Glogovac, facing the television cameras, struggling a little to
find apt words to say.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 129 bodies have been excavated from three sites near a
quarry. Some Albanians, investigators say, had been marched to the
edge of the quarry cliff, shot and then dumped over, with dead
cattle piled on top of them, and then the whole pile set afire.
</P>
<P>
   It was Holbrooke's first stop in Kosovo, on his first trip here
since the war and his swearing-in last week, at the end of a very
long day and a half that started in New York. He winced, just a
little. After all, he had brought the press and the cameras, who
would have insisted on coming anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The stop itself was the symbol, but his message was predigested
and clear for the cameras: NATO fought the war against the Serbs
for a reason, and the dead must be honored by the peace. Still, at
a place like this, it is not easy to get it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to bear witness,'' he finally said. ``We are not
learning anything here that isn't in previous accounts. But to be
in the physical presence of the events, that's different. To be on
the soil where you know people have died is a powerful event.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are trying to forge a peace, we need to remember what
brought us here,'' he added. ``And this drainage ditch, that had
bodies in it, is a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, finally in place at the United Nations after nearly a
year of congressional problems, was also trying to tell the world
that he was back _ making an effort, as he does, to feed the press
but also to put it to work for him and his message.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, after all, is deeply associated with the region _
with Bosnia and the 1995 Dayton agreement that ended that vicious
war, and with Kosovo, the unfinished business of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   His message, it seemed, was to try to drag the world's
attention, in the quiet days of August, to the complications and
difficulties of creating a lasting peace in Kosovo, and to
emphasize the Clinton administration's commitment to success here.

 &HT;    Parents to get lessons in civility
 &HT;    By Paul Donsky
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They get too rowdy during school sporting events and
sometimes yell or even curse at teachers.
</P>
<P>
   One Georgia school system has decided enough is enough and is
drafting a ``civility policy'' aimed not at students, but at their
parents and other adult visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The policy would ``set conduct for people when they enter the
building,'' Fayette County Superintendent John DeCotis said. It's
not that Fayette has had many problems with disruptive parents, he
said, though ``we have had administrators who have had to contact
police.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia law already allows administrators to remove disruptive
people from school property, and the proposed policy to be
discussed by the Fayette school board Thursday doesn't include any
new punishment. DeCotis said he's hoping that simply telling
parents they ought to behave should do the trick. Fayette
apparently would be the first school system in metro Atlanta to
have a behavior policy that includes parents and other adults.
</P>
<P>
   The policy states that ``district staff should treat parents and
other members of the public with respect and expect the same in
return. ... It is not intended to deprive any person of his or her
right to freedom of expression. In the interest of presenting
teachers, other employees, parents and other adults as positive
role models, the school system encourages positive communication
and discourages volatile, hostile, or aggressive actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Callahan, spokesman for the Professional Association of
Georgia Educators, likes the idea. ``I think it's good that we
remind ourselves that this is a civil society, and (that) students
learn by example.''

 STUDY LINKS TEEN-AGE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND PATERNAL TIES

   WASHINGTON _ Teen-agers who do not get along well with their
fathers are more likely to smoke, drink and use drugs than
youngsters in average two-parent families, according to a national
study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the study found, even teen-agers from one-parent
families, typically headed by mothers, are less at risk from
tobacco, alcohol and drugs than those in two-parent families who
have poor relationships with their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   The study was done by the National Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse at Columbia University and released by Joseph
Califano Jr., the center's president, just as the new school year
was starting.
</P>
<P>
   Califano said at a news conference: ``This should be a wake-up
call for dads across America. Every father should look in a mirror
and ask: `How often do I eat meals with my children? Take them to
religious services? Help with their homework? Attend their games
and extracurricular activities? Join mom in monitoring my teen's
conduct, praising and discipling them?'''
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, ``a child living in a two-parent family,
whose relationship with the father is poor, is 68 percent likelier
to smoke, drink and use drugs than teens living in an average
two-parent household.''
</P>
<P>
   It added that ``a child in a two-parent family with a poor or
fair relationship with the father is at more than 60 percent higher
risk of substance abuse than a child growing up in a home headed by
a single mother who has an excellent relationship with that
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Leshner, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
said that this lesson might be drawn from that finding: ``Bad
parenting is bad. That sounds simplistic, but it is the case. Bad
parenting is worse than no parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on a survey of teen-agers and their parents.
When asked whether they had ever smoked marijuana, 15 percent of
the teen-agers said they had and 85 percent said they had not.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who said they had not, 29 percent said that the person
with the most influence over their decision was their mother and 13
percent said it was their father. The others included friends,
siblings and other adults.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers scored higher than fathers generally in influence over
their children. When asked whose opinions they relied on most, 25
percent of the teen-agers said it was both their parents', but 27
percent said mostly their mothers' and 9 percent mostly their
fathers'.
</P>
<P>
   When asked which parent was easier to talk to about drugs, 57
percent said it was the mother and 26 percent, the father. The
teen-agers reported over all that their relationships with their
mothers was better than with their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   The report issued by Califano, the secretary of health,
education and welfare in the Carter administration, was the fifth
done for the substance abuse center.
</P>
<P>
   It was based on interviews conducted by telephone by the Luntz
Research Cos. from May 8 to June 23. The organization interviewed
at random 2,000 teen-agers and 1,000 parents (including 555
interviews with parents and teen-agers from the same household).
</P>
<P>
   It said the sampling error for the teen-agers was plus or minus
2.2 percentage points while that for the parents was plus or minus
3.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert DuPont, a psychiatrist who served as the first
director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said he did not
know why youngsters would get along better with mothers than
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would want to get both parents involved in stopping their
use of drugs, tobacco and alcohol,'' Dr. Dupont said in an
interview. ``That may raise more conflicts than less, but I would
consider that progress.''
</P>
<P>
   One finding in the study lent support to the recent survey by
the Department of Health and Human Services that found that drug
use by young people had declined from 1997 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia study reported that 44 percent of the teen-agers
said that they attended a drug-free school, compared with 31
percent in 1998. But they still found it easier to buy marijuana
than beer. When asked which was easier for a teen-ager under 18 to
buy, 41 percent said cigarettes, 4 percent said beer and 35 percent
said marijuana.

VENEZUELAN CONGRESS STRIPPED OF ITS LAST REMAINING POWERS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ A constitutional assembly loyal to
President Hugo Chavez stripped the opposition-controlled Congress
of its last remaining powers Monday, taking revenge against
legislators who had pledged to defy a decree last week that
declared a ``legislative emergency'' and gave the assembly
virtually unlimited powers.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly acted after congressional leaders had said, as they
exercised some of their few remaining powers over the weekend, that
they would refuse to authorize any government budget expenditures,
including money for the assembly. They also said they would
withhold the legal permission required for Chavez to leave the
country on two state visits this week.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the constitutional assembly called the threats a
provocation and said they would retaliate unless Congress
retreated.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, 45, a former Army paratrooper who led a failed coup
attempt in 1992, took office in February, saying that he needed a
new constitution to carry out a peaceful social revolution and end
rampant corruption. The constitutional assembly was elected last
month with the mandate to rewrite the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez's critics see his stand as intended to establish a
leftist military dictatorship in this nation of 23 million, which
has in recent years been the principal source of imported oil for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coup d'etat that has been proclaiming itself in slow
motion has taken its final step today,'' said Alberto Franceschi,
one of six opposition representatives in the 131-member assembly.
``The constitutional assembly has assumed all powers in the
country. That is a fact. Those who wanted to radicalize the process
have succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's supporters reject all accusations of a power grab as
ill founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't usurping their powers,'' said Luis Miquilena,
president of the constitutional assembly and one of Chavez's
closest political advisers. ``We are assuming a duty that they have
irresponsibly abandoned (because) the nation will not forgive a
power vacuum.''

MOVIES ABOUT MOVIEMAKING ARE ALL THE RAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You can't get away from the movies these days.
</P>
<P>
   Not even at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Movie-dependent entertainment publications, television shows,
Internet sites and even whole cable networks have proliferated over
the last decade or so. At the same time, general media outlets have
increased film coverage to the point that anyone in Iowa or Maine
can read the weekend grosses in their local newspaper, Roberto
Benigni is considered a great catch for the venerable news show
``60 Minutes,'' and both Time and Newsweek publish simultaneous
cover stories about ``The Blair Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   With movies being hyped at us like never before and from every
corner of the culture, it's no surprise that the people who are
most responsible for the phenomenon are addressing the subject at
an unprecedented rate, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood, over the last number of years, has gotten more and
more filled with itself from seeing more and more programs about
itself,'' observes Albert Brooks, who's made and appeared in
several films about filmmakers (``Real Life,'' ``Modern Romance,''
``I'll Do Anything'') and plays a screenwriter in his latest
comedy, ``The Muse.'' ``You know, Hollywood is the most
self-promoting entity in the history of our planet. First came
`Entertainment Tonight,' then `Access Hollywood,' then the E!
Entertainment network started to get big viewers. The proliferation
of that sort of made Hollywood this pervasive subject that people
can't get out of their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   And the overload of information, not just gossip but a
substantial portion of inside-baseball data that only hard-core
Hollywood types understood just a few years ago, has increased
audiences' show-biz savvy.
</P>
<P>
   This has enabled the current crop of people making films about
films to move beyond the ain't-Hollywood-wacky? approach of earlier
generations and the aren't-movie-people-awful? expose that's
dominated the genre for most of the '90s. Now, they can reference
all kinds of film-world facts and notions with the confidence that
ever-larger audiences will get and appreciate them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, part of ``Notting Hill's'' big international
success was built on the reality blur between the emotionally
flighty, paparazzi-stalked movie star Julia Roberts played and
everyone's knowledge of the actress' real-life tabloid traumas.
``Blair Witch'' became the most profitable cost-to-revenues release
of all time by both convincing much of the market that it was a
true story and creating a brilliant metaphor for a much-reported
subject _ independent filmmakers' fears of disappearing off the
media map.
</P>
<P>
   Even this year's $100 million-grossing, Oscar-winning
``Shakespeare in Love'' is rich in jokes about how today's
Hollywood operates, a factor that surely made it accessible to many
people who would otherwise find its Elizabethan-era setting hard to
relate to.
</P>
<P>
   While both of recently released satires ``Bowfinger'' and ``The
Muse'' lean heavily on stereotypes such as cutthroat executives,
clueless creatives, paranoid superstars and starlets who sleep
their way to the top, they also both presume a deeper understanding
of the Hollywood social order among average filmgoers. And novelist
Bruce Wagner, who directed the just-out-on-video adaptation of his
scathing novel, ``I'm Losing You,'' reworked the screenplay into a
much more humanistic piece about a producer's family's joys and
struggles _ resulting in one of the first Hollywood exposes in
years (last fall's ``Gods and Monsters'' was another) about fully
rounded characters as opposed to dysfunctional icons.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Oz, who directed Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy in the
Martin-scripted ``Bowfinger,'' sees an emerging era of more
realistically detailed films about film people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are in this business for many, many reasons,'' Oz says.
``Some are just making a living, others want the biggest (power
base) in Hollywood, some want to get girls, some want to do art, or
express themselves, or please a certain group of people. There are
tons of reasons why people do things out here, and they're usually
a mix of good and not-so-good.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, movies have always been a glamorous business, and
people have been interested in them _ and those who make them _ for
the better part of a century. And that has made them a worthy, if
only occasional, subject for movies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The early efforts tended to reflect their creators' enthusiasm
about the new medium's potential, although satire and soap opera
became part of the mix relatively quickly. The great silent
slapstick genius Buster Keaton pretty much said all that was
necessary about the movies' capacity for illusion and escape in
``Sherlock, Jr.'' (1924), where he played a projectionist who
entered into the images on the screen (Woody Allen's 1985 ``Purple
Rose of Cairo'' reversed the concept).
</P>
<P>
   Filmgoers in 1932 saw the first version of the venerable,
tragedy-behind-the-tinsel ``A Star Is Born'' formula in ``What
Price Hollywood?'' Preston Sturges paid cockeyed tribute to the
healing power of movie comedy with ``Sullivan's Travels'' (1941);
Billy Wilder explored the dark side of the Hollywood delusion in
the noir classic ``Sunset Blvd.'' (1950); Gene Kelly both lampooned
and celebrated movie magic while ``Singin' in the Rain'' (1952),
and Vincente Minnelli's ``The Bad and the Beautiful'' (1952) and
``Two Weeks in Another Town'' (1962) compellingly looked at flawed
people's struggles to do good work and sustain their careers.
</P>
<P>
   The postwar era also saw the inevitable emergence of the
movie-star biography subgenre, with highly watchable pictures about
Al Jolson (plus a sequel), Lon Chaney and dueling Jean Harlow
melodramas among the most memorable.
</P>
<P>
   The new freedoms in subject matter and form that came about in
the 1960s led to the great European filmmakers Federico Fellini
(``8{''), Ingmar Bergman (``Persona''), Jean-Luc Godard
(`Contempt'') and Francois Truffaut's (``Day for Night'')
distinctively personal works about their art form. Even in the
'80s, when Hollywood turned decisively toward the money end of its
eternal art-or-commerce debate, movies like ``The Stunt Man'' and
``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' still balanced complaints about the
production system with palpable excitement for creative cinema.
</P>
<P>
   But while films about films have always been self-critical to
more or lesser degrees, in the 1990s the genre went almost
completely sour _ even as more movie movies than ever were
produced. The keystone _ and best _ picture on the subject to
emerge this decade was ``The Player'' (1992), a lacerating allegory
of studio amorality that its director, Robert Altman, has since
said was much too gentle.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the folks who made ``Swimming With Sharks,'' ``Barton
Fink,'' ``... And God Spoke,'' ``The New Age,'' ``Living in
Oblivion'' and ``An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn'' _ all
cynical studies of venality, egomania and degeneracy on sets and in
suites _ agreed with Altman. Even the '90s films that acknowledged
moviemaking had its joyous side were ironic comedies like ``Ed
Wood,'' ``Jimmy Hollywood,'' ``Get Shorty'' and the current Brooks
and Martin releases, where the celluloid dreamers were either
talentless, rudderless or otherwise ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Much as the recent spate of movies about television (``Wag the
Dog,'' ``The Truman Show,'' ``Pleasantville,'' ``EDtv'') all riffed
on the same idea of ``real'' people lost in video pseudo-reality,
the films-about-films genre had ossified into a predictable,
mean-spirited formula.
</P>
<P>
   Oz, whose ``Bowfinger'' mixes its barbs with an equally funny
sweetness, blames that development on creative laziness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much easier to do something vicious,'' he says. ``Sweet
and incisive is much more difficult than vicious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Losing You's'' Wagner says the genre's recent sameness was
a result of the wrong careerists putting the cart before the horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it was a kind of shabby chic,'' says Wagner, who
admits his novels are as scabrous as any filmed expose. ``The idea
that you were making some monstrous observation of this town
somehow had cachet for people. Robert Altman is an exception _ he's
a daring and adventurous artist. But these endless shows that are
winking acknowledgments to the business _ that we're all so witty
by examining ourselves, that's just a part of the overall
self-obsessed, narcissistic trend of the culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``If characters captivate you, and they happen to work in the
industry, that's enough,'' Wagner says. ``The idea that I'm going
to write a Hollywood genre piece first and then chase the idea with
characters, that's an absurdity to me.''
</P>
<P>
   As it may well be to the general public. For all their often
smart exposure of film-biz misbehavior _ an approach that
paralleled, interestingly enough, the focus on malfeasance, excess
and outrageousness that marked the rising tide of serious
entertainment journalism through the early and mid-'90s _ the nasty
movie movies weren't nearly as popular as the more forgiving and/or
imaginative entries we've seen in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the overload of movie info, despite its emphasis on hype
and superficiality, has by sheer volume opened audiences' minds to
a wider range of films about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have faith in people coming along,'' Oz says, apropos
to both new filmmakers and audiences with sharper receptors for
their original ideas. ``There's always a fresh, young approach that
comes along that, hopefully, will not be part of a genre but will
spearhead something new.''
</P>
<P>
   And hasn't that really been the most fascinating aspect of the
ever-changing, sometimes even improving medium of movies over the
last 100 years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Art ultimately widens a genre,'' Wagner concludes. ``If you do
make art, everyone benefits, just as when you do things for hollow
reasons, the world gets smaller.'' &QL;

TV SERIES PULL BACK MAGIC CURTAIN ON INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(RUNS WITH HOLLYWOOD-TREND) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Who needed to read Daily Variety, the
entertainment industry's trade newspaper, when there was ``The
Larry Sanders Show''? Garry Shandling's acclaimed HBO series about
the backstage bickering at a late-night talk show took a
ground-breaking view of the back-stabbing particulars of both the
``show'' and the ``business'' of show biz. Shandling routinely
recruited Hollywood players portraying themselves _ or satirical
variations thereof _ to blur the lines between mockery and TV's
surreal reality. It was perhaps the most insightful yet grisly
examination of an industry since Upton Sinclair took on meatpacking
in ``The Jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   Though few viewers may have watched poor Larry, the industry
certainly did, and it took notes. The series has proven to be
remarkably influential, with a number of TV series seeking to
replicate its deft blend of fact and fiction about the
entertainment industry and inviting celebrities to play, even mock,
themselves in fictional settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People _ viewers, readers _ love to get behind the scenes,''
observes Ted Harbert, new president of NBC Studios and executive
producer of ``It's Like, You Know'' _ a sitcom which upped the ante
in the blurring-the-lines sweepstakes by hiring washed-up actress
Jennifer Grey to play washed-up actress Jennifer Grey and make fun
of her nose job, her stalled career and her sex life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reason talk shows work, that's why award shows and
game shows like `Hollywood Squares' work _ because you get to see
the stars being themselves,'' Harbert continues. ``So the idea of a
star playing himself in a fiction sitcom is, I don't want to go so
far as to say irresistible, but you're going to want to check out
what Jennifer Grey says about herself in the show. There isn't much
in the show that hasn't happened to one of us in the entertainment
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, those entertainers are increasingly turning inward to
examine the phenomenon of the fascination they inspire. Such
television series as ABC's ``Sports Night,'' the WB's ``Movie
Stars,'' Showtime's ``Beggars and Choosers'' and Fox's upcoming
provocation, ``Action,'' are placed unabashedly in the world of
entertainment. NBC's ``Frasier'' is a radio star, and a lead
character in ABC's new ``Wasteland'' is a soap opera star.
</P>
<P>
   Some series use other media also populated by the powerful and
glamorous, like magazines in NBC's workplace sitcoms ``Just Shoot
Me'' and ``Suddenly Susan,'' and the world of book publishing in
NBC's impending ``Stark Raving Mad'' and ABC's upcoming ``Then Came
You,'' as entertainment-industry proxies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a number of new shows _ ``Get Real,'' ``Once and
Again,'' ``Malcolm in the Middle'' and ``The Mike O'Malley Show'' _
feature characters who address the camera, as if they're ersatz
celebrities starring in documentaries about their own lives. These
series try to use the prism of the medium itself to reflect a more
``real'' reality, using Hollywood technique to strip away,
allegedly, Hollywood gloss.
</P>
<P>
   It's a canny gambit, as audiences clearly are responding to
entertainments eschewing the usual high production values in favor
of something more immediate and ``real'' seeming. Witness the
success of the film ``The Blair Witch Project,'' or the live,
on-the-fly ABC game show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' or any
of the tabloid-style talk shows, or the endless freeway chases
local TV interrupts all these other programs to present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `Larry Sanders' did to some extent start this,'' says
Peter Lefcourt, executive producer of ``Beggars and Choosers,''
about the travails of the president of programming of a fictional
TV network who contends with temperamental ``artists,'' conniving
fellow executives and demented superiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a taboo. Doing TV about the TV industry, the fear
was demythologizing to some extent _ show people how the sausage is
made, and they're gonna say `This is not magic, this is not
special.' But the industry realized that there's a whole kind of
reservoir of great material that can be done, and how many cop
shows and lawyer shows and medical shows can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   James Widdoes, co-creator and executive producer of ``Movie
Stars,'' says that viewers were interested in all things before and
behind the camera well before ``Sanders'' entered TV's landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ```Entertainment Tonight' started it,'' Widdoes says. ``The
success of that show and everything that came after it _ the
magazines and all that stuff _ that began it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, since the dawn of the medium, TV series have focused
on the entertainment world.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the most legendary of all sitcoms, ``I Love Lucy,''
which often centered on Lucy's aching to get a taste of her
bandleader husband Ricky's stardom and their forays into Hollywood
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   The classic ``The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' about variety series
writer Rob Petrie, has been the benchmark for fond evocations of
the show-biz ethos. Even the most recent TV sitcom phenomenon,
``Seinfeld,'' featured Jerry Seinfeld as a stand-up comedian (and,
therefore, in possession of a lot of free time on his hands to get
into wacky predicaments) who tried for a while to break into TV on
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood certainly is a milieu with which those creating a show
are familiar, and it doesn't entail any tedious research into the
lives and workplaces of teachers, candlestick makers or sanitation
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Following ``Larry Sanders'' lead, series such as ``Sports
Night,'' ``It's Like, You Know,'' ``Movie Stars,'' ``Action'' and
the late ``Lateline,'' all feature celebrities playing themselves
in cameo appearances. Such cameos are often self-deprecating, but,
given the subtext that the participant is in on a joke about him-
or herself that mainstream America will appreciate, they can also
be self-aggrandizing.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mehlman, creator and executive producer of ``It's Like,
You Know,'' credits ``Larry Sanders'' for awakening Hollywood to
the upside of being a good sport by playing a bad sport in a
fictional setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are realizing the benefits of not taking themselves so
seriously,'' he says. ``Everybody takes themselves so seriously out
here. Every quote, every newspaper article's like, you know, the
end of the world. I said to Jennifer, `You're gonna get all this
stuff, with the nose and everything like that; it's all just words.
Have fun with it. It's not going to change who you are or
anything.' People are realizing it doesn't change their lives if
they have fun with themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Thompson, creator of ``Action,'' about a venal action-film
producer, suggests that for creators of these series, showing the
industry's bad behavior for all the world to see can be cathartic
for writers and performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a town about bad behavior _ everything that goes on in
the show is about bad behavior that I've seen, heard of, or
probably participated in,'' Thompson says. ``And the verisimilitude
of that, the reality of that and the funniness of that is what
we're going after.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson adds that his series will concern ``how much of his
soul he has to sell in order to get his film made. Hopefully, we're
playing with all those moral themes _ in this carnivorous world,
how does one survive and keep something about yourself that's human
intact?''
</P>
<P>
   This trend of looking inward also comes at a time when some
creative minds are feeling there's little new to do with the sitcom
format, so a little postmodern, self-reflexive fun can shake it
from its doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a long-standing taboo amongst TV executives _
under no circumstances will we do a show about this industry,''
says Widdoes. ``And we just thought the time is right to see if
some of this inside stuff really works.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read a lot of Philip Roth, and I love the way he blurs
the line between reality and fiction, and that's what I want to
do,'' Mehlman adds. ``To be perfectly honest, I'm trying to avoid
getting bored with this form. I was on `Seinfeld' (as a writer and
executive producer) for seven years, and I'm in great danger of
getting bored doing standard shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether their stories will play to audiences unfamiliar
with how the entertainment industry operates, both Lefcourt and
Thompson, in separate interviews, said essentially the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson: ``If you watch `ER,' you don't have to know how to
bisect a colon to sit there and watch the show and enjoy what's
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lefcourt: ``That's a fight I have every now and then with
Showtime, they say, `Will people understand this inside-baseball
stuff?' and I say, `A guy walks into `ER' and a guy says `We've
gotta bifurcate the artery' _ that isn't common conversation
either, but it plays. &QL; 
``The television business is just faster than most businesses,''
Lefcourt continues. ``The money is crazy; the egos are crazy. But
essentially there is a business there. And anybody who works at a
big insurance company or advertising agency may in fact relate to
some of the paranoia of job security that we deal with here.''
</P>
<P>
   But is this obsession with the world of entertainment _
Hollywood's own, and, particularly, ours _ healthy? Is getting
immersed in the facts of the fantasy factories good for our
self-image, for maintaining a sense of perspective in our own
lives?
</P>
<P>
   Widdoes smiles sheepishly. ``That's a very profound question,''
he says. ``We make things out of whole cloth here, we make
entertainment. Are we curing cancer? No.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses for a moment. ``No,'' he repeats for emphasis. ``I
wish I could do a really smart comedy about the fact that America's
children are getting dumber every year. I can't come up with the
concept. So I have to do shows that afford me he opportunity to
make sure that my kids get the best education (START ITAL)they(END
ITAL) can.'' &QL;

FOR HOLBROOKE, A NEW JOB, BUT THE OLD BALKAN DIFFICULTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Richard Holbrooke, America's new delegate
to the United Nations, stood at the edge of a mass grave near Stara
Cikatova, 25 miles west of here, facing the television cameras,
struggling a little to find apt words to say.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 129 bodies have been excavated from three sites near a
quarry. Some Albanians, investigators say, had been marched to the
edge of the quarry cliff, shot and then dumped over, with dead
cattle piled on top of them, and then the whole pile set alight.
</P>
<P>
   It was Holbrooke's first stop in Kosovo, on his first trip here
since the war and his swearing-in last week, at the end of a very
long day and a half that started in New York. He winced, just a
little. After all, he had brought the press and the cameras, who
would have insisted on coming anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The stop itself was the symbol, but his message was predigested
and clear for the cameras: NATO fought the war against the
Yugoslavs for a reason, and the dead must be honored by the peace.
Still, at a place like this, it is not easy to get it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to bear witness,'' he finally said. ``We are not
learning anything here that isn't in previous accounts. But to be
in the physical presence of the events, that's different. To be on
the soil where you know people have died is a powerful event.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are trying to forge a peace, we need to remember what
brought us here,'' he added. ``And this drainage ditch, that had
bodies in it, is a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, finally in place at the United Nations after nearly a
year of congressional problems, was also trying to tell the world
that he was back _ making an effort, as he does, to feed the press
but also to put it to work for him and his message.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, after all, is deeply associated with the region _
with Bosnia and the 1995 Dayton agreement that ended that vicious
war, and with Kosovo, the unfinished business of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   His message, it seemed, was to try to drag the world's
attention, in the quiet days of August, to the complications and
difficulties of creating a lasting peace in Kosovo, and to
emphasize the Clinton administration's commitment to success here.
</P>
<P>
   He pressed rival Albanian officials _ the Kosovo Liberation Army
leader Hashim Thaci, the longtime political leader Ibrahim Rugova,
the rebel chief of staff Agim Ceku and others less well known _ to
live up to their declarations about democracy and the rule of law,
and to stop using violence and corruption as political tactics.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.N. delegate from the most powerful nation on the
Security Council, Holbrooke tried to give a boost to the officials
of a slightly discouraged and slow-starting U.N. mission in Kosovo,
and to its leader and longtime Holbrooke friend, Bernard Kouchner
of France.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke had at least three meals with Kouchner and six
meetings, and they praised each other at every turn, sometimes at
excruciating length. At one ``press opportunity,'' Holbrooke went
on about Kouchner and all his projects and progeny for some five
minutes, and then, asked by French television to do it again in
French, made a game effort to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar way, Holbrooke, wary of any story about rivalries
at the outset of his job, was careful always to mention President
Clinton and especially Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in
superlative terms, stressing that he came on their behalf and with
their imprimatur, and would report back to them.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the simultaneous visits of important Democratic Sens.
Joseph Biden of Delaware, of the Foreign Relations Committee, and
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, of the Appropriations Committee, the long
Holbrooke visit also seemed part of an administration effort to
insure that Clinton and his chosen heir, Vice President Al Gore,
stay on top of any potential problems from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Monday, for instance, Biden warned Thaci
that ``if the KLA reneges on its commitment to demilitarize on
Sept. 19 _ if the very forces and people we came to help are not
engaged on a path toward democratization _ then support for
continued involvement in Kosovo in the U.S. Congress will disappear
very, very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke tried to mix his cheerleading role with a fact-finding
one. Perhaps most unusually, he spent nearly three full days in
Kosovo, returning to meet key figures more than once _ for
instance, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, the commander of the
peacekeepers _ to get more than the once-over possible on the usual
official visit of a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   It was his eighth visit to Kosovo, Holbrooke said proudly in an
interview. ``I'm not a parachutist,'' he said. ``You don't learn
much from first meetings. It's important to go back and see people
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In private, he pleased most of the U.N. leadership here _ though
he made some others uncomfortable _ when he urged them not to ask
the permission of the infamous U.N. bureaucracy in New York at
every turn. ``Don't ask _ just do it,'' he told them, banging the
table, emphasizing that they should do what was required to solve
problems, whether it was the creation of a bank or of a document
that would allow Kosovo residents to travel; many of them are
without Yugoslav passports, even though Kosovo remains part of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said he thought that the United Nations had learned
lessons from Bosnia, had become organized more quickly in Kosovo
and had a more seamless connection between civilian and military
authority, which was badly divided in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But he also understands the chief, glaring difference with
Bosnia. ``Here the core issue is unresolved, which is the political
status of Kosovo,'' he said. The Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, accepted Bosnia's independence even before the 1995
Dayton agreement that ended the war and that pushed Holbrooke, its
chief negotiator, into the public spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But in Kosovo, the United Nations and the West recognize
Yugoslavia's sovereignty. ``But no Albanian feels that way,''
Holbrooke said. ``And if Milosevic's successor was named Thomas
Jeffersonovic, the Albanians would still want the Serbs out of
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   While Holbrooke deplores the exodus of Serbs and Gypsies from
Kosovo _ no more than 25,000 to 30,000 remain from a prewar total
of about 180,000 _ there is a degree of lip service paid. ``It was
inevitable that the Albanians would drive many of the Serbs out,''
he said. ``I always felt that there was no chance that Serbs and
Albanians could live together peacefully without a security
force.''
</P>
<P>
   But a multi-ethnic Kosovo must be pursued, although it will take
time, Holbrooke said. He recalled telling Milosevic on March 23,
just before NATO began bombing Yugoslavia, that the Yugoslav leader
was the ``best recruiting poster for the KLA,'' and ``if he keeps
this up, every Serb will be driven out of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic answered with great intensity, Holbrooke recounted,
saying, ``If there are no Serbs left in Kosovo, it will still be
Serbia.'' Holbrooke paused. ``It's no joke,'' he said. ``It's still
unresolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the postwar struggle for a multi-ethnic democracy is a
crucial test for the Albanians and their divided leadership,
Holbrooke said. His biggest worry leaving here, he said, is
Albanian political cohesiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so used to keying all their behavior off Serbian
repression that they don't know what to do with their freedom,'' he
said. ``Are we seeing the flowering of early democracy here, or
chaos?''

 &HT;    Bush spared questioning in lawsuit
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush will not have to answer
questions in a lawsuit against the Texas Funeral Service Commission
and Service Corporation International, the world's largest funeral
service company, a Travis County judge decided Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeatedly has said he knows nothing about a 1998 funeral
commission investigation of SCI nor a dispute that arose from it
that led to the lawsuit, which has drawn national attention because
of Bush's front-running presidential status.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling is an important one for Governor Bush and for
future governors because it essentially says that the governor
should not be used to generate publicity for lawsuits in which he
is not involved,'' said Bush spokesman Ray Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been accused of showing favoritism to SCI founder and
chief executive Robert Waltrip, who is a longtime Bush family
supporter. Bush has called the lawsuit ``frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   Former funeral commission director Eliza May, who sued the
agency and company after being fired in February, has argued that
SCI and Bush's office worked together to interfere with the
investigation and her job. May claims she was fired for complaining
about that interference. On Monday, her attorney called Bush a
co-conspirator in the effort, though he is not a defendant in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John Cornyn, who argued on Bush's behalf,
called the accusation reckless innuendo that was not supported by
any evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it's baseless,'' Cornyn said, adding that the claim
likely is related to Bush's bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's attorneys, citing statements from the eight funeral
service commissioners who voted to fire May, said the former
director was dismissed for a variety of legitimate reasons,
including a lack of confidence in her leadership. Each of the
commissioners said their decision was made independently of the
governor's office and SCI.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling that Bush doesn't have to give a deposition, District
Judge John Dietz said May's attorneys did not prove that the
governor has any knowledge of the investigation or her firing. He
also said that any information the governor might have can be
obtained from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of what has been alleged ... was witnessed by others,''
Dietz said.
</P>
<P>
   Dietz also rejected the idea that May's attorneys have a right
to question Bush because he filed what they call a false statement
in the case. They said Bush has knowledge of the investigation and
his office's interference partly because of a quote from SCI
attorney Johnnie B. Rogers in Newsweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The publication quoted Rogers as saying that during a 1998 visit
with aides at Bush's office, the governor stopped by and asked
Waltrip, ``Are those people still messing with you?''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers on Monday denied the quote, said he didn't remember what
he told the magazine, but then added that he was certain he didn't
say ``those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said SCI wasn't seeking Bush's help to end the
investigation but was complaining about the hostile way the
investigation was being conducted.
</P>
<P>
   According to May's lawsuit, top Bush aides threatened to take
away the investigation if it was not quickly resolved. She also
said the aides tried to intimidate and harass her.
</P>
<P>
   May said the threats came at Bush's request. And her attorneys
argued that Bush has denied only that he has no personal knowledge
of the investigation, but has not addressed what, if any,
conversations he had with his staff about it.
</P>
<P>
   May's attorneys said they had not decided whether to appeal
Dietz's ruling, but will move forward with questioning other people
in the case, including former Bush aide Joe Albaugh, now the
manager for Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's office says no one from the office threatened or
intimidated May.
</P>
<P>
   May's investigation resulted in fines of $445,000 against SCI.
Among other things, the commission said SCI used unlicensed
embalmers to conduct services at unlicensed locations.
</P>
<P>
   SCI officials say the commission misinterpreted the law and
Cornyn has issued a legal opinion that SCI has used to support that
claim.
</P>
<P>
   Dietz didn't consider arguments over May's request to hold Bush
in contempt for filing his affidavit, which she says is false. Her
attorneys said they will pursue that motion, but Cornyn said
there's nothing to prove Bush did not tell the truth.

ARCO SHAREHOLDERS OK SALE TO BP AMOCO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Arco shareholders voted overwhelmingly to approve
a $36 billion sale to British petroleum giant BP Amoco on Monday,
but several key questions remain about the merger's effect on
Arco's Los Angeles headquarters and the company's 3,000 employees
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In a special vote at the Los Angeles Downtown Marriott hotel,
more than 97 percent of Arco shareholders in attendance approved
the transaction. In all, 75 percent of total shareholders approved
the sale of Atlantic Richfield Co.The merger still needs the
approval of U.S. and European Union regulators and the shareholders
of BP Amoco. Company officials expect it to close by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Mike Bowlin, Arco's chairman and chief executive
officer, offered few specifics on what the transaction means for
the company's employees, its charitable activities and its downtown
Los Angeles headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Bowlin said as many as 2,000 workers may be laid off companywide
_ an estimate that some analysts said was too few _ but he did not
say where those cuts would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize the anxiety and uncertaintly this causes,''
Bowlin said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Angeles area, a ``good portion'' of the approximately
700 workers in the company's corporate and related offices are
likely to face layoffs, said Arco spokeswoman Marylou Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   Bowlin also said London-based BP Amoco would maintain a presence
at the Arco Center, but it was unclear how large that presence
would be.
</P>
<P>
   And although he assured shareholders that BP Amoco has committed
to continue Arco's longtime support of charitable causes, Bowlin
said the details of future giving are up to Arco's new parent
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's got to be discussed and announced by BP Amoco,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arco, the eighth-largest U.S. oil company, donated about $14
million to charity last year, according to the company. About 30
percent of that money went to the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   Arco's top employees will not have to wait for details of their
severence packages, though.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company's latest proxy statement to
shareholders, the merger will trigger lucrative pay-out packages
for many outgoing employees.
</P>
<P>
   Bowlin, a 31-year Arco employee, will receive over $27.5
million. Company President Michael Wiley and Chief Financial
Officer Marie Knowles will each receive over $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the company's top five officers will receive over $63
million, according to the proxy statement.
</P>
<P>
   As proposed, the merger would give Arco shareholders 0.82 shares
of BP Amoco American depository shares for each share of Arco. BP
would also assume about $7 billion in Arco debt.
</P>
<P>
   BP shareholders will vote on the deal Wednesday in London.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the proposed merger will give BP Amoco a step up in
an oil industry that has been consolidating rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have a completely new ball game,'' said Fadel Gheit, a
senior analyst with Fahnestock and Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bowlin acknowledged the market's current merger imperative
Monday, telling shareholders that ``bigger is better in today's oil
and gas industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder and former Arco employee Robert Chambers said Arco
veterans, including its thousands of retirees, will miss the
venerable firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have a lot of people that feel sad,'' Chambers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But life changes,'' he added, ``and certainly the economy
changes.''

 &HT;    Gingrich supports politicians' privacy
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newt Gingrich says attacks on politicians' private
lives have no place in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-part interview about his career in Congress that
begins tonight on C-SPAN, Gingrich distinguishes between properly
criticizing President Clinton for lying to a federal grand jury and
inappropriately chastizing him for his personal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first place, nobody is a saint. I mean, if you believe
in God, by definition you believe nobody is a saint. So the most
religious of people should have the deepest understanding that
you're not going to elect saints, you're going to elect a sinner,
and hopefully, you elect a sinner who prays, a sinner who is
self-aware, a sinner who is responsible,'' Gingrich tells
interviewer Brian Lamb.
</P>
<P>
   The interview took place July 30, the day after Gingrich, 56,
filed for divorce from his wife, Marianne Gingrich, but before
reports surfaced that the former House speaker is involved in a
longstanding relationship with congressional aide Callista Bisek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marianne is a wonderful person, and a very smart person, and
we've had a very long and complex relationship,'' Gingrich says.
</P>
<P>
   Of their break-up, he says, ``I think there is a cumulative
weight of the years that is debilitating.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich says he and Clinton talked about their ethical and
personal battles, discussions he called ``painful.''
</P>
<P>
   He says Clinton will be remembered for squandering his talent.
``People will look back at what a tragedy it was that he had so
much talent and did so little good,'' Gingrich says.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting his 20 years in Congress, Gingrich says he and Henry
Clay, a Kentuckian who served early in the 19th century, stand as
the most powerful speakers in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not a presider, I was the leader. And I think Henry
Clay's probably the only other speaker to have been a national
leader and speaker of the House simultaneously,'' Gingrich says.
</P>
<P>
   In his earlier years in Congress, he likens himself to the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. and other leaders of minority groups who had
to fight aggressively to be heard. He also describes himself as a
football coach who, after leading his team to the top, was too
battered to continue.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich says it was worth it to be the focal point of
Democratic criticism because his Republican majority balanced the
budget, cut taxes and reformed welfare. ``And if the price I had to
pay personally was to be demonized by the left ... sometimes you do
that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One area that was a frequent source of Democratic fury was
Gingrich's ethics. He agreed to a $300,000 fine in 1997 for
violating House ethics rules in connection with the financing of
the college course he taught in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Gingrich says repeatedly that he has since
been exonerated by the Internal Revenue Service. But tax law
specialists have said that two IRS rulings this year sent
conflicting messages about Gingrich's situation.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the former speaker says he has no regrets about
leaving Congress this year. He stepped down after some Republicans
threatened to block his re-election as speaker following unexpected
GOP losses in the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   He is now involved in several business ventures, including
speeches for up to $50,000 each, a new consulting company, and
positions on corporate boards and at think tanks.
</P>
<P>
   He periodically visits both Georgia Tech and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention to hear the views of experts in the
fields of high technology and public health.
</P>
<P>
   While Gingrich says he does not expect to seek office again, he
also does not rule it out.

 &HT;    FAIRFAX COUNTY RIDES HIGH-TECH BOOM TO RICHES _ AND SPRAWL
 &HT;    With TECH-FAIRFAX-DATA.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Sept. 5.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERNDON, Va. _ The pastures and orchards that not long ago
produced a wealth of food here are sprouting a new bounty now:
high-tech jobs, stock options, luxury subdivisions and cars, cars,
cars.
</P>
<P>
   All over the rolling parcels of green in formerly rural Fairfax
County west of Washington, entrepreneurs are raising the heavily
wired, glass-encased office buildings that will contain the
industrial base for the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   Working inside them are the Internet, telecom and software
executives and technicians who have helped boost Fairfax's median
household income to $87,569 _ the highest in the nation, according
to the market research firm Claritas Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity has its price. Like other high-tech hotbeds,
including Atlanta, Austin and Dallas, Fairfax County residents are
suffering from the aggravating side effects of rapid growth:
crowded schools, underdeveloped mass transit systems, skyrocketing
housing prices and the loss of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Residents complain bitterly about traffic snarls. But their
complaining is often done while sitting in BMWs, talking on sleek
cell phones. ``It's hard to complain too much,'' said Gerald
Gordon, president of the Fairfax County Economic Development
Authority, ``because what we suffer from is our affluence.''
</P>
<P>
   How this once-bucolic community figured out the future, and then
made a fortune from it, is a lesson in the value of post-urban
infrastructure. Instead of building roads, bridges and sewers to
attract new jobs, Fairfax County led in the laying of fat pipes for
computerized data.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Fairfax's advanced wiring, about two-thirds of all
Internet traffic in the world passes within a few miles of
Washington Dulles International Airport on the county's western
edge. By being able to move both data and air passengers quickly,
Fairfax is selling itself as a key port in the global economy.
Atlanta and Denver have similar strategies, but Fairfax also has
proximity to power, with the nation's capital just across the
Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   Moving into the next century, the question facing Fairfax
residents is: Will this wiry infrastructure, bustling airport and
tight link to Washington keep the wealth growing? Or will
increasing quality-of-life problems and competition from other
cities cause high-tech businesses to pull out as fast as they built
up?
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, Fairfax has seen nothing but growth. Before
World War II, Fairfax was a quiet Southern county with just 41,000
people thinly spread over rural acreage. But as the Pentagon
staffed up in the 1940s, Fairfax became a bedroom suburb of
Arlington, Va., and Washington. By 1950, its population was
106,000. Just a decade later, it was 272,000.
</P>
<P>
   For all the growth, Fairfax remained primarily residential and
rural, with lots of tall oaks but relatively few jobs. In the
mid-1970s, the county was still the state's leading producer of
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Though few realized it then, the seeds of Fairfax's 1990s
affluence were being planted in government computers. The Pentagon
was sponsoring the creation of Arpanet, the precursor of today's
Internet. Many of the engineers working for the government later
became founding fathers of the county's Internet giants, such as
UUNET Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other parts of the government were building
Washington Dulles, an airport whose value was not fully realized
until after the deregulation of airlines in the late 1970s and the
boom in travel in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just air service that Dulles provided. Planners
also put a wide road through the middle of the county to connect
air travelers to Washington. Today, the Dulles Toll Road is the
main artery running through the heart of Fairfax County.
</P>
<P>
   With a pleasant climate, good air service, proximity to
Washington and a highly educated work force, Fairfax began to
market itself to entrepreneurs in the 1980s as a great place to
create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And telecommunications companies started seeing Fairfax County
as a promised land, a place with lots of wires and computer
engineers, and all within miles of Capitol Hill. Having quick
access to Congress was important to telecom businesses lobbying for
fewer regulations. Satellite companies also settled into the area
because of their need to get government authorization for projects.
</P>
<P>
   Being near the federal government helps, too, when start-ups are
seeking contracts for work. The original Commerce Department
contract for registering Internet addresses gave rise to Network
Solutions Inc., now an e-commerce powerhouse in Fairfax.
</P>
<P>
   With Washington on one side, Dulles on the other, and lots of
brains and wires in the middle, Fairfax County boomed in the 1990s.
Contractors worked frantically to construct the office parks that
could contain the wildly growing work forces at companies such as
America Online, PSI Net Inc., Oracle Corp. and about 2,500 other
technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, roughly 130,000 people have moved into the
county and 20 million square feet of office space have been added.
The affluence level has rocketed up, with ``executive-style
living'' subdivisions covering former farmlands with swimming pools
and tennis courts. Pricey malls serve as town centers of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   While a few small towns are located within the county, such as
Herndon and Vienna, Fairfax is overwhelmingly defined by its lack
of urban-ness. It is a land of sprawling subdivisions, sprawling
office parks and sprawling malls.
</P>
<P>
   And cars.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington has an elaborate Metro rail system, the mass
transit system has barely penetrated Fairfax County. Seemingly
every day, local newspapers run another story about the political
battles over transportation in Northern Virginia. Everyone agrees
something must be done. The agreement stops there.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Economic Development Authority and Chamber of
Commerce continue to seek growth in the high-tech area and display
scant interest in diversifying the economy. Given the astonishing
growth in wealth that they have seen in the Internet and telecom
businesses, one could scarcely blame them for not trying to recruit
a tire factory or meat-packing plant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, seeing so many economic eggs in one high-tech basket is
some cause for concern. ``The pessimist in all of us might wonder
if it can last,'' said Tony Howard, a spokesman for county Chamber
of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   While he is abashed by the growth, Howard says the future is
bright because most of the numerous office buildings dotting the
county are generic boxes with parking decks. When one hotshot
company goes bankrupt, another company can take its space.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing unique about their buildings,'' Howard said of
the high-tech companies. ``The shell of a building is something we
would be able to make use of'' in marketing Fairfax to other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its fantastic successes, Fairfax still has some
deficiencies as a high-tech mecca.
</P>
<P>
   For one, it has no first-tier technology research university
comparable to Atlanta's Georgia Tech or Austin's University of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Second, venture-capital funding still lags well behind the
big-money magnets of Silicon Valley and New England.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Fairfax County has a new problem: too much success. One
of the reasons so many high-tech companies chose Fairfax was its
high quality of life. Company owners were able to lure young
workers by pointing out the area's relatively low cost of living,
low taxes, great schools and physical beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Now home prices are rising, schools are jammed and roads are
clogged. Shopping centers have replaced the barns and fields that
once added such charm to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Will these growing pains lead to a letdown for Fairfax in the
new century?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can predict what will come next,'' Howard said. But for
now, people are still voting with their feet, running into Fairfax
at a blistering pace. ``These are really some of the best jobs in
the country,'' he said. ``And they will continue to attract the
most motivated citizens.''

 &HT;    FAIRFAX COUNTY RIDES HIGH-TECH BOOM TO RICHES _ AND SPRAWL
 &HT;    With TECH-FAIRFAX-DATA.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Sept. 5.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HERNDON, Va. _ The pastures and orchards that not long ago
produced a wealth of food here are sprouting a new bounty now:
high-tech jobs, stock options, luxury subdivisions and cars, cars,
cars.
</P>
<P>
   All over the rolling parcels of green in formerly rural Fairfax
County west of Washington, entrepreneurs are raising the heavily
wired, glass-encased office buildings that will contain the
industrial base for the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   Working inside them are the Internet, telecom and software
executives and technicians who have helped boost Fairfax's median
household income to $87,569 _ the highest in the nation, according
to the market research firm Claritas Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity has its price. Like other high-tech hotbeds,
including Atlanta, Austin and Dallas, Fairfax County residents are
suffering from the aggravating side effects of rapid growth:
crowded schools, underdeveloped mass transit systems, skyrocketing
housing prices and the loss of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Residents complain bitterly about traffic snarls. But their
complaining is often done while sitting in BMWs, talking on sleek
cell phones. ``It's hard to complain too much,'' said Gerald
Gordon, president of the Fairfax County Economic Development
Authority, ``because what we suffer from is our affluence.''
</P>
<P>
   How this once-bucolic community figured out the future, and then
made a fortune from it, is a lesson in the value of post-urban
infrastructure. Instead of building roads, bridges and sewers to
attract new jobs, Fairfax County led in the laying of fat pipes for
computerized data.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Fairfax's advanced wiring, about two-thirds of all
Internet traffic in the world passes within a few miles of
Washington Dulles International Airport on the county's western
edge. By being able to move both data and air passengers quickly,
Fairfax is selling itself as a key port in the global economy.
Atlanta and Denver have similar strategies, but Fairfax also has
proximity to power, with the nation's capital just across the
Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   Moving into the next century, the question facing Fairfax
residents is: Will this wiry infrastructure, bustling airport and
tight link to Washington keep the wealth growing? Or will
increasing quality-of-life problems and competition from other
cities cause high-tech businesses to pull out as fast as they built
up?
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, Fairfax has seen nothing but growth. Before
World War II, Fairfax was a quiet Southern county with just 41,000

AT&AMP;T LOWERS LONG-DISTANCE RATES, JOINS PRICE WAR

 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. introduced lower long-distance rates Monday,
reluctantly joining a price war that is bringing bargains for
consumers but threatens to cut into phone companies' profits.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan, which has a $5.95 monthly fee, offers calls at 7
cents a minute any time. That represents a 30 percent cut in the
per-minute rate from AT&AMP;T's previous main offering, 10 cents a
minute with a $4.95 monthly fee. Customers must request the new
plan, otherwise they will remain with their older, more expensive
ones.
</P>
<P>
   The move by AT&AMP;T, the biggest long-distance company, comes after
its top two rivals, MCI Worldcom and Sprint, introduced plans in
recent weeks offering calls for 5 cents a minute on evenings and
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be responsive to the pricing pressures,'' said
Eugene Lockhart, president of AT&AMP;T consumer services. ``We believe
this offer represents a real opportunity to gain'' market share.
AT&AMP;T's share of the $41 billion consumer long-distance market is 50
percent but declined slightly this year as it has ever since long
distance was deregulated in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Driving much of the price war is that the cost of providing
long-distance calls continues to drop. The biggest cost are the
fees that long-distance carriers pay to local phone companies on
both ends of the call. These fees, which vary by state, average 3
to 4 cents a minute. But the Federal Communications Commission has
been moving to reduce them slowly and ordered a 4.5 percent
reduction that took effect in July.
</P>
<P>
   Even with lower costs, though, the declining prices could cut
into profits. ``On average, we are seeing our revenue on the newer
plans equal to or higher than the previous plans,'' said Len Lauer,
the president of Sprint's consumer long-distance unit. ``Our
margins may be a little squeezed for customers who make a lot of
calls at the 5-cent-a-minute rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of moving voices from one end of the country to the
other is very small, so the biggest other costs are billing,
customer service and marketing. That is why AT&AMP;T and the other
companies are eager to find programs that will pack more services
in a single bill and keep customers from switching plans every time
a new deal hits the market place.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, AT&AMP;T's new aggressive price cuts represent at least
a temporary retreat from its plan to integrate long-distance
service, with highly visible rates, into more complicated bundles
of telecommunication services that include calling cards and
wireless phones. Eventually, AT&AMP;T hopes to offer packages that also
incorporate local telephone service and cable television, now that
it has bought Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable
company. To the extent that the new long-distance plan slows AT&AMP;T's
losses in long-distance market share, it will preserve more
customers to which it can sell other services.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, AT&AMP;T's first attempt at such a bundle, the AT&AMP;T
Personal Network, has attracted a disappointing 350,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint and MCI have gone back to the tried and true method of
acquiring customers: heavy price competition,'' said Brian Adamik,
a senior vice president of the Yankee Group, a consulting firm in
Boston. ``AT&AMP;T had tried to move away from that, but it has been
forced to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said Monday that its new plan would accelerate the decline
in its consumer long-distance revenue. It now expects that revenue
to fall 4 percent to 5 percent this year, instead of the 2 percent
to 4 percent drop it had previously forecast. But it said its sales
are somewhat better than expected for wireless telephones, data and
other services, so that on balance its revenue and profits will
meet its previously announced goals. AT&AMP;T's stock nonetheless fell
$1.50 a share, or 3 percent, to $46. Sprint and MCI shares fell as
well.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the new plans offered by the top three
long-distance carriers ``are pretty comparable,'' said Rex
Mitchell, an analyst with Banc of America Securities. ``If you make
a lot of calls before 7 p.m., you're better off on the AT&AMP;T plan.
If you have the discretion to move most of your calls to the
evening and weekend, the best thing is the MCI plan.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   MCI's new plan charges 25 cents a minute during the day if
customers pay a $1.95 fee a month or 10 cents a minute with a fee
of $5.95 a month. Sprint's plan is also 10 cents a minute during
the day with a $5.95 monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is also offering several variations on its basic plan. It
will cut the monthly fee to $4.95 for customers who choose AT&AMP;T to
handle their local toll calls or who receive their bill over the
Internet rather than by mail. And it will waive the fee entirely
for customers who sign up for a new plan meant for households with
more than one cellular phone. Business customers negotiate their
own rates, but prices have been falling in that market, too.
</P>
<P>
   While consumers pay close attention to prices for state-to-state
long distance calls, they often overlook rates for international
calls, directory assistance and calling cards, each of which is
more profitable for the long-distance companies. Moreover, lower
prices are encouraging customers to make more calls.
</P>
<P>
   While MCI and Sprint have been gaining market share at AT&AMP;T's
expense, the fastest growing segment of the market has been the
hundreds of small companies that collectively split the 10 percent
of the market not controlled by the big three. These include a host
of aggressive upstarts, like Qwest Communications International and
``dial-around'' services that allow people to choose a different
long-distance carrier for each call by dialing a code beginning
with 10-10. These dial-around providers, which include AT&AMP;T and MCI
operating under different names, have been promoting complex
pricing schemes, such as a flat rate of 99 cents for calls of up to
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers told us that with all the froth that is out there
now, they are not sure what they are getting anymore,'' Lockhart
said. ``We wanted to offer two real things: simplicity and value.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T first tried this strategy in 1996 with a 15-cent-a-minute
One Rate plan and later the One Rate Plus plan at 10 cents a minute
and a $4.95 a month fee. More recently, the company offered more
complex plans, such as one with a 5-cent rate on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   The overall long-distance revenue of AT&AMP;T and the other
long-distance companies doesn't fall as quickly as the prices on
the heavily promoted plans because existing customers have to
request the new lower rates. Indeed, some 20 percent of AT&AMP;T
customers don't have any calling plan and still pay the old much
higher rates, which can be as high as 25 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is not giving up on its effort at creating complex packages
of telecommunications services. Monday, it also introduced a
``Family Plan'' meant for families in which more than one member
has an AT&AMP;T wireless phone. The plan allows each of the wireless
phones to have unlimited calling to each other and to the family's
home telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The first family member must choose between a $49.99 plan that
includes 400 minutes of nonfamily calls and a $69.99 600 minute
plan. Up to four more family members can choose among those plans
and a $24.99, 60-minute plan. Additional minutes are 35 cents each.
Long distance is 15 cents a minute. And calls made outside of the
local area are 69 cents a minute. This plan is available in New
York and the other markets served by AT&AMP;T's wireless unit.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T says that this will be particularly popular with families
that want to keep track of their teen-age children.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our research shows that people want more ways to stay in
touch with their family members,'' Lockhart said.

 &HT;    Beefed-up Bulldogs: Linebackers eager to meet expectations
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ On average, they are 6 feet, 1 1/2 inches tall.
They weigh 225 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   They are ``the kinds of guys Florida and Tennessee are winning
with,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them will be NFL first-round draft picks, South Florida
coach Jim Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   They are the Bulldogs' linebackers _ perhaps one of the best
group of linebackers in the nation. They are eight strong, and they
are a big reason many people think Georgia this season will field
its best defense of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like Boss Bailey and Will Witherspoon and Kendrell Bell,
with that type of size and speed, just don't come along often,''
Donnan said. ``Not all at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The reverberations of Georgia's linebacking talent have been
felt as far away as Tampa, Fla., and Harrisonburg, Va. Redshirt
freshman Kawika Mitchell and senior Mike Luckie, two pretty good
players caught in a logjam at the position, transferred to Division
I-AA schools in those cities during the summer to get playing time.
Mitchell went to South Florida, Luckie to James Madison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like this,'' Leavitt said. ``Georgia has some first-round
draft picks in that linebacking group.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Kawika couldn't play in the NFL someday, but
he may be a third-round pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia didn't want the 6-foot-2, 235-pound Mitchell to leave.
He was listed as No. 2 strong-side linebacker for this fall. But he
was behind Bailey, a sophomore and one of those future
first-rounders to whom Leavitt referred.
</P>
<P>
   And there wasn't another linebacker position for Mitchell to
play. At the other two spots are All-America candidate Orantes
Grant, a senior, and Witherspoon, a sophomore and prospective
first-rounder. With junior-college transfer Bell and former
Washington County star Jessie Miller joining the ranks this summer,
Mitchell read the writing on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The stockpile of blue-chip linebackers is part of Donnan's
recruiting philosophy aimed to re-establish Georgia as one of the
top programs in the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we've put a premium on in recruiting _
getting the linebackers and the so-called defensive-end types,''
Donnan said. ``We've been fortunate to get a few good ones
lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's most profound statement about the linebacking corps
came in the spring when junior Adrian Hollingshed and senior Dustin
Luckie were moved from middle and strong-side linebacker,
respectively, to defensive end. Both started every game last
season, and Hollingshed was third on the team with 93 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs had two reasons for the move. They wanted to
improve their speed and athleticism at end, and Bailey and
Witherspoon had exhibited such skill and play-making ability in
practice that Georgia no longer could afford to use them part-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed's the first thing you think of,'' linebackers coach Brad
Lambert said. ``We want to get the best 11 players on the field,
and we felt like this move helped increase our team speed. With the
depth we had, we had the luxury of moving some people around.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys bring athleticism to the table, and they should be
able to create big plays,'' Lambert said. ``That's the bottom
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has since moved Hollingshed, who was unhappy at end,
back to middle linebacker, further enhancing its depth there. He
remains behind Witherspoon and is listed with Bell on the second
team. But Lambert stresses that all the linebackers will play.
</P>
<P>
   The linebackers take pride in their reputation. But they also
know that they have not accomplished anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt, it is the best (linebacker) corps we've had here, in
terms of talent and potential. On paper, we're dynamite,'' Grant
said. ``But we'd like to be considered one of the best units in the
conference at the end of the season. Right now it doesn't mean
anything. Anybody can say they have a great linebacker corps, but
if you don't do it on the field, you haven't done anything.

VENEZUELAN CONGRESS STRIPPED OF ITS LAST REMAINING POWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ A Constitutional Assembly loyal to
President Hugo Chavez stripped the opposition-controlled Congress
of its last remaining powers Monday, taking revenge against
legislators who had pledged to defy a decree last week that
declared a ``legislative emergency'' and gave the assembly
virtually unlimited powers.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly acted after congressional leaders had said, as they
exercised some of their few remaining powers over the weekend, that
they would refuse to authorize any government budget expenditures,
including money for the assembly. They also said they would
withhold the legal permission required for Chavez to leave the
country on two state visits this week.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Constitutional Assembly called the threats a
provocation and said they would retaliate unless Congress
retreated.
</P>
<P>
   Although the expansion of the ``legislative emergency'' decree
Monday does not formally dissolve the Senate and Chamber of
Deputies, its effect is the same. All of Congress' responsibilities
and powers have now been transferred to the Constitutional
Assembly, which was elected last month with the mandate to rewrite
the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators are explicitly prohibited from holding official
meetings of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, 45, a former Army paratrooper who led a failed coup
attempt in 1992, took office in February, saying that he needed a
new constitution to carry out a peaceful social revolution and end
rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But his critics see that stand as intended to establish a
leftist military dictatorship in this nation of 23 million, which
has in recent years been the principal source of imported oil for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coup d'etat that has been proclaiming itself in slow
motion has taken its final step Monday,'' said Alberto Franceschi,
one of six opposition representatives in the 131-member assembly.
``The Constitutional Assembly has assumed all powers in the
country. That is a fact. Those who wanted to radicalize the process
have succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   After convening this month for the first time, the assembly also
declared a ``judicial emergency,'' granting itself the power to
dismiss judges and overhaul the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much more power do you want?'' Franceschi, a member of the
center-right Proyecto Venezuela Party, asked Chavez's supporters.
Sarcastically, he warned directors of condominium boards to be
alert to the possibility that the assembly might also try to take
over their functions.
</P>
<P>
   As the constitutional crisis deepens, leaders of other Latin
American countries have also begun to express concerns. In a visit
to neighboring Colombia over the weekend, President Eduardo Frei of
Chile said, ``In my judgment, if there are not three branches of
government functioning legitimately, the rule of law is broken, and
that for me is not a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's supporters reject all accusations of a power grab as
ill founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here there will be nothing but democracy,'' said Luis
Miquilena, president of the Constitutional Assembly and one of
Chavez's closest political advisers. ``The idea of a dictatorship
is light-years from our reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't usurping their powers,'' Miquilena said Monday when
asked about broadening the decree against Congress. ``We are
assuming a duty that they have irresponsibly abandoned,'' because
``the nation will not forgive a power vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   The assembly is widely expected to consider another move this
week against a branch of government, handing down a decree that
would declare a state of ``executive emergency'' and allow the
panel to dismiss the governors of the 23 states and hundreds of
mayors.
</P>
<P>
   A special committee appointed by the assembly would then screen
state and local officials, replacing those who fail the inquiry
with ``regional governing councils composed of three or five
members who enjoy high prestige and honor.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some members of the assembly have suggested moving
to take control the largest labor union. On Sunday, in his weekly
radio program, Chavez suggested that he was contemplating similar
action against the police if they obeyed the instructions of local
officials who are members of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can intervene in any police force in any municipality,
because we are not going to permit any tumult or uproar,'' he said.
``Order has arrived in Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Constitutional Assembly prepared to vote Monday on the
decree, the speaker of the lower house of Congress, Henrique
Capriles, filed a petition with the Supreme Court, asking for a
ruling on the legality of the assembly's original ``legislative
emergency'' decree, adopted last Wednesday. He argued that ``in
Venezuela, no organ exists above the constitution,'' but conceded
that the court, now in recess, might decide against him.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Supreme Court ruled, 8-6, that the Constitutional
Assembly did indeed have the authority to seize the judicial system
under its ``judicial emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   That led Chief Justice Cecilia Sosa Gomez to resign, saying the
tribunal had ``simply committed suicide in order to avoid being
assassinated.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriles said his intent was for the court to be ``put to the
test to see if the rule of law still exists in Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no middle ground,'' he added. ``Either the rule
of law exists or it doesn't.''

MANY DISTRICTS COPE WITH SEVERE SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Fla., D.C., Minn., Wis., Calif., N.Y., Mass.)   (jw) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As children across the United States swarm back to school,
principals from the nation's capital to Palm Beach, Fla., and from
Houston to Los Angeles say they face the most serious teacher
shortage in recent memory, one that has been caused by swelling
enrollments and a push to reduce class sizes while more teachers
are retiring.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not a depleted pool of teachers nationwide: there
are at least 180,000 recent graduates with teaching degrees and
about 80,000 veterans looking for new jobs, enough to fill the
estimated 200,000 teaching vacancies posted in the nation's public
schools since last school year, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The driving issues are geography and expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers in states where there are sometimes hundreds of
applicants for one teaching slot, including Minnesota and
Wisconsin, have been largely unwilling to move to those states most
in need, including Texas and California. And even those teachers
game for a change of scenery are often untrained in the subjects
where shortages are greatest: mathematics, science, special
education and bilingual studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is true that at this point, more districts are
feeling the increase in demand,'' said Linda Darling-Hammond, a
professor of education at Stanford University and the director of
the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, a private
organization that has studied the issue closely. ``In some cases
they haven't planned ahead and done aggressive recruiting, and in
others there really is a shortfall.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact has been felt in places large and small, from Texas,
where there are an estimated 20,000 openings, to Belle Glade, Fla.,
a town of migrant citrus farmers near Palm Beach, which was still
searching for two first-grade teachers Monday, two weeks after the
school year began.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of teachers, to say nothing of those trained to teach
in specific subjects, districts and states have stepped up the
competition for candidates in ways that mirror the private sector
and were unheard of even five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Washington, D.C., began offering $1,000 signing
bonuses to applicants certified to teach in the general classroom,
$2,000 for those with a background in special education and $3,000
for anyone demonstrating proficiency in special education and an
additional specialty. These incentives come on top of a $3,700
raise for starting teachers _ to $31,000 this fall from $27,300
last year _ and assorted other sweeteners like $500 for relocation
assistance and $250 for school supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, desperate districts persuaded the state Legislature to
pass a law permitting them to rehire recent retirees _ while
allowing the retirees to keep drawing their pensions.
</P>
<P>
   And in the New Haven Unified School District in Union City,
Calif., a district of 14,000 students outside of Oakland, the
effort to attract out-of-town talent has gotten so sophisticated
that candidates are directed to the nearest Kinko's copy shop to be
linked live with district recruiters over video-conferencing lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just hired a special-ed teacher from New York through the
video interviewing,'' said Jim O'Laughlin, the personnel director
for the district. ``We've met her on TV, which is the same as
sitting across the table.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City _ which has tended to be among the last
districts in the nation to complete its hiring each year, limiting
its choices _ three early job fairs and a statewide recruiting push
have paid a dividend: the city Board of Education believes it has
has hired enough teachers to reduce class sizes to 25, from 28 or
so, in the fourth through eighth grades in its 40 lowest-performing
schools, district officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But administrators say they have all but abandoned the goal of
replacing hundreds of unlicensed math, science and
special-education teachers in those schools, and elsewhere in the
five boroughs, because of a shortage of interested, qualified
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, numerous factors have conspired to place
other districts in similar straits.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's public-school population, for example, continues to
bulge, with the 50 million students who occupied classrooms in 1995
expected to grow to 54.3 million by 2007, an average increase of
about 358,000 annually, Dr. Darling-Hammond said.
</P>
<P>
   To meet that need, districts would have to add 300,000 teachers,
raising the national teaching staff to 3.3 million by 2007, from 3
million in 1995, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But that effort is already being hobbled by retirements from
faculties that are unmistakably aging: nearly 1 million teachers
are between the ages of 45 and 53, with hundreds of thousands
expected to retire when they reach 55, if not sooner. In New York
City alone, union officials estimate that 17,000 teachers will
retire after this school year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the widening movement to reduce class sizes.
In California, for example, a mandate to hold class sizes to 20 in
kindergarten through third grade, as well as in ninth-grade English
and math, has been augmented this year to include eighth-grade
English.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Marubayashi, the associate director of the California
Center for Teaching Careers, a state agency, said that about 10
percent of teachers hired by districts statewide, in part to meet
such goals, do not have the proper credentials.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, she said, districts have been hiring candidates
they rejected earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sad story,'' she said. ``But you have to have
someone in front of the class.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Unified School District, which has hired 1,658
teachers for a new school year that starts in two weeks, still has
2,500 to go, district officials said. Of those hired, 58 percent
don't have teaching credentials, the district said.
</P>
<P>
   Many were hired based solely on their experience leading church
or camping groups, said Antonio Garcia, the district's director of
recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked a lot of the field dry last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in combing the nation's young work force for teachers,
districts are often hopelessly outgunned in a thriving economy by
technology and other companies that can sometimes triple a starting
teacher's salary. School districts and such companies are often
competing for the same dwindling pool of students who choose to
major in science or math.
</P>
<P>
   Further aggravating the crisis, those students who do commit to
teaching tend to choose elementary education, English or biology,
among other subjects, where the demand is less acute. And those
most qualified to teach in shortage areas are often among those
least willing to relocate, sometimes thousands of miles to the
nearest available teaching job, particularly if they live in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fairly high percentage of people who do graduate from
teacher prep programs, it may be upwards of 40 percent, don't go
into teaching,'' said Elizabeth Fideler, the executive vice
president and chief operating officer of Recruiting New Teachers, a
Massachusetts firm that works with states and districts.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiantown Middle School in Indiantown, Fla., near
Okeechobee, needed to hire 17 teachers this year _ to reduce class
sizes, but also to bring in fresh bodies to combat another opponent
that has plagued schools across the country: low test scores.
</P>
<P>
   The school succeeded in filling all jobs, but not without a
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiting was very difficult this year because there is such
a shortage out there,'' said Debra Harper, the school principal.
``We had to go outside the county and even the state. Florida was a
major draw for some teachers, and location helped us bring them
down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas has not been as lucky, and has had to turn back the clock
to fill its vacancies _ an estimated 20,000 statewide, 300 of them
in Houston alone.
</P>
<P>
   Under an article imploring ``adults 50 and older'' to learn more
about communicating via computer, the Aug. 26 edition of the
``Teacher Retirement System News'' beckons retirees of the Texas
school system to ``return to teaching on as much as a full-time
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a recently passed state law, the retirees must be
qualified in a shortage area, and have been out of the classroom
for as long as 12 months, to keep their pension payments flowing.
State officials had no immediate sense of how many retirees had
taken districts up on the offer. &QL;

ON EVE OF NEW SCHOOL YEAR, DETROIT TEACHERS VOTE TO STRIKE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DETROIT _ Against the recommendation of their union leaders,
teachers here voted to strike Monday, just one day before Detroit's
172,000 public school students were due to return to school.
</P>
<P>
   The strike will test not only a new school board appointed this
year by Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer and Michigan Gov. John Engler,
but also a 1994 law that makes the strike illegal and punishes
teachers with fines of a day's pay for every day spent on strike.
The last teachers strike in Detroit was in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The union, the Detroit Federation of Teachers, has been in
negotiations since February over the terms of a contract to replace
the one that expired Monday. The union's leadership recommended
that teachers accept a 10-day extension of the talks with the
Detroit Public Schools, but teachers rebelled, voting to strike by
an 80 percent margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They voted not to return without a contract,'' said Janna K.
Garrison, executive vice president of the Detroit Federation of
Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Parents were urged not to take their children to school Tuesday
until the school board can make sure there are enough teachers to
go around. The union, meanwhile, called for teachers to head for
the picket lines instead of their classrooms on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``No teacher ever wants to go on strike,'' said John Elliott,
president of the Detroit Federation of Teachers. ``But when the
school system tries to undermine the teachers, it winds up hurting
students.''
</P>
<P>
   Half the students in Detroit's public schools do not graduate
from high school, and half of those who do graduate struggle to
meet state standards. Fourth-graders approach state averages on
standardized tests, but by the seventh-grade just a third can read
or do math at their grade level.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Statehouse voted in March to transfer
control of Detroit's schools from an elected school board to the
mayor and governor, who appointed a new school board. The teachers
union supported the reform effort.
</P>
<P>
   The 11,500-member teachers union was seeking a pay raise and a
reduction in class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   The board had proposed raises of 95 percent of what teachers had
asked for, according to Ms. Garrison, and the school board had
agreed to study whether to reduce class sizes.

AT&AMP;T ENTERS PRICE WAR BY LOWERING LONG-DISTANCE RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T Corp. introduced lower long-distance rates Monday,
reluctantly joining a price war that is bringing bargains for
consumers but threatens to cut into phone companies' profits.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan, which has a $5.95 monthly fee, offers calls at 7
cents a minute any time. That represents a 30 percent cut in the
per-minute rate from AT&AMP;T's previous main offering, 10 cents a
minute with a $4.95 monthly fee. Customers must request the new
plan, otherwise they will remain with their older, more expensive
ones.
</P>
<P>
   The move by AT&AMP;T, the biggest long-distance company, comes after
its top two rivals, MCI Worldcom and Sprint, introduced plans in
recent weeks offering calls for 5 cents a minute on evenings and
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be responsive to the pricing pressures,'' said
Eugene Lockhart, president of AT&AMP;T consumer services. ``We believe
this offer represents a real opportunity to gain'' market share.
AT&AMP;T's share of the $41 billion consumer long-distance market is 50
percent but declined slightly this year as it has ever since long
distance was deregulated in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Driving much of the price war is that the cost of providing
long-distance calls continues to drop. The biggest cost are the
fees that long-distance carriers pay to local phone companies on
both ends of the call. These fees, which vary by state, average 3
to 4 cents a minute. But the Federal Communications Commission has
been moving to reduce them slowly and ordered a 4.5 percent
reduction that took effect in July.
</P>
<P>
   Even with lower costs, though, the declining prices could cut
into profits. ``On average, we are seeing our revenue on the newer
plans equal to or higher than the previous plans,'' said Len Lauer,
the president of Sprint's consumer long-distance unit. ``Our
margins may be a little squeezed for customers who make a lot of
calls at the 5-cent-a-minute rate.''
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the new plans offered by the top three
long-distance carriers ``are pretty comparable,'' said Rex G.
Mitchell, an analyst with Banc of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make a lot of calls before 7 p.m., you're better off on
the AT&AMP;T plan,'' he said. ``If you have the discretion to move most
of your calls to the evening and weekend, the best thing is the MCI
plan.''

When Prohibition came, the Hurley brothers put a flower shop in
front to hide the speakeasy. When Rockefeller Center was built, the
family stubbornly refused to sell their property, forcing the
developers to build the huge complex around them. But now, it
appears, Hurley's days are coming to end. With more stylish tenants
moving in around them, the restaurant's owners have decided to
close. The restaurant will be replaced by Citarella's, the upscale
food store, according someone familiar with the deal who spoke on

 &HT;    Dennis veers off, for now
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COINJOCK, N.C. _ Hurricane Dennis is churning out to sea after
lashing coastal North Carolina with dangerous winds and rain blamed
for two deaths, but forecasters worried that the storm could come
roaring back toward land before week's end.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis is expected to stall at sea today for two or three days.
Monday, the storm tore at the North Carolina-Virginia Tidewater
region with 92 mph winds and dumped up to eight inches of rain in
southeastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching into Virginia, the storm flooded streets in the
Norfolk area and knocked out electricity to more than 22,000 homes
and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really do need to keep our guard up for the next 36
hours,'' said Richard Moore, secretary of North Carolina's
Department of Crime Control and Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Among those worried that Dennis was not gone for good was Ed
O'Neal, owner of Currituck Sports, a bait and tackle shop on a
sandy finger surrounded by Currituck and Albemarle sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it goes off and sits for a while, that would be bad,''
O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina's extreme northeastern corner, hundreds of
hotels, restaurants and other businesses in Kitty Hawk, Kill Devil
Hills and Nags Head were hoping the lumbering storm would clear out
before Labor Day weekend, one of the biggest of the year on the
tourist-dependent Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Dennis was 120 miles east of Cape Hatteras, moving
east-northeast at 17 mph and generating 90 mph winds. A hurricane
warning remained in effect for most of the North Carolina coast,
from Cape Lookout to the Virginia border, but winds were starting
to abate Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, one of our better models is showing that it
comes back into the coast, not far from where it is right now,
close to Norfolk or in that general vicinity,'' said Jerry Jarrell
of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the storm's eye stayed 60 miles from shore, sparing
coastal North Carolina the widespread wind and flood damage
suffered from Hurricane Bonnie a year ago and Hurricanes Fran and
Bertha in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It moved a lot of sand around, but it wasn't a big deal,''
said Houston Hendrik, who spent Sunday night in his Wrightsville
Beach home, despite mandatory evacuation orders for the barrier
island and most others in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   As Dennis moved north Monday, Wilmington area officials lifted
evacuation orders and residents and vacationers returned to find
relatively little damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a bunch of bad weather in this area, but we're real
happy with how things turned out this time,'' said Bob Sheppard, an
employee at Harbor Inn in Wrightsville Beach.

   Dennis caused a bit of a mess on the Carteret County coast. On
Emerald Isle, down from the town hall's limb-strewn lawn, winds
toppled a green portable toilet on a construction site. A plastic
zebra was knocked over at the Jungleland Family Theme Park in
Atlantic Beach, near the Sheraton Hotel missing the letters ``h''
and ``n'' from its red plastic sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There goes part of the roof,'' said Harry Russell, a Sheraton
guest who stood on a deck overlooking the pounding waves spewing
white spray high into the gray sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost like God's fury, I guess, so natural and yet so
unnatural to a person like me,'' said another guest at the hotel,
Jerry Gulledge.

   Two motorists were killed in a head-on collision in the coastal
Onslow County community of Richlands. Authorities said the crash
occurred about 7:30 a.m. as 60 mph winds and 2 inches of rain
blasted the area. Winds reached 102 mph at Buxton on Hatteras
Island and flooding temporarily closed N.C. 12, the only highway
along the barrier island. A stretch of the highway also was shut
down near Kitty Hawk. At times, blowing beach sand reduced
visibility to near zero along the highway on Hatteras Island. Sand
reportedly was drifted 3 feet deep near Buxton.

SUMMER RENTALS EXTEND INTO FALL

  (For release Sun., Sept. 5)

<P>
   Not so long ago, Labor Day was the moment the cottage door
twanged shut. For rentals at the beach, the long season began on
Memorial Day, the short on July 4. But long or short, it was over
on Labor Day, just before school started.
</P>
<P>
   Like many travel patterns in America, this one is changing.
While no one has created the endless summer surfers dream of, nor
the ``second summer'' touted by the New Jersey Department of
Commerce, in the Northeast and even parts of the Midwest, September
and October have become beach time for many.
</P>
<P>
   On Cape Cod, in New Jersey and at shore resorts elsewhere along
the recreational vehicle flyway, officials all say yes, yes, there
is a post-Labor Day influx of retired people, especially those
taking a leisurely course to Florida. This flow of people who pause
along the way for more than a weekend is bolstered by a certain
number of younger vacation-house hunters who cannot go in summer.
But at Bethany Beach, Del., Mayor Joe McHugh sees something else:
families with preschool children. They come flooding in to swim,
rent cottages at a lower price and eat at restaurants that
increasingly keep their stoves alight into the fall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lower prices at thriving Bethany Beach are a relative matter. In
the middle of summer, Michael Wilgus of Century 21 Wilgus real
estate company said, three-bedroom houses go for $1,800 to $1,950 a
week; in September, this might be $1,000 a week. Part of what is
driving prices, he said, is an increase in visitors from New
Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts who are looking for
quiet places near the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Although 1999 has been a boom summer at the shore all through
the Northeast, with a heat wave, a lack of rain so serious it
became a drought, and a consequent freedom from mosquitoes, the
September-October ``season'' has been evolving for some time. On
Cape Cod, Everett Keyes of Real Estate Unlimited says things have
been moving that way for 25 years, but he has seen the most radical
change in the last 10. Others involved cite 10 or 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the Delaware shore, Wilgus said, 15 or 20 years ago in
Bethany Beach, ``My parents would walk me uptown on Monday evening
of Labor Day to see how quiet things were.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All we would meet were other local people walking around,'' he
said. ``Now a lot of people have caught on. The humidity is gone,
the crowds are gone, rentals are lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Wilgus and others note, families with school-age
children and all adults involved in education vanish by Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, as parks departments in Delaware, New Jersey, New
York, Connecticut and Massachusetts point out, parking lot
attendants and lifeguards must return to school, which means
beaches must reduce their hours or the space they patrol.
Connecticut's parks, including those with beaches on Long Island
Sound _ Sherwood Island, Hammonassett, Rocky Neck _ stay open all
year but provide lifeguards only in summer. Pamela Adams, director
of state parks, said: ``We try to keep our lifeguards until Labor
Day, but school years start earlier and earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   State beaches may be able to provide weekend services by hiring
local youths, but keeping hotels and restaurants operating into the
fall means corralling customers through the week, not just on the
weekend. Many hotels and motels maintain minimum-stay requirements
into the fall to keep the staff from moving on, as one hotelier put
it.
</P>
<P>
   Cape May, N.J., and Saugatuck-Douglas, Mich., which has beaches
on Lake Michigan, have extended the season by marketing efforts.
They imitated Atlantic City, which created the Miss America Pageant
in 1921 to keep the Boardwalk hotels going the week after Labor
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Felicia Fairchild of the Saugatuck Convention and Visitors
Bureau said her town of 954 people in western Michigan began its
organization in 1989 with the mission to expand the season. ``We
have had phenomenal success,'' she said. In the '80s, she recalled,
the season was Memorial Day to Labor Day, and the six B&AMP;B's of that
era closed then. Now the resort opens in May and the 40-odd B&AMP;B's
go all year, with 20,000 visitors in the peak of summer. Travelers
to Saugatuck, she said, are mostly empty-nesters from the higher
income brackets, with two working spouses. In fall, they visit
galleries, stay in inns with fireplaces and hot tubs and continue
to swim at Oval Beach among the dunes on Lake Michigan. ``We are a
throwback,'' Ms. Fairchild said, ``the kind of place where you can
lie in the grass and read and watch sailboats go by.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saugatuck mission was accomplished without advertising, Ms.
Fairchild said. The tiny town dispatched a display to the American
Society of Travel Agents convention in Taiwan in 1991, and its
presence among the booths set up by Portugal and other countries
attracted the attention of CNN. When the campaign began, 87 percent
of visitors came from Chicago, two and a half hours away. Now the
breakdown is 50 percent from Chicago, 50 percent from the Detroit
area and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Cape May set out to sell fall opportunities, and the
town's stylish restaurants and Victorian-style inns. Tags for beach
admission end after Labor Day, said Kathy Tomlin, office manager
for the county department of tourism. ``The water is at its highest
temperature,'' she said, ``and we are past the August chaos.'' She
said that events, including a lima bean festival, had used up all
the fall weekends, and that Victorian Week Oct. 8 to 17 now
surrounds Columbus Day. The Cape May Bird Observatory is a major
attraction in the migrating season.
</P>
<P>
   Dane Wells, proprietor of the Queen Victoria Inn and the smaller
Queen's Hotel in Cape May, said that his rates did not drop at all
until mid-September because early September was still ``prime beach
season.'' He applies a three-night minimum on fall weekends and a
two-day minimum midweek. He said his places had 70 to 80 percent
occupancy in the fall. Tom Carroll at the Mainstay Inn, also in
Cape May, said: ``We've watched the business go from 0 in September
30 years ago to excellent now.'' His summer rates do not drop until
after Victorian Week.
</P>
<P>
   On Cape Cod, Keyes, the real estate broker, said the strong
season is mid-June to mid-September, and rates for rentals drop
about a third after that. ``It's a lot heavier than it used to be
up to Columbus Day,'' he said. Ninety percent of the 100 to 150
cottages he handles are heated, he said, and he often rents in the
fall to people looking for houses to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Hunter of Bedford, N.Y., says that she, her husband and
three small children rent a beach house on Long Beach Island, N.J.,
in the high season. But Ms. Hunter said the family likes the fall _
warm swimming, clothing sales, the absence of traffic signals _ so
they have been coming back, borrowing Ms. Hunter's parents' beach
house in September and October. But, she said, in the last two
years, her parents are getting demands for later rentals, and Ms.
Hunter, an agent at Valerie Wilson Travel in New York, is a realist
in these things. ``It's just getting harder to be a freeloader,''
she said.

pilots of the historic flight, Dr. Bertrand Piccard and Brian
Jones. The pilots completed their three-week trip when they landed
in Egypt on March 21, after flying 29,055 miles. No previous

Hurley's restaurant, at the corner of 49th Street and Sixth Avenue,

in the 1930's. For decades, Hurley's restaurant bucked the odds.
When Prohibition came, the Hurley brothers put a flower shop in
front to hide the speakeasy. When Rockefeller Center was built, the
family stubbornly refused to sell their property, forcing the
developers to build the huge complex around them. But now, it
appears, Hurley's days are coming to end. With more stylish tenants
moving in around them, the restaurant's owners have decided to
close. The restaurant will be replaced by Citarella's, the upscale
food store, according someone familiar with the deal who spoke on

POOLS AND PICASSO BY THE BEACH IN MAUI

   Imagine for a moment a slow morning stroll to breakfast through
bright, colonnaded galleries, past massive bronzes by Leger,
Picasso lithographs and Warhol silkscreens. There is an
embarrassment of choice as you dine on a sumptuous buffet under
huge cast-iron chandeliers that seem to grow like vines downward
from painted ceilings that vault 40 feet skyward. You then pad
lazily toward the sea past the long, terraced reflecting pools.
Just above them, realistically sculptured dolphins are permanently
suspended in flight. Finally, beachside aboard your cushioned
chaise, you look out at the picture-book ocean where a school of
humpback whales playfully sounds not far offshore.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Wailea Resort Hotel and Spa, one of the most luxurious
establishments on Maui, an island whose vocation seems to have
become luxury living, offers such dreamlike days. Although Maui
boasts seaside drives, mountain trails, free public recreational
parks and some of the best beaches in Hawaii, the sprawling Grand
Wailea, on the island's southwest coast, seems to take the credo of
all-inclusive resorts even more to heart than most, giving visitors
so many options it would scarcely occur to them to stray outside.
</P>
<P>
   At the Grand Wailea, this approach is called the ``detached
world.'' Start with the white, spiky chapel, which looks as if it
were straight from the ``Wizard of Oz'' _ except, that is, for the
brightly colored stained-glass windows depicting a royal Hawaiian
wedding. The swimming pool, a gargantuan affair, alone occupies
more space than many hotels. This uniquely designed waterworld
includes a 2,000-foot course of flowing water called the Wailea
Canyon, with a current that propels swimmers past manmade caves,
valleys, grottoes, restaurants, wet bars, Jacuzzi baths and,
obligingly, even a modest patch of simulated rapids.
</P>
<P>
   The pool also includes what is billed as the world's only water
elevator. For riders on this popular conveyance, however, the
experience is more like a thunderous, cold-water shower than an
elevator. Riders sit on a huge rubber tire that hoists passengers a
full five stories while the pumice-stone chamber that houses it is
filled with water cascading down from above, a bracing shower. What
keeps people coming back again and again for another ascent,
though, is the serpentine water slide, which is reached by the
elevator, and whose long and giddy ride rivals that of most water
parks.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming one's budget holds up, the Grand Wailea claims to be
all things to all people. With its variety of recreational
activities, six restaurants, rooms from presidential-type suites to
more prosaic singles and doubles, and many other choices, the hotel
largely succeeds, and certainly did for my family, which included
my wife, Agnes, and our sons William, 14, and Henry, 10, during a
three-day stay last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's swimming pool serves as a metaphor for the entire
enterprise. While children play on the slide (endlessly in Henry's
case), a small, deep pool is reserved for scuba lessons. And just
up the long terraced promenade to the hotel there is another large
formal pool reserved for adults. Alongside it are a number of
spacious Jacuzzi baths, as well as canopy-shaded tables where
professional masseurs ply their art.
</P>
<P>
   An even quieter form of relaxation is a walk between virtually
any two places in the hotel, affording a view of its 40 acres of
verdant, carefully manicured grounds that slope gently from the
foothills of Mount Haleakala to the beach. From the balcony of the
breakfast restaurant (where an elaborate buffet is served, with an
abundance of tropical fruits and traditional Japanese offerings),
while colorful tropical birds seek to raid tables of leftovers,
another mildly distracting choreography can be spied below:
white-uniformed grounds-keepers pruning regal palm trees aboard
telescoping lifts. And always, there is the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Wailea sits along a beach that has often been
described as one of the finest in the world _ perhaps because of
its gentle turquoise waters and clean, fine white sand, and because
of a fantastic view of Molokini Island, Lanai Island and the West
Maui mountains. Whales and dolphins abound, as do sea turtles,
sharks and the countless tropical fish species that feed off the
abundant coral. The usual variety of water sports is available
here, from scuba, windsurfing and kayaking to sailboat outings on a
60-foot catamaran, the Alii Nui. Although there is no tennis or
golf at the resort, 11 tennis courts and three championship golf
courses are less than a mile away (cost is extra).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the spa, which Agnes and William frequented, a
soothing world of marble floors, waterfalls and a wide range of
treatments from around the world _ plus state-of-the-art equipment,
TV monitors, instructors and lots of fresh towels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For children _ and for an extra fee _ the hotel has a recreation
center known as Camp Grande, with its own dining room and nursery.
Run much like a summer camp, it offers computers, video games, its
own movie theater and extensive professional supervision by a young
staff. For parents wishing a little extra privacy, the camp also
has an evening session.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of all the outdoor choices, for some guests the
greatest pleasures of the Grand Wailea will be found in the hotel's
spacious white-walled interior. The massive, whimsical Botero
sculptures _ like ``Woman Smoking a Cigarette'' or ``Sleepless
Night'' _ that grace many of the public areas are a particular
pleasure, and an unexpected touch for a hotel of any class. While
the art continually takes guests by surprise, a quieter
satisfaction comes from the unfussy luxury in the hotel's other
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   There are 780 rooms, including 51 suites, ranging from 640 to
5,500 square feet. The ordinary traveler _ one like me who
vacations on a budget _ will typically be lodged in the Molokini
wing, whose terraced rooms offer a full view of the mountains, but
just a glimpse of the Pacific Ocean. The furniture in each room,
however, shows an eye for understated elegance and craftsmanship,
whether it is the four--poster beds, the fine wicker cabinets, or
the solid, hardwood tables on the porches. Each room also has a
bath, separate shower and marble vanity.
</P>
<P>
   For Hawaii residents (as we were for nine months), the room is
discounted, in our case to $286 a night during our stay in late
March, down considerably from the standard rate of $380. It had a
queen-size bed and a double, plus a large, comfortable chaise
longue, which the boys took turns sleeping on, rather than sharing
the double bed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Grand Wailea's six restaurants is the Kincha, an
austere Japanese dining establishment with private tatami rooms,
Japanese lanterns and calligraphy wall-hangings. What seems most
authentic is the cuisine, which must meet the demanding standards
of the hotel's large Japanese clientele. There is also an
Italian-Mediterranean restaurant known as Bistro Molokini, and a
Hawaiian seafood restaurant with the nearly impossible to pronounce
name of Humuhumunukunukuapua'a (more familiar is its thatched-roof
and stilts-in-the-water design, typical of Polynesia).
</P>
<P>
   If there was any disappointment at the Grand Wailea, it involved
service. Sometimes the hotel seemed unable to strike the right
balance between overweening attention _ as at some of its fine
restaurants _ and relative neglect _ sometimes the case in the
breakfast dining area, or at poolside, where snacks are served. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for this guest, the perfect cap to days long and rich
in choices were sunset cocktails on our room's terrace, dividing my
view between the foothills of the West Maui mountains and the deep
blue sea. The only music was live _ from a riot of birds fussing
and flirting as they tidied their nests for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing, sailing and lei making

Space Museum, puts together the Breitling Orbiter 3 in the lobby of
the museum on Monday. The Breitling Orbiter 3, the first manned
balloon ever to make a non-stop trip around the earth, will be
permanently housed at the museum. The balloon was donated by the
pilots of the historic flight, Dr. Bertrand Piccard and Brian
Jones. The pilots completed their three-week trip when they landed
in Egypt on March 21, after flying 29,055 miles. No previous
attempts came even close. In the background at top is the Spirit of

Hurley's restaurant, at the corner of 49th Street and Sixth Avenue,
on Monday, top, and as Rockefeller Center was constructed around it
in the 1930's. For decades, Hurley's restaurant bucked the odds.
When Prohibition came, the Hurley brothers put a flower shop in
front to hide the speakeasy. When Rockefeller Center was built, the
family stubbornly refused to sell their property, forcing the
developers to build the huge complex around them. But now, it
appears, Hurley's days are coming to end. With more stylish tenants
moving in around them, the restaurant's owners have decided to
close. The restaurant will be replaced by Citarella's, the upscale
food store, according someone familiar with the deal who spoke on

force. A year and a half after sweeping into office as the most
powerful leftist elected politician in Latin America, Mayor

population of 20 million, is the biggest metropolis in the
hemisphere and one of the largest in the world. It is so gargantuan
that it dominates Mexico politically and economically in the same
way as Washington, New York and Los Angeles would the United States
if they were one mega-city. (Carlos Avila Gonzalez/San Francisco

RUSSIAN SAYS HE HAS PROOF   BRIBES WERE PAID TO KREMLIN

<P>
   MOSCOW _ A Russian investigator said in a television interview
Monday night that published accounts of bribes paid to Kremlin
officials by a Swiss construction company were ``98 percent true''
and could be backed up by evidence in his files.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, Georgi Chuglazov, a deputy in the prosecutor
general's office, made the comments after he was barred at the last
minute from joining a delegation from the office that is to leave
Tuesday for Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Chuglazov confirmed that he had been removed Friday as head of
the investigation into Mabetex, a Swiss-based construction company
that has been at the center of a probe into kickbacks allegedly
received by top Kremlin officials.
</P>
<P>
   Chuglazov had hoped to wind up his investigation with a trip to
Switizerland. Instead, he said, he discovered not only that his
airplane tickets had been canceled but that his phones had been cut
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that no one here is interested in this case,'' he
said in an interview on NTV, Russia's largest independent station,
which has taken an increasingly strong stance against President
Boris Yeltsin in a politically charged media war.
</P>
<P>
   So far no charges have been filed against any Kremlin officials
in the investigation, which was begun last winter by a prosecutor
general, Yuri Skuratov. His subsequent dismissal was seen as
political retribution by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But the scandal flashed back to life last week when Corriere
della Sera, Italy's leading newspaper, reported detailed charges
against Yeltsin's inner circle and his family.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, quoting unnamed sources close to the Swiss
investigation, said $1 million channeled by Mabetex through
accounts used by Pavel Borodin, head of the Kremlin's property
management office, had been labeled ``pocket money'' for members of
Yeltsin's family during an official trip to Hungary several years
ago. The paper also reported that Yeltsin's family had been given
access to credit cards that were paid by Mabetex's president,
Behgjet Pacolli.
</P>
<P>
   Pacolli has denied most of the charges, saying the $1 million
transfer had been to a subcontractor based in Budapest. Borodin has
also denied having a Swiss bank account of his own, although in an
interview last week he said Mabetex had paid for several business
trips that he and Kremlin colleagues had made to Switzerland and
Italy to inspect materials used by Mabetex for the reconstruction
of Yeltsin's residence and offices.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Monday night, Chuglazov did not specify which
of the allegations made by the Italian newspaper may be backed up
by evidence in his files. But he insisted the evidence was
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the case has enough grounds to have some of the state
officials fired,'' he said. ``One doesn't have to have a court
sentence to be fired from a job.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It shouldn't be surprising to anyone who has been
following fashion of late that women are more interested in
practical clothes than in designers' flights of fancy. In an
informal survey last week, women from 19 to 70 had similar
reactions to a lot of what they see pictured in fashion
publications, calling the clothes exaggerated and the styling
extreme and not realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion these days should be straight and pure, with no
gimmicks,'' said Margot Rogoff, a consultant to the fashion and
beauty industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see realistic things, not celebrity stuff,'' said
Stacey Gubinski, a student in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to have direction,'' said Barbara Raynor, a copy
editor at a New York publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   Since the stores are currently stocked with new fall
merchandise, this is a good time to ask retailers about their
directions. Stores, after all, place their bets on what they think
customers will actually want to buy. They don't always guess
correctly, but are more down-to-earth than the fantasies of
stylists and fashion photographers. Herewith, a rundown of the
major trends a woman might think about if she wants to look au
courant but not like a fashion victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customer is looking for something new, something
luxurious, something special,'' said Joan Kaner, a vice president
and the fashion director of Neiman Marcus. ``She's looking for high
fashion, not buying a basic.''
</P>
<P>
   The other day Ms. Kaner pulled from the racks a collection of
early best sellers for Neiman Marcus, which included cashmeres in
both knitwear and double-face woven fabrics, leathers and
shearlings. ``There's a lot of black and white,'' she said,
``especially tweeds and patterns, plus camels and browns. And
there's also color: orange, red and the whole family of greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the early hits are a vicuna-colored cashmere twin set and
a pony-printed hair-calf skirt by Michael Kors; a knitted jacket
and leather skirt from Chanel; a black and white cowl-neck tunic
sweater with tweed pants by John Galliano, and a black shearling
coat with rough edges and a decidedly bohemian air by Donna Karan.
</P>
<P>
   The bohemian, ethnic, hippie style _ call it what you will, it's
a throwback to the 1970s _ is a major trend that can make the
wearer look like a gypsy or can be toned down to a romantic,
feminine look with mere touches of decorative elements.
</P>
<P>
   James Aguiar, Bergdorf Goodman's fashion director for
ready-to-wear, sees bohemian as one side of the fashion coin and a
sleek urban look as the counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one can be at home in the city,'' he said. ``The urban
sophisticate dresses in a monotone _ black head to toe or white
head to toe, or camel. The bohemian mixes colors, prints and
textures. Boots are important for both looks. We also feel very
strongly about ponchos, capes and serapes, and luxurious
hand-knitted cashmeres.''
</P>
<P>
   His suggestion for a wearable urban bohemian look is a raw silk
skirt by Matthew Williamson bordered in velvet and beaded fringe,
topped by a simple two-tone pullover. The city sophisticate is
personified by a white Calvin Klein suit with a short jacket and a
knee-length skirt. For color, there is a reddish orange dress with
a matching poncho by Michael Kors.
</P>
<P>
   ``An individual style filters through all of these looks,''
Aguiar said. ``The most important thing is, there is no uniform.
And color is important, finally. People are responding to color.''
</P>
<P>
   At Barneys New York, Judy Collinson, an executive vice
president, sees the bohemian influence in details like embroidery,
beading and appliques. She mentioned a Marni skirt trimmed with
rows of flowers, shown with a red hair-calf jacket, and a red skirt
by Andrew Gn decorated with black embroidery and leather and shown
with a fur-trimmed sleeveless sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Other important trends that are already selling, she said, are
skirts from knee length to long; touches of fur; vests in leather,
shearling and knits; blanket wraps; velvet, and chunky sweaters.
She likes Burberry's plaid blanket skirt teamed with a shearling
vest, and a camel mohair skirt from the Barneys private-label
collection worn with a matching cashmere turtleneck that looks
hand-knitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of black on the runways, but also a lot of
color,'' she said. ``There's the warmth of camel tones and brown,
while blue and red are still powerful. And it's a strong boot
season, whether tall, short or in between.''
</P>
<P>
   At Henri Bendel, Ed Burstell, the store's vice president and
general merchandise manager, pointed out what he considers the
trends of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animal prints are selling in cashmere, in fake fur, in coats
and accessories,'' he said, ``and they look terrific with orange,
one of the big colors. The other big color is olive in everything
from ponchos to coats. Athletic looks continue to be popular. And
chunky sweaters. I love this chunky turtleneck from Dirk
Bikkembergs in olive or blue. And the hippie, vintage look in
Catherine's wool poncho in diamond-patterned olive, plum and camel
worn with a long skirt. ''
</P>
<P>
   Sheri Wilson-Gray, Saks Fifth Avenue's executive vice president
for marketing, went through the store to see what she wanted for
fall and came up with the following shopping list: something
pashmina and something in hair calf, a poncho, boots and a status
bag. For color she favors red over orange because ``next year
you'll still want to wear red, but you may hate orange.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just gotten used to the look of bare legs,'' she said,
``so I'm not sure about black hosiery. If you wear boots and
there's a gap between the boot and the hem of the skirt, what looks
better? A bare leg or black?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing when a magazine shows a picture,'' she added,
``and it's always interesting when people wear it and you think,
`Hmmmm.'''

When Prohibition came, the Hurley brothers put a flower shop in
front to hide the speakeasy. When Rockefeller Center was built, the
family stubbornly refused to sell their property, forcing the
developers to build the huge complex around them. But now, it
appears, Hurley's days are coming to end. With more stylish tenants
moving in around them, the restaurant's owners have decided to
close. The restaurant will be replaced by Citarella's, the upscale
food store, according someone familiar with the deal who spoke on

   (NYT1) MEXICO CITY -- Aug. 30, 1999 -- MEXICO-CITY-SFCHRON-1,
08-30 -- Visitors atop the Latin American Tower look out over part
of the city's skyline. Mexico City, with a metropolitan area
population of 20 million, is the biggest metropolis in the
hemisphere and one of the largest in the world. It is so gargantuan
that it dominates Mexico politically and economically in the same
way as Washington, New York and Los Angeles would the United States
if they were one mega-city. (Carlos Avila Gonzalez/San Francisco

   (NYT32) WASHINGTON -- Aug. 30, 1999 -- SUB-MUSEUM-ORBITER, 08-30
-- Bernie Poppert, an employee at the Smithsonian's National Air
Space Museum, puts together the Breitling Orbiter 3 in the lobby of
the museum on Monday. The Breitling Orbiter 3, the first manned
balloon ever to make a non-stop trip around the earth, will be
permanently housed at the museum. The balloon was donated by the
pilots of the historic flight, Dr. Bertrand Piccard and Brian
Jones. The pilots completed their three-week trip when they landed
in Egypt on March 21, after flying 29,055 miles. No previous
attempts came even close. In the background at top is the Spirit of
St. Louis, which Charles Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic in
1927. (Justin Lane/New York Times Photo) LITE

1998. Politicians have always made a point of having themselves
photographed as they step out of church on Sunday, carrying a Bible
and shaking the minister's hand. But in the early campaign for the
2000 elections, the rite of political piety has moved far beyond
the sac ramental photo opportunity. (Paul Hosefros/New York Times

   (NYT23) NEW YORK -- Aug. 30, 1999 -- CLOSING-HURLEY'S, 08-30 --
Hurley's restaurant, at the corner of 49th Street and Sixth Avenue,
on Monday, top, and as Rockefeller Center was constructed around it
in the 1930's. For decades, Hurley's restaurant bucked the odds.
When Prohibition came, the Hurley brothers put a flower shop in
front to hide the speakeasy. When Rockefeller Center was built, the
family stubbornly refused to sell their property, forcing the
developers to build the huge complex around them. But now, it
appears, Hurley's days are coming to end. With more stylish tenants
moving in around them, the restaurant's owners have decided to
close. The restaurant will be replaced by Citarella's, the upscale
food store, according someone familiar with the deal who spoke on
condition of anonymity. (Chester Higgins Jr./New York Times Photo)

from Baltimore to Palm Beach, Fla., and from the Texas panhandle to

force. A year and a half after sweeping into office as the most
powerful leftist elected politician in Latin America, Mayor

<P>
   LONDON _ Pressed into the defensive by Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s
aggressive march into Europe, two of the biggest supermarket
operators in France announced a $16.6 billion combination Monday
intended to build a stockade against Wal-Mart's ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Carrefour SA said it would exchange six of its shares for every
share of Promodes SA in a deal that would create the world's
second-biggest retailer after Wal-Mart. It would supplant Metro AG
of Germany as Europe's largest retailer. The all-stock deal, which
must be approved by European Union regulators, will build a retail
chain with 9,000 stores in Europe, Asia and Latin America and
expected sales this year of $56 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Carrefour's offer values Promodes at 841.8 euros a share, or
15.9 billion euros, a 20 percent premium to its closing price of
700 euros on Friday. The announcement of the deal in Paris pushed
Carrefour's shares down by as much 4.8 percent before they
rebounded and closed up 0.10 euro, to 140.4 euros. Shares of
Promodes jumped by 129 euros, or 18.4 percent, to 829 euros. Retail
stocks rose across the Continent as investors anticipated a merger
wave among retailers, all unsettled by Wal-Mart's campaign. A
similar surge was forecast in London for Tuesday, which had a
holiday Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Wal-Mart, which had sales of $138 billion last year,
agreed to pay $10.8 billion in cash for Asda Group PLC, Britain's
third-largest supermarket chain, adding to its acquisition of two
German retail chains _ Wertkauf and 74 Spar Handels AG outlets _ in
1997. The drive into Europe is propelled by acquisitions because
strict zoning regulations in France, Britain and elsewhere leave
little room for new stores. The maneuvers have forced European
retailers to consider joining forces so they can use size to
negotiate lower prices from suppliers, enhancing their ability to
meet the challenge from Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   France _ one of Europe's big three retail markets along with
Britain and Germany _ had been seen by analysts as a big gap in
Wal-Mart's European armor, and it was not immediately clear how it
would respond to the French deal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts differed on how the combination would affect Wal-Mart's
strategy. ``It only means that international retailers recognize
Wal Mart's aggressive push into Europe and are beginning to act,''
said Jeff Feiner, who follows Wal-Mart for Lehman Brothers. ``But
this will not deter Wal-Mart.''
</P>
<P>
   But Burt Flickinger, managing director of Reach Marketing, a
retail consulting firm in Westport, Conn., disagreed. ``This means
Carrefour will dominate the European Union, before Wal-Mart has a
chance to reload and get beyond its last merger.'' Although the
French retailer does $100 billion less in annual sales worldwide
than the American giant, Flickinger thinks that it has distinct
advantages in the global arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win the world war, Wal-Mart needs two things: fresh
consumables and fashion.'' Promodes, he reasons, was the jewel of
the supermarket chains available for purchase. Meanwhile,
``Carrefour has much more fashion authority, it is much more on
trend.'' Flickinger thinks that Wal-Mart will now have to push its
domestic expansion much faster to meet its internal goals for
increasing revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney said in a report before the French deal
Monday that Wal-Mart ``is one of the main triggers for
consolidation in Europe.'' But, the report said, ``even with Asda
in its portfolio, Wal-Mart still has some way to go. It still lacks
access to France.'' In June, the family-owned French chain Auchan
said it had been approached by Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The chairmen of both Carrefour and Promodes left little doubt
that their move had been set off by the pressure for consolidation.
``Given the acceleration in alliances in the distribution business,
this merger comes at the right time and is without doubt the best
possible for the two partners,'' said Paul-Louis Halley, the head
of Promodes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Carre-four will issue 115 million
new shares to Promodes stockholders. That means that, between them,
the founding families of the two companies, along with their
supporters, will have 33.5 percent of the stock and 35.8 percent of
the voting rights in the new company. Under French rules, a 33
percent share of voting rights constitutes a blocking minority,
theoretically immunizing the merged company against a hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel Bernard, the chairman of Carrefour, who will be
chairman and chief executive of the merged company, suggested that
Europe's vulnerability to Wal-Mart was not likely to go away. ``We
are still smaller than the biggest companies that are far from
renouncing their intentions to become ever more powerful,'' he said
at a news conference in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies said no layoffs were planned among the 240,000
employees, 110,000 of whom are in France.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Monday's announcement, Carrefour had been
aggressively seeking to strengthen its position globally and
domestically, overtaking Wal-Mart to become the biggest retailer in
Brazil while acquiring Comptoirs Modernes SA, which operates more
than 350 supermarkets in France. Carrefour's assets include more
than 1,500 large mass convenience stores known as hypermarkets and
supermarkets in 20 countries. Promodes had also been seeking to
expand, but failed in a hostile bid to take over Casino Guichard
Perrachon SA.
</P>
<P>
   The new company is expected to rely on the Continent for 85
percent of its sales.
</P>
<P>
   The deal puts pressure on other European retailers, notably
Koninlijke Ahold in the Netherlands and France's Casino, to embark
on consolidation moves. Ahold said Monday that it would refrain
from hostile takeovers but was considering deals in France,
Britain, Italy and Spain.

ROAD DISPUTE REVIVES ZAPATISTA FIGHT IN MEXICO

<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico _ A spat over a dirt road
through a soggy jungle has reignited the clash between the
government and Zapatista rebels in the Mexican state of Chiapas,
showing that five years of efforts by President Ernesto Zedillo to
bring peace to the Indian region have failed.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began in mid-August when masked Zapatistas formed a
human barrier in a faraway rain forest hamlet to block the
government from opening a roadway into their main stronghold. Army
troops flew in to clear the way, activating tensions that led to
the first direct skirmishes between the two sides in more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Zapatistas and soldiers are still staring at
each other angrily across a coil of concertina wire in a humid
clearing.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation with the Zapatistas, which President Zedillo
inherited when he took office in December 1994, has proved to be
one of the noisiest and most intractable issues of his
administration. The clamor for peace came not only from Mexicans
but also from devotees of the masked guerrillas, and their
pro-Indian cause, in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The president pledged time and again to engage the Zapatistas in
negotiations to settle the conflict and to expand the rights of
Mexico's indigenous peoples.
</P>
<P>
   But as Zedillo prepares for Sept. 1, when he will give his last
state of the union address before becoming a lame-duck leader in an
election year, protagonists on all sides have given up on a
resolution or even renewed talks before he steps down in November
of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's lack of results in Chiapas will be a political burden
for the man believed to be his choice for his party's presidential
nomination, Francisco Labastida Ochoa. When he was interior
minister, Labastida helped to devise, and then carried out, the
policies that instead of reducing animosities have kept the state
at a slow boil.
</P>
<P>
   Chiapas became national news in Mexico once again with the feud
that erupted in Amador Hernandez, a solitary hamlet in the Lacandon
rain forest, whose canopy hides the Zapatistas' most important
redoubts. The state government wanted to connect the hamlet and
muddy wilds around it to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   But as charted, the road would also provide access to the jungle
from a military base the Mexican army uses for operations to harass
and hem in the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   While several nearby Indian communities support the road, in
Amador Hernandez a pro-Zapatista majority furiously opposes it.
Nevertheless, the state authorities sent surveyors to prepare the
final plans for construction.
</P>
<P>
   When Zapatista men, women and even children put up their
roadblock, the government dispatched two companies of military riot
police by helicopter, ostensibly to protect the surveyors.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas called in their own reinforcements, several dozen
students who came to Chiapas at the invitation of Subcommander
Marcos, the Zapatista leader, from a strike at the National
Autonomous University of Mexico, in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff came to blows only once, on Aug. 15. The Zapatistas
began pummeling the soldiers with clubs, and the troops repelled
them with tear gas and truncheons, leaving a half-dozen people with
minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 25, Zapatistas and soldiers stumbled into each other in
another village in the rain forest. Seven soldiers were wounded by
machetes or rocks, and two Zapatistas had bullet wounds. The next
day, the government suspended the road construction.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the Zapatista rebellion should have been easy
for Zedillo to extinguish. The Zapatista National Liberation Army
never demonstrated any military prowess and met in combat with the
government for only about two weeks since staging an uprising in
January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the Zapatistas' demands for justice and equality for Indians
resonated with Mexicans, as did the seductive figure of Marcos, a
guerrilla strategist who also composes witty political epistles and
even children's books.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas' resistance has been far more effective than a
straight show of military force could have been. Peace talks
produced a preliminary accord in February 1996, but the
negotiations collapsed in September of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Since early 1998, Zedillo has pursued a double-barreled
strategy. On one hand troops have borne down on the Zapatistas,
patrolling and setting up bases all around them but avoiding
head-on fights. Meanwhile, the government lavished resources on
Chiapas for health clinics, land reform, power lines and roads in a
bid to draw Indians away from the rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the Zapatistas won't talk peace, my strategy has been to
press hard with our social programs to remove some of the causes of
the conflict,'' said Emilio Rabasa Gamboa, the federal government's
top official for Chiapas. ``The policy has been so successful that
the Zapatistas are trying to block it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the name of protecting Mexican sovereignty, the country's
immigration authorities have harassed and often expelled foreigners
who have come to Chiapas to help the Zapatistas, cutting the rebels
off from sorely needed overseas assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked to undermine the rebels. About 100 people
have defected from Zapatista ranks this year _ the first year in
which there has been a steady flow of deserters.
</P>
<P>
   But the policies only antagonized Zapatista supporters and
exacerbated volatile rifts in Indian areas where they remain
strong, completely souring the environment for peace talks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas contributed to their own isolation. Marcos seems
less and less like a visionary and more like a cult leader. Holed
up in his hideout, he meets almost exclusively with admirers. While
the rest of Mexico is passionately embroiled in the presidential
campaign, the Zapatista leader rejected electoral politics and
disdained all political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than keeping their focus on Indian rights, the rebels
took up other, oddly marginal causes.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently they held a jungle conference to drum up
opposition to an obscure legislative proposal that would grant
private concessions the authority to operate some of Mexico's
pre-Hispanic archeological sites.
</P>
<P>
   They tried to fend off the encroachment of government social
programs by barring their followers from any contact with them. Not
only have villagers who support the Zapatistas rejected new roads,
but they do not even allow their children to be vaccinated by
public health agents.
</P>
<P>
   Zapatista leaders had instead expected a shower of international
aid, but it has not materialized. Communities of their followers
struggle with severe want while watching others reap the benefits
of their rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The events in Amador Hernandez brought out outlandish positions
on all sides, revealing the political morass that Chiapas has
become.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset Marcos announced that the army had ``gone to war''
in Amador Hernandez because the hamlet sat on top of ``the largest
petroleum reserves in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Ministry quickly responded that there is no petroleum
worth exploiting in the vicinity. Then the rebel leader came out
with another of his whimsical missives, a folk tale full of Maya
wisdom about the virtue of perseverance. In the midst of the
dangerous tension, it seemed less insightful than surreal.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatista leader was soon eclipsed by the Chiapas governor,
Roberto Albores Guillen, an ally of Zedillo. Taking the jungle
standoff as a personal affront, he counterattacked by whipping up
the anti-Zapatista rage and state chauvinism of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patience of the people of Chiapas is running out,''
Albores warned in a stemwinder speech in a pro-government village.
``We can't allow a band of delinquents to hold our state hostage
any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the governor's speech, a mob of his Indian
supporters beat up a Mexican doctor and two foreigners on a rural
road, denouncing them as Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   But Albores' sharpest wrath was for Ofelia Medina, a former
television soap opera star who is one of the Zapatistas' best-known
Mexican supporters. Ms. Medina, in Indian garb and an elaborate
turban, slogged for nine hours through the underbrush to reach
Amador Hernandez and make a stand with the Zapatistas there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had it with little groups of radicals led by Ofelia
Medina who come to determine the destiny of Chiapas,'' Albores
said. The city council of San Cristobal de las Casas, the largest
city in the state's Indian region, declared Ms. Medina persona non
grata and ordered her to leave the state within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Finally federal officials stepped in to restrain Albores. Rabasa
noted in public statements that all Mexicans, including Ms. Medina,
enjoy constitutional rights to travel within their country and
express their ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But Rabasa's action came too late to stop Albores from saying
what everyone in Chiapas now holds true: that Zedillo's peace plan
has failed and the Zapatistas seem certain to wait until after the
presidential election next year before considering a return to
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have to say to the federal government is this: Let the
people of Chiapas handle our own problems,'' Albores told the
president testily in his speech. ``We're ready to take the
responsibility into our own hands _ and that's not just brave
talk.''

BOND YIELDS RISE AS PRICES DROP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)   By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond yields rose sharply Monday amid investor fears
that the Federal Reserve would increase short-term rates again in
the coming months as evidence of a strong economy continues to
mount.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day, in trading volume that was lighter than
normal, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 1 3/32 to
101, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose
to 6.05 percent, from 5.97 percent on Friday. It was the highest
level since Aug. 16, when the yield was 6.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With investors growing cautious, the market's tone has shifted
more toward selling rallies, traders said. Also weighing on the
market was concern about the supply of new debt issues, as
corporate treasurers scramble to sell securities before year-end.
The reluctance among investors to buy bonds as the year wears on
could lead to rising rates, as investors seek some reward for the
higher risk to which they feel they might be exposed if Year 2000
problems occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The massive supply of corporate debt has added to the
liquidity squeeze,'' said Sung Won Sohn, senior vice president and
chief economic officer at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. ``When
corporations issue debt, the underwriters selling that debt reduce
their exposure to losses by hedging those transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Securities dealers of corporate transactions often sell or swap
Treasuries ahead of these debt offerings, adding to the available
supply of government securities and thus placing upward pressure on
rates. The securities dealers then buy back Treasuries when the
corporate paper is in the hands of investors.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate supply calendar, however, is sparse this week,
before an expected flood of issuance after the Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed has signaled that it may be finished raising rates
for now, the door is not completely shut on further increases
should the economy not show signs of slowing. Monday's report on
new home sales in July took an unexpected rise to its
second-highest level on record, as sales rose one-tenth of 1
percent to an annualized rate of 980,000 units. Some analysts had
expected 910,000. The increase trailed only November 1998's annual
pace of 985,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sohn, citing labor shortages, the weakening dollar, economic
expansion abroad and a big rise in oil prices, said that the Fed
``is not finished with tightening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The inflation picture is likely to deteriorate,'' Sohn said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities,
thinks that bonds are vulnerable this week to the August National
Association of Purchasing Management report, due out on Wednesday,
which is expected to show a rebound after the outsized July
decline, as well as to the closely watched employment and payroll
report on Friday. Last week's report of a drop in initial jobless
claims suggests that this Friday's payroll figure is likely to be
strong, Ms. Cooper said, and the unemployment rate may well have
dipped a notch, to 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's weekly bill auction was in line with expectations, with
the three-month bill awarded at the high rate of 4.875 percent, up
from 4.85 percent a week earlier. The six-month maturity was
awarded at the high rate of 4.99 percent, up from 4.95 percent.
Noncompetitive bids were considered satisfactory for the
three-month bill, but a little soft for the six-month issue.

 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lately, a lot of investors have found one of the best things
about mutual funds is selling them.
</P>
<P>
   Don Matsanoff, 37, a commercial real estate broker in Columbus,
Ohio, cashed out of a Dreyfus mutual fund in July and spent $24,000
of the proceeds on a sport utility vehicle. After enjoying strong
returns for much of the 90s, he said, it was time to buy some
things he had put off while he let his profits ride.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his money remains in the market, he said, but he would
rather take a profit on some of it ``and use it for something, than
have it sit there and watch it go up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Columbus real estate broker, Wayne Harer, 47, recently
sold about $150,000 in fund shares to pay for home remodeling. He
could have obtained a home-equity or other loan, but with three
children and college expenses looming, ``I wanted to start
whittling down that debt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `I'll take this amount off the table,''' Harer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the market's record highs and volatile moves, many
investors have decided to sell some of their funds and use the
profit to remodel the bathroom, buy a new washing machine, take
that expensive vacation or splurge in some way.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, investors are cashing out stock mutual fund shares at
the highest rate in almost a dozen years. Though more money is
still flowing into funds than is being taken out, the pace at which
people have been selling fund shares has been growing faster than
the rate of purchases.
</P>
<P>
   This selling helps to explain the surge in consumer spending on
big-ticket items. Home sales have soared, car sales are on pace to
set a record, and retail sales have been very strong. By the way
the federal government measures things, consumers are spending more
than they earn.
</P>
<P>
   Investors typically sell 13 to 17 percent of their stock mutual
fund shares in any given year. But that rate has grown
substantially, and in July investors redeemed shares from fund
companies at an annual rate of 21.8 percent, according to figures
released Monday by the Investment Company Institute, a trade group
based in Washington. That is the highest level since December 1987,
when investors were pulling money out in the aftermath of the
October crash.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fund redemptions are not all being spent on
consumer goods. Some proceeds are being reinvested into other
funds, or perhaps into Internet stocks or other market darlings.
But economists and fund-company executives say those cannot account
for the strong pace of redemptions lately.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists say that the giant profits earned in stock
portfolios this decade have led individuals to spend far more than
they otherwise would, thus helping keep the economy _ and corporate
profits _ perking along. They break the ``wealth effect'' down like
this: For every $100 increase in net worth, a consumer will spend
an additional $3 or $4 a year.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent increases in stock prices, that has translated
into big spending gains. Total personal financial assets were $27.6
trillion as of March, nearly double the level at the end of 1992,
according to the Federal Reserve. That does not count gains in home
prices. Borrowings against increased home values ``influence
consumer outlays beyond the effects of gains from financial
assets,'' Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said
in a speech Friday, adding that run-ups in the prices of homes are
at least partly related to increases in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   The growing importance of investment gains means that central
bankers ``no longer have the luxury to look primarily to the flow
of goods and services, as conventionally estimated, when evaluating
the macroeconomic environment,'' Greenspan said. In other words,
central bankers must increasingly wrestle with the value of
consumers' stock portfolios, homes and personal debts when setting
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Though economists agree that investment gains play a large role
in consumer spending, they still differ on how significant the
effect. A study last month by two officials at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, for example, concluded that stock market
fluctuations affect current spending but ``changes in wealth in
this quarter do not portend significant changes in consumption one
or more quarters later.''
</P>
<P>
   The high rate of mutual-fund withdrawals suggests that consumers
have been selling investments at a quick pace to maintain and
upgrade their standard of living. Whether those sales continue,
especially if the market swoons, could have big implications for
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   A. Michael Lipper, chairman of the fund research company Lipper
Inc. in Summit, N.J., attributes some of the selling to the aging
population. ``A fair amount is due to people achieving their
retirement and resetting their financial'' goals, he said. ``People
are getting older.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also says that many others think the market may be
overvalued. ``They are reducing their equity commitment,'' Lipper
said.
</P>
<P>
   The high rate of fund redemptions unnerves John J. Brennan,
chief executive of the Vanguard Group, who says he cannot figure
why redemption rates would be higher now than during the market's
nearly 20 percent sell-off a year ago. ``That's the mysterious
issue now,'' he said. ``People who hung in last year are paring
back and taking some risk off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Investor optimism about the stock market has dropped sharply,
according to a PaineWebber Inc. poll of small investors. Optimism
is close to the lowest level in three years, with 55 percent of the
people surveyed optimistic and 18 percent pessimistic, according to
the poll, which was conducted early this month by the Gallup
Organization. The sample included 1,004 people with at least
$10,000 in assets to invest. When asked what they thought the
market would do in the next three months, 28 percent predicted it
would rise and 23 percent said it would fall.
</P>
<P>
   A lot more money is still flowing into stock mutual funds than
out, buoyed by stable streams of contributions to 401 (k),
Individual Retirement Accounts and other such plans, which workers
continue to sock away monthly to get tax breaks. After a rocky
period following the market's drop a year ago, net fund sales are
strong, if somewhat below the pace of the last two years. By this
measure _ investor purchases minus redemptions _ investors poured
$61.3 billion into stock funds in the second quarter and an
additional $12.3 billion last month, according to the Investment
Company Institute.
</P>
<P>
   As the popularity of mutual-fund ``supermarkets'' like Charles
Schwab &AMP; Co. has grown, some redemptions have gone into other
mutual funds, though economists say they doubt this accounts for
much of the rise in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supermarkets have been around awhile'' and can account for
only a small part of the sudden increase in stock fund redemptions,
said John Rea, the chief economist of the Investment Company
Institute. Moreover, investor switching within the same fund
families has stayed at about the same pace, as a percentage of
total fund assets, for a half-dozen years, by the trade group's
tally.
</P>
<P>
   Some money from some redemptions is going into other
investments, including stocks, as investors take advantage of low
commissions available through online trading. In fact, the
longstanding trend of investors selling shares of individual stocks
slowed in the first quarter after having risen sharply for many
years, according to data from the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Matsanoff, for example, the commercial real estate broker from
Columbus, has transferred some money from funds to individual
stocks in hopes of getting better returns. The fund he sold last
month was performing well. ``But my individual stocks were
performing better,'' he said. ``So when I decided which one I
should pick in order to write a check for the truck, I thought my
mutual fund was the way to go.''

   Although consumer debt levels and personal bankruptcies remain
high, many consumers have paid down debt recently or chosen to pay
for new purchases with cash rather than credit _ a trend also
attributed in part to the strong stock market. In a report this
month, Moody's Investors Service said that in the second quarter
consumers paid off the highest percentage of their credit-card debt
in a decade and that credit-card delinquency rates fell in June to
their lowest monthly level since April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the rising stock market has helped propel the
economy and strengthen the financial condition of the typical
American household, ``It's a two-edged sword,'' said David M.
Jones, chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co., a New York bond
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the stock market gets out of control, then there's a danger
that spending will be excessive,'' Jones said. ``And that will put
undue pressure on the labor market and kick off cost and price
pressures, forcing the Fed to tighten more than it might,''
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be a rude awakening,'' he added, ``for the stock
market, and consumers' balance sheets.''

IN REVERSAL, COURT RULES JOURNALISTS' NOTES CAN BE PROTECTED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas, La.)   (jw) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reversing itself, a federal appeals court has ruled
that journalists' notes and other unpublished or unbroadcast
materials are often protected from subpoenas in federal lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Manhattan, which was released on Friday, overturned a significant
aspect of a ruling issued by the same court in the same case last
September. A three-judge appeals panel had ruled then that federal
law recognized no privilege for journalists when people in civil
suits sought unpublished or unbroadcast material that was gathered
from nonconfidential sources.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, the defendant in the case, had argued that a qualified
privilege involving nonconfidential sources had long been
recognized by the 2nd Circuit and by other federal appeals courts.
NBC, joined by several other television networks and many major
newspapers, asked the appeals court to reconsider its decision.
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed in June to take up the issue again. In a
15-page decision, the judges agreed with NBC and the other news
organizations that there had been a long series of decisions,
dating back nearly 30 years, in which appeals judges in the 2nd
Circuit had recognized the existence of a qualified privilege.
Someone seeking to subpoena unbroadcast or unpublished materials
gathered from nonconfidential sources can do so only if the
material is likely to be relevant to his lawsuit and is obtainable
nowhere else, the appeals panel said.
</P>
<P>
   The judges did not explain their change of mind.
</P>
<P>
   The decision does not affect a related federal principle that
protects news organizations from disclosing information from
confidential sources. News organizations are also protected in New
York state courts from disclosing unpublished material from both
confidential and nonconfidential sources.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the latest decision affect the practical outcome of the
case, because NBC must still turn over copies of unbroadcast
videotapes that have been ruled essential to a civil rights lawsuit
in Louisiana, on the ground that they have overcome the general
privilege that the court recognized.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, a couple from Texas, Albert and Mary Gonzales,
sued a Louisiana deputy sheriff, Darrell Pierce, saying that he had
pulled them over on an interstate highway because they are
Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had served a subpoena on NBC seeking the complete,
unedited videotape from a segment of the show ``Dateline,'' which
was broadcast in January 1997. The report examined whether law
enforcement officers in Louisiana had pulled over drivers because
of their race or nationality or because they were from out of
state; it included videotape of Pierce as he stopped a car with
Florida license plates that was driven by an NBC producer.
</P>
<P>
   NBC challenged the subpoena, citing the qualified privilege. In
September 1997, U.D. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. ruled that
there was such a privilege for material gathered from
nonconfidential sources but said that the Gonzaleses had met the
tests for disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court, in its first decision last September, said
the couple was entitled to the unedited videotape because there was
no general protection on nonconfidential material. The latest
ruling generally agrees with Judge Baer's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Weiner, a lawyer for NBC, said the network was ``very
pleased that the court has once again recognized that
nonconfidential material is protected by a journalist's privilege
and that civil litigants cannot have ready access to material.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC is considering whether to appeal the decision that the
Gonzaleses meet the test to overcome the privilege to protect
unbroadcast material, and that it thus must turn over the
videotape, Ms. Weiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Sanders Jr., the lawyer for the Gonzaleses, noted that, in
its latest decision, the appeals panel had weakened somewhat the
standard that must be met by someone seeking material from
nonconfidential sources. The requested material must now be
relevant to the court case; in the past it had to be essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does seem to be an appropriate compromise,'' Sanders
said.

DRAPER DIDN'T WALK AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The show goes on, and Scotty Draper went on with it.
For one day.
</P>
<P>
   One bleak Monday, when slate-gray clouds enshrouded Flushing
Meadow, and a wind like Pete Sampras's serve cut across the courts
and plazas, leading the customers to raise their collars and duck
into jackets and sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   No one felt bleaker than Draper out on Court 7, his thoughts,
like the day, ``very clouded.'' Still, he was part of the show
called the US Tennis Championships. Running for a 119th consecutive
year, it always goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Players have marched off to a variety of conflicts, including
the Spanish-American War and World Wars I and II. Hurricanes and
other inclemencies have taken bites out of the schedule. ``I waited
a week in the hotel for the '38 hurricane to blow out so I could
complete my Grand Slam,'' says Don Budge. Yet the tournament has
endured into old age. First at Newport, R.I. Then Forest Hills.
Now, a few miles down the road.
</P>
<P>
   It was opening day, and the original stadium, refurbished with
red brick facing and named for a neighborhood guy, Louis Armstrong,
gleamed like the trumpet he played with such style and feeling.
Gleaming as well on pedestals within the stadium's new museum are
US championship trophies loaned by the Hall of Fame, having been
won by such bygone luminaries as Bill Tilden and Helen Wills Moody,
Alice Marble and Titanic survivor Dick Williams. You almost could
hear Armstrong tooting, ``As the Saints Go Marchin' In.''
</P>
<P>
   If Draper, a young Australian lefthander, had any familiarity
with the works of the singing horn player, the dirge, ``St. James
Infirmary,'' might have run through his mind. And Louis rasping:
``Went down to St. James Infirmary/To see my baby there,/Stretched
out on a long white table,/So young so clean so fair . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Opening day was closing day for Draper, as it was for all the
first-round losers. No tragedy in that. The hardest part for him
was merely showing up because his tragedy had occurred July 19, the
death of his 23-year-old wife, Kellie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I didn't want to come,'' Draper said after an
obviously dispirited loss to an ex-NCAA champ out of Stanford, Paul
Goldstein, 6-3, 6-1, 6-0. ``My heart didn't want to come here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think you can't walk away. You're not going to get
anywhere in life just walking away from things.''
</P>
<P>
   And Draper, 25, a very good player who made the last 16 of the
US Open two years ago, didn't walk away from the woman he loved
even though her life expectancy wasn't terrific. Afflicted with
cystic fibrosis from childhood, she was a long shot to go past her
teens. Nevertheless, he married her almost two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had five years together _ and now I have that,'' he said.
``That's really something for me to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellie Grieg Draper was always ``rugged-out,'' said an Aussie
friend, using a homeland expression for somebody wearing a heavy
coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had trouble keeping warm,'' said Scotty. ``Her illness.
The breathing could be tough, and we had plans for a lung
transplant. We thought that would help a lot. She was doing all
right, and we didn't expect her to die . . . now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at Wimbledon, and she was home. She caught a cold.
Didn't seem like much, but suddenly she was very sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Draper had the bad luck to draw Sampras in the first round at
Wimbledon. Much worse luck was in the wings, at home in Brisbane.
He got there for Kellie's last days.
</P>
<P>
   She died the day Australia clinched the Davis Cup quarterfinal
over the US, 3-2, at Boston. Aussie captain John Newcombe was
notified, but Draper asked that the awful news be kept from his
Queensland mate, Patrick Rafter, and the others. He wanted nothing
to deter them.
</P>
<P>
   His US Open lasted 81 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I knew three weeks ago when I left home to come over
here that it was going to be difficult,'' he said. ``It's just
difficult to concentrate on the court. It's going to take some time
to get through this period. But I wanted to play when there was no
pressure on myself to perform. Just to get over, get a lot out of
the way, see all the guys. Maybe next time, when I start full-on,
all this behind, and I can concentrate.''
</P>
<P>
   His foe, Goldstein, said, ``It's a match you play with heavy
heart because you feel for Scotty.'' Goldstein shares the general
feeling of these nomads: ``Scotty is one of the most liked, most
respected people on tour. For him to step out there and play . . .
he's all class.''
</P>
<P>
   Draper apologized to Goldstein for a poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want Paul to think I disrespected him, like I wasn't
trying,'' said Draper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `My head just wasn't in it, mate,' '' said
Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard, but it was also the Aussie code. If you're not
hurt, you play. Draper was hurt where it didn't show, but he
carried on. He knew from the beginning Kellie was sick, and he
carried on.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it wasn't hard to go into marriage,'' he said. ``You say
for better or worse _ you're marrying the person. Whatever they
bring, they bring. Whatever problems. You marry because you love
that person. The quality of time you spend with her is the most
important. I'd do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   He took her to Paris in 1996, and took her up her high, looking
at the city from the top of the Eiffel Tower. A year later they
went back, same place, and another high: Scotty gave her an
engagement ring. This terrible low doesn't negate the highs, he
feels.
</P>
<P>
   The show goes on without Scotty, but he didn't walk away from it
or Kellie.

RAMON MARTINEZ TO PITCH THURSDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- At long last, Pedro the Younger will be joined by
Ramon the Elder. In the Martinez brothers, the Red Sox will have
siblings pitching together on the same team for the first time in
the 99-year history of the Olde Towne Team.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams summoned reporters into his office Monday
to announce that Ramon Martinez, who has not pitched in the big
leagues in 14 1/2 months because of shoulder surgery, will make his
Boston debut Thursday, when he is scheduled to start against the
Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who won 123 games in 11 seasons for the Los Angeles
Dodgers and whose career that includes a 20-win season (1990), an
18-strikeout game (1990), and a no-hitter (1995), will be on an
85-pitch count and will be followed to the mound by knuckleballer
Tim Wakefield, who has served as the staff starter, closer, and
Band-Aid this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's best in our minds to do it in that sequence,'' Williams
said. ``Ramon first, Wakefield second. That's what we're going to
do. Give it a shot. Especially when the kid came into my office
(Sunday) and said he's ready to pitch, he wants to pitch and help
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, who made 14 saves when he replaced Tom Gordon as the
closer, was just recently returned to the rotation and made two
starts, losing 6-0 to the Texas Rangers and getting no decision in
a 7-6 win over the Angels on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He accepted this new change in assignment in his usual stoic
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No big deal,'' said Wakefield, whose won-lost record (4-9)
belies his value to the club this season, one in which he not only
bailed out the bullpen but performed a similar service for Bret
Saberhagen when the sore-shouldered pitcher was able to go just two
innings in his last start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it,'' Wakefield said. ``This is the best way to
try and do it. My understanding of it is they're going to give
Ramon a shot, see if he can pitch here, instead of giving him
another minor league rehab start. What's the sense of sending him
on another rehab start? He's got to start here sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's logical for me to back him up out of the pen, because
it's my day to throw and it's easier for me to get loose, because
I've done it (relieved). And what if he can only go two innings?
Why deplete the bullpen?''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, without elaborating, insisted that Wakefield will
remain in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my decision,'' Wakefield said. ``But they told me I'm
definitely a starter. Will we go to six starters? I don't know. But
I'm not worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams ruled out a six-man rotation. A likely scenario, if
Martinez proves he can contribute: Wakefield could come back Sunday
on two days' rest and take the place of the ineffective Mark
Portugal in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez, 31, will serve as the bookend to a series in
which Pedro Martinez, 28, pitched the opener. The elder Martinez
last pitched for the Dodgers on June 14, 1998, and 16 days later
underwent rotator cuff surgery on his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   After signing with the Red Sox as a free agent in March,
Martinez made 10 rehabilitation assignments in the minor leagues,
the last one coming last Thursday for Triple A Pawtucket. In all,
he threw 36 innings and had a 2-1 record with a 3.73 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing a side session in the Sox bullpen on Sunday,
Martinez told Williams he was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very long time,'' said Martinez, who is the
taller, more reserved, and more mature of the brothers (or, as one
press box observer noted, Wally to Pedro's more excitable Beaver).
</P>
<P>
   Once known for a fastball that topped out around 95 miles an
hour, Martinez estimates that his velocity is around 86-88.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're young, what do you think? You're going to blow
everybody away,'' Martinez said. ``Ten years later, you don't have
a 95 mile-an-hour fastball. What do you do? You use your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he is pleased with the way he has recaptured
command of his pitches but warned against great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect to pitch a shutout or go nine innings,'' he
said. ``I just want to go out there and do the best I can, get some
innings for the team and help them out.''

WORRIES OF A 3RD RATE INCREASE PULL STOCKS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices fell for the third consecutive session
Monday, pulled down by worries that in early October the Federal
Reserve may increase short-term interest rates for a third time
this year.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger-than-expected report on new-home sales for July and
an earnings warning from a big personal automobile insurer combined
to raise anxiety during morning trading. A selloff in the bond
market, which pushed yields on long-term Treasury bonds to 6.05
percent, compounded the worries.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a broad decline in equity prices, one that sent
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index to its biggest loss in nearly
six weeks and battered financial service and transportation stocks.
The S&AMP;P 500 fell 24.25 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,324.02.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 176.04 points, or 1.6
percent, to 10,914.13. Financial stocks like American Express and
J.P. Morgan accounted for much of the drop.
</P>
<P>
   Big losses in American International Group, the multinational
insurance company, Bank of America and America Online generated the
biggest loss in the S&AMP;P 500 index since July 20.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy NASDAQ composite shed 46.21 points, or 1.7
percent, to 2,712.69.
</P>
<P>
   With many investors on vacation, trading volume was light: On
the New York Stock Exchange, about 610 million shares changed
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, traders and analysts were not willing to say the lack of
activity was a positive sign for the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people will say that because volume is light this
selloff doesn't mean anything,'' said William Meehan, chief market
analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. ``I am not so sure. I told our
clients this morning that this week is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan and others are concerned that if reports later in the
week _ particularly the August employment data, due on Friday _
portray an economy that is showing few signs of slowing down, the
Federal Reserve Board will be forced to raise short-term interest
rates again in early October.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in sentiment, which the new-home sales numbers helped
to promote, comes only days after most traders seemed convinced
that last week's rate increase by the Fed was the last of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is just a replay of the cycle we played out in
June, the last time the Fed bumped rates,'' said Michael Clarm,
head of U.S. stock trading at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into that increase with tremendous negative sentiment,
and we did the same thing going in to last week. Now the
anticipation is gone and we are still wondering if there is another
hike down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the threat posed by higher interest rates,
insurance and financial service company stocks were hurt by an
announcement late Friday from Progressive Corp., the nation's
fourth-largest personal automobile insurer, that it would miss
earnings estimates for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Progressive, an S&AMP;P component, fell 16 1/4, to 102 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement dragged down other insurance company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate, the largest publicly traded car insurer, fell 1 13/16,
to 33 11/16. And Safeco Corp. lost 1 9/16, to 34 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Diversified financial service company stocks also slumped. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's financial stock index fell 5.34 points, or 3.9
percent, to 130.36. Citigroup fell 2 1/4 to 44 3/4. American
Express dropped 4 15/16, to 139 11/16. General Electric, parent of
GE Capital, fell 2 5/16, to 114 1/4. And J.P. Morgan lost 3, to 130
3/4.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, it was a pretty good day for drug stocks.
Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 5/8, to 72 1/4. Eli Lilly rose 1 1/8,
to 76 3/8. Pfizer rose 1/4, to 38 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares, including many Internet companies, fell after
AT&AMP;T, following similar moves by MCI WorldCom and Sprint, announced
the introduction of a discount long-distance rate. AT&AMP;T fell 1 1/2,
to 46. MCI/Worldcom dropped 2 7/16, to 76 1/16.

   NEW YORK _ Gilles Dufour, the new ready-to-wear designer at
Balmain, was in town recently to go over details for his first
American store appearance, at Saks Fifth Avenue on Sept. 9. Dufour,
who has the swept-back demeanor of a 1970s French film star, was
Karl Lagerfeld's assistant at Chanel for 15 years, and it's no
exaggeration to say that his rapid style of speech is oddly
familiar. ``It's Karl,'' Dufour conceded. ``If I don't talk fast,
I'm afraid I'll sound stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Dufour is too modest. His first Balmain show, in Paris last
March, drew a throng of admirers, including Catherine Deneuve, Lee
Radziwill Ross and Claudia Schiffer. The clothes were young with a
knowing French accent _ tweed blazers with tiny flowers embroidered
on the cuffs; snappy broadcloth shirts with white, oversize
collars, and the occasional gamine town coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Balmain, I wanted a change from the old, jolie madame look
to one that is more wearable and hip, for the woman who moves,''
Dufour said. He suddenly looked nonplused. ``Maybe I'm repeating
the stuff I said before.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But given Oscar de la Renta's success in designing
Balmain haute couture and the fact that Saks will carry the
ready-to-wear line at five other branches, including Dallas and
Beverly Hills, Dufour is eager to make his own mark. One thing he
has done that should make a difference with American customers, he
said, is to combine the easy fit of Italian sportswear with the
insouciant details of French fashion. ``It's a little bit _ how do
you say _ `twisted,''' he said. When it was suggested to Dufour
that his clothes looked sophisticated but not (yawn) overly
elegant, he beamed. ``Write that,'' he demanded. ``That's it
exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   Dufour, who is to be the guest of honor at a private dinner at
La Grenouille the night before he attempts to razzle-dazzle
customers, added that he had received a number of congratulatory
notes from American designers in Paris, including Marc Jacobs and
Michael Kors. ``All the American designers have been very
supportive,'' Dufour said. ``But not the French.'' He shrugged and
smiled. ``I'm not naive.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BETTING ON 01-01-00
</P>
<P>
   For years, as a store designer, Kenneth H. Walker was more
elaborate stage manager than show-stopping personality. It was
Walker's firm, Walker Group/CNI, that helped to give Burdine's a
youthful look in the early 1970s and that later in the decade
created Henri Bendel's Shoe Biz, probably the swingiest shoe salon
in town. Nowadays, though, Walker is kind of an advance man for the
new millennium, his picture popping up in publications like People
and Forbes. All because he had the foresight in 1994 to apply for a
trademark for the numbers 01-01-00.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty,'' he said, ``I liked the way it looked. It
also wasn't language-dependent. You know what it means whether you
speak Chinese, French or English.''
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting about Walker's venture is not that the
trademark process cost him $500,000 in attorney fees or that the
logo appears on 1,000 different products in 14 categories (from
clocks to caps) or even that he and his partners could see sales
``go north of $100 million,'' as he put it. The intriguing thing is
how poorly fashion merchandise with the numbers has fared.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, when he began opening 01-01-00 boutiques in
department stores like Bloomingdale's and J.C. Penney, he predicted
that fashion would account for 60 percent of sales, with items like
mugs and picture frames taking up the slack. But by the end of
1998, he said, ``There was a ton of apparel left over.'' Apparently
he was ahead of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Now that there are only 122 days left before the corks fly,
Walker says he expects to see more demand for millennium fun wear,
like evening bags and black stretch sheaths studded with
``01-01-00'' in rhinestones. But are fabric suppliers and clothing
manufacturers willing to gamble now with inventories to meet
last-minute party demands in December? To put it another way, what
do you do with a couple thousand millennial frocks on Jan. 2?
</P>
<P>
   As Walker said, ``My biggest problem has been taking on a whole
industry that is risk-averse, and getting it to take a chance on
something.'' &QL;

CRENSHAW SAVORS THE COUNTRY CLUB EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE _ Monday's restful interlude on the way to the 33d
Ryder Cup at The Country Club may have been Ben Crenshaw's calm
after the storm. Or was it merely the calm before the storm that
may kick up when his players take on the Europeans Sept. 24-26?
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw, who became upset when certain players talked more
about sharing the wealth than the joy of victory, showed up Monday
for a practice round with eight members of the team that will seek
to win Sam Ryder's cup for the first time since a 15-13 triumph at
The Belfry in Sutton Coldfield, England, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara, and Tom Lehman had prior commitments
and Davis Love was getting medical attention for a nerve problem in
his neck, but the group on hand in bright breezy conditions was
headed by David Duval, one of those singled out for criticism by
Crenshaw. Also on hand were Payne Stewart, Hal Sutton, Justin
Leonard, Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson, Jeff Maggert, and captain's
pick Steve Pate.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw got in the eye of the storm following remarks by Woods,
Duval, O'Meara, and Mickelson over the PGA of America's
distribution of money from this event, but he was completely at
ease in a location he loves and on a course where he advanced to
the quarterfinals of the US Juniors in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greatest honor for an American professional golfer to
be captain,'' said Crenshaw. ``I'm very emotional about it. It's a
great honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Pate, Love, Sutton, O'Meara, and Stewart have played this
course, which was restored by architect Rees Jones prior to the US
Open in 1988. Ten of the first 20 players in the world rankings are
on the US team; just four of the first 20 are on the European
roster. Crenshaw's major assignment is to guard against
overconfidence, make sure the storm warnings are in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted them to go out, relax, have a little fun, but really
study it,'' said Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person getting here for the first time has to understand
what a special place this is. There are very few places in golf
that have atmosphere like this. I wanted them to experience this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a day of learning for us, and a day to be together.
It's important for us to be together. It's a golf course that takes
a long time to learn, and you can't see it enough. This is a large
part of preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   The first glitch could be Love. He was scheduled to see Dr.
Frank Jobe Monday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was having trouble with it at the PGA,'' said Crenshaw.
``He's played a lot and he's playing well. He's having it looked
at.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Love be unable to play, the replacement would be the No.
11 man on the points list, Bob Estes.
</P>
<P>
   Once the competition approaches, Crenshaw must piece together
the pairings for the first two days of foursomes and alternate-shot
matches and determining the playing order.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to put all of your thoughts into the one week
of practice,'' he said. ``It's still important to consider how
they're playing at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be talking to all of them. That's my job. Some captains
want the steadiest players to go into the alternate-shot
competition. It's a rudimentary procedure at this point. When I
look at my team, there aren't a lot of holes. There's nobody who's
appreciably shorter. That's important, because you're not playing
too many different shots into the greens. You still have to have
your thinking cap on when you go out to play any of these holes.''
</P>
<P>
   The great known/unknown is Woods, who is playing a different
game, as evidenced by his victories in the PGA Championship at
Medinah and the $5 million NEC Invitational that ended Sunday in
Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tough thing,'' said Crenshaw, ``because nobody
plays like him. They're all at the top of their game, but it's very
difficult to find someone who plays a game like Tiger. There's a
lot of interchangeable parts, but there's not a lot of holes in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is the course, where the rough will not be US
Open length.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course doesn't favor one team or the other,'' said
Crenshaw. ``There's definitely the flavor of the British Isles. It
reflects something that's beautifully natural. It's not heavily
manicured, so you do feel you're playing against a piece of ground
and piece of art. The great thing is it's a great test for
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel every moment we can spend together is golden. That's
why I enjoyed today so much. They were together. I told them before
they left, `I want you to know what the other guy's thinking.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't fall out on this golf course and expect to learn it.
On the other side of the column is team, camaraderie, and being
together. They know they're favored, but that doesn't mean a thing
Ryder Cup week.''

STOCK PRICE STAY DISTANT FROM FED MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wyo., Kan., N.J., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. _ Like the narrator in a Greek drama, Yutaka
Yamaguchi, deputy governor of Japan's central bank, took the
lectern here and sadly described how the booming Japanese economy
in the late 1980s came to tragedy. His description of Japan at its
peak sounded eerily parallel to America in today's still evolving
boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``A question haunts us to this day,'' Yamaguchi said. Would
different policies have prevented the terrible crash of Japan's
stock market and real estate prices and the decade-long recession
that has followed? ``With hindsight,'' he said, ``such excellent
performance was unsustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, listened
from the front row of long, narrow tables in the hotel conference
room. Gene Sperling, President Clinton's chief assistant for
economic policy, sat in the next row, just behind Greenspan. And
most of the Fed's top policy makers _ the men and women with their
hands on the crucial levers of the economy that control short-term
interest rates _ were scattered through the crowded hall, with its
invitation-only audience of prominent economists and high-level
foreign officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's annual two-day gathering at Jackson Lake
Lodge, across a vast green meadow and sparkling lake from the
breathtaking Tetons range, has evolved from an informal
get-together organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City
as a late August escape for central bankers into a high-powered
forum for debating the issues that shape economies around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The big topic this year was the ever-rising American stock
market. And almost as if they were staging a play, the Fed
officials chose to act out, through research papers and speeches,
how they were coping with its hard-to-control impact.
</P>
<P>
   Yamaguchi played the heavy. Reviewing all that the Bank of Japan
had done and failed to do, he left open the possibility that the
Fed might also make mistakes, falling victim to roughly the same
forces that brought down Japan in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a bubble in the American stock market,'' he said
in an interview, ``the outcome is difficult to predict when it
collapses.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Yamaguchi's narration was foreboding, many of the
Americans here said the last act of their own drama would end
differently. The Japanese lesson has been well learned, they say.
Further, the financial system in the United States, after its own
wrenching changes early this decade, does not suffer from the debt
problems that were Japan's real undoing after its stock market
bubble burst.
</P>
<P>
   American real estate is nowhere near as inflated as Japanese
property in the late '80s when, on the eve of the collapse, the
land under Tokyo's Imperial Palace was supposedly worth more than
all of California.
</P>
<P>
   And if Wall Street crashes? Well, the Fed stands ready to
minimize the damage, particularly with Greenspan still at the helm.
After all, in the October 1987 market debacle, his skills in this
department were aptly demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the discussion about crashes, we forget that the
Greenspan Fed will react,'' said Mark Gertler, a New York
University economist and the co-author, with Ben Bernanke of
Princeton, of a new research paper that outlines how a central bank
should proceed, particularly in the presence of very high stock
prices. The Fed commissioned the study after learning that the
research by Gertler and Bernanke reflected the thinking of Fed
policy makers.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan carried his own suitcase when he came to these annual
conferences in his early days as Fed chairman. Now, he moves about
with an entourage of Secret Service agents. He has become a
bigger-than-life figure in American public life, getting
considerable credit for the nation's prosperity in recent years but
likely to be the target of considerable blame if things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   So well known is his face that several of the tourists who
shared the hotel with the conference delegates got as big a kick
out of sighting Greenspan in the lobby as they did sighting moose
from the hotel's huge back veranda.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an increasing need to integrate into our macro models
more complete descriptions of the responses of households and
businesses to risk,'' Greenspan said in a speech on Friday,
referring to the risks people take in buying stocks and real estate
when prices are rising.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices in particular have become an increasingly
significant subject of discussion at the Fed's periodic,
closed-door policy meetings, where interest rates are set. ``As
time goes on,'' said Edward Kelley Jr., a Fed governor, ``different
parts of the economy have a greater impact than others. It was oil
in the '70s, the very high dollar in the '80s, and there is little
question that in today's world, the stock market is a very
important component of the overall economy.''
</P>
<P>
   What role should the stock market play in shaping central bank
policies? According to Bernanke and Gertler, the Fed quite
correctly sets a flexible inflation target, an average to be
achieved that now appears to be roughly 2 percent. Indeed, that is
close to the actual annual rise in the Consumer Price Index these
days. When inflation drifts above this level, or seems to be in the
process of doing so, the Fed, in line with flexible inflation
targeting, generally pushes up rates to try to slow the economy.
And when economic conditions change in ways that suggest the
inflation rate will fall below the target, rates are usually pushed
down to stimulate borrowing and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Always the output of goods and services is kept in mind: if the
demand exceeds the potential supply, then rates go up, and if the
opposite occurs, they go down.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices themselves, in this approach, should never be a
target of interest rate policy. And in the Fed's deliberations,
Bernanke and Gertler concluded, inflation has been the target, a
point Greenspan also made in his speech here. Stock prices have
been dealt with only as one component of inflation _ along with
rising wages, shifting oil prices and the changing value of the
dollar among others.
</P>
<P>
   Rising stock prices can feed through to inflation by making
people feel wealthier, and companies too. They spend or invest the
new wealth or borrow against it and spend the borrowings. Demand
rises and, if it exceeds the capability of the economy to deliver
more goods and services, eventually the inflation rate should rise,
too.
</P>
<P>
   But are stock prices too high? They have risen, on average, 25
percent a year for five years, an unprecedented run. Or has the
United States entered a new era of greater efficiency and
profitability that justifies the higher prices?
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, is the spending that emanates from rising stock
prices excessive and inflationary? A number of the people here said
so off the record, outside the conference room. Greenspan and his
colleagues, however, insist that they do not know. And in that
Hamlet-like failure to decide may lie the makings of a painful
mistake: namely the Fed's failure to raise interest rates
sufficiently to counteract the inflationary pressures coming from
overvalued stocks, but not yet evident in the inflation numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Japan fell into this mistake, Yamaguchi said. ``The CPI stayed
close to zero for three years through 1988, while real growth
accelerated to 5 percent per year from less than 4 percent in the
early 1980s,'' he said. The impression grew that interest rates, in
the absence of visible inflation, would stay low. And with Japanese
interest rates low, the vision of healthy economic growth
stretching endlessly into the future _ a vision popular in America
today _ kept stock and real estate prices rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lag between rapid growth and the eventual rise in
inflation happened to be longer,'' Yamaguchi said. ``but the
linkage didn't disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   When inflation did finally materialize, the Bank of Japan pushed
up interest rates, giving the false impression, Yamaguchi said,
that Japan had fallen into the most fatal flaw of all: pushing up
rates to puncture the stock market bubble and not simply to fight
inflation. ``We have never targeted asset prices,'' Yamaguchi
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Many outsiders disagree, arguing that Japanese officials left
the clear impression at the time that they intended through higher
interest rates to ease down the stock market because they feared
the consequences of the market bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Bernanke and Gertler furnished a happier
ending for America. Stick to inflation targeting, they say, and if
there is a stock market bubble, let it burst. Acting much more
quickly than the Japanese did, the Fed will reverse course,
lowering interest rates and encouraging lending, thus minimizing
the damage. The main potential damage is from falling prices
(deflation) and from the unwillingness of frightened lenders to
keep lending.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think that overreaction is a source of panic,
confidence is restored if the private sector sees that the Fed will
react,'' Gertler said, arguing that Greenspan's quick actions after
the stock market crash in 1987 and the Russian default last year
demonstrated his crisis skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people have confidence that the Fed will stabilize the
economy,'' Gertler said, ``that in itself will be a stabilizing
force.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, American banks are far healthier than Japan's
in 1990, without the mountain of bad debt, chiefly in real estate,
that Japan's market crash revealed. That in itself will diminish
the damage from a sharp decline in stocks, Gertler and Bernanke
argued. And Yamaguchi agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a nagging worry remained. Is there more indebtedness and
danger of default than the conference presenters acknowledged,
perhaps among homeowners, hedge funds or other investors in the
stock market?
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Crockett, general manager of the Bank for International
Settlements, raised that possibility. ``Unpredictable things can
happen,'' he said. ``If there is a bubble and it breaks, people can
turn out to have debts you did not realize were there.''

ROAD DISPUTE REVIVES ZAPATISTA FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico _ A spat over a dirt road
through a soggy jungle has reignited the clash between the
government and Zapatista rebels in the Mexican state of Chiapas,
showing that five years of efforts by President Ernesto Zedillo to
bring peace to the Indian region have failed.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began in mid-August when masked Zapatistas formed a
human barrier in a faraway rain forest hamlet to block the
government from opening a roadway into their main stronghold. Army
troops flew in to clear the way, activating tensions that led to
the first direct skirmishes between the two sides in more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Zapatistas and soldiers are still staring at
each other angrily across a coil of concertina wire in a humid
clearing.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation with the Zapatistas, which Zedillo inherited
when he took office in December 1994, has proved to be one of the
noisiest and most intractable issues of his administration. The
clamor for peace came not only from Mexicans but also from devotees
of the masked guerrillas, and their pro-Indian cause, in the United
States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The president pledged time and again to engage the Zapatistas in
negotiations to settle the conflict and to expand the rights of
Mexico's indigenous peoples.
</P>
<P>
   But as Zedillo prepares for Sept. 1, when he will give his last
state of the union address before becoming a lame-duck leader in an
election year, protagonists on all sides have given up on a
resolution or even renewed talks before he steps down in November
of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Since early 1998, Zedillo has pursued a double-barreled
strategy. On one hand troops have borne down on the Zapatistas,
patrolling and setting up bases all around them but avoiding
head-on fights. Meanwhile, the government lavished resources on
Chiapas for health clinics, land reform, power lines and roads in a
bid to draw Indians away from the rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy has been so successful that the Zapatistas are
trying to block it,'' said Emilio Rabasa Gamboa, the federal
government's top official for Chiapas.

<P>
   BBDO NEW YORK, known for its television commercials for longtime
clients like Pepsi-Cola, Visa and Frito-Lay, is making a big push
into the exploding business of Internet marketing with the opening
of a new agency dedicated to interactive marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Called (at)tmosphere, the new shop is BBDO New York's vision of
a hybrid agency that marries the technical ability of Internet
marketing with traditional advertising techniques. To fulfill that
vision, the firm is bringing in the top BBDO senior creative
director, Mike Campbell, as its managing director. Campbell has
worked on virtually all of BBDO's top accounts, creating memorable
TV spots that have included the comical Donald and Ivana Trump spot
for Pizza Hut and the much-publicized Mario Cuomo-Ann Richards spot
for Doritos.
</P>
<P>
   The new shop opens with capitalized billings of about $25
million from BBDO clients like Visa USA and General Electric and
assignments for Federal Express, Frito-Lay, M&AMP;M/Mars and Pepsi One.
That places (at)tmosphere squarely in the middle of the pack of the
top 100 interactive ad agencies compiled by Advertising Age, the
trade publication. In comparison, the nation's top interactive shop
USWeb/CKS in Santa Clara, Calif., had $125.3 million in revenue
last year, up from $54 million.
</P>
<P>
   BBDO's move may foreshadow a coming consolidation in the
interactive agency world as the Web has evolved from a hip, young
medium into mainstream big business. Last year, $1.03 billion was
spent on Internet advertising, up from $544 million in 1997,
according to Intermedia Advertising Solutions, a unit of the Dutch
conglomerate VNU Marketing Information Services.
</P>
<P>
   BBDO's new agency is late to the field. Many of the big Madison
Avenue agencies have prominent interactive shops, like Ogilvy
Interactive and Grey Interactive. ``They're late to market,'' said
Marissa Gluck, an analyst with Jupiter Communications in New York,
an online research firm ``I think they're going to have a tough
time of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But BBDO said it believed its timing was actually opportune
because the interactive business is now out of its infancy and
ready for the skills of top-notch creatives. BBDO New York is part
of BBDO Worldwide, which is ranked by Advertising Age as the
world's third-largest ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen the engineering, the strategic planning and the
placement, but we haven't seen breakthrough ways of interacting
with consumers on the Internet _ no one is doing world-class
creative,'' said Bill Katz, BBDO New York's president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Sann, BBDO's co-chief executive and chief creative officer,
said: ``When you talk about building brands, that's not happening
yet on the Internet. No one has cracked that code _ we're still in
the very early stages of development.''
</P>
<P>
   BBDO Interactive, an in-house department that was mainly a media
buying unit. The new agency will be involved in all aspects of
Internet marketing _ from advertising to Web site development to
strategy _ and will operate independently in its own offices apart
from BBDO headquarters. The new agency, which will report to BBDO
New York, will also seek its own new accounts.
</P>
<P>
   BBDO's parent company, Omnicom Group, has also been intricately
involved in the Internet and was one of the early investors in the
fledgling interactive business via its Communicade unit, a
portfolio of investments in interactive, E-commerce, digital design
and technology companies. Omnicom has a stake in several
independent interactive shops, including Organic, Razorfish, Red
Sky and agency.com.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, (at)tmosphere will be headed by a Communicade senior
consultant, Susan Pinkwater, who becomes the new agency's president
and chief executive. Earlier, Ms. Pinkwater worked at agency.com,
and even earlier, ``in another life'' she was a social worker.
</P>
<P>
   In her work for Communicade, Ms. Pinkwater said she was
delighted by the technical abilities of interactive shops, but was
frustrated by the limited understanding of brand strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to create a new kind of agency that addresses branding,
quality of creative and the big picture, and works with ad agencies
instead of against them,'' said Ms. Pinkwater, who added that the
staff of 25 was from both traditional advertising and Internet
shops
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Gluck of Jupiter said advertising agencies had not made
an easy transition to the Internet. BBDO's stellar creative
reputation may have less meaning in the interactive ad world, where
the hottest shops started as fledgling independents that have grown
up with the Internet, she said.
</P>
<P>
   `A lot of the traditional agencies are very stuck in their ways
and not really open to the pace and flexibility that the Internet
requires,'' Ms. Gluck said. ``They haven't shifted their mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Gluck noted that it might be more economical to start
up a shop and take talent from the field than to buy a shop
outright because the valuations of many interactive shops ``are
astronomical.'' Several shops have gone public and there are rumors
about more initial public offerings ahead, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Campbell _ who said joining (at)tmosphere felt a little like
``being Joe Kennedy before the Court of St. James's'' _
(at)tmosphere has an edge because as interactive communications
have evolved, they demand classic branding techniques. In their
early experimental stages, interactive ads often had a completely
different image than traditional (i.e. off-line) advertising and
that diffused the message, he said. Interactive advertising _ like
all advertising _ must go back to the core image of the brand, and
that puts a big creative powerhouse like BBDO at an advantage, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tools are different, the medium is different, but what's
the same is how you bring a brand to life in a creative powerful
way with a big idea,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gluck likened the situation to the 1980s when the big shops
gobbled up specialized medical agencies en masse with the growth of
consumer health care marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be more consolidation among the larger
agencies _ I think the traditional agencies are playing catch-up,''
Ms. Gluck said.
</P>
<P>
   Katz agreed that consolidation was coming, but said it was
premature to discuss. Still, he said, BBDO New York will succeed in
the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``However it happens, it happens,'' he said.

MARC LUSTGARTEN, BUILDER OF MEDIA AND SPORTS EMPIRE, DIES AT 52  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Mass.)  By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marc A. Lustgarten, a principal architect of
Cablevision's growth in cable television and programming for the
past two decades and the chairman of its Madison Square Garden
subsidiary since 1997, died Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center. He was 52 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Lustgarten joined Cablevision in 1975 as assistant general
counsel and quickly became instrumental in helping to transform
what was then solely a Long Island cable television system into a
broad-based entertainment and sports colossus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just starting sports then, and we had an arrangement
with Roy Boe to telecast Islanders games,'' Charles F. Dolan, the
founder and chairman of Cablevision, said, referring to the
Islanders' owner at the time. ``I said, `Marc, here's the deal, go
make a contract with Roy.' He lost himself in that for a few weeks
and did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Lustgarten was renowned for his ability to interpret Dolan's
vision, which could be obscure or difficult to comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put the pieces together that allowed Cablevision to
maneuver the course from a small suburban cable company to the most
powerful media company in New York,'' said Tom Rogers, the chairman
of NBC Cable.
</P>
<P>
   Lustgarten could be a gruff and abrupt executive, who sometimes
played the tough cop to Dolan's understated good cop demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he would also ``go to bat for those who weren't in agreement
with Chuck to let you know that he tried to soften up the boss for
you,'' said Richard Aurelio, the former president of Time Warner's
New York City Cable Group.
</P>
<P>
   As the president of what is now called Rainbow Media Holdings,
Lustgarten helped oversee the creation of American Movie Classics;
Bravo; News 12 Long Island, a local 24-hour news service, and the
family of Sportschannel regional cable networks in New York, Boston
and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   His dealmaking was central to Cablevision's recent leap into
acquiring Madison Square Garden, Radio City Entertainment, The Wiz
retail electronics chain and the Clearview Cinema movie theater
chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tough but fair, with an imaginative mind that found
ways to put complicated things together and make them work as
businesses,'' said Chase Carey, the chairman and chief executive
officer of Fox Television.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Carey negotiated the $850 million deal with Lustgarten
that merged the Fox/Liberty Networks' cable sports channels with
Cablevision's sports networks to create the Fox Sports Net, a rival
to ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Lustgarten was named chairman of Madison
Square Garden, where he ``found his calling,'' Dolan said. He
attended nearly every Knicks and Rangers game. ``He became
emotionally involved in the games,'' Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
   Lustgarten, who graduated from Pace University and earned law
degrees from New York Law School and New York University Law
School, was a New York City high school English teacher and an
associate corporation counsel for the city before joining
Cablevision.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Marcia; two children, Andrew and
Jessica; and his father, Irving. &QL;

SCHULTZ TO QUIT OLYMPIC JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Schultz will step down as the executive director of the
U.S. Olympic Committee next year as part of an organizational
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC's executive committee adopted the preliminary
recommendations of a report by a management consulting firm and a
public-sector task force that will make the USOC operate more like
a private corporation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main changes is to eliminate the executive director
post and replace it with a president and chief executive officer.
The volunteer president, who is now William Hybl, will become a
more ceremonial chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what I've pushed for,'' Schultz said. ``It's
being able to do more things that you couldn't do under the current
structure, to be more in control of strategy and direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said that while it would be tempting to apply for the
new, more powerful job as president and chief executive, he would
not seek the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I looked at what was needed, it's a five- to six-year
commitment,'' said Schultz, who became executive director in 1995.
``I was encouraged to do it, but my wife and grandkids would kill
me. I'll be 70 years old next week. We have to get the right person
to make that commitment, a younger person who can look at 5 to 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz's contract expires in 2002 but gives him the option to
decide to leave at the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As the USOC has grown in size, so has the need to make it
operate more like a major corporation than a nonprofit
organization. The budget has grown from $13 million for the 1976-80
quadrennium to the current $441 million. Since 1979, the number of
employees has swelled from 40 to 527.
</P>
<P>
   The final report of the proposed restructuring, made by McKinsey
&AMP; Co. and the USOC Public Sector Task Force, is to be presented to
the Olympic committee's board of directors in October and is
expected to be approved in January. Hybl is expected to appoint a
search committee for a president in several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said he would serve his term through the Summer Olympics
in Sydney, Australia, next year and focus most of his remaining
tenure to USOC fund-raising for Sydney and the 2002 Winter Games in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   He said many of his day-to-day responsibilities would be handled
by Scott Blackmun, the USOC's general counsel until the new
president is appointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to raise $20 million a month for the next 12 months,''
he said. Fund-raising is going well in the aftermath of the Olympic
bribery scandal involving improper gift-giving by former Salt Lake
City Olympic officials, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the market loosening up, as we go after corporations
that have never done business with the Olympics before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to reorganize the USOC began about two years ago,
before criticism was leveled at the organization regarding the Salt
Lake City bid. The scandal erupted late last year, and the USOC's
lack of oversight of the Salt Lake Olympic Organizing Committee was
harshly criticized by a commission headed by George Mitchell, the
former U.S. senator from Maine. &QL;

BERG FINALLY AGREES TO KINGS' TERMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By   ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Defenseman Aki Berg said Monday he has decided to
end his year-long salary dispute with the Los Angeles Kings and has
agreed to terms on a one-year contract pending the resolution of
minor details.
</P>
<P>
   There is the possibility Berg, a 22-year-old native of Finland
who was the third player chosen in the 1995 NHL draft, could sign
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play in the NHL, everybody knows that,'' Berg said
Monday. ``It's going to be nice to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings general manager Dave Taylor said a contract could be
finalized by today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down to talking about bonuses,'' Taylor said. ``I think
both sides would like to get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   An NHL source said Berg acquiesced to the Kings' terms.
</P>
<P>
   Last week _ through an associate of his Ottawa-based agent,
Larry Kelly _ Berg said he was willing to sign a one-year deal
worth $900,000. At the same time, the source said the Kings were
offering a one-year deal worth about $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   The contract Berg appears ready to sign is for a salary much
closer to the one offered by the Kings than to the amount he was
seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings hold all the cards, because if they wished to do so,
terms of the NHL's collective-bargaining agreement give them
complete control of Berg's rights until he is 31. Thus, his option
is to sign with the Kings or play in Europe, as he did last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll sign, and that's it,'' said Berg, who has been in Ottawa
since flying there Saturday from Finland. ``I'll come back and show
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Petri Lehto, a friend of Berg's and an associate of
Kelly's, ``He could be in Europe until he's 31. If that's the
choice, I guess you do what you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg said he is prepared to put the contentiousness of the past
12 months behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a deal and I'm part of the team, and of course I've
forgotten what happened last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berg has appeared in 164 games in three seasons with the Kings,
scoring two goals and assisting on 21 others. Two other key Kings,
defenseman Mattias Norstrom and right wing Glen Murray, remain
unsigned. Players report for training camp Saturday and step on the
ice for the first time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger has surgery: Center Eric Belanger, suffering from
Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, a circulatory disorder, underwent surgery
Monday at USC University Hospital to remove a rib and resolve the
problem, which had caused a blood clot in his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger, 22, is considered one of the Kings' top prospects but
has been plagued by injuries in the past year. He will be sidelined
indefinitely and his status will be reviewed over the next month as
he recuperates from the operation. Taylor said there's a
possibility Belanger could be playing within three months.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger, a fourth-round draft choice in 1996, had 26 points in
33 games last season with Springfield of the American Hockey
League.

NEW YORK MAYOR PICKED FOR JURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six jurors were selected in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan on Monday to hear an obscure $7 million personal injury
case. They included a registered nurse, a student, a communications
executive, a financial journalist and the mayor of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   And over the next week or so, barring a last-minute settlement,
Rudolph Giuliani, the tigerish former federal prosecutor who has
been known to devour lawyers before breakfast and maul judges and
verdicts he does not like, will have a chance to play the Common
Man in the jury box _ listenng instead of lecturing others on
their civic duties, and perhaps forgoing the political pyrotechnics
to walk the slender line of objectivity in the jury room.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor _ the first ever picked to serve on a jury _ was the
latest in a growing list of politicians and celebrities to be
summoned for possible duty since the state approved reforms in 1995
that abolished exemptions for lawyers, doctors and others.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed more amazed than Giuliani when the opposing
lawyers picked him as Juror No. 1 in the civil suit, in which a
Harlem man and his wife are suing their landlord, claiming the
husband's genitals were scalded taking a shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I surprised? Yeah, I was surprised,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   It was anybody's guess why the lawyers for both sides agreed to
seat Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is strange that both sides would take him,'' former Mayor
Ed Koch said. ``There is no doubt that, his personality being what
it is, you'd fear putting someone like him on. This is no longer
what six people think. It's what Giuliani thinks. That's gonna be a
major problem. No reflection on him. He's just doing his duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonya Hamlin, a jury and trial consultant who has written books
on juries and communications, speculated that the competing
lawyers, for different reasons, saw advantages in having Giuliani
on the panel _ the tenant's lawyer believing Giuliani's desire to
run for the Senate would prompt him to do the popular thing; the
landlord's lawyer counting on the mayor who has denounced
``nuisance'' lawsuits against the city to stand up for principle.

<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Wading into a sea of candied apples, broiled
sausages and fried dough, Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigned elbow
to elbow with President Clinton at the state fair here Monday _ the
first time that this husband has campaigned on behalf of this wife.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons shook hands, hoisted toddlers into the air and
addressed a Democratic luncheon in a day filled with reminders that
a passing of the family torch was at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's pretty nice to go to a lunch like this when you
know you're the only one not running for anything,'' Clinton said
with a sheepish grin after he ambled up to the microphone,
following his wife, at the annual luncheon sponsored by the state
comptroller, H. Carl McCall, the highest-ranking elected Democrat
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even with a president in town _ people lined Route 5 for
hours for a glance at the presidential motorcade _ it was Mrs.
Clinton who kept snatching the spotlight. And the state fair, a
sprawling two-week confluence of food, culture and art held every
year in Syracuse, turned out to be particularly friendly territory
for a trip that was as much about the 2000 race for U.S. Senate as
about rest and relaxation for the first family.
</P>
<P>
   John Avery, a retired tool factory executive, pulled Mrs.
Clinton aside to urge her to move to the Finger Lakes area rather
than to Westchester County. A few moments later, outside the
International Horse Show exhibition, Robert Lentz of Warners
greeted the first lady by taking out his wallet and offering her
two $50 bills if she announced to him that she would run for the
Senate, as she seems likely to do.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton demurred, summoning her press secretary, Howard
Wolfson, to politely decline the potentially illegal offer of a
cash donation. ``I think she'd do a lot better for this state than
the other guy,'' said Lentz, referring to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of
New York City, her presumed opponent, as the Clintons moved into
the crowd. ``And if she doesn't run, I want her to turn it over to
the Clinton defense fund.''
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of events came on the third phase of what is, at
least ostensibly, the Clintons' vacation, complete with their
daughter, Chelsea, and their dog, Buddy. (Chelsea, wearing a pair
of sunglasses, came to the fair; Buddy did not.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is counting off the months until the end of his term,
and this was his first vacation in New York since becoming
president. Nonetheless, after spending 10 days in the Hamptons on
Long Island, N.Y., and Martha's Vineyard, Mass., he looked anything
but unhappy at the demands of putting on a shirt and tie and
spending a beautiful if slightly cool late August afternoon shaking
hands under the upstate sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I've done all my life,'' Clinton told reporters, a
bit wistfully, as he headed back to his motorcade. ``It's how I
think it should be done.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton was trying to offer his wife some pointers on how the
game should be played, the first lady seemed the eager student.
Upon arrival in Syracuse, where a crowd of 2,300 was waiting,
according to the Secret Service, Mrs. Clinton kept shaking hands
long after even Clinton had stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the fair, when the Clintons stopped for iced tea, Mrs.
Clinton again seemed the experienced politician as she politely
turned down an offer of a chicken lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably not,'' she said, glancing at the photographers who
were circling the table. ``Actually, I'd love to take some with me
because I don't want to eat it in front of 9 million people. I'd
love some.'' The Clintons left with containers of chickens and
apples.
</P>
<P>
   The state fair, which was on the way from the airport to
Skaneateles, provided an ideal foray for anyone looking for fun, a
quick lesson in New York culture or campaigning opportunities. The
fair is one of New York's largest upstate tourist attractions, and
even at midday, it was packed with people.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons did not take in all the attractions at the fair _
they skipped the Freakathon, for example, which from the outside
appeared to be a late-20th-century version of a circus ``freak
show'' _ but they did see an exhibition of American quilts.
</P>
<P>
   People lined up eight deep at some spots just for a chance at a
handshake, an autograph or, in some cases, the political trifecta:
a piece of paper signed by Clinton, Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited!'' Richard Ferris of Syracuse exclaimed as he
kissed Mrs. Clinton's right hand. ``This is the most exciting thing
that has ever happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the first lady began to move on, Ferris, a hairstylist,
called out, ``And I want to do her hair!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Later, as the Clintons moved through the fair _ to the sounds of
``Louie Louie'' and other famous 1960s songs _ they made their way
to the Dairy Building. There, Mrs. Clinton handed out containers of
milk and even indulged in a soft ice cream cone.
</P>
<P>
   At McCall's lunch, Clinton sat with his hands clasped and his
head tilted as he listened to his wife speak.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton discussed funding for education and health care,
the issues that she expects to raise in a campaign against
Giuliani. ``People are asking me what I am learning,'' said Mrs.
Clinton, referring to the so-called listening tour that she has
been conducting in New York for two months. ``I am learning about
the diversity of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, in his remarks, mixed humor and reminiscences of
trips to other state fairs with what has become his standard
refrain these days: the need for the nation to take advantage of
its prosperity to plan for the future.
</P>
<P>
   On the way from the fair to the home of Thomas McDonald, a
supporter who is the Clintons' host this week, they encountered
another cluster of people and stopped again to shake more hands.
Clinton, in an aside to reporters, brushed off the suggestion that
he needed to teach Mrs. Clinton anything about campaigning. ``I
think she's doing pretty well without any help from me,'' he said.

 Coulter's Cancer Drug Is Delayed by FDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Tom Abate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Shares in Coulter Pharmaceutical Inc. plunged 32 percent yesterday
after the company disclosed that the Food and Drug Administration
wants it to revise its application to sell a cancer drug called
Bexxar.
</P>
<P>
   The South San Francisco biotech company said the FDA wanted it
to reformat parts of its massive application and reanalyze some of
the data it has already submitted.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter spokeswoman Sylvia Wheeler estimated it would take six
to eight weeks to resubmit the application and emphasized that the
FDA has not asked for any new studies, which would take much longer
to satisfy. The company did not release the FDA letter.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent Coulter stock plunging $10.94 to close at $23.50
yesterday on a volume of 6.3 million shares, nearly 20 times the
company's daily average over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   Bexxar is intended to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of
the blood and lymph tissues that affects 300,000 Americans. Bexxar
consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a radioactive
isotope. The antibody is designed to find the cancer cell, while
the radioactive payload is supposed to kill the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McCamant of the Medical Technology Stock Letter in Berkeley
that a delay in winning FDA approval for Bexxar _ if the setback
proves to be just that _ would diminish Coulter's lead over Idec
Pharmaceuticals Corp.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Idec is testing a drug called Zevalin that would be
very similar to Bexxar, joining a radioactive particle to an
antibody. Idec is still about a year away from asking the FDA for
permission to sell Zevalin.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA action took analysts by surprise. Only last week,
Coulter Chief Executive Officer Michael Bigham said in a magazine
interview that his company had provided the FDA all the information
it needed when Coulter submitted its application to sell Bexxar on
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lost some credibility,'' said Curtis Hogue, an analyst at
Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP; Co., who has a ``neutral'' rating on Coulter
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Pending FDA approval, Coulter plans to market Bexxar in
conjunction with SmithKline Beecham Plc., which is based in the
United Kingdom. Shares in SmithKline dropped fell $1.63 to close at
$64.31.

   LONG-DISTANCE RATE WAR HEATS UP AFTER AT&AMP;T CUTS
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has introduced lower long-distance rates, reluctantly
joining a price war with large and small phone carriers that has
brought bargains for consumers but threatens to add to already
intense pressure on profits.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan, which has a $5.95 monthly fee, offers calls at 7
cents a minute any time. That represents a 30 percent cut in the
per-minute rate from AT&AMP;T's previous main offering, 10 cents a
minute with a $4.95 monthly fee. Customers must request the new
plan, otherwise they will remain with their older, more expensive
ones. Shares of AT&AMP;T declined $1.50 a share, or 3 percent, to $46,
on the news.
</P>
<P>
   HOME SALES REMAINED BRISK IN JULY
</P>
<P>
   The number of new single-family homes sold in July reached a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 980,000, the Commerce Department
said. Although that was up only slightly from June, it was the
highest sales pace since the record high of 985,000 in November
1998.
</P>
<P>
   CIGARETTE PRICES UP 18 CENTS A PACK
</P>
<P>
   The country's leading cigarette manufacturers raised wholesale
prices 18 cents a pack over the weekend, anticipating a tax
increase and more expenses from a settlement with the states over
health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   DOW FALLS ON CONCERN ABOUT RATES
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices fell for the third consecutive session, pulled down
by worries that in early October the Federal Reserve may increase
short-term interest rates for a third time this year. The Dow Jones
industrial average dropped 176.04 points, or 1.6 percent, to
10,914.13. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index fell 24.25 points,
or 1.8 percent, to 1,324.02. The technology-heavy NASDAQ composite
shed 46.21 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,712.69.
</P>
<P>
   Bond yields rose sharply, reflecting investors' fears that the
Federal Reserve would increase short-term rates again because of
continuing evidence that the economy is strong. The yield on the
30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.05 percent, from 5.97 percent on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   OFFICE DEPOT TO MISS ESTIMATES
</P>
<P>
   Office Depot, the office-supply superstore chain, said that it
would miss earnings estimates for the rest of the year because of
lower-than-expected sales and tighter profit margins. The company
also said it would take third-quarter charges and buy back $500
million of its stock.
</P>
<P>
   SEC SEES DEAL WITH BIG BOARD
</P>
<P>
   Securities and Exchange Commission officials expect to work out
an agreement with the New York Stock Exchange on the thorniest
issue involved in its going public _ what happens to the exchange's
self-policing unit, which would face the possibility of
investigating and disciplining its own shareholders. Arthur Levitt,
the SEC chairman, has warned that approval for the exchange to
convert to public ownership would be contingent on ``investors'
interests taking precedence over all others.''
</P>
<P>
   SHARES OF REPUBLIC SERVICES PLUNGE
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Republic Services, the waste collection company, fell
$5.375, or 32.6 percent, to $11.125, after the company said that
1999 earnings would fall below analysts' estimates. Republic cited
a lag in integrating assets bought from Waste Management.
</P>
<P>
   A NEW SHOP FOR INTERNET MARKETING
</P>
<P>
   BBDO New York, known for its television commercials for longtime
clients like Pepsi-Cola, Frito-Lay and Visa, is making a big push
into Internet marketing with the opening of a new agency dedicated
to interactive marketing. The new shop is BBDO New York's vision of
a hybrid agency that marries the technical ability of Internet
marketing with traditional advertising techniques.
</P>
<P>
   PRADA TO BUY JIL SANDER'S SHARES
</P>
<P>
   The Italian fashion house Prada said that it planned to buy 75
percent of the common shares of Jil Sander AG of Germany and 15
percent of its publicly traded preferred stock, adding to its
designer-clothing brands.

 Investment Clubbing on the Net  
 By Arthur M. Louis 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Investment clubs date back to before that rusted-out Hudson in
grandpa's barn, but they are beginning to take on a slick, modern
look thanks to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 100 investment clubs now operate exclusively online,
experts estimate. Their members, scattered throughout the country,
may never meet face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   They don't hold their monthly strategy meetings in somebody's
living room over coffee and finger food, as the nation's 50,000
conventional investment clubs do. Instead, they share their ideas
and make their buy-and-sell decisions via chat rooms, bulletin
boards and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more popular financial Web sites, such as Motley
Fool and Yahoo, are catering to this new trend, offering the clubs
private Web pages, bulletin boards and portfolio tracking.
</P>
<P>
   They do this free of charge, though the club members who use the
sites must endure an endless stream of advertisements for brokerage
houses and other financial service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Communicating online lets the club members break out of the
conventional, rigid investment-club structure and carry on a
perpetual dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will set up a message board for any club,'' says Selena
Maranjian, a senior writer with Motley Fool. ``You not only can
post messages, but if you notice an article you want other members
to share, you can post a link.''
</P>
<P>
   In one recent bulletin board posting on Motley Fool, a club
member plaintively inquired: ``When is our next meeting? I noticed
ORCL (Oracle Corp.) is stuck around $37 lately. Do we want to take
any action (like selling it to gain some profit????).''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the Internet let clubs with geographically
dispersed members operate more efficiently, but it also makes it
more practical to recruit large numbers of members and amass large
amounts of capital. That gives the funds more flexibility in their
investments.
</P>
<P>
   John Conley, a paralegal based in Nicasio in Marin County, is
organizing an online club that will invest in stocks, mortgages and
deeds of trust. He says he can think of a dozen friends and
relatives who might sign up, but like Blanche DuBois, he will
depend heavily on the kindness of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to set up a Web page to attract members. He hopes to
corral as many as 75 and to build an initial investment pool of
$200,000 so that the club can diversify its investments adequately.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the average investment club has fewer than 20
members.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of strictly online clubs is still small, a
substantial minority of traditional clubs can be classed as
semionline. They use the Internet to enhance communications among
their members _ mainly with e-mail and to do investment research.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more investment clubs are doing business online,''
says Kenneth Janke, president of the National Association of
Investors Corp. ``It is more convenient, especially if people are
vacationing out of town and can't attend a meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   NAIC, whose members include about three-fourths of all U.S.
investment clubs, was founded in 1951, a few years after investment
clubs began to proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   Devin Holmes, a network administrator with the state Department
of Corrections in Sacramento, is president of a conventional,
3-year-old investment club with 12 members and $23,000 in assets,
as well as a 1-year-old, $2,300, semionline club limited to a
half-dozen members of his family, including one in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the family club has a computer,'' he says. ``We
have a Web site that is updated every month. We discuss possible
investments and vote on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes sends each member a list of stocks the club might want to
buy or sell, and the members respond by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Once Holmes receives a majority vote for or against a stock, the
order is placed by his mother, the club treasurer, with Waterhouse
Securities, where the club has its brokerage account.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes says he will follow the standard procedure recommended by
NAIC if any members want to quit and withdraw their share of the
club assets. The member must give 60 days' notice so that the club
has plenty of time to liquidate securities with minimal harm to the
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   As convenient and efficient as they may be, online clubs have
potentially bothersome drawbacks, some experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Robertson, senior contributing editor of NAIC publications,
contends that face-to-face discussions help investment clubs
perform better _ that crucial nuances get lost when club members
only interact electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no substitute for the one-room schoolhouse atmosphere
of the conventional face-to-face club,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Terrance Odean, a professor of finance at the University of
California at Davis, worries that online investment clubs will
trade too actively _ ``because the online environment encourages
more active trading.''
</P>
<P>
   Odean co-authored a recent study of investment clubs, which
indicated that the clubs that trade most actively perform
relatively poorly, while those that hold stocks for the long term
do best.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential drawback is fraud _ a real possibility when
the club members are far-flung strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of opening a joint brokerage account with a bunch
of strangers and hoping for the best seems frivolous to me,''
remarks Elizabeth Rowe, a senior consultant with Find/SVP Emerging
Technologies Research Group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   NAIC's Janke acknowledges that ``any time you are dealing with
money, there is a potential that someone will try and con you.''
But he insists that fraud has been extremely rare among the clubs
that belong to his organization.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that the opportunities for rank-and-file members
to defraud an investment club are limited. A crooked officer, on
the other hand _ particularly a crooked treasurer, who handles the
flow of money in and out of investments _ can inflict serious
financial damage.
</P>
<P>
   Janke cites the case of a woman who gave club members copies of
authentic-looking but phony brokerage statements that indicated she
was buying and selling exactly the securities on which the members
had voted. In fact, she was keeping the club's money for herself.
</P>
<P>
   The scam didn't get detected until after the woman died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone in the club went to the broker to say they needed to
change the administration of the account to someone else,'' Janke
says. ``The broker didn't know what they were talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   The fraud might have been avoided if the club had taken the
precaution of assigning more than one person to monitor the
brokerage account. The members were too naive and too trustful.
</P>
<P>
   But not entirely trustful. Fortunately, they got back all their
money because they did have the foresight to get the treasurer
bonded by an insurance company. If the loss hadn't been insured,
they might have had to hire a lawyer to sue the treasurer's estate.
</P>
<P>
   Or they might have gotten relief through the regulators that
oversee investment clubs _ the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the state agency that administers securities laws. (In
California, that would be the Department of Corporations.)
</P>
<P>
   Janke emphasizes that this particular fraud was perpetrated
entirely offline. He concludes: ``If someone wants to cheat you,
they can find a way, and it doesn't necessarily have to be
online.''

DETROIT TEACHERS CALL A STRIKE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ill., Ohio, N.J.)   (jw) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Against the recommendation of their union leaders,
teachers here voted Monday to strike, just one day before Detroit's
172,000 public school students were due to return to school.
</P>
<P>
   The strike will test not only a new school board appointed this
year by Mayor Dennis Archer and Gov. John Engler but also a 1994
state law that makes the strike illegal and punishes teachers with
fines of a day's pay for every day on strike. The last teachers
strike in Detroit was in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The union, the Detroit Federation of Teachers, has been in
negotiations since February over terms of a contract to replace the
one that expired Monday. The union's leadership recommended that
teachers accept a 10-day extension of the talks with the Detroit
public schools, but teachers rebelled, voting to strike by an 80
percent majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``They voted not to return without a contract,'' said Janna K.
Garrison, executive vice president of the Detroit Federation of
Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The union leadership had recommended the extension, Ms. Garrison
said, because ``we were at the table and we were getting pretty
close.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers apparently felt that returning to the classrooms and
extending the talks would cost them leverage at the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
   Archer urged the union and the school board to continue
negotiations until they reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain optimistic and encourage the negotiators to return to
the table forthwith,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office is also hoping for a quick end to the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reform must move forward, and a key to that is having teachers
in the classrooms,'' said John Truscott, a spokesman for Engler.
``We're just hoping for a speedy resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Half the students in Detroit's public schools do not graduate
from high school, and half of those who do graduate struggle to
meet state standards. Fourth-graders approach state averages on
standardized tests, but by the seventh grade just a third can read
or do math at their grade level.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature, which is controlled by Republicans, voted
in March to transfer control of Detroit's schools from an elected
school board to the mayor and the governor, who appointed a new
school board. The Detroit Federation of Teachers supported that
reform effort. State legislatures have similarly restructured
school boards in Chicago and Cleveland and in five school districts
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   All summer, the Detroit school board has been racing to complete
school repairs before students return, hiring scores of contractors
to refinish floors, refurbish dilapidated restrooms and repair
broken windows. The board also recruited local businesses to
monitor the progress, and many have donated school supplies and
expertise to their adopted schools.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's developments are likely to leave parents confused.
David Adamany, the chief executive of the Detroit public schools,
said that schools were open and that teachers were expected to
report to their posts. But Adamany also said parents should not
take their children to school until the board could ensure that
there were enough teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The union has called for teachers to head for the picket lines
instead of their classrooms on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``No teacher ever wants to go on strike,'' said John Elliott,
the union president. ``But when the school system tries to
undermine the teachers, it winds up hurting students.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher strikes are rare in large cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been little strikes, but it has been a long time
since we had a really big strike,'' said Janet Bass, a spokeswoman
for the American Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Others concurred. ``They have been very few and far between in
recent years,'' said John Butler, a spokesman for the National
School Boards Association, based in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, the 11,500-member teachers union was seeking a
raise, a reduction in class sizes and the elimination of certain
policies, including what teachers called too-rigid attendance
requirements. The union had asked that wages for Detroit's teachers
be brought up to the median of those in the three-county
metropolitan area, which would have meant raises of 2 percent to 10
percent, depending on seniority.
</P>
<P>
   The board had proposed giving the teachers 95 percent of the
raises they had asked for, said Ms. Garrison, the union's executive
vice president. And it had agreed to study whether to reduce class
sizes, which reached 41 students in one first-grade class last
year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Morrow, a political consultant in Detroit who is also an
assistant principal in the school system, said teachers felt that
although they were on the front lines of improving the city's
schools, the board was asking a lot without giving enough in
return.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers say that ``even though the strike is illegal, at some
point in time, you've got to stand up for what you believe in,''
Morrow said.

NEW YORK CITY CLAIMS THAT HATE SPEECH JUSTIFIES DENYING RALLY
PERMIT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city's lawyer argued in court Monday that the
incendiary words of Khallid Abdul Muhammad are so filled with
hatred toward Jews and whites _ and are so likely to incite
violence against the police _ that he and his compatriots should be
prevented from staging a youth rally in Harlem on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The argument was not received warmly by U.S. District Judge
Denny Chin.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp, persistent questioning of Michael Hess, the city's
corporation counsel, Chin wondered whether Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
arbitrarily denied a permit for the rally simply because he
detested Muhammad's political views. He called the city's response
to Muhammad's permit request ``problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Chin criticized the city's procedures for reviewing parade
permits, saying, ``There still do not appear to be any standards.''
And he observed that the city's abrupt decision last week to deny a
permit ``would seem to contradict'' efforts by city lawyers to
negotiate with organizers of the rally, called the Million Youth
March.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, Giuliani said the permit was denied because a
proper application was not made in time _ the same sort of narrow
legal grounds his lawyers employed unsuccessfully to try to block
last year's rally. Such technical reasons were largely abandoned
Monday, as Hess instead framed the city's denial as a lawful
restraint on demagogic, hate-filled speech.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional defense of the city's position, Hess urged the
judge to consider ``the reality'' of last year's Million Youth
March, in which hundreds of participants clashed with police
officers after Muhammad urged them to ``beat the hell'' out of the
advancing line of officers in riot gear if they were attacked by
the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no joke,'' Hess said. ``Twenty cops were hurt.'' One
officer, he said, had been out of work for a year because of a neck
injury. Others, he said, were knocked unconscious by chairs and
other objects hurled at them by rally participants.
</P>
<P>
   With one rally organizer talking of inviting armed gang members
to this year's rally, Hess argued, and with Muhammad vowing to
march with or without a permit, the city is justified in denying a
permit because of the content of Muhammad's words.
</P>
<P>
   The usual test for upholding restrictions on demonstrations is
whether they are neutral, and are imposed for valid logistical
reasons, rather than because of the speech's content.
</P>
<P>
   At times Chin appeared impatient with Hess' arguments. At one
point he rubbed his head in frustration, and at another he cut Hess
short with ``You didn't answer my question.'' When Hess said the
heavy police presence at last year's rally was ``relatively
normal,'' Chin again interrupted. ``Cattle chutes are relatively
normal?'' he asked acidly, referring to the hundreds of steel
barricades that the rally organizers likened to cattle pens.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad did not attend Monday's hearing, but his lawyers were
clearly encouraged by Chin's questions and comments. ``His
questions seemed to indicate he was in favor of our position,''
said Roger Wareham, a lawyer for the rally organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chin also expressed reservations about allowing Muhammad to
stage a rally on Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem. Taking note of
several prominent politicians in Harlem who have called on
residents to boycott the rally, Chin asked, ``Do the residents of
Harlem really want this rally?''
</P>
<P>
   Chin said he expected to give a decision Tuesday. His ruling is
likely to be appealed, lawyers in the case said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Giuliani clearly anticipated an unfavorable ruling. In response
to a reporter's question Monday evening, he said he feared that
Chin had failed to appreciate the difference between what the mayor
called the ``Million Teen Hate March'' and traditional events like
the St. Patrick's Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't figure out that difference there is nothing in
the world that I can do to educate the judge as to the difference
between those two things,'' he said, his expression one of
incredulity.
</P>
<P>
   The limits of the First Amendment _ and specifically whether it
protects Muhammad's most inflammatory statements _ were at the
heart of Monday's hearing. On the one hand, as Chin noted, the U.S.
Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution protects the speech
of those who advocate the violent overthrow of the government. Yet
in an important 1969 case, Brandenburg vs. Ohio, the court also
held that the First Amendment does not protect speech aimed at
``inciting or producing imminent lawless action.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess argued that Muhammad and other rally organizers did just
that last year, and plan to do the same this year. He submitted
videotapes of last year's rally, and transcripts of speeches by
Muhammad and other rally participants.
</P>
<P>
   But Wareham said that Muhammad only called for violence as a
means of self-defense. During his brief remarks, Muhammad spoke of
self-defense or ``the right to defend ourselves'' nine times. In
Muhammad's final instructions to the crowd, he urged them to leave
in ``peace,'' and to ``go home to your families, brothers and
sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   Wareham argued that it was the Police Department that caused the
violence with a series of provocative tactics, such as flying
helicopters low over the crowd. He noted that there were no arrests
or reported incidents of violence until the police moved in to
clear the area minutes after the rally was scheduled to end. What's
more, he asked, if Muhammad's words sparked the violence, then why
was he not indicted by a grand jury that spent months investigating
the melee?
</P>
<P>
   Chin appeared troubled by aspects of the Police Department's
conduct last year. ``Certainly some of it appears excessive _
helicopters swooping in at 4 o'clock,'' he said.

   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Hurricane Dennis began peeling away from the
coast of North Carolina on Monday afternoon, apparently sparing the
state the kind of damage it had suffered in three other hurricanes
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here along the state's southern coast began reopening
barrier islands that were evacuated on Sunday night. And although
northern coastal communities remained hunkered down Monday evening
against heavy rain, sustained winds of nearly 90 mph and gusts of
up to 112 mph, they also seemed to have avoided a direct hit.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the eye of the storm continued moving away from the
coast, officials cautioned that the hurricane remained a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are so unpredictable,'' said Bill Furney of the
North Carolina Division of Emergency Management. ``It could stay
off the coast for a day or two and gather strength and come back
in. We hope that doesn't happen. What we need is a good front to
come in from the coast and push Dennis back out to sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, predicted that the storm would ``come to a screeching halt
out there'' in the Atlantic by early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, heaven only knows what it's going to do,'' Jarrell said.
``But we think it'll probably sit there for one, two or three days,
and then almost anything is possible after that.''
</P>
<P>
   No deaths were attributed to the storm directly, although a
head-on collision that killed two people Monday morning north of
Wilmington was laid to 60 mph winds and heavy rain associated with
it.
</P>
<P>
   The storm did not appear to have caused any major structural
damage in southern North Carolina. To the north, it appeared that
Dennis had not brought the destruction inflicted by three other
hurricanes in the last three years: Bertha, Bonnie and Fran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Dennis said, `How close can I get to land and not
cause any damage?''' said Bill Clontz of the New Hanover County
Emergency Management Agency, here in Wilmington.

   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Hurricane Dennis began peeling away from the
coast of North Carolina on Monday afternoon, apparently sparing the
state the kind of damage it had suffered in three other hurricanes
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here along the state's southern coast began reopening
barrier islands that were evacuated on Sunday night. And although
northern coastal communities remained hunkered down Monday evening
against heavy rain, sustained winds of nearly 90 mph and gusts of
up to 112 mph, they also seemed to have avoided a direct hit.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the eye of the storm continued moving
east-northeast, away from the coast, officials cautioned that the
hurricane remained a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are so unpredictable,'' said Bill Furney of the
North Carolina Division of Emergency Management. ``It could stay
off the coast for a day or two and gather strength and come back

</P>
<P>
   Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University,
explained that the hurricane was being pushed away from the coast
by the same southward dip of jet-stream winds that brought cool
weather to the Northeast on Monday. The jet stream is now expected
to move back to the north, Miner said, a shift that, in the absence
of any other strong weather pattern, will most likely leave the
storm to stall at sea.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At 8 o'clock Monday night, the eye of the hurricane was about
120 miles east of Cape Hatteras, and was continuing on a path that
had brought it close to the coast, but without making landfall, all
along the Southeastern seaboard. A hurricane warning remained in
effect for most of the North Carolina coast to the Virginia state
line.
</P>
<P>
   No deaths were attributed to the storm directly, although a
head-on collision that killed two people Monday morning in Onslow
County, north of Wilmington, was laid to 60 mph winds and heavy
rain associated with it. The storm did not appear to have caused
any major structural damage in southern North Carolina. To the
north, it was still too early Monday evening for much of a damage
assessment, although there, too, it appeared that Dennis had not
brought the destruction inflicted by three other hurricanes in the
last three years: Bertha, Bonnie and Fran.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clontz of the New Hanover County Emergency Management
Agency, here in Wilmington, said: ``We're thinking we're very lucky
we only got a glancing blow, compared to the three storms we've had
in the past few years. The rest of the state seems to be faring
very well just like we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the whole country made out. It's like Dennis said,
`How close can I get to land and not cause any damage?'''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The storm did cut electrical power to 60,000 people, the North
Carolina Division of Emergency Management reported, and those
disruptions stretched as far inland as 140 miles, all the way to
the Raleigh area, where at one point about 10,000 customers were
without power.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, ``as far as damage in the state,'' ``we have a few
roads out, and bridges closed,'' said Furney, of the state's
emergency management division.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although the punishment to the state as a whole appeared light,
there were pockets of almost puzzling damage. On Hatteras Island,
two gasoline pumps embedded in concrete were blown over at the
service station owned by Danny Couch, who sat out the storm on the
island. (Although the island was under an evacuation order,
residents were allowed to stay if they remained on their own
property.)
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Tucker, 39, from Michigan, also stayed on the island,
with 24 of her relatives, who were making their annual visit to the
Outer Banks Motel on the beachfront. The motel owner let the
gathered clan stay at her house, farther from the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were here for Hurricane Emily in 1993,'' Ms. Tucker said,
``but we evacuated for that. This one didn't seem like it would be
as bad. We haven't been out yet, but I don't think there will be
too much damage. We're still hoping to get a good week out of our
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   At a mooring on the Cape Fear River in downtown Wilmington on
Monday morning, Mike Brit, 55, cleared some leaves off his 55-foot
charter boat, which he moved there from Carolina Beach, a barrier
island south of the city, after that island was evacuated on
Sunday. Brit spent the night with his wife in a nearby hotel with a
view of the river, and his assistant, Dean Holt, stayed on board
the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sleep much,'' Brit said. ``Dean had a phone, I had a
phone, so we kept in touch through the storm. I came down here
about 4:30 in the morning to check on the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, neither the boat nor Holt suffered any damage, and
when the first sunlight of the morning appeared, and Brit decided
that the worst was over, he declared the hurricane not so bad as
those he had weathered in the past.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Already, hopes for a big Labor Day weekend were spreading among
many whose work is dependent on the busy tourist industry all along
the Southeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call Labor Day weekend the last big hurrah of the season,''
said Shayna Anderson, a front-desk manager at the Blockade Runner
Beach Resort on Wrightsville Beach, a barrier island near
Wilmington that was evacuated on Sunday night but reopened Monday.
Ms. Anderson said the hotel was just about fully booked for the
Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came in this morning,'' she said, ``the phone was
ringing off the wall with booked guests for this weekend checking
to see if we were still here. I spent much of the morning assuring
them that we were, in fact, still standing, had had minimal damage
and that everything would be fine for this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   But one family that evacuated the area on Sunday apparently has
no plans to return this season. Vice President Al Gore cut short
his family beach vacation on Figure Eight Island near Wilmington on
Sunday afternoon, after state officials issued evacuation orders
for that and other islands.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore family was nearing the end of a 12-day vacation at a
private home on the four-mile-long resort island just north of
Wrightsville Beach, said Thomas F. Taft, a family friend from
Greenville, N.C., who planned the trip. The private home, where the
Gores also stayed for two weeks in 1997, is owned by V. Parker
Overton, founder of a large water sports equipment retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had intended to stay until Tuesday, but after monitoring
the hurricane's progress on television and through military
channels, decided to leave early, Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they started having evacuations,'' Taft said, ``he felt
it best to take normal precautions.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ All bluster and no balm, the U.S. Open, inarguably
the most chaotic Grand Slam, got under way Monday at the National
Tennis Center. Those who coped with the ball-bullying breezes moved
one round closer to a record $750,000 payday. Those who couldn't
cope moped home with their $10,000 condolence checks.
</P>
<P>
   And anybody in the crowd of 27,809, a record for an Open day
session, who neglected to tote a windbreaker along with their
binoculars was doomed to shiver just the way third-seeded Venus
Williams did in her backless blue dress. No wonder she made like a
gale-force wind and whipped through her initial assignment in a
scant 54 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the Arthur Ashe Stadium, the upsets occurred inside the
players' minds _ as exasperated tennis technicians watched
textbook-executed shots spirited up and out of bounds _ but not on
the scoreboard. First, 10th-seeded Arantxa Sanchez &UR; - &LR; Vicario, the
Open's 1994 champion, then eighth-seeded Carlos Moya, the 1998
French Open champion, and finally Williams, still a Grand Slam
champion wannabe, used the adverse conditions to handcuff their
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the weather took a turn toward the tranquil in the night
session, top-seeded Martina Hingis suffered through some anxious
second-set moments before buckling down and beating 74th-ranked
Kveta Hrdlickova, 6-1, 7-5. ``It was definitely a wake-up call,''
said Hingis, on track to face Williams in the semifinals if the
seedings hold true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very windy, and I had to improvise some,'' said
Williams, whose shotmaking, whether rote or inventive, was too much
for 145th-ranked Tatiana Poutchek, a ponytailed Belarussian now
coached by Natasha Zvereva's father, Marat Zverev. Despite
acquitting herself favorably in the Open's qualifying rounds,
Poutchek bowed out of her first-ever visit to a Grand Slam
tournament's main draw, 6-1, 6-2, a victim of the 19-year-old
Williams' superior brawn and court coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Venus is a favorite'; people actually think Venus
is going to win,'' said Williams, whose Open fan club includes
athletes Ricky Williams, Keyshawn Johnson and Rickey Henderson and
is headed up by her loquacious coach and father, Richard, who has
been telling anyone who will listen that his daughters will be
locking horns in the final in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Very much to their liking, Venus Williams and her younger
sibling, the seventh-seeded Serena, landed on opposite sides of the
draw here, and Monday Venus defended the family's tactic of
scheduling its two stars for different tournaments except at the
Grand Slam events. ``If it's a crime, I should be arrested,'' she
joked about her preference for avoiding matches with her sister.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Poutchek, who spent 1994 in the United States
taking her tennis training at the Brooklyn Racquet Club, never got
the chance to avoid Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't difficult at all, especially since I knew I
was much more experienced than her; whenever I faced a break point
or she had a game point, I knew exactly what to do with the ball,''
said Williams, who described herself as eight titles and 61 ranking
spots better than the unseeded rookie who gilded her phenom status
by reaching the 1997 final. ``I have a bigger serve, make better
decisions, cover the net more, things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Williams did not underestimate her unpolished opponent the
way she did this year at the French Open, where another
inexperienced qualifier, 125th-ranked Barbara Schwartz of Austria,
upended her in the fourth round. ``I've learned my lesson; I had to
learn it the hard way, in a Grand Slam,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's most prolific champion, the 27-year-old
Sanchez &UR; - &LR; Vicario, administered a lesson of sorts to Australia's
Jelena Dokic, the Belgrade native who as a 16-year-old qualifier
rode a wave of upsets, including a victory over Martina Hingis in
the first round, to this year's Wimbledon quarterfinals. Down by
4-1 in the first set, the Spaniard accepted the wind factor,
adjusted her patience quotient, and started making Dokic, last
year's Open junior champion, do all the running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried never to get upset,'' Sanchez &UR; - &LR; Vicario said of her
7-5, 6-1 victory. ``It was difficult with the wind. You have to be
looking at the ball really careful, be very concentrated. As long
as you feel you can compete with them, it's fine,'' she said of the
influx of teen-agers that's rejuvenated the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   Dokic, limited by the Women's Tennis Association's age
eligibility rules to 10 events plus the Grand Slam tournaments,
blamed her defeat on a loss of patience brought on by a lack of
sufficient match play. ``I started making errors and just gave a
lot away,'' she said. ``Knowing you've got five tournaments for the
next eight months, that's a big difference compared to most of the
players who can play as much as they want. At Wimbledon I came
through qualifying, which is much tougher; it was a different
story. It was a different player.''
</P>
<P>
   What Spain's top male player, the eighth-seeded Moya, contended
with Monday was a player with a history of making life difficult
for stars at Grand Slam events. But fortunately for Moya,
22nd-ranked Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia did not temper his game in
the swirling conditions, made 60 unforced errors and paid an
obvious price, a 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, 6-4 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very windy and very fast, and when you play with windy
conditions, you have to be more conservative because the ball
doesn't go where you want the ball to go,'' Moya said. ``If it's
windy, if it's not windy, he's hitting so hard, he doesn't care
about anything. When he plays well, everything is in; when he plays
bad, he doesn't try to change his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, in a scramble here
with second-seeded Andre Agassi for Pete Sampras' top ranking, was
harried by the wind and a human ball machine of an opponent,
Alberto Martin, but escaped with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind makes my life so miserable, I had to struggle,''
Kafelnikov said, ``but I'm glad I got through.''
</P>
<P>
   The only seeded player who did not get through the first round
Monday was No. 6 Amanda Coetzer of South Africa, who fell by 6-1,
7-5 to Irina Spirlea, the contentious Romanian who exchanged the
infamous semifinal changeover bump with Venus Williams in 1997.

   TINGKA, China _ Luodeng Chideng was horrified when the police
led away his 10-year-old son because the boy refused to repeat the
phrase ``I am a Chinese citizen'' in school, insisting instead that
he is Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
   The boy spent four months behind bars. He was released only when
Luodeng bribed a police officer who, adding a final insult, warned
the father not to let it happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my fault he got arrested,'' Luodeng said later, shaking
his head. ``I'm the one who taught him to be proud he is Tibetan.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``patriotic education'' campaign recently began in this
ethnically Tibetan area of Sichuan province, extending the pledges
of allegiance that are common at state-run work places and schools
elsewhere to those here, and even to Buddhist monasteries. The
campaign is apparently being carried out with all the sensitivity
of similar campaigns in other ethnic Tibetan areas, meaning
relatively little.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 6 million ethnic Tibetans who live in areas under Chinese
control, more than half live outside the official Tibetan
Autonomous Region. They are in neighboring provinces that include
large areas of the vast Tibetan plateau.
</P>
<P>
   In part because the authorities in Beijing are most concerned
about damping demands for independence, China's official policy
toward Tibetans and other ethnic minorities is a broad form of
affirmative action, giving preferences in university admissions, in
government promotions and in relaxed population control.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that policy, in a remote Tibetan area like this one, seems
more than outweighed by a brutal intolerance, religious oppression
and widespread racism, many Tibetans say.
</P>
<P>
   International human rights monitors recognize that conditions
for Tibetans are marginally better in areas like this one in the
mountains of Sichuan province than they are in Tibet proper, where
the authorities are nervous and strictly prevent any demonstration
of opposition to Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Chinese officials here are less oppressive than in Tibet,
they still rule over ordinary people in an arbitrary way that
extends all the way to young children, local Tibetans say, even if
the toughest treatment is usually reserved for monks and anyone
else who challenges local officials. They say Chinese officials
treat Tibetans almost uniformly as inferior to Han Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Tibetans take it for granted that they will have the worst jobs,
that they will lose virtually any legal dispute with an ethnic
Chinese no matter what the evidence and that they will suffer
unexpected hardships throughout their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no voice,'' said Luodeng, 51, a truck driver. ``We
have no way of appeal, no one who will listen. We are a lost
people.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Chinese authorities say they tolerate freedom of
religious worship, though in practice that means little more than
allowing temples and monasteries to remain open. At the monasteries
sprinkled throughout the region, monks say, there are intense
efforts to control their daily operations.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials still limit the number of monks in each
monastery, tightly supervise the selection of religious leaders and
strictly enforce the regulations that require monks to swear
allegiance to the local Communist Party authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no human rights here,'' complained a 27-year-old monk
at the main temple in Garze, a town about 400 miles over dirt roads
from the nearest city.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-June, two monks were arrested at the monastery in Garze
and five others fled to elude police officials who were upset at a
pamphlet that was being passed around in support of independence
for Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmingly, Tibetans here say, a primary goal in life is to
see the Dalai Lama, the exiled leader, whose photograph is in plain
view in countless homes, stores and temples in this area.
Technically, such pictures are banned, and their display is a
modest sign of tolerance by the authorities. No such pictures are
on public view in Lhasa, Tibet's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Tibetans often talk about when the Dalai Lama will return to
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we said it would be this year,'' a shop owner in
Garze said. ``This year, we say next year. We don't really know.''
</P>
<P>
   With hopes of any return to Tibet by the Dalai Lama remaining
dismal, a growing number of Tibetan monks from this area and others
figure that if their religious leader cannot come home, they will
go to him. So thousands are emigrating to India, where the Dalai
Lama and a community of Tibetan refugees live in Dharamsala.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of Tibetans to get across the border to India
appears to represent their growing ability to obtain passports from
Chinese officials, many of whom request bribes for the favor. One
monk in Garze who went to India and recently returned to visit his
family said he had paid about $300 for a passport that should
ordinarily cost about $30.
</P>
<P>
   This summer the World Bank came under fire for supporting a
government project to move 58,000 impoverished farmers _ about 40
percent ethnic Chinese and the balance Hui Muslim and other
minorities _ from eastern Qinghai province to a newly irrigated
area farther west in Qinghai that has traditionally been inhabited
by Tibetans. Human rights groups argue that one of the main
problems facing Tibetans is the arrival of so many Chinese, whom
the Tibetans see as diluting native culture.
</P>
<P>
   In this Tibetan area, however, cultural dilution is not nearly
as pressing an issue to people like Luodeng as simply being able to
live without the wanton interference of corrupt, power-hungry
officials.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-year-old tradesman in Garze complained that the Chinese
authorities had burned down his house this year, for no apparent
reason except that he is Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged that local officials could behave this way, the
tradesman said he had gone to the government of the neighboring
county to seek redress. He said the official in charge had said:
``What race are you? Tibetan? Go ask the Dalai Lama for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Luodeng has little affection for Chinese people, even though he
married one. ``Only one out of 10 Chinese is decent,'' he said.
``The rest are bad, trying to figure out how to get money out of
you.''

EX-OFFICIAL ACCUSES PANAMA'S LEADER IN VISA-SELLING SCHEME
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA _ Panama dismissed its intelligence chief in June after
the United States made allegations that she was selling visas to
Chinese seeking a back-door entrance to the United States. Now she
is charging that Panama's president insisted that she authorize
visas that he was selling.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Samantha Smith, said in an interview that she
approved visas specifically requested by President Ernesto Perez
Balladares. She said she had warned the president on several
occasions that she had serious doubts about the visas. She said
that they clearly were being used by poor rural Chinese to get to
Panama en route to the United States, and said that the Chinese had
no intention of returning to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   As head of intelligence from September 1998 to June of this
year, Ms. Smith was in charge of approving visas from countries
like Cuba and China. She said that the president's personal
secretary delivered to her office some 140 visas for her approval
during her nine months in office. She said she confronted the
president in early May to voice her objections to authorizing the
latest batch of 32 suspect visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president said that I had to give the visas because they
were already committed to giving them, because he had obligations,
because people were after him and he had things to pay, expenses to
cover,'' she said. ``He put it this way, `These visas have been
promised. They have to be issued.'''
</P>
<P>
   The president, whose five-year term in office ends Wednesday,
said through a spokeswoman that he ``categorically denies''
benefiting from any visa scheme. Previously, he said he had asked
Ms. Smith to approve certain visas for Chinese merchants and their
relatives who worked in the nation's free-trade zone. His office
provided no further comment, but a statement issued late Monday by
the Ministry of Government and Justice insisted that the president
had ``never promoted, nor allowed illegal immigration to any
country.''
</P>
<P>
   It also accused Ms. Smith of making politically motivated
accusations that could be seized upon by American critics of the
hand over of the Panama Canal, set for Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Sunday, Ms. Smith portrayed herself as a
skeptical official who reluctantly obeyed her president. Ms. Smith,
a lawyer who started with the intelligence service as an analyst,
said she still did not know the full extent of whatever scheme
there was to sell visas.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was disclosing her conversation with the president
to ensure her safety and because she feared that the scheme might
go uninvestigated by Panamanian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official said: ``A whole lot of senior Panamanian
officials appear to be guilty, complicit in the scheme or
participants in it. It's a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Illegal traffic in visas is not new to Panama, dating back at
least to the rule of Gen. Manuel Noriega, who in the 1980s was
accused of selling visas to Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   The latest scandal erupted when Ms. Smith discovered that she
had visa problems of her own in June after State Department
officials revoked her visa to travel to the United States. She said
American Embassy officials in Panama told her that they suspected
her involvement in an immigrant smuggling ring that used Panama as
an entry point for Chinese aliens headed clandestinely by land to
the United States. The fallout from that decision cost her her job,
as well as those of several other mid-level officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department's revocation of her visa has also drawn
the ire of officials at the Justice Department, who said the move
damaged an investigation that could have resulted in charges
against more senior Panamanian officials.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy said there would be no comment
on the revocation of Ms. Smith's visa or any of her allegations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said she had had doubts about the visa requests from
the beginning of her tenure. She said the requests arrived at her
office after bypassing regular immigration channels and appeared to
be for people who clearly had no intention of returning to their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have said that smugglers later took the
Chinese immigrants through Costa Rica and into Mexico, where they
illegally entered the United States. It has been estimated that the
visas were sold for $15,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these packets arrived for visas for people from
Guangdong, I immediately thought something was wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she said, she wrote a letter to the president
outlining her objections. She said he returned the letter with a
notation to not issue the visas. Soon afterward, she said, Romulo
Abad, the president's personal secretary, came to her office
seeking that month's package of approved visas. When she showed him
the president's reply to her letter, she said he took his cellular
phone, called up the president and passed the phone to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president told me to give the visas to Romulo Abad,'' she
said. ``Romulo Abad then told me, `You know the president cannot
leave anything in writing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her doubts grew as the visa requests continued, she said,
especially when several presidential aides told her she needed to
approve some visas quickly because ``the budget is short.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Ms. Smith said: ``I want to restore my
reputation. I did nothing wrong. Why should I have to pay for
someone else?''

TREATING   OLD WOUNDS   WITH THE HELP   OF MUSIC  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEIMAR, Germany _ A month devoted to music as a force for
healing wounds of the Holocaust and of the Middle East today has
ended with the first concert on German soil by the Israeli
Philharmonic playing with a German orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinarily charged setting beneath the hill where
Buchenwald once disgorged its daily horror, Zubin Mehta conducted
more than 170 musicians from the Bavarian State Orchestra and the
Israeli Philharmonic just hours after accompanying many of them on
a visit Sunday to the former Nazi camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought did run through my mind at the camp: How will
Israelis be able to sit together with Germans this evening and play
music?'' Mehta said. ``But I detected no feelings of resistance.
And my feeling now is that if Jews and Germans can be together near
Buchenwald after 50 years, one day there will be reconciliation
with Arabs too.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been precisely the aim of another distinguished
maestro, Daniel Barenboim, who spent much of August in Weimar
directing a workshop of young musicians drawn largely from Israel
and Arab countries. Out of this experience, a new orchestra now
seems set to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The German and Israeli orchestras under Mehta played Gustav
Mahler's Symphony No. 2, the ``Resurrection,'' whose passage from a
first movement that is virtually a death march to the soaring
finale in which the victory of the spirit is affirmed reflected the
themes of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta, the longtime director of the Israeli Philharmonic and the
recently appointed music director of the Bavarian State opera in
Munich, may be uniquely placed to promote German-Jewish
understanding through music. In this light, Mehta described the
performance as ``thrilling,'' though less than perfect. A sharp
drop in temperature as dusk gave way to night affected the pitch of
the wind instruments.
</P>
<P>
   But perfection was scarcely the point. As a century fades, one
marked by the Nazis' industrialization of mass murder, Germany is
anxious to complete its painful confrontation with the years of
Hitler's rule. Weimar _ named Europe's ``cultural capital'' for
1999, home to Goethe and to Buchenwald _ has emerged as a focus of
that task.
</P>
<P>
   ``This concert was about the past,'' said Bernd Kauffmann,
director of the yearlong Weimar festival. ``It was about showing
that even the past symbolized by Buchenwald can be overcome, and
the Germans whose forebears murdered Jews can sit now with Israelis
and play the music of a Bohemian-Jewish-Austrian-German composer.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than two weeks, Barenboim, the director of the Berlin
State Opera, brought together young musicians _ including
Palestinians, Lebanese, Syrians, Israelis and Germans _ to ponder
their problems of identity and communication while exploring their
shared passion for music. He said he was driven by the conviction
that the Middle East is a very small area and that political
solutions based on separation can never fully answer the area's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue, in the end, in the Middle East is how to be
together,'' Barenboim said. ``And music is an ideal form of
communication because it can bring an almost ecstatic togetherness
and elevation while remaining essentially abstract.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of more than 70 musicians, most in their early 20s,
was so successful that plans now call for forming a ``West-Eastern
Divan Orchestra.'' The name is taken from Goethe's book ``The
West-Eastern Divan,'' in which, late in life, he explored aspects
of Arab and Islamic culture, their relationship to Western ideas
and the need for tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   This humanistic side of Goethe gave way to expressions of
Romantic cultural nationalism that the Nazis would later seize on
and distort. Barenboim suggested that it was important for the
young musicians _ confronted daily with the issue of their national
identity _ to understand these two faces of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Chaloub, 24, a violinist from Lebanon who was in Weimar
with Barenboim, said that ``for the first two days it was rather
tense, because I think we all had stereotypes about the other
nationalities.'' He added, ``But as we talked and played, these
ideas tended to fade.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the visit to the Buchenwald camp, where more than 50,000
people died between 1937 and 1945, ``did help me, up to a point, to
understand the feelings of the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Ilya Isakovich, 22, an Israeli violinist, also said that the
workshop had helped him overcome stereotypes, in his case, a
conviction that the musicians from Arab countries would not be of a
high enough standard.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians both said they were helped by the presence of
Edward Said, the Palestinian writer and intellectual, who joined
daily discussions after rehearsals and after the visit to
Buchenwald.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of the Arab musicians, it was probably the first time
they had heard the word `Holocaust' or `concentration camp,'''
Barenboim said. ``Said was invaluable in explaining that an
understanding of Jewish history was essential, whatever the current
problems Arabs have with Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear that the Mahler concert and the workshop advanced
understanding on both sides, though the wounds remain deep and
complex. Asked if his orchestras might have played Wagner _ whose
place in Hitler's mythology of German power and pre-eminence has
sometimes imbued his music with a divisive rather than conciliatory
force _ Mehta said this was still impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we decide to play Wagner, we will do it,'' he ``But there
are still too many people in Israel and elsewhere with numbers on
their arms, who do not want to be transported back. Music
transports, more than a Volkswagen does. Music is strong.''

A STRONG LATIN RETAIL PRESENCE IS ABOUT TO GET STRONGER
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CARREFOUR-PROMODES) 
(jw) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Geraldo Ferregetti was overjoyed when his
company, a prominent fruit producer, signed a contract last week to
supply 100 tons of papayas each month to Carrefour S.A., Brazil's
largest retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selling to Carrefour is like securing our future,''
Ferregetti, the produce director at Caliman Agricola, said in a
telephone interview from the company's headquarters in the
southeastern state of Espirito Santo. Ferregetti said the next step
was to use Carrefour's global reach to sell papayas in Europe, Asia
and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   At least in the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries of
Latin America, Ferregetti's goal is likely to get a boost after
Carrefour's agreement Monday to buy its rival, Promodes S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Just as U.S. companies like McDonald's Corp. have carved out a
leading presence in Latin America's fast-food business, French
retailers have emerged as some of the region's largest supermarket
operators. So it is small wonder that the combined operations of
Carrefour and Promodes provide a Latin giant with the power to
compete in markets where they are not already leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The global consolidation of the retail industry arrived late
in Latin America, but it's here to stay,'' said Percio de Souza, a
managing director at Banco BBA-Creditanstalt, an investment bank in
Sao Paulo that has worked as an adviser on several takeovers in the
Brazilian supermarket sector. ``The fight to dominate retailing in
areas which are until today untouched by global players like
Carrefour should be a fierce one,'' de Souza said.
</P>
<P>
   A look at how the old Carrefour grew into the largest retailer
in Brazil and Argentina, South America's two largest economies,
provides some insight into how the new Carrefour might start to
flex its muscle in countries like Mexico, Chile and Colombia, where
other companies are leading supermarket retailers.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, Carrefour's influence comes from a string of
acquisitions of smaller chains in the last few years, giving it 13
percent of the retailing market. The buying binge, undaunted by an
economy that shrank in 1998 and is expected to register no growth
this year, has picked up pace only in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, for instance, Carrefour said it would buy three
supermarket chains that operate in Rio de Janeiro, some of them in
the city's gritty, working-class suburbs. The purchase comes after
similar acquisitions in places like Belo Horizonte, Brazil's
third-largest city, and in Brasilia, the capital. In fact,
Carrefour has sought opportunities far from Sao Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro, the two largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Argentina, Carrefour's share of the market should
be even larger than it is in Brazil, about 30 percent, after its
purchase of Promodes. This is because Carrefour's leading position
will be combined with Promodes' recent move into the country.
Earlier this year, Promodes bought a 49 percent stake in
Supermercados Norte, the country's third-largest supermarket chain,
and announced plans to buy a controlling stake by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Such expansion has not caught some of Latin America's more
nimble supermarket companies off guard. Companhia Brasileira de
Distribuicao Pao de Acucar, which competes with Carrefour for
customers in big cities, decided this month to sell a 26 percent
stake to Casino Guicard Perrachon S.A. of France in a transaction
that should provide the company with about $1 billion of cash to go
on its own acquisition spree.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the deal also benefits Casino, France's third-largest
retailer, which would like to complement the operations it already
has in Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay and the United States.

ACCORD EXPECTED ON PLAN   FOR BIG BOARD'S OFFERING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Securities and Exchange Commission officials say they
expect to work out an agreement with the New York Stock Exchange on
the thorniest issue involved in its going public _ what happens to
the exchange's self-policing unit.
</P>
<P>
   Once the exchange converts to public ownership, the exchange's
self-regulatory unit will face the possibility of investigating and
disciplining its own shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   That has raised concerns about conflicts of interest and whether
the exchange's self-policing unit will have enough independence.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt warned both the exchange
and officials of the Nasdaq market, which is also planning to go
public, that conversion to a for-profit structure must allow for
self-regulation that is ``zealous, adequately funded and imbued
with the public interest.'' Approval of conversions, he added,
would be contingent on ``investors' interests taking precedence
over all others.''
</P>
<P>
   SEC officials now say those concerns are likely to be resolved
with the exchange. ``Our ongoing conversations have been very
fruitful, and I don't anticipate that the structure of the
regulatory unit will be a major impediment to the transaction going
forward,'' Annette Nazareth, the director of the SEC's division of
market regulation, said in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York exchange is expected to discuss conversion to
public ownership at its board meeting Thursday. Both exchanges are
taking steps to go public so they can better respond to increased
competition, including challenges posed by electronic trading
networks.
</P>
<P>
   According to people with knowledge of talks between the exchange
and regulators, they have discussed ways to provide independence
for the exchange's self-policing unit that include having a
separate board, separate staffs and general counsels, and separate
financing.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange has set a target date of November for its
conversion, but it now appears that timetable may be delayed. A
spokesman for the exchange declined comment, except to say that the
timing issue would be addressed at this week's board meeting.

SPORTS COLUMN: LIGHT-YEARS AND A BRIDGE OF SEPARATION

 (ATTN: Mass., Britain, The Netherlands)   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The young ones are coming bigger, hitting harder,
learning faster. From one end of the summer to another, London to
New York, Mirjana Lucic schooled a former Harvard student on the
existential differences between plucky challengers and aspiring
champions, between opposite ends of the Whitestone Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Erika de Lone had pushed Lucic deep into a third Wimbledon set
just two months ago in the first round of the tall Croatian
teen-ager's run to her semifinal defeat by Steffi Graf. De Lone
returned home to her best tennis summer ever, to become authentic
queen of a gritty Bronx court. Then she walked onto Court 11 Monday
at the National Tennis Center, and it was all too clear that she
was in the wrong borough, half a foot smaller than her opponent, in
over her head at the U.S. Open. Against all reasonable laws of
main-draw probability, Lucic was waiting for de Lone again, more
poised, better prepared, still growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how much the tour has changed,'' de Lone said
after Lucic had hammered out a 6-3, 6-3 victory. ``When I first
came on eight years ago, it was pretty much Seles and Capriati. Now
you have so much depth, so many players, all these Europeans, so
many big, strong players who are really cracking the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It can be enough to send a woman who stands under 5 feet 7
inches tall and weights 135 pounds to places where she can find
someone her own size, where Darwin doesn't always dole out the
prize money and computer ranking points. This is how 26-year-old
Erika de Lone of Lincoln, Mass., recently discovered another side
of the tennis city, how she came to conquer the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't luxury like this, what you get used to,'' she said,
making a sweeping gesture outside Court 11. ``But the fans came
out. The tennis was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Her pre-Open tuneup was the GHI Bronx Challenger, a satellite
event in what is the tennis equivalent of the minor leagues. The
site was Crotona Park, a short drive from the Third Avenue exit of
the Cross Bronx Expressway. Here there were no fancy food courts,
no parking lot full of luxury cars. The fans came in from the
neighborhood on foot, for free. The kids came from all over town,
courtesy of the New York Junior Tennis League. The players were
bused up from Manhattan, on a yellow school bus that de Lone didn't
have to ride because she'd brought her car.
</P>
<P>
   She found a room at the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan for $133, a
bargain compared to the $350 they wanted at the Parker-Meridian,
which refused to extend her the Open player rate until the Open
actually began. This is not a consideration for Venus Williams, but
de Lone had to hustle everywhere she could to earn $53,137 in 1998.
When Els Callens of the Netherlands retired from their Bronx
Challenger final, it was worth $8,800 to her 1999 bank account, and
a qualifier's place in the Open draw.
</P>
<P>
   She had nine break points Monday against Lucic and converted
none. The match came and went, like the smell of hamburger wafting
from close by. Still, it was the Open. It was another chance to
step into a fantasy before it slips through her fingers, like sand
at the beach. Her run from the Bronx was worth this one afternoon
in Queens, against a 17-year-old who is supposed to be going all
the places that Erika de Lone is not.
</P>
<P>
   She dropped out of Harvard after her freshman year, with the
support of her parents, who agreed that tennis was ``now or
never.'' Her older sister, Amy, played briefly on the tour. She has
a younger half sister and half brother who are nationally ranked
juniors. She's ``taking this where it goes,'' though to reach her
career-best ranking of 85, de Lone has had to win four Challenger
events this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing better than I ever have,'' she said, ``but the
players are so much stronger now, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The day she can't stand to wake up in a hotel room will be the
day she starts thinking about returning to Harvard, about an
economics degree. She realizes that day is coming, because more and
more, the early round opponents are 6-foot sluggers, whether they
are named Lucic or not.
</P>
<P>
   While de Lone told her story outside Court 11, Amelie Mauresmo
was powering forehands, impressively warming up for her first-round
match. Venus Williams was about to bring her special athleticism
into Arthur Ashe Stadium. Little sister Serena and Alexandra
Stevenson will be out there belting winners Tuesday night. It
doesn't take a Harvard study to recognize what is happening in
women's tennis, to know where the bridge to the future goes.

UMPIRES' BID TO SAVE JOBS NEEDS HELP FROM COURT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly reduced to grasping at flimsy foul lines, the umpires
union went to court again Monday in a late effort to save the jobs
of 22 major league umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Without waiting for a ruling from the National Labor Relations
Board, the union asked U.S. District Court in Philadelphia to issue
an injunction blocking the National and American leagues from
letting the umpires go after Wednesday's games.
</P>
<P>
   The union acted after the leagues rejected a request to retain
the umpires pending the outcome of a union grievance filed with the
American Arbitration Association last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Phillips, the union leader, did not return a telephone
call seeking comment on the union's action, but he clearly is
trying every conceivable avenue to rescue the umpires who are
losing their jobs as a result of his mass resignation strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has spoken with Major League Baseball officials, the
union has filed unfair labor practice charges against the leagues
and now the union has gone to court a second time in five weeks.
But nothing has worked.
</P>
<P>
   The labor board's New York office is expected to rule on the
union's allegations before Thursday, but the decision most likely
will go against the union.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the union, which withdrew its first lawsuit three
weeks after it was filed, are expected to argue at a hearing
Tuesday before Judge Curtis Joyner that the umpires will suffer
irreparable harm if the leagues are allowed to accept their
resignations. Irreparable harm is one element that has to be
established for an injunction to be granted.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the leagues, however, are expected to argue that the
22 umpires will suffer no irreparable harm if they lose their jobs
Wednesday and the union subsequently prevails in court or the labor
board's proceedings. In that event, the lawyers will argue, the
umpires' jobs can be restored and back pay ordered.
</P>
<P>
   The union also said in its suit that if the injunction was
granted, neither the leagues nor baseball would suffer irreparable
harm.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit further contends that baseball and its integrity
will suffer harm if the leagues are permitted to proceed with their
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The union, maintaining that it is the umpires who protect the
integrity of the game, even invoked the view of former President
Nixon on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said in his 1985 arbitration decision: ``The leagues
should recognize that umpires have a special relationship to the
game, which is different from that of players. Umpires should not
be treated as employees but as judges who are independent of both
players and owners and whose primary responsibility is to maintain
the integrity of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, more than 50 umpires signed letters of resignation,
which were faxed to the league offices the next day. The leagues
subsequently hired 25 new umpires and accepted the resignations
nine American League umpires and 13 National League umpires. &UR;

 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six jurors were selected in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan on Monday to hear an obscure $7 million personal injury
case called Johnson vs. Riverton Associates. They included a
registered nurse, a student, a communications executive, a
financial journalist and the mayor of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   And over the next week or so, barring a last-minute settlement,
Rudolph Giuliani, the tigerish former federal prosecutor who has
been known to devour lawyers before breakfast and maul judges and
verdicts he does not like, will have a chance to play the common
man in the jury box _ listening instead of lecturing others on
their civic duties, and perhaps forgoing the political pyrotechnics
to walk the slender line of objectivity in the jury room.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor _ the first ever picked to serve on a jury _ was the
latest in a growing list of politicians and celebrities to be
summoned for possible duty since the state approved reforms in 1995
that abolished exemptions for lawyers, doctors and others. Among
those who have been called, but not chosen, are Gov. George Pataki
and the state's chief judge, Judith Kaye _ and even Giuliani once
before.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent people, particularly highly persuasive politicians,
are usually not chosen because trial lawyers regard them as too
influential in the jury room. And no one seemed more amazed than
Giuliani when the opposing lawyers picked him as juror No. 1 in the
civil suit, in which a Harlem man and his wife are suing their
landlord, claiming the husband's genitals were scalded taking a
shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor has in fact been selected to serve as a juror on a
very personal, personal injury case,'' said David Bookstaver, a
spokesman for the state Office of Court Administration. ``To the
best of my knowledge, this is the first time a mayor of New York
has ever served as a juror.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I surprised? Yeah, I was surprised,'' Giuliani said after
an extraordinary day in which he joined the crowd of potential
jurors at a courthouse at 60 Centre St., saw a film about the jury
system and answered lawyers' questions about his qualifications and
his ability to be fair in rendering a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   It was anybody's guess why the lawyers for both sides agreed to
seat Giuliani, rather than exclude him for some specified cause or
by using one of several peremptory challenges that need not be
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is strange that both sides would take him,'' former Mayor
Ed Koch said when asked about it. ``There is no doubt that, his
personality being what it is, you'd fear putting someone like him
on. This is no longer what six people think. It's what Giuliani
thinks. That's gonna be a major problem. No reflection on him. He's
just doing his duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonya Hamlin, a jury and trial consultant who has written books
on juries and communications, speculated that the competing
lawyers, for different reasons, saw advantages in having Giuliani
on the panel _ the tenant's lawyer believing Giuliani's desire to
run for the Senate would prompt him to do the popular thing; the
landlord's lawyer counting on the mayor, who has denounced
``nuisance'' lawsuits against the city, to stand up for principle.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mayor, who received a jury summons in 1996 and another a few
weeks ago, arrived at the courthouse shortly after 9:15 a.m.,
accompanied by two aides and a security detail of plainclothes
police officers. Clad in a light summer suit, he strode up the
steps.
</P>
<P>
   He was soon recognized inside. After a modest hubbub, Giuliani
found himself assigned to a civil court part, sitting in a jury box
with a score of other people being questioned by Brian Hurley, a
lawyer for Oliver and Larene Johnson, the plaintiffs, and James
Miller, representing Riverton Associates, the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, Johnson contends that he was scalded in a shower in
his apartment on Feb. 16, 1995, as a result of a ``defective,
hazardous and unsafe'' hot water system and ``negligence'' by the
landlord. Johnson seeks $6 million in damages, and his wife $1
million for the loss of her husband's services.
</P>
<P>
   No reporters were present for the questioning of the prospective
jurors, but people who were there said the mayor was asked whether
he was a landlord or a tenant. It was unclear what answer he gave,
but he might have noted that he owns an apartment on the Upper East
Side of Manhattan and is a tenant at Gracie Mansion.

MTV TO UNITE MUSIC WEB SITES AHEAD OF LIKELY STOCK OFFERING
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a likely precursor to a public offering of its online music
operations, MTV Networks Online, a unit of Viacom Inc., Monday
announced the creation of a subsidiary to incorporate its three
music-related Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Tom Freston, chairman of MTV Networks, said the
company's online music division would be spun off as a publicly
traded company in nine to 15 months. Company officials declined to
comment Monday on such plans but referred a reporter to the
previous statement.
</P>
<P>
   The new unit, MTV Interactive, will include MTV.com and VH1.com,
the online extensions of Viacom's music cable channels, as well as
SonicNet.com, which was acquired by MTV in May and offers music
news and information. Nicholas Butterworth, formerly president and
chief executive of SonicNet, was named president and chief
executive of MTV Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth said the company's short-term goal was to build
revenue through advertising. In the longer run, he said, it will
emphasize commerce in music, music-related merchandise and concert
tickets, and will eventually sell music in digital form over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the three sites had been under the umbrella of MTV
Networks Online along with Internet properties focused on a younger
audience, notably Nickelodeon Online. ``This will help us execute
our strategy and give us better leverage with distributors,''
Butterworth said.

CLEANING COWBOYS' IMAGE DOESN'T REQUIRE MORE SOAP OPERA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Going totally out of character, I'm refusing to
overreact after the latest episode of ``All My Cowboys.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   But who was originally driving that Suburban, anyway? Al
Cowlings?
</P>
<P>
   It has often been suggested the inhabitants of Valley Ranch long
ago reached soap-opera status. This is false. The soaps seek more
realism.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones arrested on a Sunday morning while on his way to
church? Yes, and Barry Switzer has been accepted to grad school at
MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about another national embarrassment for the Cowboys
organization _ and no, I don't necessarily mean Jerry's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Jones may have upgraded the team image by insisting
nothing delay his visit to a place of worship. In doing so, he had
to be bonded out of jail, but what was more shocking _ Jerry going
to church or being busted by the cops?
</P>
<P>
   If, however, Jerry stumbled into a `goodwill'' gesture for the
Cowboys, it was erased later Sunday evening when the Fox TV cameras
honed in for a sideline shot of Cowboys defensive tackle Nathan
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   This was a bit more than any of us needed to see. Davis stuck
out his tongue to reveal double stud piercings, matching twin
eyebrow piercings. Real class. The only thing Nathan didn't do was
drop his pants and display what else is rumored _ I stress rumored,
because I swear I haven't looked _ to be pierced.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Gailey, you might need to do something. A member of the
Cowboys could have been mistaken for a grunge band act on MTV. It's
harmless, except for the perception. But for the Cowboys, hasn't
perception become everything. Chan, it just didn't look
footballish.
</P>
<P>
   Again, however, there will be no personal overreaction, or
piercings. And that includes reaction to the results of an
exhibition game that was played Sunday night. Somehow, the game
became almost secondary to Jones' arrest, but since it was the best
Cowboys' preseason showing in several years, well...
</P>
<P>
   Place about the same amount of importance on the dismantling of
Denver as in the three previous misadventures of this month. The
one upside for the Cowboys is both teams used the game as a final
tuneup for the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But the same suspects who did a full-tilt panic over the team's
poor play will now be glorifying the meaningless dominance of
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, judge nothing on the field about the Cowboys until
Sept. 12 in Washington. The one and only verdict begins then, and
stretches through December.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, however, what can happen next to the Cowboys?
Image disasters are nothing new, but how can this team possibly top
Jerry Jones being arrested on a Sunday morning while riding to
church?
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, I confess to actually being sympathetic toward Jones
in this particular case.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to the officer of the Highland Park Police
Department who made the original traffic stop, was all this
necessary?
</P>
<P>
   Jones released several statements Sunday night, and then didn't
want to discuss the situation yesterday. It has often been said
Jones is immune to public embarrassment, but apparently not this
time.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a private and joyful family event for Jones _ the
christening of a grandson _ ended up as another Jethro joke. The
usual national ridicule was heaped upon Jones, and in many past
incidents I've either joined in or led that parade.
</P>
<P>
   But this...
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, maybe Jerry tried to big-time the cop. Maybe he
became verbally pushy. Whatever, Jones had a valid reason for not
wanting to be late for this church service, and there were two
carloads of family with him.
</P>
<P>
   It does seem like the police could have cut him a break, but in
saying so, I have no idea what went on after the traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Jones has now done personal damage to his own
``clean up the Cowboys'' campaign. And much of that campaign has
centered around players and coaches never placing themselves in a
position to be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the college draft of 1998, when the Cowboys skipped a
particular player because they feared the possible image impact?
</P>
<P>
   Since coming into the NFL, however, Randy Moss has now been
arrested one less time _ meaning none _ than Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry, it doesn't matter why. Just go ahead and fine yourself
$50,000 and donate the money to a local charity. And for penance,
also have many body parts pierced. See Nathan Davis for references.
</P>
<P>
   There is no soap opera like this soap opera. Except this one
never seems real. nn

 (ATTN: Calif.)   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scott Draper shuffled around the lines of Court 7
Monday, but he could not find solace in its boundaries. This was
not an escape but another dip into a tennis life that seems as
empty and as fragile as a soap bubble.
</P>
<P>
   A simpler life seems much more appealing to Draper now, just six
weeks after his wife, Kellie, died from cystic fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   Once a steadily rising star in the world ranking, Draper, 25, is
wondering where he can find happiness. Right now, it is not on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of his 6-3, 6-1, 6-0 first-round loss to Paul
Goldstein at the U.S. Open, Draper resisted the impulse to walk out
on his first-round match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a struggle,'' Draper said. ``But that would have been
weak and unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet understandable, too. You could see his mind drifting with
every stroke. His forehands landed like darts flung wide of the
board, and simple volleys crashed into the net. At the end,
Goldstein hardly felt like celebrating a match point against an
opponent going through so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go out there, you just play every point and put your
head down after every point,'' said Goldstein, a 23-year-old
Stanford graduate whose ranking has risen from No. 189 to No. 80
this year. ``It's a match you play with a heavy heart because you
feel for Scotty and because he's really one of the most well-liked
and most well-respected people on the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Draper respects the game, too. Maybe he could not have beaten
Goldstein _ a bright young player coming off a gold-medal
performance at the Pan American Games _ but Draper wanted to give
him a tougher match, wanted to prepare him for the Open
competition. But as the two met at the net, they lingered for a
while as Draper put his arm around Goldstein and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up and said: `Mate' _ in typical Scott Draper fashion
_ `Mate, it was nothing against you. My head wasn't into it
today,''' Goldstein said. ``He started the conversation before I
could say anything. I said: `I don't take it bad at all. You're
class.' I said to him, `I admire you for being out here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Draper has been a familiar face on the tour since 1993. But he
is not like a lot of the other players. Although his ranking was up
to No. 51 in 1998 before tumbling to No. 151 during a difficult
season this year, Draper never enjoyed the sport's fast track.
</P>
<P>
   There were too many moments at home lost to the travel, too many
times when he felt the lifestyle promoted selfishness and
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need time to figure out if this is what I want to do for the
next five, six, seven years,'' Draper said. ``Like right now, yes,
I could walk away and say, `I've had enough.' But that would be a
stupid decision because in six or seven or 12 months' time, that
urge, that feeling of wanting to compete may come back. I'm not
making any decisions right now because they're just clouded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what I'm saying, if I found a job right now at home
that paid pretty well and I enjoyed it, it sounds good. But tennis
is a great sport. It brings a lot of great things, but it may not
bring happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   He had that with Kellie. The disease did not stop him from
falling in love, proposing and embracing the 19 months he was given
as her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the person you're marrying, the person you love,'' Draper
said. ``I think the quality of time you spend with somebody is more
important than anything else. She was still the same person
regardless of whatever problems she had. I'd do it all over
again.''
</P>
<P>
   While it has helped the grieving process to be around some of
his friends on the tour this week, he is not sure he wants this
life anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in my thought process right now,'' Draper
said. ``It's just all over the place. That just takes time.''

 &HT;    `Lost' boaters didn't fear for their safety
 &HT;    By Angela Townsend
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Richard Stewart's desire to sail his 65-foot
sailboat through the stormy Atlantic and back to shore safely was
the uppermost goal in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   After managing to bring the Jolly Joyce close enough to land
Saturday night to allow Stewart and his family to use their
cellular phone, it was then that they called home to Ludlow Falls.
They hadn't checked in since July 26.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Stewart was beginning to sense what that connection to
his daughter, Beth, would mean to him, his wife Debra, 47, their
children Chad, 16, and Mischa, 12, and the family pets _ a mixed
breed dog named JJ and a calico named Hannah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any consideration of the boat sinking or anything
like that,'' Richard Stewart said Monday from the Jolly Joyce,
which for now is docked at Ocean City Fisherman's Marina at Ocean
City, Md. ``We've got to do some repairs to the boat before we can
go anywhere,'' he said. ``No, I wasn't really worried about losing
the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wasn't worried about being lost, because that phone call
to Beth was the first time Richard Stewart found out that he and
his family had been classified as ``missing.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Coast Guard, which had been searching for the Jolly
Joyce since Aug. 16, got wind of that Saturday night phone call
from Beth. Sunday, the Coast Guard towed the boat to the marina.
</P>
<P>
   It was Aug. 15 when a family friend, Mike Candella, called the
Coast Guard to report that the Stewart family was missing.

<P>
   The Stewarts, who had been living in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on
their boat intermittently since November, were last seen July 23 in
Newport, R.I. They had docked there for more than a month after
having engine trouble. Relatives last heard from them on July 26.
Harbor authorities in Rhode Island recorded the family's actual
departure Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   By Aug. 17, the Coast Guard had launched two C-130 planes to
scour the Eastern seaboard for the Jolly Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   By Aug. 23, the Coast Guard had suspended its search but had
used substantial resources:
</P>
<P>
   _ Two C-130 planes were flown for slightly more than 13 hours at
a cost of $4,081 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   _ The HU-25 falcon jet launched from Cape Cod, Mass., was flown
for one, six-hour mission at a cost of $3,700 per hour, according
to Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. John Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the planes alone _ more than $75,000 for three days'
use _ and other costs incurred will not be passed on to the
Stewarts, the Coast Guard said. Reimbursements happen only when the
Coast Guard responds to hoax calls, determined as such after an
investigation by the Department of Interior.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday afternoon, the Stewarts had spoken to Beth; Debra
Stewart's mother, Joyce McManus; and Candella.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're kind of peeved,'' Richard Stewart said of them
and other family members who for weeks anxiously awaited word about
the Jolly Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   But now the questions begin.
</P>
<P>
   How could the Stewarts not have known about the six-day, 85,000
nautical square mile search for the Jolly Joyce? Were they lost or
simply out of touch? Why didn't they call family sooner?
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he was never seriously worried about their safety.
After all, they had a 30-day supply of food and water and plenty of
emergency supplies, he said. Food, however, was running out.
</P>
<P>
   Until their first venture into Ocean City to stock up on
groceries, the family's food supply included a few packages of
noodles, some cans of tuna fish and corned beef, bread, juice and
water, Debra Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting down pretty sparse,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Stewarts left Rhode Island, they planned to sail
directly south to Cape Hatteras, N.C., on the way back to Fort
Lauderdale for boat repairs. While attempting to sail along the
outside of Cape Hatteras, the Jolly Joyce ran into a storm on Aug.
6.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storm knocked us 30 miles further east, and then back
north,'' Stewart said. By the time they recovered from that storm,
they drifted another 15 miles east and hit another storm Aug. 7.
The Jolly Joyce lost its mizzenmast (the back sail) and mainsail.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, a hydraulic leak caused them to lose steering.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18, the Stewarts began drifting east in the Gulf Stream
and made some repairs to the sails and the steering.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 22 while heading to Cape Henry, Va., they saw some
merchant vessels but couldn't communicate with them because of weak
radio signals.
</P>
<P>
   The winds were not kind, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd gain 10 miles west, then end up going the opposite
direction,'' he said. ``Over the course of the time we were out
there, we slotted several different courses to go because of the
wind,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point they were within 300 miles of Bermuda, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after spending more than two hours locating the the
Stewarts, the Coast Guard used a 47-foot motor lifeboat to tow the
Jolly Joyce. By then the Jolly Joyce had lost all steering and the
use of its engines.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard had asked the family to call them every 30
minutes during the day Sunday until they could find them; Richard
Stewart, however, was determined to come in on his own power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd gone 900 miles on our own. If we would get to shore we're
gonna do it on our own,'' his wife quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard is now conducting a ``survivor debriefing,''
standard operating procedure in a successful search and rescue
case, Fitzgerald said. The debriefing includes interviews with the
family and the compilation of additional data.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next couple of weeks the Coast Guard will review copies
of Stewart's logs to compare the Jolly Joyce trip with the Coast
Guard's search patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald conceded its two-week involvement with the search for
the Jolly Joyce departs from Coast Guard norms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically we will search until we're pretty certain that we've
exhausted all possibilities,'' Fitzgerald said. ``Obviously this is
a wonderful thing. The most obvious lesson that anyone can learn
from this is that people have to file a float plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Stewarts done that, the Coast Guard may have found them
sooner, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were lucky. Almost 30 days at sea is a long time,''
Fitzgerald said. ``Had they incurred a little more trouble and been
delayed in going back to shore, they would have been affected by
the hurricane (Dennis). Who knows what would have happened then.''
</P>
<P>
   Son Carter Stewart, 27, the family's unofficial spokesman, on
Monday expressed his relief that the Jolly Joyce had been located.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Coast Guard) was absolutely fabulous and professional,''
he said. ``We're very relieved to know that this potentially tragic
story has a happy ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter Stewart deferred all other comments about the matter to
his father and stepmother, but not before adding, ``This is their
drama, let them act in it.''

   IRAQ: CONGRESSIONAL VISIT

<P>
   Aides to five U.S. members of Congress are in Iraq to try to
assess the effect of nine years of international sanctions on
civilians. The delegation, drawn from the staffs of four Democrats,
Sam Gedjenson of Connecticut, Cynthia McKinney of Georgia, Earl
Hilliard of Alabama and Danny K. Davis of Illinois, and one
independent, Bernard Sanders of Vermont, were taken on a tour of
Baghdad hospitals and a bomb shelter in which Iraq says 403 people
died in allied bombing during the Persian Gulf war.

   Two more Catholic teen-agers have been ordered to leave Northern
Ireland or face death by men who say they represent the Irish
Republican Army. One is 15; the other, an unidentified 19-year-old,
was beaten before receiving the expulsion order. Four young men
left the province over the weekend after receiving similar threats,
and Protestant politicians contend that the actions undermine
claims that the IRA's two-year-old cease-fire is holding and make
Sinn Fein, the group's political ally, unfit to take part in peace
talks that are set to resume next week.

Mexico, according to a nationwide poll by the newspaper Reforma.
Francisco Labastida Ochoa, a former Interior Minister, and Roberto
Madrazo Pintado, a former governor of Tabasco, the leading
candidates for the PRI's Nov. 7 presidential primary, are virtually
tied in voter preferences 10 weeks before the primary vote.

   The five living ex-presidents of the National Autonomous
University of Mexico appealed for an end to a student strike that

Led by Pablo Gonzalez Casanova, who headed the university in the
early '70s, the ex-presidents called the strike illegal but
insisted it be settled without violence.

A TRACK STAR'S BURDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Fla.) (jt) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY JR.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ When the world's best sprinters met in
Seville, Spain, last week to test the limits of human speed, Dennis
Mitchell was not among them. The veteran American sprinter instead
worked out at the University of Florida track, helping younger
athletes with their running technique while keeping an eye on his
two small children.
</P>
<P>
   But his mind, and part of his heart, were two thousand miles
away at the world track and field championships, where he had hoped
to at last win a gold medal and break his personal record in the
100 meters.
</P>
<P>
   That hope was destroyed in August, when a three-member panel
from the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the sport's
international governing body, suspended Mitchell for two years. The
arbitrators ruled that a test of Mitchell's urine had proved he was
taking banned steroids, even though a United States panel had
cleared him of the same charge in December. His ban will end on
April 1, 2000, two years after the positive test.
</P>
<P>
   The world championships ended on Sunday, but for Mitchell the
distress continues. For years he had spoken out against doping in
track and field and was seen as a role model by many younger
athletes. At 33, he has only a few more years of competition left.
His reputation is hopelessly tarnished, he says. His livelihood,
which he said brought him a half-million dollars a year, has been
temporarily taken from him. And he angrily maintains, as he has all
along, that there is a natural explanation for the test results.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing else for me to do except accept this thing,''
he said, looking wistfully down at the track. ``I feel terribly
wronged. I feel like this sport owed me more than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, a four-time national champion who has competed in
three Olympics, is one of several athletes suspended recently not
because banned substances were found in their bodies, but because
the ratio of various hormones in their urine was so unusual that
the International Amateur Athletic Federation ruled it could only
have been caused by taking illicit steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Once a Positive Test, A Presumption of Guilt
</P>
<P>
   Whether Mitchell is telling the truth, his case illustrates the
difficulties inherent in trying to catch athletes who ingest
hormones already found naturally in the body. It also raises
troubling questions about how the sport's main governing body
adjudicates such cases. Athletes going before IAAF arbitrators must
do more than simply create a reasonable doubt about the evidence
against them. They are presumed to be guilty unless they can prove
that the hormonal imbalance in their bodies has a natural cause, a
nearly impossible burden, lawyers say, since there is little
research on the subject outside of studies done by the very same
laboratories testing the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's case may also reflect another problem: the growing
use among top athletes of unregulated dietary supplements, from
amino acids to plant sterols, bought over the counter in
health-food stores. The effect of these supplements on the body are
largely a matter of conjecture, scientists say. What's worse, some
products have been found to be mislabeled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of different things sold in food-supplement
stores,'' Dr. Don H. Catlin, who operates the Olympic drug-testing
laboratory at the University of California at Los Angeles and is a
member of the International Olympic Committee's medical committee
on doping. ``Many of them have amino acids on the label, but this
is not a regulated industry, so it's buyer beware.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many modern sprinters, Mitchell's cupboard looks like a
new-age apothecary shop. There are bottles of Symbiotropin,
Triboxin, arginine, glutamine, B-complex, Creotine Xtreme and whey
protein.
</P>
<P>
   But while Mitchell admits he has experimented with these
supplements to try to keep his strength from declining with age, he
does not think he took a banned substance by accident. Instead, he
has argued at his hearings, the testosterone level found in his
urine resulted from two stressful nights without sleep, including a
night of drinking and lovemaking to celebrate his fiancee's
birthday, coupled with the effect of amino acids he was taking to
shore up his aging muscles. The acids _ arginine and glutamine _
might have stimulated his adrenal gland to produce more
testosterone than normal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My testosterone level rose naturally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the case is a test that Olympic drug-testing
laboratories have used since 1983 to catch athletes who are taking
testosterone and other steroids that allow their bodies to put on
extra muscle during training, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The test measures the ratio between two hormones excreted in the
urine in a metabolized form _ testosterone and epitestosterone,
scientists say. When testosterone, or another anabolic steroid
closely related to it, is taken as a supplement, the production of
epitestosterone is suppressed and the gap between the two hormones
in the urine widens.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, Olympic labs have tested tens of
thousands of athletes. Those results show 90 percent of athletes
have a ratio of about 1-to-1 and that more than 99 percent fall
under 5-to-1. Only one in every 2,000 athletes has a naturally
elevated level, and those tend to remain constant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, officials at the International Olympic Committee set a
limit of 6-to-1 as the acceptable upper ratio. Even that limit left
room for cheating, scientists say, since most people have much
lower ratios. Anything above that level was deemed to be evidence
of taking steroids, unless the athlete had a history of elevated
testosterone, scientists at several Olympic labs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six was the speed limit,'' Catlin explained.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Violating The Speed Limit
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was tested on April 1, 1998, when lab technicians hired
by the IAAF showed up without warning at the track in Gainesville
to conduct a urine test.
</P>
<P>
   Unannounced tests have been routine since 1996 to fight a
widespread perception of cheating. Before that, athletes were
tested only during competitions, and some athletes beat the testers
with gels, creams, patches and injections that deliver drugs
quickly flushed from the system.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's urine was sent to a Montreal laboratory accredited by
the International Olympic Committee, where scientists found it
contained a testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio of 7.3-to-1. He
had been tested 21 times before and had never had a ratio above
2.2-to-1, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was not told about the test results until three months
later, at a meet in Norway on July 8. He was stunned. He rushed
home and had a battery of blood tests by an independent doctor to
prove he was clean. ``I turned myself inside out for them,'' he
said. It was to no avail. Just after the Goodwill Games in August,
officials from USA Track and Field informed him he had been
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   But at a hearing in December, Mitchell mounted a surprisingly
formidable defense, calling Wylie C. Hembree, a respected
endocrinologist from Columbia University, as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Hembree testified that the elevated testosterone level might
well have been caused by Mitchell's sleepless weekend, coupled with
drinking alcohol and the effect of other dietary supplements he was
taking.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights before the test, Mitchell had driven for 10 hours
from a meet in Raleigh, N.C., to Florida, pushing on through the
night and arriving home late in the morning. He then went to the
track after two hours' sleep and worked out. That night, instead of
sleeping, he had stayed up until dawn for a second night with his
fiancee to celebrate her birthday, drinking eight beers and having
sex several times, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hembree said that sleep deprivation causes the
adrenal gland to work overtime, pumping out three times more
cortisone and other hormones than normal. The gland produces only a
small amount of testosterone, but it produces other hormones that
can be quickly converted to testosterone in the bodies tissues,
thus boosting the amount of metabolized testosterone in the urine,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hembree pointed out that alcohol has been shown to
increase testosterone levels, since the enzymes that usually break
down testosterone are kept busy attacking the alcohol molecules.
Studies at Olympic labs have also shown moderate increases in the
testosterone level in men's urine after heavy drinking and fairly
large increases among female athletes, scientists at three labs
said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Hembree pointed out that the amino acids Mitchell had
been taking can cause the body to produce more human growth
hormone, which in turn would have stimulated the adrenal gland to
secrete even more products that could increase the amount of
metabolized testosterone in the urine. ``It was highly likely that
was the explanation,'' Hembree said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But testing experts from Olympic labs argued there were no
scientific studies that specifically proved Hembree's theory. They
noted that in addition to the high ratio, Mitchell also had twice
as much testosterone in his urine as his past tests had shown _
about 300 nanograms per milliliter. Christiane Ayotte, who heads
the University of Quebec lab that did the test, said the only
possible explanation was that he took steroids. ``I am 100 percent
convinced that this elevated ratio was not attributable to natural
factors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The American panel _ composed of two lawyers and an athlete _
disagreed. They ruled that Mitchell had created enough doubt about
the validity of the test to be exonerated. The IAAF appealed the
decision to arbitrators at the organization's headquarters in Monte
Carlo, Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time an American panel had questioned the
world body's tests. Another U.S. panel had cleared Mary Decker
Slaney, the former world champion distance runner, in 1997 after
her lawyers presented evidence that the testosterone ratio in women
could rise dramatically because of birth control pills and
menopausal changes.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year both rulings were overruled by panels of
arbitrators in Monte Carlo. In both cases, the IAAF officials ruled
that the prosecution had proved a doping violation ``beyond a
reasonable doubt'' simply by showing the athlete had a
testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio and raw testosterone level
far above the athlete's previous test results.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arne Ljungqvist, the chairman of the IAAF medical
commission, said sports officials have so much confidence in the
testing method that it is up to the athletes to provide scientific
evidence of their claims. He noted the 25 labs employed by the
International Olympic Committee draw their conclusions from more
than 100,000 tests each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enough data available to show that cases like the
one we are talking about have been the result of the ingestion of a
banned substance,'' he said. ``It is not for us to prove that they
are wrong, because they can come up with any claim. It is for them
to prove that they are right. And they couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic Labs' Studies Are Questioned
</P>
<P>
   But some critics have questioned the studies done by Olympic
labs because they often do not include control groups to compare
against the athletes. No one has ever studied, for instance, the
effect of sleep deprivation on the testosterone-to-epitestosterone
ratio, Hembree said.
</P>
<P>
   In Mitchell's eyes, the hearing was a farce. He said the IAAF
panel sacrificed him because it did not want to not set a precedent
that dietary supplements and sleep deprivation may skew the test
results.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings at the international body have also infuriated U.S.
track officials, who are questioning why they should go to the
expense of holding hearings if the decisions of their panels are
ignored by the IAAF. Some have even argued an independent
arbitration court relying on outside labs should be set up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go to a system where any doping case in the world is
adjudicated in exactly the same way, with a hearing and an appeals
process, that are external to any sports organization,'' Craig
Masback, the chief executive officer of USA Track and Field, said
this week in Seville.
</P>
<P>
   For Mitchell, the bottom line is that he did not run the 100
meters in Seville this year, though he will be allowed to compete
in next year's Olympics in Sydney, Australia. The loss is still
significant, he said. He had hoped to break his personal record of
9.91, set in 1991, and his times had been coming down this fall.
His career has been notable: He was the 100-meter bronze medalist
in the 1992 Olympics and part of two teams that share the world
record for the 400-meter relay. Still, he had harbored hopes of
someday winning a world championship. And he still dreams of
running a 9.8 before his career is finished. Those hopes are now
dimming rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two years they were trying to take away from me were the
only two years I wanted,'' he said.

MICROSOFT SHUTS SECURITY BREACH IN E-MAIL SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By   SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Microsoft Corp. scrambled Monday to close a
security breach that had left tens of millions of personal e-mail
accounts freely accessible through Web sites that were created to
exploit the vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how much private information might have been
compromised and for what length of time. And while Microsoft said
it had solved the problem, after shutting down the service for
several hours, it was not clear whether other vulnerabilities in
the e-mail service, known as Hotmail, might still exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go into specifics'' about Hotmail security issues
``because we don't want to enable people to do this all the time,''
said Rob Bennett, director of marketing for MSN, Microsoft's online
division, which includes Hotmail.
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail is a free service that allows any Internet user to
create an account and send and receive e-mail from any location
with Internet access. Microsoft says 40 million people worldwide
have signed up for the service, but it is not clear how many use
it.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was clear from messages circulating on the Internet
on Monday that unauthorized users had gained access to e-mail
accounts, Microsoft said it had received no reports of tampering
with e-mail content.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it was alerted to the problem at 2 a.m., Pacific
time, by a Swedish newspaper that ran an article about it.
</P>
<P>
   The company responded by immediately shutting down the Hotmail
service. Microsoft said it restored service after about eight
hours, but a cat-and-mouse game ensued as new instructions were
circulated on the Internet routing would-be intruders around the
initial fix and Microsoft scrambled to block them.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m., Pacific time, Bennett declared the problem solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going manually now from server to server to make sure
the fix has been propagated, but we're quite confident that it has
been,'' he said. The HotMail servers, the computers that operate
the service, are scattered around the world, but the ones initially
attacked were in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith, a computer security expert, said the program that
allowed illicit access to Hotmail appeared to be derived from the
work of a programmer named Michael Nobilio, whose Internet postings
say the software was intended to allow users to store their Hotmail
login information as a convenience so it would not have to be
entered each time they used the service. Nobilio made his program
available through an Internet discussion group in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But what was apparently intended to be innocent code could be
manipulated to allow people to gain access to Hotmail accounts
without a password, so long as they knew the user's e-mail address.
The code has been posted on at least 20 sites scattered around the
Internet, probably for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enjoy, and I hope other folks find it as useful as I have!''
he said in one Internet posting.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail exchange Monday with Smith, president of Phar Lap
Software in Cambridge, Mass., Nobilio said he knew nothing of the
Hotmail vulnerability and had not intended for his program to be
used maliciously.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC.com, an Internet news service in which Microsoft is a
partner, quoted Jon Thompson, administrator of one of the Web sites
that posted instructions on exploiting the Hotmail flaw, as saying
that associates had known about the vulnerability of Hotmail
accounts for about eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Carrwik, the reporter who wrote for the Swedish
newspaper Expressen, said he was tipped off to the vulnerability by
a hacker over the weekend, and was told that a member of the
computer underground discovered the hole late last week, MSNBC.com
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The episode was one of several recently in which the security of
Microsoft software was found to be compromised. A flaw affecting
the Office 97 and Office 2000 programs allowed a user's data,
software or hardware to be damaged via e-mail or commands sent from
a malicious Web site. The company also said this month that it was
repairing a bug in its new Internet chat software, MSN Messenger,
that could allow anyone with access to an individual's computer to
see that person's Hotmail password.
</P>
<P>
   The incident raised eyebrows among the community of well-meaning
hackers who probe software for security flaws but immediately
report them to the vendor. Bennett said that whoever made the
Hotmail vulnerability known on the Internet had not reported it to
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good relationship with white-hat hackers,'' he said.
``It's unfortunate that the person or people responsible chose to
put people's privacy at risk in such a public way.''

   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Hurricane Dennis began peeling away from the
coast of North Carolina on Monday afternoon, apparently sparing the
state the kind of damage it had suffered in three other hurricanes
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here along the state's southern coast began reopening
barrier islands that were evacuated on Sunday night. And although
northern coastal communities remained hunkered down Monday evening
against heavy rain, sustained winds of nearly 90 mph and gusts of
up to 112 mph, they also seemed to have avoided a direct hit.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the eye of the storm continued moving
east-northeast, away from the coast, officials cautioned that the
hurricane remained a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are so unpredictable,'' said Bill Furney of the
North Carolina Division of Emergency Management. ``It could stay
off the coast for a day or two and gather strength and come back
in. We hope that doesn't happen. What we need is a good front to
come in from the coast and push Dennis back out to sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, predicted that the storm would ``come to a screeching halt
out there'' in the Atlantic by early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, heaven only knows what it's going to do,'' Jarrell said.
``But we think it'll probably sit there for one, two or three days,
and then almost anything is possible after that.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University,
explained that the hurricane was being pushed away from the coast
by the same southward dip of jet-stream winds that brought cool
weather to the Northeast on Monday. The jet stream is now expected
to move back to the north, Miner said, a shift that, in the absence
of any other strong weather pattern, will most likely leave the
storm to stall at sea.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At 11 o'clock Monday night, the eye of the hurricane was about
145 miles east of Cape Hatteras, and was continuing on a path that
had brought it close to the coast, but without making landfall, all
along the Southeastern seaboard. A hurricane warning was changed to
a tropical storm warning along the North Carolina coast, from Cape
Lookout to the Virginia state line.
</P>
<P>
   No deaths were attributed to the storm directly, although a
head-on collision that killed two people Monday morning in Onslow
County, north of Wilmington, was laid to 60 mph winds and heavy
rain associated with it. The storm did not appear to have caused
any major structural damage in southern North Carolina. To the
north, it was still too early Monday evening for much of a damage
assessment, although there, too, it appeared that Dennis had not
brought the destruction inflicted by three other hurricanes in the
last three years: Bertha, Bonnie and Fran.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clontz of the New Hanover County Emergency Management
Agency, here in Wilmington, said: ``We're thinking we're very lucky
we only got a glancing blow, compared to the three storms we've had
in the past few years. The rest of the state seems to be faring
very well just like we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the whole country made out. It's like Dennis said,
`How close can I get to land and not cause any damage?'''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The storm did cut electrical power to 60,000 people, the North
Carolina Division of Emergency Management reported, and those
disruptions stretched as far inland as 140 miles, all the way to
the Raleigh area, where at one point about 10,000 customers were
without power.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, ``we have a few roads out, and bridges closed,'' said
Furney, of the state's emergency management division.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although the punishment to the state as a whole appeared light,
there were pockets of almost puzzling damage. On Hatteras Island,
two gasoline pumps embedded in concrete were blown over at the
service station owned by Danny Couch, who sat out the storm on the
island. (Although the island was under an evacuation order,
residents were allowed to stay if they remained on their own
property.)
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Tucker, 39, from Michigan, also stayed on the island,
with 24 of her relatives, who were making their annual visit to the
Outer Banks Motel on the beachfront. The motel owner let the
gathered clan stay at her house, farther from the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were here for Hurricane Emily in 1993,'' Ms. Tucker said,
``but we evacuated for that. This one didn't seem like it would be
as bad. We haven't been out yet, but I don't think there will be
too much damage. We're still hoping to get a good week out of our
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   At a mooring on the Cape Fear River in downtown Wilmington on
Monday morning, Mike Brit cleared some leaves off his 55-foot
charter boat, which he moved there from Carolina Beach, a barrier
island south of the city, after that island was evacuated on
Sunday. Brit spent the night with his wife in a nearby hotel with a
view of the river, and his assistant, Dean Holt, stayed on board
the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sleep much,'' Brit said. ``Dean had a phone, I had a
phone, so we kept in touch through the storm. I came down here
about 4:30 in the morning to check on the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, neither the boat nor Holt suffered any damage, and
when the first sunlight of the morning appeared, and Brit decided
that the worst was over, he declared the hurricane not so bad as
those he had weathered in the past.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Already Monday, hopes for a big Labor Day weekend were spreading
among many whose work is dependent on the busy tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call Labor Day weekend the last big hurrah of the season,''
said Shayna Anderson, a front-desk manager at the Blockade Runner
Beach Resort on Wrightsville Beach, a barrier island near
Wilmington that was evacuated on Sunday night but reopened Monday.
Ms. Anderson said the hotel was just about fully booked for the
Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came in this morning,'' she said, ``the phone was
ringing off the wall with booked guests for this weekend checking
to see if we were still here. I spent much of the morning assuring
them that we were, in fact, still standing, had had minimal damage
and that everything would be fine for this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   But one family that evacuated the area on Sunday apparently has
no plans to return this season. Vice President Al Gore cut short
his family beach vacation on Figure Eight Island near Wilmington on
Sunday afternoon, after state officials issued evacuation orders
for that and other islands.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore family was nearing the end of a 12-day vacation at a
private home on the four-mile-long resort island just north of
Wrightsville Beach, said Thomas F. Taft, a family friend who had
planned the trip. The private home, where the Gores also stayed for
two weeks in 1997, is owned by V. Parker Overton, founder of a
large water sports equipment retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had intended to stay until Tuesday, but after monitoring
the hurricane's progress on television and through military
channels, decided to leave early, Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they started having evacuations,'' Taft said, ``he felt
it best to take normal precautions.''

NEW YORK LIBERTY DEFEAT CHARLOTTE STING 69-54  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Texas, Calif.)   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The celebration started early Monday night, the crowd
realizing from the opening minutes what became a reality to the
Charlotte Sting in the final minutes. In the final minute, after a
steal and a foul stopped the clock, Teresa Weatherspoon finally let
loose, whirling her arms at the crowd or the sky and then hopping
frantically into the air.
</P>
<P>
   There was no need to get the crowd of 12,929 at Madison Square
Garden out of its seats. The emotional outpouring was for herself,
celebrating the Liberty's 69-54 victory in Game 3 of the
best-of-3-game Eastern Conference finals and releasing a season of
waiting for a chance that the Liberty now possess, heading to the
Women's National Basketball Association championship series
beginning on Thursday night in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty, which missed the playoffs on the final game of the
regular season last year, will face the winner of the Western
Conference finals series between the Houston Comets and the Los
Angeles Sparks that was played Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   As the Sting slumped off the floor, the Liberty celebrated
wildly, with Weatherspoon racing to every corner of the floor, then
hopping onto the press table, as rookie Tamika Whitmore danced into
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty had earned the home-court advantage in the Eastern
Conference finals with its first-place finish in the regular
season, an advantage that seemed precariously close to going to
waste after the Liberty lost Game 1 in Charlotte. But after
surviving Game 2, it never trailed once in this game.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that the final minutes arrived Monday night, a
celebration followed almost every basket, whether it was a
fist-pump by Weatherspoon, the hand thrust in the air by Vickie
Johnson after a jumper, or a taunting glare by Whitmore when the
dagger had been twisted in the Sting for good.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the Liberty knew that there would be no comebacks,
no furious rushes to the finish. The only drama down the stretch
was whether the Liberty could contain itself until the final buzzer
sounded. Weatherspoon assured that by spearheading a defensive
effort that would be the envy of the Liberty's Garden-mates, the
Knicks, and by handing out 11 assists as she controlled the tempo,
keeping the Liberty from squandering any of its lead.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive game, the Liberty controlled play for
most of the first half, building leads of as large as 11 points and
never trailing in the opening 20 minutes. But after seeing that
lead evaporate in a Game 1 loss and then disappear in Game 2 before
the Liberty was able to regroup in the final minutes, New York was
well aware it was in for a fight in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   While the two sides nearly did come to an actual fight on the
floor, something that would have come as little surprise with the
constant trash-talk on the floor and in the locker rooms, the fight
that the Liberty displayed was the sort that drove the Madison
Square Garden crowd into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Leading by 40-34 on a pair of 3-point field goals by Crystal
Robinson, who had a team-high 18 points, in the opening minutes of
the second half, the Liberty seemingly opened the door as Robinson
turned the ball over. But as Andrea Stinson, who had a game-high 24
points, raced the other way, Robinson chased her down from behind.
She caught her, deflected the ball into the stands and then bounded
into the seats behind the basket herself.
</P>
<P>
   If the hustle sparked the crowd, it also provided a lift to the
Liberty, which responded on the other end. With the Sting unable to
score when it inbounded the ball, Johnson buried a 3-point field
goal, starting a stretch in which the Liberty opened the lead back
up to 56-43 with just over seven minutes to play, prompting a
celebration that had even the front-row observer Dick Vitale
dancing on the floor. After the timeout, the Liberty continued to
build on the lead, capping out at 60-43 on a jumper by Kym Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, again playing with the fear that the game might be her
last with retirement awaiting at season's end, played a steady
first half Monday night after a manic second half on Sunday. She
finished the first half with six points and eight rebounds, helping
the Liberty to a 32-26 advantage.

AN EMPTY BOX OVERFLOWS WITH AFFECTION FOR TIM RAINES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT  
 (ATTN: Calif., Canada, Ore.)   By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tim Raines of the Oakland Athletics was the center of
attention in the Yankees' clubhouse Monday night before the game.
He was standing in the middle of the room, engulfed by the opposing
team.
</P>
<P>
   Raines spent almost an hour with his former Yankee teammates,
catching up on news, teasing them, laughing with them.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams gave him a bearhug. It was a powerful reminder
of how popular Raines was during his three-year stay in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Raines was at Yankee Stadium Monday night for an on-field
ceremony during which he was presented with his 1998 World Series
championship ring. It was Raines' first time in New York since the
victory parade in Manhattan last October.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first time Raines had traveled with the A's
since he learned last month that he had lupus, an incurable but
treatable connective tissue disease in which the immune system
turns against the body.
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitting outfielder, who turns 40 on Sept. 16, won't
play again this season, but he vowed Monday night to be ready for
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   During the emotion-charged ceremony, Raines went from the
Oakland dugout to home plate, where he was met by manager Joe
Torre, who handed him a box that had no ring in it. The entire
Yankee team then gathered around Raines, and Williams presented him
the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was emotional,'' Raines said before the game. ``I haven't
seen those guys in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to play. I know that. I could probably play five or
six more years. I feel like a rookie. Who knows, maybe I could play
another 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines said he was feeling better than he had in months. Three
weeks ago, when the Yankees were in Oakland, he was too weak to
make the short drive to visit his former teammates at the park.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the swelling and the weight he gained from the illness
are gone, although, at one point Monday he pulled up his jeans and
showed David Cone how his ankles were still thicker than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks good,'' Torre said. ``He says he feels great. If
there's one person we miss, not for his at-bats but for his
presence, it's Rock. You remember his infectious laugh. He's a good
guy with great leadership qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of his career, Raines, who carried a .296 batting
average into this season, was an outstanding leadoff batter and
base stealer. But his role as a Yankee was more pronounced in the
clubhouse than on the field. He was the joker, the guy with the
high-pitched cackle who always seemed to keep things loose. He was
even able to get a smile out of the combustible Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miss him around here,'' Derek Jeter said. ``What can I say?
He was a great teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey Rock, come over here,'' Jeter yelled moments later. ``Hey
Rock, come on, you old man.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines said that winning the championships with the Yankees in
1996 and 1998 were the highlights of his career, which began in
Montreal in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the greatest feeling I've ever had in my life,'' he
said. ``For years I watched Michael Jordan win championship after
championship and wondered what it felt like to put on one of those
rings. Now I've had that feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines is undergoing intensive treatment for lupus. His friend
and lawyer, Randy Grossman, said the disease, which Raines might
have had for years before the diagnosis, could have contributed to
the injuries that forced Raines to miss considerable time as a
Yankee with hamstring and knee ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who knows Tim knows that he was never one to make
excuses,'' Grossman said. ``But lupus may have very well affected
his hamstrings.''
</P>
<P>
   With this season over for Raines, he is focusing on preparing
for next year. Nine years after Ken Griffey Jr. and Sr. became the
first father-son teammates to play in a game, Raines said that his
dream is to be able to hang around long enough to play with his
oldest son, Tim Jr., who was Baltimore's sixth-round pick last year
and is working his way through the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That the one thing I want to do,'' Raines said. `` I want to
do the Griffey thing.''
