<HEADLINE> 66 People Killed in Bus Attack in Egypt: TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Altogether 66 people, including
foreign tourists and Egyptians, have been reportedly killed in a
terrorist attack in the Upper Egyptian city of Luxur this morning,
according to Egypt state television.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian TV broke off its normal broadcasting to announce
the latest casualties a few hours after unidentified gunmen shot
at a tour bus and fought a two-hour gun battle with police near a
tourist site in Luxor, about 560 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed, this would be the biggest single toll in a
terrorist attack in a wave of violence that swept Egypt over the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Hassan el-Alfi, charged with striking down
Islamic militants fighting a five-year war against President Hosni
Mubarak's secular government, has flown to Luxor.
</P>
<P>
A special plane carrying a medical team landed at Luxor airport
to transport the casualties to Cairo for treatment. Minister of
Health Ismail Sallam also flew there to supervise those injured in
the attack, the second in the country in two months.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier report, the Middle East News Agency said 22 were
wounded, including 11 Egyptians and 11 foreign tourists and two in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
An official statement is expected to be released at any moment
defining the number of casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian TV in a previous bulletin quoted an official
security source as saying that the six gunmen were all killed.
</P>
<P>
But MENA quoted "a top level security source" in Luxor as
saying that there may be a seventh terrorist still at large.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a security source as saying that the terrorists fired
haphazardly at the tourist bus travelling from a dock on the Nile
to a tourist site in el Deir al Bahari, before they fled in the
direction of the Valley of Queens.
</P>
<P>
In a shoot-out with the police immediately after they opened
fire, one gunman was killed. In the following pursuit of the
remaining five, the police managed to kill them all during the
subsequent exchange of fire, said MENA.
</P>
<P>
According to some tourist guides on site, the bus was carrying
Japanese, American and German tourists when it was hijacked by the
attackers and driven to the Valley of Queens which houses hundreds
of Pharaonic tombs.
</P>
<P>
So far no one has claimed responsibility for the attack. But
speculations have it that the Islamic militants scheming to
install a strict Islamic rule in Egypt with violence were to blame.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3,000 have been killed since 1992, mostly policemen,
terrorists, tourists and civilians.
</P>
<P>
As the government's crackdown has largely confined the violence
to such southern hideouts as Assuit and Minya, undeterred foreign
tourists still patron Luxor, a top Egyptian tourist attraction
that boasts mammoth Pharaonic temples and royal tombs.
</P>
<P>
In the previous attack targeting foreign tourists, nine Germans
and an Egyptian driver were killed on September 18 in a gunshoot
and firebomb attack on a bus in front of the Egyptian Antiquities
Museum in Cairo. The two assailants were sentenced to death on
October 30.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, a vulnerable target of terrorism, has brought about 4
million tourists and 3 billion U.S. dollars to Egypt last year.

<HEADLINE> Albright Leaves for Pakistan After Gulf Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright left Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh today
for Pakistan after her visits to Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia to rally support for U.S. military build-up in the region.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) quoted diplomatic sources in Riyadh
as saying that during her stay in Saudi Arabia, Albright held
talks with Saudi King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz on the latest developments in the region and the
current standoff between Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The two sides reviewed the ramifications of Iraq's decision to
ban U.S. arms inspectors from taking part in the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to try to persuade Iraq to reverse its decision and
resolve the crisis through diplomacy before resorting to a
military option.
</P>
<P>
They renewed their appeal to Iraq to stop placing obstacles on
the way of the U.N. arms inspection and fully comply with all
U.N. Security Council resolutions to eliminate tension in the
region, the KUNA said.
</P>
<P>
Albright said at the conclusion of her three-hour stay in
Kuwait Sunday that the U.S. was actively pursuing a diplomatic
solution to the crisis, "but if (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein
insists on threatening the wish of the international community, we
cannot rule out other options."
</P>
<P>
She also reiterated the U.S. stand that Saddam Hussein should
allow the U.N. Special Commission inspectors to carry out their
mission regardless of their nationality.
</P>
<P>
She affirmed that "there is no way out for Saddam Hussein if
he doesn't reverse his decision and change course. That is a
message I can clearly say now," which she said was supported and
applauded by the countries she visited.
</P>
<P>
She asserted that Iraq should implement all U.N. resolutions
and rescind from its decision to expel U.S. members in the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Iraq expelled six Americans working with the UNSCOM last
Friday, causing other 66 members of the commission to pull out
of the country and a military build-up by the U.S. in the Gulf
for a possible military strike.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that the U.S. was looking for a political
solution to the crisis, but she did not rule out other options
if tension continues to escalate.
</P>
<P>
She said the aim of her tour in the Gulf was to caution the
states of the region of the dangers the Iraqi regime is subjecting
the region to.
</P>
<P>
Albright made it clear in Doha Sunday while attending the
opening ceremony of the fourth Middle East and North Africa
economic conference that Washington was determined that Iraq
should not be allowed to block the U.N. mission although her
country was making every effort to end the crisis through
diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state is on a week-long tour of Europe
and South Asia, but the Gulf crisis has made her take a whirlwind
tour to the four Gulf states before resuming her arranged
schedule.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Hold Demonstrations in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A large number of
Palestinians held demonstrations today in the West Bank city of
Bethlehem to show their sympathy for a Palestinian boy who died of
rubber bullet wounds Saturday in a Jerusalem hospital.
</P>
<P>
Nine-year-old Ali Jawarish, who was wounded Tuesday by rubber
bullets fired by Israeli soldiers, was laid rest Sunday in his
hometown of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
Around 1,000 local residents participated in his funeral. Ali's
organs were donated by his family to three Israeli children
patients.
</P>
<P>
The march, which started from the Bethlehem University, ended
in front of the house of Ali inside the Ayda Refugee Camp near
Rachel Tomb.
</P>
<P>
"This march was organized to show our sympathy for Ali, but
also to show our solidarity with the Iraqi people and Palestinian
prisoner Ataf Alayan," one of the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Alayan was released several months ago from Israeli prison
under the Oslo Accords signed by Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), but she was rearrested by the Israeli
police about four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Shorterly after her arrest, she went on a hunger strike to
protest against the arrest and her detention without charge by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Ali was shot by rubber bullets within
a range of only 15 to 20 meters while around 30 Palestinian
children between the age of 8 to 12 throwing stones at Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police said the open fire regulations
concerning rubber bullets prohibit their use at a range closer
than 40 meters and these regulations also explicitly prohibit
shooting rubber bullets at children.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, 275 Palestinian children under the age
of 16 have been killed by Israeli soldiers, of these 69 were
under the age of 12, Palestinian police said.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Admits Diplomat Offering Iraq Top Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The German Foreign Ministry today
admitted that a Bonn diplomat had provided Iraq with hundreds of
classified documents during the 1990 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann confirmed a report in
the news weekly Der Spiegal that former diplomat Juergen Mohammed
Gietler, 42, had revealed to Iraq "West's complete political and
military counter-measures" before his arrest at the end of August
1990.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence he passed to Iraq included the French
satellite pictures of Israeli missile sites and United States
military plans such as a report on the number of the Stealth
bombers being sent to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
A court in Duesseldorf sentenced Gietler to five years in
prison in May 1991. The trial was classified as a state secret
so that the espionage case would not go public, which was seen as
one of the most embarrassing security and foreign policy lapses in
Germany's post-war history.
</P>
<P>
The Spiegal magazine said the judge feared that on knowing the
case, Washington would reduce the amount of information passed on
to Bonn in the future.
</P>
<P>
The judge was quoted as saying that he believed the
intelligence Gietler handed over to Iraq even influenced the
course of the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Gietler converted to Islam in Cairo in 1982 and began spying
for Iraq in the beginning of 1990. He came under suspicion in June
1990, but German domestic security officials did not intervene
hoping for catching any accomplices.
</P>
<P>
Gietler is now a businessman in Ghana after spending three
years in prison. He said his espionage career traced to as early
as 1987 and that he had offered Cairo thousands of documents on
Israel and the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Moderates to Form Political Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate group "Servants
of Construction" has decided to form a political party, the local
English daily Iran News reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily, Faezeh Hashemi, daughter of
Iran's former moderate President Hashemi Rafsanjani, said that the
group, also known as Group Six (G-6), will soon enter political
arena "with a bright future."
</P>
<P>
The group is codifying its articles of association and holding
meetings every week, said Hashemi.
</P>
<P>
She said that "one of the major factors contributing to the
victory of President Mohammad Khatami was the strong support of
the G-6."
</P>
<P>
Khatami, widely known as a moderate, won a landslide victory in
the presidential elections on May 23 due to support of moderates,
women and intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi, a member of the Iranian Parliament, said that many
members of President Khatami's cabinet are from the G-6.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Resume Pistachio Exports to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran will resume pistachio
export to European countries from December 15 after a suspension
of two months, local daily Tehran Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Vice chairman of Iran's Chamber of Commerce, Asadollah
Askarowladi, was quoted as saying that the European Common Market
Commission has decided to allow Iran to export pistachio to its
members.
</P>
<P>
Conditions laid down by the commission for granting export
licenses to Iranian pistachio included testing of pistachio upon
entry to Europe in addition to quality assessment by the standard
and hygiene centers in Iran, Askarowladi said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union countries announced to ban the import of
Iranian pistachio on September 9, fearing contamination by
Aflatoxin B1, a carcinogenic substance produced by molds.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran defended the quality of its pistachio, saying
that the export to Europe was not only uncontaminated but also was
the healthiest type.
</P>
<P>
Askarowladi said the European boycott had no impact on the
export of Iranian pistachio. Iran's pistachio produced this year
totaled 70,000 tons and its export volume has not decreased.
</P>
<P>
Pistachio cultivation in Iran is about 300,000 hectares and
the country expected to earn some 400 million dollars from
pistachio exports.
</P>
<P>
Askarowladi also said that Iranian raisins and dates, 100,000
tons of each being exported annually, also would be tested by the
European common market.
</P>
<P>
"Numerous experiments conducted up to now have shown Iran's
products to be safe and free from contamination," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Concerned Over Iraqi-U.S. Stand-off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today expressed its
grave concern over the possible military conflict between Iraq
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly news briefing here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry Deputy Spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that Turkey has
been in touch with all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
"As a country in this region, Turkey has been monitoring
the development very closely because it is having adverse
effects on us," Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
"So it is our sincere wish to see this problem reach a
peaceful conclusion," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Iraq and the U.S. intensified after the
Iraqi government expelled six Americans on U.N. arms inspections
teams on charges of espionage and blocking the lifting of
sanctions against Iraq imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened that it might take military actions
against Iraq if Baghdad continues to defy the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question what is Ankara's position on the
latest crisis, Atacanli stressed that " Turkey is not a party
to the conflict."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also said that the Turkish government expects
Baghdad to abide by all U.N. resolutions in order to avoid a
military confrontation with the Americans.
</P>
<P>
On the possible use of southern Turkey's Incirlik air base
by the United States to attack Iraqi targets, Atacanli
reiterated that Turkish Parliament has a final say if Washington
makes such a request.
</P>
<P>
Local TV and newspaper reports said that one U.S. tanker
plane and several fighters had been deployed in the air base
for a possible attack against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli, however, said that all the military movements in
Incirlik air base were taking place within the framework of
"Operation Northern Watch", which is designed to monitor northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Recalling that Turkey suffered a tremendous economic loss of
30 billion U.S. dollars due to the U.N. sanctions on Iraq,
the spokesman said that some ways and means must be sought
to compensate Turkey's loss.

<HEADLINE> WHO Calls for Extensive Coordination of Malaria Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) has called on the international community to step up
coordination of action against malaria, which kills an estimated
1.5 to 2.7 million people each year, according to a WHO press
release here today.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a two-day meeting here last week, experts agreed
that global coordination is essential and vital for the more
efficient use of resources.
</P>
<P>
"The tools are available for malaria control but moving to
large scale implementation requires coordination mechanisms at
global, regional and country levels," said Dr Ralph Henderson, WHO
Assistant Director-General. "Continuing political support for
malaria control is needed to ensure continuity of action and
sustainability of achievements."
</P>
<P>
Steps will be initiated to review the current coordination
mechanisms at global level with a view to identifying options for
improvement which would be discussed by interested parties during
1998, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
300 to 500 million people suffer from malaria today, according
to WHO. It is the most prevalent disease of the poorest rural
areas and produces recurrent infections.

Jericho, Palestine, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Senior Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators held a special meeting here today, in
which both sides agreed to intensify talks on implementing the
interim agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli team was headed by Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh
and Foreign Ministry's legal adviser Yaaov Bardugo, and the
Palestinian team led by senior negotiator Saeb Erekat and Hasan
Asfour. The meeting was also attended by United States Counsul
General John Herbst and some heads of the nine negotiating teams.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Erekat said they
listened to reports on the current state of negotiations given by
heads of the negotiating teams. They discussed the outstanding
interim issues including the Gaza airport and harbor as well as
the safe passage between Gaza Strip and West Bank
</P>
<P>
"We will of course report back to our leaders, hoping
that we can proceed forward. It was agreed today that many
of the committees will work intensively until they reach an
agreement," said Erekat.
</P>
<P>
Naveh said today's meeting was convened according to the
agreement reached during the talks early the month between
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) deputy head Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen). He echoed
Erekat's statement that both sides reviewed the previous talks
and explored ways of moving forward.
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is that in the coming days, we are going
to intensify the talks of the steering committees in order to
achieve great progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that today's meeting was convened to prepare
for the scheduled meeting between Levy and Mazen Tuesday in
Jericho to formally resume the negotiations of nine interim
committees.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the PNA had different assessments of the outcome of
the Washington talks held under the auspices of U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
While Levy said both sides had agreed to eliminate the
atmosphere of crisis in order to advance future talks, the
Palestinian side insisted the Washington talks have failed due to
Israel's refusal to make concessions on key issues.

</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel and Egypt have resumed negotiations on the

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Riyadh Supports Diplomatic Than Military Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia today voiced
support for solving the current crisis between Iraq and the United
States through diplomacy rather than military option.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by Saudi Foreign Ministry at the end
U.S. State Secretary Madelleine Albright's visit to the kingdom,
said Washington is seeking a diplomatic solution and Saudi Arabia
supports this approach.
</P>
<P>
"At a time when the U.N. Security Council is closely following
this matter (the crisis), Saudi Arabia expresses its satisfaction
at the collective desire to give diplomatic efforts every chance
to resolve the present crisis peacefully," the statement read.
</P>
<P>
It said the Saudi government shares the American position that
the issue involved is not between Iraq and the U.S., but rather,
it is an issue between the Security Council and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad expelled six Americans working with the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on monitoring Iraq's disarmament last Friday,
prompting an UNSCOM decision to pull out of other 63 weapons
inspectors accordingly.
</P>
<P>
"The Saudi side praised the unanimous international position
which called for the preservation of the integrity of UNSCOM," it
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It called on Iraq to rescind its decision to expel the
Americans inspectors. "Such response, along with full compliance
with all Security Council resolutions, is the surest way to
lifting the sanctions and alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi
people," it said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, Albright held separate talks with Saudi King
Fahd and Crown Prince Abdallah Bin Abdel Aziz shortly after her
arrival from Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> US Seeks to Settle Share in MENA Bank: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Administration will make
considerable efforts to persuade the Congress to approve the
U.S. share in the initial capital of the Middle East-North Africa
(MENA) Bank, a senior U.S. official said here today.
</P>
<P>
American Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs
Stuart Isenstat made the remarks at a press conference this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Isenstat said that his country's share in the bank's capital is
estimated at 52 million U.S. dollars. The bank's capital amounts
to 1.25 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Isenstat is participating in the three-day fourth MENA conomic
conference, which opened here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that MENA Bank is intended to meet the needs
of both the Middle East and North Africa, and that the bank is
designed to achieve three definite objectives, namely, to help the
private sector, to publicize regional projects and to promote
economic dialogue between nations of the region.
</P>
<P>
Isenstat pointed out that the interim working team in charge of
organizing the bank comprises representatives of Japan, Israel,
Egypt, Canada, Italy and the Netherlands, adding that the working
team has completed most of the necessary work for organizing the
Middle East-North Africa Bank.
</P>
<P>
David Danford, coordinator of the MENA Bank - who participated
in the press conference held by Isenstat - said he looked forward
to Saudi Arabia's contribution to the bank's capital, admitting
that Riyadh had relevant reservations in view of the stumbling of
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The decision to establish the bank was made at the third MENA
conference in Cairo last year.

<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The State Education
Commission, Communist Youth League of China and Western Returned
Scholars Association (WRSA) jointly hosted today's forum on the
40th Anniversary of a major speech by Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
Mao, a first generation leader of New China, presented the
speech some 40 years ago to a group of students returning from
Moscow, capital of the former Soviet Union. Mao encouraged the
students to study hard and render service to repay their country's
kindness.
</P>
<P>
Promoting the advancement of society requires training and
grooming of millions of talented people and encouraging returned
students to serve the country, according to Li Lanqing, a standing
committee member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee and vice-premier of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Li reaffirmed the Chinese government's policy of encouraging
students to study abroad and allowing them to return and go abroad
again on their own will.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Hails Hungarian Referendum Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana today welcomed the positive result of Hungary's referendum
on joining the Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
"The support for NATO membership expressed by a high percentage
of those who voted demonstrates the broad support among the
Hungarian people for membership in the alliance," the NATO chief
said.
</P>
<P>
The final result of referendum, held on Sunday with a turnout
of more than half of the eight million electorate, showed that
some 85 percent of the votes were in favor of NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
Solana is expecting a confirmation letter from the Hungarian
government to formally expressing its desire to join NATO and its
willingness to meet the membership requirements.
</P>
<P>
Receipt of this letter will mark the formal end of the
accession negotiations and the start of the run-up to the signing
of the accession protocols.
</P>
<P>
The signing will take place during the December 16 ministerial
meeting of the North Atlantic Council, the executive body of the
16-nation military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Of the three countries invited to join NATO, Hungary was the
only one that chose to hold a referendum. The other two invitees
are Poland and the Czech Republic.

<HEADLINE> Digital Modems Let Phone Lines Do Double Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. phone companies are
turning out digital modems that create high-speed connection to
the Internet and let people go on line and talk on the phone at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the USA Today, GTE, a major
telecommunications company, will announce today that it is
offering digital subscriber line (DSL) service to large
residential and office buildings in Los Angeles, San Francisco and
Chicago. DSL compresses data over regular copper phone wires.
</P>
<P>
Other companies, including the US West, the SBC Communications,
Bell Atlantic, Ameritech and BellSouth are also testing on the new
product, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Phone companies are trying to keep prices affordable. US West's
service begins at 40 U.S. dollars a month, plus installation and
equipment fees of several hundred dollars. That would be much
cheaper than ISDN service.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that it would still take years to spread the
technology across the nation, which has 175 million phone lines.
</P>
<P>
Digital modems will pose a challenge to cable TV companies,
which offer high-speed cable modems.
</P>
<P>
DSL and cable modems offer more than just speed. They
eliminate the need for separate phone and computer lines and let
people stay on line 24 hours a day for a flat fee.

<P>
HARARE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The decision to admit the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) into the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) was to contribute to the political
stability in the country, a SADC official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende said in a statement that the
decision was taken in view of the fact that DRC was a neighbor of
three SADC member states -- Angola, Tanzania and Zambia -- as
well as the fact that it is a potential major economic partner.
</P>
<P>
"Concern was expressed during the meeting regarding the
apparent double standards being applied to the DRC by certain
quarters on the probe into atrocities committed in that country
before the government of President L. Kabila took office," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Of particular concern was that this issue was being made a
pre-condition to assisting the country in the democratization and
reconstruction process," Mbuende said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the international community to adopt a more
positive and progressive attitude toward the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende also deplored the attempted coup in Zambia last month
and commended the Zambian security forces for thwarting it
successfully.

<HEADLINE> Workshop on Farming Policies Opens in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A workshop was held here
today with the theme of "adopting food and agricultural policies
to the changing international environment".
</P>
<P>
Opening the three-day workshop, Ethiopian Vice-Minister of
Economic Development and Cooperation Mulatu Teshome said the
Uruguay round of multi-lateral trade negotiations was
successfully concluded in 1994 and their implementation herald a
new era in international trade and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguay round aims to achieve greater liberalization of
trade in agriculture by restricting the use of trade-distorting
policies such as direct and indirect subsidies to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguay round can be considered to be consistent with the
objectives and priorities of structural adjustment programs of
developing countries that mainly focus on the promotion and
diversification of exports as well as the improvement of foreign
exchange earnings, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister hoped the workshop to come up with viable
mechanism that will help developing countries to take advantage
of the liberalized international trading environment.
</P>
<P>
Gana Diagne, representative of the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) in Ethiopia, told the workshop that the study
on adopting food and agriculture policies to the changing
international environment involves the assessment of the
requirements of the new international trade regime.
</P>
<P>
It also involves the review of the compatibility of domestic
production and trade policies of Ethiopia with these requirements
and the impact of the new international trade relations on the
export earnings of developing countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, jointly organized by the FAO and the Ethiopian
Ministry of Economic Development and Cooperation, is attended by
representatives from Ethiopian ministries, institutions and the
private sector as well as international organizations.

<HEADLINE> 60 Killed, 24 Injured in Terror Attack in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Altogether 60 people were
confirmed dead and 24 injured in Egypt's largest single terrorist
shooting rampage in the Upper Egyptian city of Luxor this morning,
the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry issued its first words nearly nine hours after six
unidentified gunmen opened fire randomly at groups of tourists in
front of a desert tourist site and fought a two-hour gun battle
with the police near the Valley of Queens in Luxor, about 560
kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-seven Swiss, German and Japanese tourists, two Egyptian
security guards and a tourist guide were among the dead.
</P>
<P>
The injured include 12 Swiss, two Germans, one French and one
Japanese as well as eight Egyptians, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The 11 critically-ill have been flown by helicopters to Cairo
for treatment while those with lesser injuries remain in the Luxor
Hospital. Four lightly injured foreign tourists have been released
after treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Luxor security authority is working with the Tourism
Ministry to identify the ill-fated tourists. Another official
statement by the Interior Ministry in this regard is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that all six gunmen that launched the
shooting spree at around 8:45 a.m. local time were killed in the
shoot-out with the police.
</P>
<P>
But MENA quoted "a top level security source" in Luxor as
saying that there may be a seventh terrorist still at large.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the terrorists fired indiscriminately at the
groups of foreign tourists converging in front of a desert tomb on
the west bank of the Nile before one of them was killed in the
ensuing cross-fire with the security police.
</P>
<P>
The rest fled and were killed in the subsequent exchange of
fire with the police in front of the Hatshepsut Temple in the
Valley of Queens which houses hundreds of Pharaonic tombs.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no claim of responsibility for the attack. But
speculations have it that the Islamic militants scheming to
install pure and stricter Islamic rule in Egypt with violence.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,300 have been killed since 1992 when the Islamic
extremists launched a violent campaign to topple the secular
government led by President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
As the government's crackdown confined the violence to such
southern hideouts as Assuit and Minya further in the south, Luxor
has mainly been free from such attacks until today. Undeterred
foreign tourists kept flocking into Luxor, a top Egyptian tourist
attraction that boasts mammoth Pharaonic temples and royal tombs.
</P>
<P>
This was the second fetal attack in two months targeting
foreign tourists. Nine Germans and their Egyptian driver were
killed on September 18 in a gunshoot and petrol-bomb attack on a
tour bus in front of the Egyptian Antiquities Museum in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The two brother carrying out the attack have been sentenced to
death on October 30.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is a vulnerable target of terror attacks. However, it
attracted about 4 million tourists and about 3 billion
U.S. dollars to Egypt last year.

<HEADLINE> Windsor Castle Restoration Completed Ahead of Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Restoration work on the
fire-damaged Windsor Castle was completed today after five years
of hard work by 1,500 workers and experts.
</P>
<P>
900-year-old Windsor Castle, the Queen's weekend residence in
southwestern suburb of London, was destroyed by fire on November
20, 1992. More than 100 rooms, covering an area of 7,000 square
meters, were damaged in the blaze, which is thought to have been
started by a spotlight shining on a curtain.
</P>
<P>
At a party she gave for the workers involved in the restoration
project, the Queen Elizabeth said today the completed restoration,
which cost 36.5 million pounds (62 million U.S. dollars), was a
"wonderful anniversary present" to her 50-year marriage scheduled
for later this week.
</P>
<P>
The work was originally expected to be completed by Spring 1998
and the job, with painstaking efforts of the workers, had been
finished six months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Initial estimates put the castle's damage at about 40 million
pounds (68 million dollars), which sparked a public debate about
who should pay for the repairs, as the castle is owned by the
government. Later the Queen agreed to meet 70 percent of the cost
of the restoration work and the government pay the rest.

<HEADLINE> U.S Goods, Service Quality Show Overall Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- An annual survey indicated
that the U.S. customers are showing growing dissatisfaction with
goods and services they get in the country over the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
The new data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index
(ACSI) help explain why consumers don't feel better off even
though the nation's economy is strong, according to University of
Michigan Business School economist Claes Fornell.
</P>
<P>
Although the latest data show the Index to be stabilizing, the
ACSI is at its second-lowest level since measuring customer
satisfaction on a national scale begun three years ago. The Index
now stands at 71.1 on a 100-point scale, down nearly 5 percent
since November 1994 when customer satisfaction was at 74.5.
</P>
<P>
The products with most significant decline in satisfaction
rating include athletic clothing and running shoes, soft drinks
and food processing. The customers are most dissatisfied with the
service in transportation and communication utilities, with the
rating down by 5.2 percent
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing and nondurables rating is based on interviews
with 13,375 customers of 43 companies in 10 major industries.
</P>
<P>
The University of Michigan Business School is the home of the
National Quality Research Center (NQRC) where the Index is
compiled..

<HEADLINE> China Places Priority on Automobile Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
in charge of China's automotive industry says that China places
high priority on the introduction and development of automotive
safety.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government is extending great efforts to
reduce traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoyu, director of the Automotive Department under the
Ministry of Machinery(MOM), made the remarks at today's Automotive
Safety Technology Seminar jointly sponsored by Sweden-based Volvo
and the China Machinery Consultants International.
</P>
<P>
The safety issue has prevailed since the introduction of
China's automotive industry some 110 years ago, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Domestic automobile manufacturers have lagged behind in
introducing safety technology, said Zhang, adding that China
nonetheless introduced 25 compulsory rules governing operations of
the industry.
</P>
<P>
China has also established three test centers to ensure the
safety of domestically-produced vehicles, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The director called for expanded international cooperation in
the sector in order to help China's automotive industry adopt
international practices at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for 1992 show that China had 22.8 million motor
vehicles, with the highway death toll standing at 58,700
people. The number of related injuries stood at 114,000 people,
with economic losses for the year ending at 640 million
yuan. Respective figures for 1996 jumped to 28.8 million, 73,700,
174,000, and 1.72 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the seminar joined in in-depth discussions on
the development of automobile safety. Bjorn Lundell, a senior
design Engineer for Volvo, briefed participants on the Swedish
company's experience in the field.
</P>
<P>
Lars-Ake Skager, deputy mayor of Gothenburg, Germany, the Volvo
headquarters, briefed participants on cooperation between the city
government and the company.
</P>
<P>
Volvo, one of the world's major automobile manufacturers,
entered the Chinese market in 1976, with the company's Beijing
Office established in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Leif Engstrom, the company's chief representative in Beijing,
noted that over 6,000 Volvos are currently in operation in
China. He noted that Volvo has opened 18 maintenance centers and
sales outlets across the country.
</P>
<P>
Engstrom pointed to the fact that China's automotive industry
is still relatively underdeveloped, and noted that the country
offers great opportunities for international motor vehicle
manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> EU Strives to Stamp out Maritime Transport Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
launched a campaign aimed at stamping out maritime transport
accidents and upgrading quality shipping in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Maritime accidents claim an average 1,000 lives and 230 vessels
a year worldwide, according to a senior official on the
commission, the executive agency of the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
"On average, 230 vessels with a gross registered tonnage of 1.1
million are lost worldwide every year, claiming more than 1,000
lives and often causing irreparable environmental damage," said
Commissioner in Transport Neil Kinnock.
</P>
<P>
Though the large majority of maritime operators in Europe and
elsewhere in the world fulfil and often exceed the best standards
of safety and seaworthiness, said the commissioner, there are
still too many owners and users of shipping who put the pursuit of
short-term profit far above any considerations of safety and
civilized conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The result," Kinnock said, "are seen in unfair competition, in
preventable danger, in appalling living and working conditions on
board ships and too often in tragedy."
</P>
<P>
The European Commission pledged to continue to work closely
with such international organizations as the International
Maritime Organization to ensure the proper implementation of
international rules for both the merchant shipping fleet and for
passenger vessels of all flags when trading in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The commission has proposed that from July 1 next year any
vessel entering EU ports should be certified under the
International Safety Management code and that ships without such
certification will be detained until they have a valid
certification.
</P>
<P>
"We are not seeking to multiply regulations for their own sake.
The priority will be given to binding quality standards for flag
administrations and registers rather than composing further new
demands that would widen the cost gap for honest and responsible
operators," the commissioner added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A large vaccine campaign
started on Sunday in the northeast and northwestern regions of
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF),
World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) are involved in the vaccination in an
effort to immunize 400,000 Somali children under five from polio,
one of the six killer diseases.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Bosasso said 350 local doctors and nurses are
carrying out the work in the regions of Bosasso, Nugal and Mudug
on four-wheel drive vehicles, camel caravans and donkey carts to
the remote areas where transportation has been affected by the
rains.
</P>
<P>
In the capital of the breakaway Republic of Somaliland, the
vaccine campaign was inaugurated in the presidential palace of
Mohamed Hagi Ibrahim Egal.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 people are reported to be working for the
campaign in Somaliland. According to the WHO officials in
Hargeisa, the capital city, about six million African children
were vaccinated last year, while this year they plan to immunize
eight million children from polio.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will continue for four days in the main towns as
well as the remote villages provided the security situation
permits.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is part of a worldwide polio vaccination
operation meant to eradicate the disease from the earth surface
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. agencies, the immunization campaign will
be confined to the northeast and northwest regions because the
southern regions of the country are inaccessible due to serious
floods which has lasted about a month now.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, Switzerland Agree to Boost Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and Switzerland
signed an agreement here today for boosting and protecting mutual
investments, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was aimed at easing the flow of capital between
the two countries and guaranteeing the right of investors to go
to court in case of any legal conflict, Nabil Al-Abduljalil, a
supervisor at the taxes department at the Kuwaiti Finance
Ministry, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement also guarantees that investments in the
host country or investing country would not be confiscated or
frozen in any case.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates that expropriation or nationalization
of any investments should immediately be fairly compensated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement said the agreement which was
generated from two rounds of talks was of great importance to
the two sides to protect mutual investments.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is also seen as paving the way for an increase
in Swiss investments in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The amount of mutual investments between the two countries is
not officially available.
</P>
<P>
But Swiss products exported to Kuwait are estimated at 150
million U.S. dollars this year, according to an official who
attended the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's exports to Switzerland are at a low level of 2
million dollars, he added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses US of Blocking Approving Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Health Minister Omid
Medhat today accused the United States of blocking the approval of
an Iraqi contract under its "oil-for-food" deal with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraq News Agency, the minister said the
U.S. delegate on the U.N. Sanctions Committee disapproved Sunday a
contract concluded by Iraq with an Indian company for the purchase
of medical requisites.
</P>
<P>
The frail excuses made by the U.S. delegate, as well as his
unscientific assertions that the contractual articles could be
used for dual purposes were but false allegations which reflected
the U.S. unfairness in dealing with the Iraqi people, Medhat said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the U.S. delegate that had suspended an Iraqi
contract with a German company on the pretext that additional
information was need.
</P>
<P>
Such moves taken by the U.S. delegate on the U.N. Sanctions
Committee are intended to obstruct and delay the approval of
contracts for the purchase of essential needs of the Iraqi people,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Provincial Security Chief Killed by Traffickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Security commander of Iran's
southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, Brigadier General
Javad Hajj Khodakaram, has been killed by drug traffickers, local
evening newspaper "Kayhan" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Khodakaram was shot dead in an ambush
plotted by drug traffickers at 18:00 local time Saturday evening
when he was inspecting the country's borders with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The group of smugglers fled from the site under the cover of
twilight after the killing, the daily added, without mentioning
whether there were other casualties.
</P>
<P>
Due to its adjacency to the drug-producing center of the
"Golden Crescent" bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran, Sistan
and Baluchestan province is a frontier of Iran's combat against
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The country's northeast province of Khorasan is the other
important transit for drug smugglers from the "Golden Crescent".
</P>
<P>
A newspaper report on Saturday said that over 4,000 kilograms
of opium were seized in Khorasan province in two separate armed
encounters with the smugglers during three days.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989, which empowered
the authorities to issue the death penalty to any drug trafficker
caught with more than 30 grams of heroin or 5,000 grams of opium.
</P>
<P>
The country intensified its campaign by allowing the imposition
of hard labor punishment on drug traffickers and addicts.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking is a major social problem in the country that
one of the main transit routes for drugs destined for Europe
coming from the "Golden Crescent."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Criticizes Conditional U.S. Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today criticized the
U.S. Congress for adding certain conditions to an economic
assistance program for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly press conference here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry Deputy Spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that such a action
is "an interference in Turkey's domestic affairs."
</P>
<P>
The House demanded recently that half of the 40 million
U.S. dollar economic assistance to Ankara should be distributed
to some democratic groups, according to Atacanli.
</P>
<P>
Such a decision was made as the House discussed the assistance
program presented by the U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
"This move is in contradiction with the spirit of the
agreements signed by the two countries, " Atacanli said,
describing it as "totally unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also said that the Turkish government is
disappointed in the U.S. Congress's decision to reduce the
economic assistance from 50 million dollars to 40 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
This reduction was caused by the pressure of some
anti-Turkish lobbies on the Capital Hill, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli said that the Turkish ambassador in Washington had
informed the U.S administration Turkey's dissatisfaction with the
change of the assistance program.

<P>
PARIS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The French chemical and
pharmaceutical corporation Rhone-Poulenc is selling its new
insecticide Regent to the United States corn market, after the
chemical product was recently approved by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
The approval of Regent marks the first introduction in the U.S.
of the insecticidal active ingredient for agricultural use, and
will allow Rhone Poulenc to increase its sale of insecticidal
products to 250 million U.S. dollars in 1998, said Rhone-Poulenc
Agro, a branch of the corporation in a news release today.
</P>
<P>
Regent, which will be available to U.S. corn growers from 1998,
will be the only corn soil insecticide that controls two key
insects simultaneously at planting application, said the company.
</P>
<P>
The insecticide protects against corn root worm and European corn
borer which consistently rank as two most economically damaging
corn pests in the United States, said the company.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Government Supports Bi-Communal Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government is in
favor of meetings between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
businessmen in a bid for short and long-term cooperation, a
government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Government Spokesman
Manolis Christofides said "in the past we neglected the
importance of economic cooperation between the two
communities. That was a mistake."
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on the results of a seminar held in Brussels
last week, which was attended by businessmen from the two
communities from Cyprus, Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, entitled "In Economic Cooperation Lies Mutual
Benefit", was organized by the Columbia University, New York, and
the Peace Research Institute in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
Similar meetings were also held in Istanbul, Turkey and Athens,
Greece in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
"There are problems and difficulties but they can be overcome
through sincere cooperation," Christofides said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed, however, that activities should in no
way contain elements that might lead to direct or indirect
recognition of the breakaway entity unilaterally established in
the Turkish-occupied northern part of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the government would support the implementation
of measures agreed upon by the business people in Brussels,
Christofides said the Cypriot government would wait for full
details before expressing its position.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops took over the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed Greek Cypriot
coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "the Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was only recognized by
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> US Calls Arabs Boycotting MENA Gathering Losers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Displeaed with the Arab boycott
of the on-going Doha regional economic conference, a senior
U.S. official today called the rejectionists "losers" in the
cooperation process this gathering is meant to promote.
</P>
<P>
"Those who chose to come are the winners," said Stuart
Eizenstat, U.S. under-secretary for economic, business and
agricultural affairs, while commenting on the boycott adopted by a
dozen Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Those Arab countries, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia,
preferred to stay away from the three-day Arab-Israeli Middle East
and North Africa conference which opened here Sunday. They cited
the lack of progress on the peace track as reasons for their
absence.
</P>
<P>
This turned out to be a major embarassment for the U.S., which,
as a patron of Israel, has vehemently supported the holding of the
conference and tried its best to persuade those Arabs into
participating, even at a lower level.
</P>
<P>
The conference did scale down from an originally anticipated
summit to the one now represented only by ministers. However, the
Arabs argued their philosophy that no Arab-Israeli economic
cooperation should take place without progress in peace.
</P>
<P>
"Those who didn't come are sending a signal that the Middle
East is potentially going to slide back into the same motion of
putting politics first," Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
He nonetheless expressed satisfaction over the turnout at the
conference - an estimated 2,000 attendants from more than 60
countries, including 850 business representatives.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the region wants politics to come second after
the need for economic development, he paraphrased.
</P>
<P>
Expounding U.S. wisdom on the relationship between economic
cooperation and peace process, Eizenstat said that during a tough
period of the peace process, the economic dimension could "help
indicate what can happen in a positive way," and "the peace
process will accelerate."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we (U.S.) are not naive and know that the
political situation of the peace process is an important
ingredient," he said, adding economic cooperation and economic
dimension reinforce each other.
</P>
<P>
"Under the very difficult circumstances of the peace process,
this (the conference) is an enormous success," he concluded.

Wall Street was also making good progress and the Dow stood 104

<HEADLINE> UK Public Become Less Hostile to EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) - British voters are less hostile
to the economic and monetary union (EMU) since Chancellor Gordon
Brown committed the UK to the principle of joining, according to a
new poll.
</P>
<P>
Brown told Commons on 26 October that "If a single currency
would be good for British jobs, business and future prosperity, it
is right, in principle, to join."
</P>
<P>
However, if a referendum was called today, the public would
still vote against participation with "No" votes outnumber "Yes"
by a margin of 22 percent, the poll said.
</P>
<P>
But this compares with 27 percent before the Chancellor's commons
statement on 26 October. It is the lowest figure for three years,
the research conducted by the US investment bank Salomaon Brothers
shows.
</P>
<P>
The Mori poll also suggested that the Government's stance could
affect the outcome of a referendum.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the Government were to urge strongly that Britain
should be part of EMU, the gap between the "Yes" and "No" votes
falls to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
"An outcome along these lines would still leave the Government
facing defeat, but the full weight of the Government's powers of
persuasion has yet to be felt," said Michael Saunders, the Bank's
economist.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) - Hundreds of thousands of new
jobs will be created around the world as a direct result of World
Travel Market 1997's four-day activities which starts here today.
</P>
<P>
Almost 5,000 exhibitors from 158 countries attend the opening
ceremony and over 40,000 international travel industry
professionals will present at the four-day activities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Geoffrey Lipman, President of
the World Travel &AMP; Tourism Council (WTTC) said: "Individual
companies, and many countries, now recognize that Travel &AMP; Tourism
is one of the most effective ways of tackling the scourage of
unemployment."
</P>
<P>
"Now we must ensure that all governments understand the
importance of Travel &AMP; Tourism and put in place policies which
encourage its development," he added.
</P>
<P>
Travel &AMP; Tourism in Europe provides some 19 million direct or
indirect jobs, or one in eight of all workers, Lipman said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that over the next decade and with the right
policies in place, the industry could create a further 300,000
jobs in the UK, 2 million in the EU, 6 million in Central and
Eastern Europe and up to 100 million world-wide.
</P>
<P>
The WTTC has pressed the case for greater government efforts to
encourage job creation in Travel &AMP; Tourism which, it argues, leads
to more jobs in manufacturing, construction, retail and other
industries.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) - IBM, the world's largest
computer company, today delivered its vision of the future of
travel at London's World Travel Market 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the future, people will be selecting, booking and paying for
their travel via the internet, viewing hotel rooms and holiday
resorts via their home computers, and conducting business trip
expenses on "Smart Cards" which act as electronic purses.
</P>
<P>
People will pass through immigration by placing their hand on
an electronic reader that instantly cross-references their hand
geometry with millions of records, according to IBM.
</P>
<P>
People will always be assured of their favorite room, meal,
and seat through stored data that means carriers will be able to
pamper them as never before, IBM said.
</P>
<P>
The journey of the future, as outlined by IBM, will reduce the
need for queuing to check in at airports and hotels, and will see
travelers booking hire cars, restaurants and theater tickets from
wherever they are.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, Claude Guay, Director Travel
Distribution Solutions, said: "The future is here already. Over 50
percent of the financial transactions conducted on the Internet in
1997 involved travel, and this is set to explode in the near
future."
</P>
<P>
"We have created ways of booking, reserving, and paying
securely for flights on the Internet already, and switched-on
business travelers are already taking advantage." he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Defends Decision Not to Attend Doha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said today that his decision of not attending the Doha
economic conference was a result of consultations with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and related American representatives.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that before making the decision he had talks with
Netanyahu and U.S. officials for their opinion.
</P>
<P>
After the consultation, he said, he conceived that the main
focus of the meeting was economic, not political and it would be
preferable that a senior economic minister should head the Israeli
delegation to Doha.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky is leading
a 100-member delegation, including government officials,
businessmen and journalists, to the Middle East and North Africa
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Labor Knesset (Parliament) member Uzi Beilin has
criticized that Levy made a terrible mistake by staying away from
the Doha conference, noting that would give Arab States reasons to
divert the conference away from the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in contrast to previous conference, the U.S. today
did not object to the release of a statement against Israel by the
meeting. Observers in Qatar attributed this to Levy's staying
away, because U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had
pressed Israel to send Levy to the conference.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the conference called on Israel to honor
signed agreements and United Nations Security Council Resolutions
242 and 338, and noted that any Middle East peace accord must
based on the land for peace principle.
</P>

<HEADLINE> London Rejects Baghdad's Proposal on Arms Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The British government rejected
today an Iraqi compromise proposal of readmitting American members
of a UN arms inspection team, saying "there is no room for
negotiation."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz has reportedly proposed
to readmit the American arms inspectors if the United Nations
agreed to change the composition of the inspection groups.
</P>
<P>
Aziz noted that equal representation on the arms inspection
teams to all five permanent Security Council members would help to
resolve the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office spokesman was quoted by the Reuters as
saying: "Iraq cannot dictate the composition of the teams. The
U.N. cannot accept discrimination."
</P>
<P>
"There is no room for negotiation on this," the spokesman said,
adding: "We hope Aziz's comments indicate an Iraqi willingness to
move in the direction of the U.N.'s position."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that "Iraq must first make clear a willingness
to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Sets Preconditions for Turkish Cypriots' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government set
preconditions of Turkish Cypriots' participation in negotiations
on Cyprus' accession to the European Union (EU), due to begin
early next year.
</P>
<P>
At his daily press briefing here today, Government Spokesman
Manolis Christofides said that the preconditions for Turkish
Cypriot participation is that participants support accession and
the Turkish occupation regime receives no recognition.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on press reports citing British special envoy
for Cyprus Sir David Hannay as saying that the question is whether
a way can be found for the representation of Turkish Cypriot
so-called governmental organizations in the accession talks.
</P>
<P>
"If the Cyprus problem is resolved, then the two federal states
will be officially represented," the Spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
"For as long as the Cyprus problem remains unresolved and
since the U.N. (resolution 541) asks that no other state but the
Republic of Cyprus is recognized as the legal government, we
can not but insist on our preconditions," Christofides added.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has proposed the participation of
Turkish Cypriot organizations, such as political parties and trade
unions, in the official delegation of the Republic of Cyprus for
EU talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU full membership in 1990. The EU has
confirmed its decision in March 1995 that the accession talks
with Cyprus will begin early next year.
</P>
<P>
But the EU's decision was rejected by Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash, who refused to further negotiations for a Cyprus
settlement unless the EU freezes plans for accession talks with
the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops took over the northern
third of the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in
Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Calls for End to Angolan Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Jose Lamego, Portugal's
secretary of state for foreign affairs and cooperation, today
called on all parties involved to put an immediate end to the
peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement to Angolan newsmen in Lisbon after a
meeting with Paulo Cassoma, governor of Huambo province in Angola
who is on a visit to Portugal, the Angolan News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It's been nearly three years since the Lusaka Peace Accord was
signed on November 20, 1994, but peace is still out of sight, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace pact calls for a government of national
reconciliation and a single national army in Angola, ending
nearly two decades of civil war in the country since the two
warring sides inked the accord in late 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, articles of the accord have not been stuck to by the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and
for this sanctions were imposed on the former rebel movement
UNITA on October 30 by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
As an observer to the peace process, Lamego noted, Portugal
urged that national authority be re-established in all parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Portugal wishes to strengthen and consolidate its ties with
Angola, Lamego said, adding his country will work together with
the United States and Russia to promote the development in the
peace process and bring peace to the worn-torn country.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Criticizes UN Policy Over Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Fares Boueiz today criticized the United Nations for exerting
different standards on Iraq and Israel over the implementation of
relevant resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"The treatment to Iraq is too severe," Boueiz said in an
interview with Iranian Islamic TV today.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. is taking a severe position over Iraq issue
while disregarding the implementation of those resolutions related
to Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is being punished due to the reported possession of
weapons of mass destruction, but it is only a presumption," he
said, "Israel is outside the punishment although it refuses to
observe the U.N. resolutions and to sign to the treaty on nuclear
weapons control."
</P>
<P>
Iraq is faced with a military attack by the U.S. after it
expelled American personnel working with the U.N. arms inspection
teams on charges of carrying out spying activities.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, U.N. Security Council met and issued a resolution
strongly condemning Iraq's expulsion of the U.S. weapon inspectors
and demanding it rescind its decision immediately.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz criticized the U.N. for not imposing any sanctions on
countries defying its resolutions except Iraq, saying that it
appears there are different levels and standards based on
different countries and interests.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.N. to take the same standard to treat every
single country equally.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer "security zone" in south
Lebanon to prevent cross-border Lebanese guerrilla attacks. Israel
refuses to observe the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425
demanding Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Medicine Against Malaria Flown to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Belgium, Spain and the Swiss
organization "Doctors without Borders" today sent 33 tons of
lactato de Ringer by plane to help malaria patients refrain from
dehydration.
</P>
<P>
The medicine arrived here this morning along with doctors,
medical equipment and tents to assist the country's health
authorities to curb the spread of malaria.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic has spread to Maputo city, Maputo province and
the adjacent Gaza province.
</P>
<P>
According to medical sources, the disease has claimed 56 lives
in Maputo city and province in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Maputo Central Hospital, the largest one in Mozambique, has
admitted about 3,000 malaria patients, and so far 350 of them are
still hospitalized. Due to the shortage of lactato de Ringer, the
hospital has ceased to have surgical operations on malaria
patients.
</P>
<P>
Luis Felipe, coordinator for "Doctors without Borders", said,
the aid was in response to the calls made by Mozambican Ministry
of Health last Friday.
</P>
<P>
At present, Felipe said, the daily consumption of the drug is
2,500 liters, which means the 33-ton donation could only last one
month, and by that time the medicine purchased from India might
arrive.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that doctors from France, Belgium, Spain, the
Netherlands and Switzerland will work with their Mozambican
counterparts for 15 days to six months.

<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Qatari Foreign Minister
Sheikh Hamad al Thani has stated that his country opposes a
military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference here this evening, on the sideline
of the Fourth Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference,
the Qatari Minister called for a resolution of the crisis through
diplomatic and peaceful means between Iraq and the U.S. or between
Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Baghdad expelled six Americans working with the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on monitoring Iraq's disarmament last Friday,
prompting an UNSCOM decision to pull out of other 63 weapons
inspectors accordingly. Following the crisis, the U.S. and Britain
have threatened to take military actions against Iraq after the
U.N. passed a resolution last Wednesday condemning the Iraqi move.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad asserted that Iraq must abide by all the related
U.N. resolutions in order to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
He denied any U.S. pressures on Qatar regarding the convocation
of the Doha economic conference, and strongly criticized the
Egyptian media campaign against Qatar on the conference issue.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari Minister also denounced the intransigent attitude of
the Israeli government regarding the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said such intransigence was the principal cause of the peace
process stalemate, pointing out that dialogue was necessary and
useful. It is a must as well as possible to reach a solution through
dialogue such as the Doha economic conference which ought to be
utilized to reactivate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the representation of Arab states in the Doha
economic conference, he said each Arab state had its own views on
attending or failing to attend, and Qatar entertained no stand
against any Arab state.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question as to whether Qatar will attend the GCC
summit in Kuwait in December, he said Qatar would be proud to
attend that summit conference.
</P>
<P>
On the relationship between Qatar and Iran, he said Iran is a
neighboring state, and Qatar maintains normal relations with it,
despite some differences. He added that Qatar differs with the
U.S. with regard to its attitude towards Iran.

<HEADLINE> South Africa to Import More Oil from Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 17 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today said in Saudi Arabia that his country would
increase oil import from the world's top oil producer and exporter
by 15,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the announcement before wrapping up his two-day
visit to the kingdom. He told a press conference that a Memorandum
of Understanding to this effect has been signed.
</P>
<P>
According to reports by Kuwait News Agency from Saudi capital
Riyadh, Mandela said the Saudi Aramco Company, its only
state-owned oil producing and exporting conglomerate, would follow
up the details of this project, along with the construction of an
oil refinery in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is currently one of the major oil suppliers to
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The memo was a result of Mandela's first official visit to the
Gulf Kingdom since assuming power in 1994 ending the apartheid
regime in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by a high-ranking delegation that included the
ministers of defense, metals and energy, and public utilities,
Mandela arrived in Riyadh Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He held talks with Saudi King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdallah
Bin Abdel Aziz on means of boosting bilateral relations and the
stalled Middle East peace process, and on the current stand-off
between Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the ministers met their Saudi counterparts for
talks on boosting cooperation in the fields of defense, minerals,
oil and trade.
</P>
<P>
On the current Iraq-U.N. crisis, Mandela called for a peaceful
settlement through diplomatic means, adding that his country
"supports all efforts aimed at peacefully solving the crisis away
from the use of force."
</P>
<P>
He also called on Iraq to "fully implement all U.N. resolutions
so that the plight of the Iraqi people ends."
</P>
<P>
Mandela's visit to Saudi Arabia came two months after a visit
to South Africa by Saudi second Deputy Premier and Minister of
Defense Prince Sultan Bin Abdel Aziz in September.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and South Africa established diplomatic relations
in 1994 after Mandela took office. Since then, official
exchanges between the two countries have been on the increase.
</P>
<P>
In addition, trade exchange between the two countries jumped
from 42.7 million U.S. dollars in 1994 to 433.6 million in
1996.

<HEADLINE> British Army Exercises Protested in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot environmentalists
gathered from Sunday in the Akamas peninsula, at the western tip
of the island, to protest against British Forces' military
exercises in the area.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued today by the British Forces said
90 Episkopi-based soldiers would have low level training in
Akamas region between November 17 and 21, using hand-held
infantry-type weapons and, at times, live ammunitions.
</P>
<P>
"Such weapons present almost no hazard to the environment,"
the press release said, adding that stringent regulations will be
enforced to preserve and protect the landscape.
</P>
<P>
Akamas is one of the few regions in the Mediterranean where the
green and loggerhead turtles hatch their eggs. Local
environmentalists have called for the establishment of a national
park in Akamas peninsula.
</P>
<P>
A group of environmentalists, gathered since Sunday, tried
twice to stop the 20 military vehicles carrying British soldiers
to Akamas.
</P>
<P>
They were prevented by the Cypriot police but finally managed
to hand the officer in charge a petition calling for an immediate
end to these exercises.
</P>
<P>
Britain has retained two sovereign bases in Cyprus since
1960, when it granted the island its independence from colonial
rule.
</P>
<P>
British Forces in Cyprus could conduct annual military
exercises for about 70 days in accordance with the 1960 Treaty
of Establishment of the Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
"Discussion continues between the Republic of Cyprus'
government and British authorities regarding the possibility of
an alternate training area to replace the Akamas," the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Cyprus' House of Representatives approved
unanimously a resolution, calling for an end to British forces
exercises in Akamas.
</P>
<P>
It called on the government of the Republic to stop giving its
approval to exercises in this region and to "take all necessary
measures".
</P>
<P>
The resolution described Britain's right to use the area for
military purposes as a colonial legacy.
</P>
<P>
It authorized House President Spyros Kyprianou to make a
recourse on the issue to the European Parliament, the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association and the House of Commons of Britain.

UNITED NATIONS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said here today he was encouraged by Iraqi government's
latest moves.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief was responding to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz's remark in Paris that Iraq would readmit American arms
inspectors if the United Nations agreed to change the makeup of
the inspection teams with equal representation given to each
Permanent Member of the Security Council of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters Annan said all sorts of efforts were
being made to try to find a diplomatic solution to the present
crisis and Aziz's remark was part of that effort.
</P>
<P>
Annan said this was at least a movement from Iraqi original
position where it was adamant that there should be no Americans.
</P>
<P>
Annan said it was encouraging and everybody was trying to
avoid a conflict and resolve the crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The latest crisis over the arms inspection began on October
29 when Iraq vowed to expel Americans weapons inspectors working
for the United Nations and to shoot down American U-2 planes.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors are part of the teams monitoring Iraqi
compliance with the United Nations resolutions demanding that
it destroy all its weapons of mass destruction.

DAMASCUS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The visiting first deputy
Premier and Foreign Minister of Kuwait Sheikh Ahmed Al Sabah and
his Syrian counterpart Farouq Sharaa today expressed hope for
averting any military confrontation between Iraq and the US.
</P>
<P>
In a departure statement in Damascus, upon the conclusion of
his two-day visit to Syria, Sheikh Sabah said "we hope that no
military confrontation will take place in the region, and should
such confrontation occur it will not be our doing."
</P>
<P>
He called upon Iraq to implement the UN Security Council
resolutions, particularly the latest ones.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Sharaa, who was seeing off Sheikh Sabah, said on
the same issue that "we hope that no escalation takes place
because confrontation is not in the interest of any party, nor is
it in the interest of security and stability in the region. But,
at the same time we have always been for commitment to the related
U.N. Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Sharaa denied any current Syrian-Egyptian efforts to deal with
the crisis or the tense situation between the Security Council and
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa revealed a prospective visit to Syria by Iraqi deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz within his current tour. He said, "Aziz
may visit Damascus in the course of his present tour, and it is him
who has requested that.
</P>
<P>
Should the visit take place, discussions will take into account
the interests of Kuwait, the Iraqi people and the Gulf region as
well as the Arab situation as a whole, he said, adding that Syria
is of the view that any crisis affecting any part of the Arab
homeland ought to be treated in a manner that serves the supreme
Arab interest.

<HEADLINE> 65 Militants Stand Trial in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Supreme Military
Court today opened trial of leaders of Gamaa Islamia (Islamic
Group), as Islamic militants carried out a deadly attack on
foreign tourists in south of the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 65 defendants were indicted for joining the illegal
group that was established with the aim of overthrowing the
government.
</P>
<P>
They also were accused of monitoring the movement of public
personalities with the aim of killing them, and planned to attack
public places for the purpose of stealing.
</P>
<P>
They stocked firearms and other weapons, forged documents and
possessed unlicensed ammunition, the presiding judge read the
indictment before adjourning the hearings to December 3 to give a
chance to counsels to prepare their defense.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Group has been leading a violent campaign to
overthrow the Egyptian secular government. Nearly 1,300 have been
killed since 1992, most of them policemen and militants.
</P>
<P>
The group is widely suspected of being responsible for Egypt's
largest single terrorist attack which hit the archeological resort
of Luxor, about 500 kilometers south of Cairo, this morning.
</P>
<P>
At least 60 people were confirmed dead and 24 injured after six
unidentified gunmen opened fire randomly at groups of tourists in
front of a desert tourist site and fought a two-hour gun battle
with the police near the Valley of Queens.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-seven Swiss, German and Japanese tourists, two Egyptian
security guards and a tourist guide were among the dead.
</P>
<P>
The wounded were 12 Swiss, two Germans, one French and one
Japanese as well as eight Egyptian nationals.
</P>
<P>
The attack which targeted the highly vulnerable and profitable
tourist industry is apparently a retaliation for the government
crackdown on militants that involved massive arrests, military
trials and executions.
</P>
<P>
Less than two months ago, nine German tourists and their
Egyptian drive were killed in a shoot-out and firebomb attack on a
bus in front of the Egyptian Antiquities Museum in Cairo. The two
assailants have been sentenced to death on October 30.
</P>
<P>
Tourism brought about some 3 billion U.S. dollars in revenue to
Egypt last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Iraq's Latest Compromise Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Monday rejected an offer for compromise from Iraq to end the
confrontation between Washington and Baghdad by giving the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council the equal
authority in the U.N. weapons inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
"It's not up to iraq to determine the composition of U.N.
inspection teams," White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
"It's up to the U.N. to determine that, so whatever feelings
Iraq has are immaterial."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said in an interview
with Le Figaro in Paris on Sunday that Iraq would re-admit
American weapons inspectors back if the United Nations agreed to
change the makeup of the inspection teams with equal
representation given to each permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The permanent members of the U.N. Security Council include
Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We asked the Security Council to create a committee of experts
whose impartiality is not in question," Aziz told the French
newspaper Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
"it would be necessary that in this new team of inspectors,
the five permanent members would all have the same weight," he
added.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Iraq presented the proposal at the United
Nations about a week ago but there was "not much enthusiasm for
it."
</P>
<P>
"We're continuing to stress in our diplomatic contacts the
importance of a clear message to Baghdad that they should back
down and allow the inspections to occur," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promotes Welfare Hiring Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday visited the Cessna Aircraft Co. in Wichita, Kansas, to
promote companies' special efforts to find jobs for welfare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and several Cabinet members headed to the dedication of
a new job training facility at Cessna, which already had won
national recognition for helping to move welfare recipients into
the workplace, United Press International reported.
</P>
<P>
The event is part of Clinton's efforts with the Welfare to Work
Partnership, a nationwide non-partisan group of private businesses
pledged to promote efforts to train and employ workers from among
welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to announce that 2,500 companies have
joined the partnership in its first six months, far exceeding his
goal of 1,000.
</P>
<P>
The president will also announce new financial penalties,
reaching 5 percent of federal welfare funds, for states that do
not meet federally mandated goals for employing welfare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
Under a 7-year-old program at Cessna, the worldwide leader in
the production of single-engine aircraft, small groups of
unemployed or low- skilled workers are taught blueprint reading,
shop math and basic sheet metal assembly skills.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, Cessna has hired 262 people for its sheet metal
assembly training program.
</P>
<P>
The new Cessna facility will allow the 70-year-old company to
double its welfare-to-work program and provide on-site child care
for trainees.

<HEADLINE> Anti-War Groups to Protest U.S. Military Action on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Some anti-war groups based
in Washington D.C. will stage a protest against the latest round
of U.S. military threatening to Iraq, the National People's
Campaign (NPC), one of the anti-war groups said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The protest, which will take the form of a picket line and a
rally in front of the White House on Tuesday, is part of an
international campaign of protests this week, including 9 U.S.
cities, the NPC said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC also called for an end to the sanctions imposed upon
Iraq since 1991.
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions have killed an estimated 1.4 million Iraqis,
including over half a million children," the NPC quoted the
International Action Center as saying, which had a delegation
just returned from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
A poll, released on Sunday by Newsweek, found Americans are
divided over whether the United States should take military
action against Iraq as a way to force Baghdad to back down on
expulsion of American inspectors.
</P>
<P>
About half, or 49 percent, of those polled say Iraq's
decision to ban Americans from United Nations inspection teams
warrants military action. But nearly as many, or 41 percent,
oppose military action.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Opposes Military Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Kuwaiti Foreign
Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahamd Al-Jaber said here today that
Kuwait opposes any military attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark upon arrival at the Beirut International
Airport tonight on a three-day visit to Lebanon after a trip to
Egypt and Syria.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with his Lebanese counterpart Farez Boueiz,
Al-Jaber said he is not sure if military attacks will be launched
on Iraq, adding it depends on the stance of Iraq and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only solution to the crisis is Iraq's
implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Last week Iraq expelled six Americans working with the U.N.
Special Commission monitoring Baghdad's weapons destruction, on
charges of espionage. It now faces U.S. threat of military action
in the standoff.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Al-Jaber explained to Boueiz the reason Kuwait
attends the ongoing Doha economic conference, saying the
participation is not meant to being against Lebanon and Syria,
both of which boycotted the gathering because it also includes
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait sent only a low level official to the conference, he
said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Al-Jaber will meet Lebanon's leadership and
for discussions on the regional situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korean currency and stock
markets continued its tumble Tuesday, with the won hitting its
daily allowable low of 1,012.80 to one dollar in early trade.
</P>
<P>
The won's plunge came only moments after the market started its
morning session, dealers said. The average rate stood at 990.60
won, compared with Monday's close at 1,008.60 won.
</P>
<P>
The central bank did not intervene during the day. It withdrew
from the market Monday after supporting the local currency for
several days.
</P>
<P>
Excessive speculation, growing jitters over domestic financial
markets and high demand for import payments have combined to weigh
on the won, said a dealer at a foreign bank branch here.
</P>
<P>
A market participant predicted that the central bank would step
in again when the won hits 1,050 level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, share prices dropped 0.47 percent and then rose
steadly on hopes of a possible loan from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The composite index plunged more than 20 points from the
previous day's closing to 476.30 during the morning session,
nudged by the continuing depreciation of the won.
</P>
<P>
During the afternoon trading, speculation of an imminent
government appeal to the IMF for aid brought the market to 500.49
points at one time.
</P>
<P>
However, the hopes settled down toward the end of the day. The
market closed at 494.66 points, down 2.32 points from the previous
day's closing.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Speaker Attacks US for Crisis with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri today attacked the United States
for unleashing the current crisis with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Yemeni Minister of Housing and
Urban Planning Abdullah Hussein al-Dafei, Nouri said that the
present stand-off between the U.S. and Iraq was aimed at making
the Persian Gulf look insecure.
</P>
<P>
This is part of a bid to overshadow the forthcoming summit of
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) to be held here in
December, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nouri called for all Islamic states to have an active presence
in the Tehran summit in order to foil Washington's probable plots.
</P>
<P>
Following the failure of Doha economic conference, he said,
the U.S. has concentrated all its efforts to prevent all Muslim
states from getting closer to one another and finally undermine
the coming OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. of trying to dominate all oil wells in the
region through its divisive policies.
</P>
<P>
Nouri also voiced Iran's readiness to expand cooperation with
Yemen in various fields, including in parliamentary affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni minister said that the OIC summit should be
considered as a turning point in making coordination among Islamic
states, adding that Yemen would actively take part in it and hope
other Islamic states to do the same.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dafei called for expansion of bilateral cooperation in the
areas of economy and commerce and invited Nouri to pay an
official visit to Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Al-Dafei, Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said "We are in need of security and tranquility in the
region, based on which we can make up for our past stagnation and
achieve progress, development and greatness in the region."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Iran-Yemen relation was on an upward swing, he
said that the political resolve of the officials of the two
countries would help further expand the bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Genscher Calls for EU-China Political Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Predicting that China will become
"an important pillar in the world politics of the 21st century",
former German foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has called
on Europe to form a political partnership with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Genscher, who just ended a visit to Beijing on November 11-12,
made the appeal in an article titled "Europe and China", which is
due to be published by the Berlin Tagesspiegel newspaper on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent frequent high-level contacts between
China, the United States, Russia and Japan, Genscher said: "The
multi-polar world, which has replaced the bi-polar one of the Cold
War, is taking a more and more clear shape."
</P>
<P>
While Washington, Moscow and Tokyo are taking the common
approach to see China not only as an economic but also a political
partner, people cannot yet talk about a China-policy of the
European Union (EU), Genscher added.
</P>
<P>
"Europe must realize that China will become an important pillar
in the world politics of the 21st century. And this calls for a
political partnership between the EU with China," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the course of the 21st century will depend on
whether a world order based on equality and cooperation will be
established. "Such a world order is unimaginable without the full
participation of China."
</P>
<P>
"The inclusion of China in all developments is indispensable
for global stability. Its quickest possible admission into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) and its future participation in the
world economic summit of the Group 8 are therefore of great
importance," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also stressed that the decision on forming a
Europe-China strategic partnership ought to be made by Europe
itself, not by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"It is now up to Europe to resolutely exploit the opportunities
opened up by the end of the Cold War. Only then can Europe take
its seat in the multi-polar world order of the 21st century,"
Genscher concluded.

<HEADLINE> Indian Rupee Dips to New Low Despite Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee today
dipped to a new 21-month low at 37.40/42 rupees per U.S. dollar in
a panic-driven market, not heeding to a strong statement by the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that it would prevent "overshooting"
of the currency.
</P>
<P>
After opening lower at 36.91/94 at the Foreign Exchange Market
in Bombay, the rupee slid to 37.55 per dollar at noon despite RBI
floating 150 million dollars in the market gripped by frenzied
corporate buying and covering by importers, Press Trust of India
said.
</P>
<P>
However, RBI Governor C. Rangarajan's statement that "there is
no ground for a further weakening of the rupee" propped up the
currency to 37.35/39. The RBI's reference rate for the day stood
at 37.52 rupees per dollar.
</P>
<P>
Dealers felt that the market will test the 37.50 benchmark at
which the RBI had come out with the statement and said this is
seen as a cap defined by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing the strong economic fundamentals in the
country, Rangarajan said in his statement, "We believe that the
adjustment that has already taken place in the value of the rupee
is adequate."
</P>
<P>
The rupee depreciated by nearly 15 paise (0.15 rupee) Monday
and by over a rupee since November 1.

<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of
the Central Military Commission, met with Moussa Djermakoye, chief
of general staff of the Armed Forces of Niger, here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also state councillor and minister of national defense,
said he was glad to see Sino-Niger bilateral ties had a sound
development since the two nations restored diplomatic relations
last year.
</P>
<P>
He told the visitor the Chinese Government greatly appreciated
the independent foreign policy of peace and nonalignment pursued
by the Niger government under the leadership of President Ibrahim
Mainassara Barre, as well as the government's "one China" stand.
</P>
<P>
"China has much in common with Niger. There are only common
interests, but no conflicts of interests, between the two
countries," Chi said, adding that "Chief Djermakoye would feel
Chinese people's profound friendly sentiments toward the Niger
people during his visit."

strengthen their cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Presidential Candidates Spurt for Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- With 30 days away from the
presidential election, South Korea's three key presidential
candidates and their parties are sparing no efforts to raise their
popularity ratings.
</P>
<P>
While Kim Dae-jung from the main opposition National Congress
for New Politics (NCNP) intends to keep his lead, Lee Hoi-chang of
the largest New Korea Party (NKP) and Rhee In-je of the New Party
by the People (NPP) are vying desperately for the second place.
</P>
<P>
Latest polls showed that Kim Dae-jung still tops candidates in
popularity although his support rating has fallen to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The fiercest rivalry is expected to be between Rhee and
Lee. The latter's popularity rating has for the first time
overtaken Rhee's according to the latest opinion polls by seven
major dailies.
</P>
<P>
While these two candidates hope to clinch the second place for
a final contest with Kim Dae-jung, Kim himself hopes that a
neck-and-neck competition between Rhee and Lee will enhance his
chance of success.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung is focusing on such large voting blocs as Seoul,
Taegu and North Kyongsang Province (TK region) where the latest
polls showed his popularity is declining.
</P>
<P>
Kim's NCNP and its ally the United Liberal Democrats (ULD) will
start their campaigns throughout the country this week to boost
Kim's popularity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee Hoi-chang's NKP, desperately trying to turn the
three-way race into a showdown between Lee and Kim, are prepared
to launch various political activities to boost Lee's chance of
winning the election.
</P>
<P>
Rhee In-je, on the other hand, is seeking to generate a
"whirlwind of support" through his campaign tours. His NPP is
planning to bring Park Chan-jong and some other political
heavyweights from the NKP into its fold.
</P>
<P>
While trying to gain the broadest possible support, the parties
have resumed trading accusations to contain each other's support
rates.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP and the NPP are renewing attacks on the NKP's Lee with
the past controversy surrounding his two sons. The NKP countered
by saying that the 73-year-old Kim is too old to be a president
and Rhee broke his promise to split the NKP after he was defeated
by Lee in the party's nomination race.

<HEADLINE> Premier Calls for Help to Developing Countries in Cleaning Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
called on big Western international firms to help solve developing
countries' environmental problems by offering them financial
support.
</P>
<P>
Li made the call during a meeting with foreign delegates who
are attending a four-day China Environmental Forum which opened at
the Great Hall of the People here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 international environmentalists including former
Australian Prime Minister P.J. Keating and former Dutch Prime
Minister R.F.N. Lubbers as well as representatives from some big
western industrial and financial firms are attending the forum.
</P>
<P>
"I hope those powerful international businesses will provide
financial support to developing countries to help them dealing
with environmental problems while showing concerns for their own
problems at home," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China welcomes international environmentalists to
strengthen their environmental cooperation with their Chinese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"Environmental protection is not only the work of the
government, but also demands the participation of all sectors of
the society including enterprises and non-governmental
organizations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the environmental protection as the basic
national policy of the country, he said, "the Chinese government
pays great attention to this work and has made big achievements."
</P>
<P>
"But on the other hand, we must keep a clear mind on the
environmental problems that do exist in China," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"As a developing country, China will do whatever it can to
protect its environment while developing its economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the country's energy policy, the Chinese premier
said that China lays equal stress on both developing and saving
energy.
</P>
<P>
"China will gradually increase the consumption of clean energy
while reducing the use of coal," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China will also make more efforts to solve its problems of
soil erosion and pollution caused by small enterprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin and Director of the State
Administration of Environment Xie Zhenhua were present at the
meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The property development arm
of the Chinese Ministry of Construction will join hands with a
Hong Kong listed company to develop real estate projects in
China's inland areas, Hong Kong and even overseas.
</P>
<P>
The China National Real Estate Development Group (CRED), a
major property developer in China's interior, signed here today
strategic alliance with CIL Holdings Ltd. of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The alliance will bring positive results to both, said Meng
Xiaosu, president of CRED.
</P>
<P>
CRED has thorough knowledge of the property development market
in China's inland areas -- both national policies and local market
needs -- while CIL possesses international caliber project
management skills and the capability to secure financing and to
promote business in overseas markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
The alliance is the first partnership CRED has signed with a
HK-based company, Meng added.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the eight-point strategic alliance, CRED and
CIL will form joint ventures in major Chinese cities, initially in
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, to pursue property and
infrastructure development projects.
</P>
<P>
CIL will be one of the primary interior contractors for CRED on
CRED projects in Hong Kong and China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The two companies will also provide each other with staff
training, support and consulting. In particular, CIL will share
modern project management expertise and technology with CRED.
</P>
<P>
The long-term objective of the alliance is to seek
opportunities in the international market, said CRED Vice
President Li Qinyi.

<HEADLINE> HK Future Teachers Receive Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China, today awarded certificates to 2,782 graduates from the Hong
Kong Institute of Education (HKIEd).
</P>
<P>
This was the third graduation ceremony of the institute, which
was established in 1994 to produce qualified teachers for Hong
Kong's kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, technical
schools and schools for the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony held at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium,
Professor Ruth Hayhoe, director of the institute, extended her
congratulations to the graduates and wished them the very best in
their new professional careers.
</P>
<P>
She elaborated on two main themes: the new expectations of
teachers and the new opportunities open to the teaching profession
as a result of the Chief Executive's Policy Address on October 8.
</P>
<P>
Education has been given a place of honor in the policy
framework which Tung has put forward for Hong Kong's future
development, Hayhoe said.
</P>
<P>
September 10 has been named Teachers Day, following a precedent
in China's mainland and it will be a day when everyone shows their
respect for the work of teachers, and their recognition of the
special way that teachers' professional knowledge contributes to
the health and prosperity of society, she added.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation that all new teachers entering the profession
are expected to be university graduates and professionally
trained, the challenge for HKIEd's certificate of education
graduates will be to continue their studies and reach the level of
a Bachelor of Education, Hayhoe said.
</P>
<P>
They have to continue improving their language skills in
speaking and writing English and Chinese, she said.
</P>
<P>
Also they will be expected to make extensive use of information
technology in the classrooms for the benefit of their students,
Hayhoe added.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, the first after Hong Kong's return to China,
Hayhoe asked students of Hong Kong to explore and learn from their
rich cultural heritage, to share with colleagues and friends in
the mainland their many positive experiences and in the process
open their minds to new areas of understanding.
</P>
<P>
"You have an exciting challenge ahead of you -- to develop each
of the pupils in your classes to their fullest potential, in a
context where they will be expected to be responsible citizens of
Hong Kong and of the Mainland, also to be citizens of the world,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was attended by 3,500 students and academic staff,
parents, guests from the Government and the education sector as
well as community leaders from all walks of life.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Group Responsible for Luxor Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's most powerful extremist
group today claimed responsibility for the deadly attack on
foreign tourists that claimed 68 lives in southern Egypt on Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
In a statement faxed to international news agencies, Gamaa
Islamia, or the Islamic Group, said the gunmen killed the tourists
while trying to take them hostage.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier statement, the Islamic faction threatened that
the Luxor killing, which was aimed at warning the tourists who
come to Egypt, would not be the last and more violent attacks will
be coming.
</P>
<P>
Six gunmen opened fire randomly at foreign tourists and
Egyptians in front of the Hatsheput Temple in Luxor, about 500
kilometers south of Cairo. At least 24 were wounded. This was the
worst terrorist shooting attack ever happened in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Group has been leading a terror wave since 1992
against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's secular government to
install a strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
One of the six gunmen has been identified as a group member
who had committed other terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting the scene of the crime this morning, Mubarak
condemned the killers as "murderers" and "criminals" who have no
religion whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
"They do not belong to any faith whether Islam, Christianity or
Judaism," he said, while trying to reassure potential visitors
that Egypt is still safe.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of heavily-armed police guarded the site today as around
50 courageous foreign tourists ventured into 4,500-year-old
Hatsheput Temple.
</P>
<P>
Seven of those injured in the Luxor attack, including five
Swiss, a Japanese and an Egyptian, are in serious condition after
receiving treatment at Maadi Hospital, Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The police have identified up to 51 ill-fated foreigners - 31
Swiss, eight Japanese, four British, five German, a Bulgarian, a
French and a Colombian.
</P>
<P>
The killed Egyptians include two policemen, a security guard
and a worker of the antiquities authority. The six terrorists were
gunned down by the police on the site.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,300 people, mostly police, Christian Coptics and
foreign tourists, have been killed in the Islamic extremists'
five-year violent campaign against the government.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Government, Central Bank Differ over Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Finance and
Economy (MOFE) and the central Bank of Korea (BOK) are at odds
over the introduction of emergency loans from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to stabilize the protracted currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is facing a serious shortage of foreign exchanges,
with the local currency won racing to renew its record lows
against the dollar day after day.
</P>
<P>
Most MOFE officials assert that the nation's economy can
overcome the current turmoil without the IMF bailout. They
stressed that the IMF rescue package, which has a string of
conditions, could drive the national economy to bankruptcy and
infringe upon economic sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
As one of the policy options, the government is reportedly
pushing the BOK to borrow more than 10 billion U.S. dollars from
foreign banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the
Bank of International Settlement (BIS).
</P>
<P>
"Through various measures, the ministry aims to raise the
nation's foreign currency reserves from the current level of less
than 30 billion dollars to 38 billion," a MOFE official noted.
</P>
<P>
However, South Korean banks, suffering from their declining
credit rates, found it impossible to borrow from abroad and
difficult to lend foreign currencies to businesses.
</P>
<P>
BOK officials recommended the government to apply for emergency
IMF loans as the most effective way to ease the foreign exchange
crunch.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, central bank governor Lee Kyung-shik
today held a meeting with the presidents from eight commercial and
state-run banks, including Korea First Bank and Korea Development
Bank, to discuss ways of easing the currency woes.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly decided to request the government to take IMF
bailout loans as a sole way to tide over the financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of economists here also said that the IMF
emergency loans ranging from 30 to 50 billion dollars will be the
ultimate solution.

<HEADLINE> EU Takes U.S. to WTO Over Export Subsidy Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
announced that it is taking a United States subsidy scheme to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) for formal consultations.
</P>
<P>
The commission is requesting an end to the so-called scheme of
"Foreign Sales Corporations (FSCs)", which is only available if a
large part of the exported item has been manufactured in the U.S.,
the commission's vice-president Sir Leon Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government grants tax exemptions for exports conducted
through FSCs, that are usually subsidiaries of U.S. corporations
located in such tax havens as the Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, therefore, views it a clear violation
of the WTO subsidy rules.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras will spearhead the
U.S. team to challeng Sweden in the Davis Cup final next week.
</P>
<P>
Jonas Bjorkman will lead a Swedish team that also includes
Magnus Larsson, Thomas Enqvist and Nicklas Kulti for the
Nov. 28-30 final in Goteborg, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
U.S. captain Tom Gullikson is expected to select Sampras and
Michael Chang for the singles, with Bjorkman and Enqvist playing
singles for Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's top doubles pairing is Bjorkman and Kulti. Todd Martin
is expected to play doubles for the Americans with either Sampras
or Alex O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
Sampras beat Bjorkman in straight sets last week in the
semifinals of the ATP World Championship in Hanover, Germany, to
extend his career record against the Swede to 7-1. But Bjorkman,
ranked No. 4 in the world, beat Chang earlier in Hanover.
</P>
<P>
Sampras went on to defeat Yevgeny Kafelknikov in the Hanover
final to cap another exceptional season and finish as No. 1 for
the fifth year in a row.
</P>
<P>
Sampras led the United States to the Davis Cup title in 1995,
accounting for all three points _ two in singles and one in
doubles _ in the 3-2 victory over Russia in the final in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The United States leads Sweden 7-2 in Davis Cup play. The
countries have met only once before in the final, with Sweden
winning 4-1 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The United States, appearing in its 59th Davis Cup final, has
won the title 31 times. Sweden, in its 11th final, has won five

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government Unveils Economic Stimulation Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government today
announced a package of pump-priming measures to revive the economy
through deregulation and structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
The package, which contains 120 measures, is intended to
stimulate the financial, real estate, media, transportation and
welfare sectors and lend support to small and medium-sized
companies.
</P>
<P>
To uplift the capital markets, the government will submit bills
to the next Diet (parliament) session to pave way for the trading
in equity derivatives and market deregulation.
</P>
<P>
Banks and insurance firms will be allowed to deal in mutual
funds and brokerage houses to diversify their operations.
</P>
<P>
On tax reform, the government will review the systems of
corporate tax, land tax and monetary- and securities-related taxes
during the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
To foster the media industry, the package will lift the
restrictions on the number of multi-channel programs that are
available via satellite. A bill will also be introduced to
encourage competition in telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
By focusing on deregulation and structural reforms, the
government hopes to pump new life into private and corporate
activities and to wipe out lingering uncertainties about the
economy, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
"A recovery of confidence will have a positive impact on the
economy," said an official from the Economic Planning Agency (EPA).
</P>
<P>
However, economists reacted negatively to the government move,
arguing that the package will neither have a resuscitating impact
on the sluggish economy nor promote structural economic reform.
</P>
<P>
This is the government's first set of pump-priming measures
since April 1995, when concerns about deflation peaked with the
U.S. dollar briefly falling below 80 yen.

SINGAPORE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Central
Narcotics Bureau has busted a drug syndicate operating from the
areas of Toa Payoh and Balestier, both in the central part of the
Singapore island, local television reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that a total of 35 people, all Singaporeans, were
arrested during the 18-hour raid today.
</P>
<P>
Under what was called Operation Autumn, the Central Narcotics
Bureau (CNB) officers seized a total of 1.2 kilograms of heroin
and cash amounting to more than 2,000 Singapore dollars (about
1,258 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The television report said that the CNB acted on a tip-off
received earlier this month and has since mounted surveillance in
the two areas.
</P>
<P>
CNB!!Deputy Director Tan Seck Kang noted that the busted
syndicate showed a new trend in drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
It was distributing small sachets of drug to as many syndicate
members as possible so as to ensure that, if arrested, they would
not be found in possession of a large quantity.
</P>
<P>
Seven of them will be charged in court Wednesday for possession
of a controlled drug for the purposes of trafficking. In
Singapore, anyone who is caught to be in possession of more than
15 grams of heroin illegally would be sentenced to death.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- About 22 people were killed
this morning in clashes between Iraq's two rival Kurdish groups
in northern Iraq, Turkish Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a radio report from the Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) as saying that the KDP shot dead 12 members of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) in the conflicts in the
areas of Hiran, Ciyayiderebi, Verdi, Dolahanikin and Belek
early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the PUK had suffered great losses
in the clashes in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agency also quoted another radio report from
the PUK as saying that 10 KDP members were also killed in
fightings in the areas this morning.
</P>
<P>
A KDP spokesman in Ankara said: "KDP forces have managed to
secure, or recapture, some of the positions taken earlier by
joint forces of PUK and PKK (Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party) separatist gang."
</P>
<P>
He said that his group had retaken a number of strategic
positions and mountaintops around the town of Sedakan, some 20
kilometers from Iraq's border with Iran.
</P>
<P>
A PUK spokesman here said that their forces had been
withdrawing from Sedakan over the last week and Turkish fighters
launched bombing raids Monday.
</P>
<P>
The KDP said that it had started the latest offensive Sunday
against its rival PUK.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian PUK and the KDP, allegedly backed by Turkey
and Iraq, have ruled northern Iraq since the Baghdad government
lost control over the area at the end of the Gulf War in
1991. The two rival forces have been fighting each other for the
control of northern Iraq since then.

and Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cuba, at the Great
Hall of the People here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Li and Raul Castro exchanged views on bilateral relations and
other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Castro, Li voiced his belief that the
visit will produce a great impact on the further growth of
Sino-Cuban friendly and cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
Li congratulated Cuba on the success of the fifth national
congress of the Cuban Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Li said Cuba has been carrying out socialist constructions
under "difficult and special circumstances" and Cuba's economy has
gradually been improved. He added that Cuba has won support from
more and more countries.
</P>
<P>
The premier said he believes that the Cuban people will
overcome every difficulty and score new achievements.
</P>
<P>
Both Li and Castro expressed satisfaction with the development
of Sino-Cuban relations and vowed joint efforts to further enhance
such relations.
</P>
<P>
Li added that the frequent contacts between leaders of the two
countries have greatly promoted the development of bilateral
relations.

world, and the country's modernization drive. He also briefed the
guest on the 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party

<P>
Chinese State Councillor Li Tieying and the senior officials
accompanying Castro on the visit were present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, Li presided over a welcoming ceremony in

</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton Administration is offering to allow Iraq to buy
more goods with its oil, finding itself forced to retreat from its
refusal to negotiate with Saddam Hussein. The offer -- cobbled
together as a position paper by British and American diplomats --
was passed to France and Russia, who were to discuss it with the
Iraqis, officials said.
</P>
<P>
-- The Democratic Peopole's Republic of Korea appears ready to
start serious negotiations on a formal end to the Korean War,
replacing an armistice put in place 44 years ago with a peace
treaty, a senior U.S. State Department official said. Four-party
talks among diplomats from DPRK, South Korea, the United States
and China would begin sometime next month in Geneva after a
preliminary meeting in New York on Friday, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- With a promise of help from Russia, the United States turned
toward diplomacy Monday for a resolution of the tense standoff
between Iraq and the United States.
</P>

the union's general treasury to finance his successful campaign
last year against rival James P. Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>

of the federal government's grip on states' ability to run their
own programs. The rules, which are intended by the Department of
Health and Human Service to fill in the details on last year's big
overhaul of welfare programs, allow states to continue providing
benefits to more two-parent families.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Debt Reaches 117.3 Bln Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's foreign debt until
September this year reached 117.3 billion U.S. dollars and the
country's total debt service ratio by the end of fiscal year
1997-98 is expected to reach 34.5 percent, a senior official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The foreign debt consisted of 52.3 billion dollars in
government loans and 65 billion dollars in private loans, Finance
Minister Mar'ie Muhammad told House Commission VIII on the state
budget and finance.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has been monitoring the acquisition of
loans through reports on debts worth at least one million U.S.
dollars, including basic data, variables as well as the securing
of the loans.
</P>
<P>
"We have to control our foreign loans to reduce the burden that
has been weighing on our balance of payment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has yet to decide whether Indonesia will
give prepayments for its high-interest foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
"The repayment of out foreign debt will depend on the rupiah's
recovery against the U.S. dollar," he said, adding that if the
rupiah continues to depreciate until next year, the country's
ability to repay the principal and interest of its foreign loans
will surely be affected.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah has dropped by more than 40 percent
against the U.S. dollar this year, especially following the
monetary crisis in the Southeast Asian region since early July.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that Indonesia's capital inflow in the
second semester of 1997-98 reached 3.4 billion dollars from
foreign loans under the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI)
while bilateral loans from CGI member countries reached 54
percent.

<HEADLINE> China Beats Japan 3-1 at World Grand Champions Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HIROSHIMA, Japan, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Asian Champion China
proved its depth by downing Japan 3-0 in the world volleyball
continental grand champions cup here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first victory for the Chinese women spikers through
three rounds after lossing to Russia 3-0 and Cuba 3-2 earlier.
</P>
<P>
China took the first set with an easy win of 15-4, but the
hosts tied it at 1-1 with a spectacular defensive effort from
1.59-meter tall setter Takeshita Yoshie from the bench.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Takeshia, a genius in back-row defence, also
showed her talent in setting up the attackings for Japan. But she
soon found it was difficult to repeat it in the third set when her
taller counterpart Zhu Yunzhi, also 19, but stood at 1.76-meter,
paced China to clinch the set in 15-13.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Yunying, who replaced China's starting setter He Qi in the
middle of the second set, kept her place in the remaining times
and helped China seal the win 15-8 in the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
In the other two matches played earlier on Tuesday, Olympic and
world champions Cuba remained unbeaten by overwhelming South Korea
3-0, while Russia also boosted their winning streak by downing
Brazil 3-2.
</P>
<P>
The taller and powerful Cubans spikers, although made many
serving errors in the first set, used their over-net smashings and
blockings to sink their not-in-form South Korean opponents 15-8,
15-10, 15-2.
</P>
<P>
European champion Russia overcame a slow start and outspiked the
South American champion Brazil 7-15, 15-7, 9-15, 15-7, 15-10 for
their third win in as many games so far in the six-team tournaments.
</P>
<P>
"Today's match was much tougher than I had expected," said Russian
head coach Nicola Karpol. "I hope our players will get accustomed to
the circumstances in Japan and concentrate more on the following
games."
</P>
<P>
The Russia-Brazil game lasted for one hour and 47 minutes, the
longest since last Friday, the opening day of the 12-day
tournament. The tourney has applied a 25-minute time limitation
for the first four sets and a rally-point scoring system in the
fifth set.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Group in Egypt Threatens More Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- As Egyptian leaders condemned
the rampage killers of foreign tourists in a southern resort as
"murderers" and "criminals", an extremist Islamic faction today
threatened that more violent attacks will be coming.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Middle East News Agency, the Gamaa
Islamia, or the Islamic Group, said that the Luxor killing, which
was aimed at warning the tourists who come to Egypt, would not
be the last.
</P>
<P>
Six unidentified gunmen killed more than 60 foreign tourists
and Egyptians Monday in random shootings in Luxor, about 500
kilometers south of Cairo. This was the worst terrorist shooting
attack ever happened in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The group suspected of masterminding the incident and other
violence since 1992, however, did not claim responsibility for the
attack in its statement.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting the scene of the crime this morning, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak condemned the killers as "murderers" and
"criminals" who have no religion whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
"They do not belong to any faith whether Islam, Christianity or
Judaism," he said.
</P>
<P>
Extremist Islamic militants have been staging a campaign to
topple the secular government for strict Islamic rule, which has
claimed more than 1,300 people, mostly police, Christians and
foreign tourists.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
decided to launch a research program aimed at using new
technologies to make de-mining safer and faster.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made known today, was taken at the initiative of
Commissioner Edith Cresson who is responsible for research,
innovation, education, training and youth.
</P>
<P>
The program will be given a total of 15 million ECU (17 million
U.S. dollars) in its pursuit of new technologies for seeking,
identifying and deactivating landmines.
</P>
<P>
The planned research activities will focus on the real needs of
de-mining operations.
</P>
<P>
New technologies can make a vital contribution, particularly by
improving minefield surveys, analysing data from multiple sensors
to detect and identify individual mines, using geographical
information database to collate and store all information
available on minefields and in mine removal, according to an EU
press release.
</P>
<P>
An estimated total of 125 million uncleared anti-personnel and
anti-tank mines are laid in former theaters of war around the
world, killing more than 26,000 people, mostly children, each year.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Revises Property Market Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government
announced today that it has decided to review its policies on the
property market, so as to "avoid aggravating the excess supply and
pessimistic sentiment in the property market".
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a press conference chaired by
Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who announced the
government policy adjustments in May 1996 to curb the excessive
speculative activities in the property market then.
</P>
<P>
The reviewed measures announced today include deferring the
government's land sale program and extending the project
completion period, currently set at four to five years for
residential sale sites, to eight years.
</P>
<P>
The government will also suspend the stamp duty surcharge
payable on properties sold within three years of purchase, a
measure introduced in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government said that these reviewed measures will help ease
the excess supply in the market. However, the government also made
it clear that it will not stimulate demand for properties by
relaxing credit, for example, by raising the 80 percent limit on
mortgage loans.
</P>
<P>
This would be imprudent from the point of view of both the
buyers and the financial institutions, especially at this time of
economic uncertainty, it said.
</P>
<P>
The government stressed that a healthy and stable property
market is important to the economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
By moderating the supply of new land for private housing and
allowing greater flexibility for the supply of new projects to
adjust to demand, the property market can self-correct and buffer
against volatile prices, the government said.
</P>
<P>
The government said that the package of measures introduced in
May 1996 to cool the speculative frenzy stabilized the market and
averted a property bubble. However, today the situation and market
sentiment had totally changed.
</P>
<P>
Property prices have been gradually declining since May 1996,
the government noted, adding that in the third quarter of this
year, the sales of uncompleted private residential properties fell
to 1,376 units, 22 percent lower than the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, property prices declined by 4.4 percent in the
three-month period, the sharpest fall since May 1996, the
government observed and pointed out that "the market is now in an
excess supply situation".
</P>
<P>
Announcing the new adjustments, the government stressed that
the measures are not intended to fix property prices at any
particular level.
</P>
<P>
"They are to take into account the regional economic
uncertainties and avoid aggravating the excess supply and
pessimistic sentiments in the property market", it said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Indigenous Health Depressing: Governor- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian Governor-General
William Deane today called on international health experts to
share their knowledge with the Australian medical community to
improve what he called the "extremely depressing" condition of
aboriginal health in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The governor-general told the 30th International Hospital
Federation Congress in Melbourne that Australia was one of the
healthiest nations in the world with one important exception:
indigenous health.
</P>
<P>
He said the life expectancy of an Aboriginal baby was almost 20
years less than a non-aboriginal child.
</P>
<P>
"These facts are extremely depressing. The problems of
aboriginal health are devastating in their extent," the
governor-general was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He told the health experts to share their knowledge with
Australian colleagues "to improve substantially the health of the
aboriginal people."
</P>
<P>
There are about 300,000 indigenous people in Australia.
</P>
<P>
At an earlier engagement today, the governor-general urged
Australians to address the plight of the disadvantaged, adding
that aborigines were "the most disadvantaged group in Australia."
</P>
<P>
The plight of the disadvantaged, along with reconciliation,
would be the biggest test for Australia as it entered its second
century of federation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor-general, a ceremonial political figure in
Australia, has spoken on several occasions for the country's
disadvantaged indigenous people in the past several months.

BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Information technology is
expected to contribute to China's aviation sector by improving
airports and airlines.
</P>
<P>
The use of more advanced computer and telecom technology by the
aviation industry was the subject of a seminar in Beijing, where
Zhou A'rong, deputy director of the Air Traffic Management Bureau

new information technology improved the punctuality of aircraft
and the quality of service and ensured flight safety, making
China's aviation industry more competitive.
</P>

But, "The automation of China's civil aviation still lags far
behind that of its overseas counterparts," Zhou pointed out, and a
more modern national air traffic control network with three
regional centers is being considered.
</P>
<P>
Present at the two-day seminar were CAAC officials, technical
staff, and representatives of leading computer and telecom
businesses, which also displayed their latest technology and
products.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Science and Technology Trade Fair Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Enterprises, research
institutes and universities and colleges from the interior areas
of China are displaying their latest achievements and products of
high and new technology in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day '97 China Science and Technology Trade
Fair, which opened today at the Hong Kong Exhibition Center, a
210-member delegation from the inland areas of China will display
414 technology items and products.
</P>
<P>
These technology items and products cover fields such as
machinery, electronics, micro-electronics, environmental
protection, communications, meteorological equipment and medical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
They were carefully chosen by China's Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), organizer of the fair, from 10
provinces and cities and seven ministries and commissions in the
inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the fair, Sun Guangxiang,
assistant minister of the MOFTEC, said the fair will help
strengthen the cooperation between the inland areas and Hong Kong
in the field of high and new technology.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong needs high and new technologies of the inland areas
and the inland areas need funds and market information from Hong
Kong to accelerate the process of transforming technology into
products, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Zhenquan, deputy director general of the Department of
Science and Technology of the MOFTEC, said on Monday at a press
conference held for the fair that one of the purposes of the fair,
the first of its kind after Hong Kong's return to China in July,
is to promote the export of high and new technology items and
products of the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the inland areas will continue to introduce advanced
technology and equipment from and through Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mimi Yeung, assistant executive director of the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC), co-organizer of the fair, said this
fair can be considered a milestone in the economic and trade
cooperation between Hong Kong and the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
She called on people of the commercial and industrial circles
in Hong Kong to choose right items to invest in.
</P>
<P>
She added that if Hong Kong's businessmen want to maintain
their competitiveness in the international markets, they should
not hesitate to develop high value-added products.
</P>
<P>
The TDC will promote the joint effort of Hong Kong and the
inland areas to develop high-tech products and help elevate
China's industry to the world level, Yeung said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Express Cautious Welcome to Abacha's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigerians have expressed
cautious welcome to the Head of State, General Sani Abacha's
Monday speech marking his fourth anniversary in power.
</P>
<P>
The Nigeria's Tribune today reported that the country's five
political parties have applauded the dissolution of the cabinet,
saying that it would rejuvenate confidence and interest in the
remaining elections in the transition period.
</P>
<P>
On the formation of the new cabinet, the report said the party
leaders have called for a transitional government genuinely
concerned with preparing the nation for the democratic government
expected to be put in place next October.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Lawan Gambo, National Chairman of the Grassroots
Democratic Movement, reportedly said that the new cabinet should
be made up of "every sector of the polity including the political
parties".
</P>
<P>
Solomon Onaghinon, Secretary-General of the Association of
Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria said that there is no cause
for euphoria right now, because the dissolution of the cabinet
did not explain the direction of the government.
</P>
<P>
"The action in the next couple of days would dictate the real
state of things," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abacha's announcement of the release of political detainees
received almost unanimous welcome.
</P>
<P>
Bode Olajumoke, the National Deputy Chairman of the United
Nigeria Congress Party said that he commends the initiative of the
head of state.
</P>
<P>
But again people are cautious, as the names of the detainees
to be freed are yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Sorunke, a traditional ruler in the Ogun, home
state of Boshorun Abiola, the presumed winner of the 1993
presidential election now in detention, commented with a proverb,
"Somebody whose son killed an elephant said 'I can't believe it,
until I eat it.'"

<HEADLINE> Cost of New Airport Projects Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Budget for the Airport Core
Programs (ACP) has been reduced further by more than one billion
HK dollars (128 million US dollars) thanks to tight control of
cost.
</P>
<P>
So far, the overall cost for the ten ACP projects centering on
Chek Lap Kok New Airport has declined to 155.3 billion HK dollars
(20 billion US dollars), according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
It is the third time the budget has been cut, adding that the
total amount reduced to 8.4 billion HK dollars (1.1 billion US
dollars), about 5.1 percent of the original estimate of 163.7
billion HK dollars (21.1 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Billy Lam Chung-lun, director of the New Airport Projects
Co-ordination Office (NAPCO), attributed the successful cut in
budget to cost control and effective claim settlement.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the third quarter this year, the overall ACP was
90 percent complete, said the official. Eight out of the ten
projects have been finished, including expressways, bridges, land
reclamation programs, and a harbor crossing.
</P>
<P>
Two others are scheduled to be completed next year -- the New
Airport now under construction on a small island in the west of
Hong Kong, and a railway to link the airport with Kowloon and Hong
Kong Island. The New Airport is expected to go into operation in
April, 1998.

<P>
CANBERRA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia believe they can
roll over their final World Cup football qualifying rivals Iran
and win the chance to go to France next June for the finals.
</P>
<P>
The Australian squad have assembled in Dubai from Europe, Asia
and Australia for Saturday's first leg match in Tehran with the
return match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on November
29. Already 45,000 tickets have been pre-sold for the Melbourne
game.
</P>
<P>
Australian captain defender Alex Tobin believes the Iranians
are shaky in morale and mind after losing 3-2 on a golden goal to
Japan in extra time in Malaysia last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Their defence looked leaky. The Japanese strikers were quick
but Iran didn't seem to react to them 100 percent," said Tobin.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iranian defence gave Japan's forwards too much room
in the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
"Now they've lost to Japan. They're not out of it yet, but it's
fair to say they're probably not feeling their best at the moment."
</P>
<P>
Tobin said the Australians would go out to win the first leg
match, "Their fans are not happy so there's probably more pressure
on them than us.
</P>
<P>
Australian manager Terry Venables has yet to decide whether to
take his team from Dubai to Tehran on the morning of the match on
Saturday or a day earlier.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Campaigns Against Growing Rat Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Alarmed by raging rat
activities in the Chinese capital, Beijing's public health
authorities have called on residents to take an active part in the
campaign to rid the city of the rodent.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government ordered a unified distribution of rat
poison last weekend in the city on a scale described as the
largest in the last 10 years, according to today's Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yubing, head of Beijing's Patriotic Campaign Committee
which is responsible for monitoring pest control, said the rat
population has been on the rise in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Rat density has exceeded the state-set tolerable line in rural
areas, conjunctive parts between urban and rural areas and in old
buildings torn down for reconstruction," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Rats have become a common sight in Beijing, running across the
streets even during daytime. They have damaged telephone and power
lines and spoiled grains. Some big hotels are complaining of rats
chewing tourists' clothes and even "stealing" their false teeth.
</P>
<P>
"Rampant rat activities have posed threats to people's health,
their normal work and production activities," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
One health official warned of epidemics caused by rats since
some bordering countries reportedly have been invaded by rat-bite
fever and other plagues among animals and human beings in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Experts said one reason for the growing rat population is the
drastic decrease in the last 10 years of the number of owls and
weasels, natural predators of rats.
</P>
<P>
Also, cats are now kept not to catch mice but as pets.
</P>
<P>
"There is a break in biological chains," said Wang Chengxin, a
professor with the China Academy of Preventive Medical Sciences.
</P>
<P>
So far, Beijing has distributed 300,000 leaflets among
residents calling for their immediate participation. Meanwhile,
about 250 tons of poison bait has been put in places frequented by
rats such as public green areas, sewers, restaurants and meat and
vegetable markets.

<HEADLINE> Plot Against S.Leonean Junta Foiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Security officials in Sierra
Leone said today that they have uncovered and foiled a plot to
destabilize the military government of Major Johnny Paul Koroma.
</P>
<P>
A number of people including the spokesman of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Gibril Massaquoi and a
businessman, Steve Bio, have been detained, they added.
</P>
<P>
There has not been any official statement from the military
government, but residents near the Maximum Security Prison in
the capital said Massaquoi and Bio were taken in handcuffs to the
prison on Monday evening while about five military officers were
brought in early today.
</P>
<P>
Details of the plot remain unclear but observers said
Massaquoi was one of the most trusted officials in the RUF and
one of the closest to rebel leader Foday Sankoh who is now in
detention in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to an observer, majority of the rebels now working
with the military government have clearly shifted their loyalty
to Major Koroma and have not supported the alleged plot.
</P>
<P>
Bio, a high profile businessman, is the cousin of former
military strongman, Julius Maada Bio who ruled Sierra Leone until
January 1996 Before handing over to democratically selected
president Tejan Kabbah who was ousted in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
Bio ran a lucrative helicopter service to the interior of the
country, using Ukrainian pilots. He was frequently accused of
selling arms and ammunition to both government forces and the
rebels at the height of the rebel war, a charge he had dismissed
as "false".

<HEADLINE> US Attaches High Importance to Relations with Pak: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said here today her country attaches high
importance to its relations with Pakistan for realizing the
objectives of peace and prosperity in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Both countries should enter into the 21st century as closed
partner for a better future and to fight against terrorism and
drug trafficking," said Albright at a joint news conference with
Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating her country's commitment to further enhance
relations with Pakistan, Albright said she has discussed with the
Pakistani leadership the vast prospects of U.S. investment in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and the U.S.A., she said, have a long history of
mutual friendship and cooperation and the U.S. wants to continue
and increase its cooperation with Pakistan in the country's
efforts to bring progress and prosperity to the people.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed concern over nuclear proliferation in South
Asia, saying Washington attaches "high priority" to the issue.
</P>
<P>
She said she told Pakistani leaders "the importance the United
States attached to limiting the spread of nuclear weapons
technology" and would also make it "quite clear" in India.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Kashmir issue, Albright said the U.S. desires
peaceful solution of the problem, adding the U.S. stand on the
violation of human rights anywhere of the world including Kashmir
is well-known.
</P>
<P>
About the supply of F-16 aircraft, she said the U.S. government
is trying to deal with the issue so that the amount paid by
Pakistan for the planes is refunded. So far, she said, they have
not fully succeeded but their efforts are continuing.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question on Afghanistan, the U.S. secretary of
state said that her country will continue to be helpful in
restoration of peace and promotion of a settlement in that
country.

<HEADLINE> Sunlight Causes Eye Cataracts: Australian Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- An Australian researcher
said today his new study had bolstered the theory that sunlight
causes eye cataracts.
</P>
<P>
Minas Coroneo, a researcher with University of New South Wales
(UNSW) in Australia, said his study also raised questions about
the usefulness of most sunglasses, the Australian Associated Press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Professor Coroneo, head of ophthalmology at UNSW, said he had
shown that most damage was caused by ultra-violet (UV) light
hitting the periphery of the eye.
</P>
<P>
It was immediately refocused to the opposite side, closest to
the nose, he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the very spot where cataracts develop, and also the
site for pterygia, growth which afflicts thousands of Australians,
particularly those from hot, dry environments, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
Coroneo told the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmology
conference in Sydney that he had proved the link by examining the
eyes of people with pterygia, after death.
</P>
<P>
He found tissue damage inside the eyes underneath the pterygia,
which coincided with the area where light is refocused.
</P>
<P>
For children, Coroneo recommends broad-brimmed hats only,
because sunglasses with wings may interfere with the development
of a natural protective mechanism in which the lens of the eye
becomes tinted with age.
</P>
<P>
Cataracts are common among welders, who despite protective
masks tend to receive large doses of UV rays in the periphery of
their vision from other workers, the professor said.

<HEADLINE> External Debt Drains COMESA Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The bulk of export earnings by
member states of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) is being drained through repayment of the over 80
billion U.S. Dollars external debts, according to Zambia's
vice-president Godfrey Miyanda.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency ZANA today quoted Miyanda as saying here
Monday at the first COMESA Finance Ministers Meeting that the
regional grouping should negotiate jointly for relief of the debt
to halt capital flight and redress the distortion of their
economies.
</P>
<P>
"The major problem that faces all our economies is that of the
debt," said the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the regional community had by 1994 owed
the international community at least 88 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda told the three-day meeting starting Monday that it
will not be feasible for the people in the COMESA region to enjoy
the benefits of economic liberalization being pursued as long as
the current drain on export earnings continued through servicing
of external debt.
</P>
<P>
He called for the consolidation of COMESA financial
institutions to enhance monetary and financial cooperation. This
will also help to expedite the integration process through the
merging of markets for goods, services, capital and labor, said
Miyanda.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers are meeting to revise the implementation
of the COMESA monetary harmonization program.
</P>
<P>
Top of their agenda includes the future role of the clearing
house whose original functions are said to have been overtaken by
the new economic regimes in most member countries.
</P>
<P>
The clearing house, which is now an autonomous body, was set
up in the 1980s as an important sector of the preferential trade
area for eastern and southern Africa, predecessor of the COMESA,
to mitigate the economic environment then that had been
characterized by controls, particularly of foreign exchange
outflows from most member states.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA that came into being in 1994 groups 20 members and
aims to achieve a free trade area by 2000, a customs union with a
zero tariff on products originating within the common market and
free movement of capital and people.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Official Calls for Consensus on Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Roberto de Ocampo today urged delegates to an "Asian Fund
Facility" meeting here to reach consensus on a workable framework
for regional cooperation in dealing with or preventing a financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the Finance and Central Bank
Deputies Meeting on the Asian Fund Facility, de Ocampo, chairman
of the conference, said: "The ongoing economic turbulence in
Southeast Asia poses a major challenge to all of us in the
region."
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interest not only of economies in Southeast Asia,
but of the whole world that we address the issues that have merged
from this currency crisis not only to solve it and regain investor
confidence in the region but also to prevent a crisis like this
one from recurring in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
He requested the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to provide
an in-depth analysis of the financial crisis that has prevailed in
Southeast Asia since July this year.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo said that the challenge of the meeting is to "reach
consensus on a workable framework for regional cooperation."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the framework should include at least the
following elements:
</P>
<P>
-- A mechanism for regional surveillance to complement the
global surveillance efforts of the IMF;
</P>
<P>
-- Enhancement of economic and technical cooperation to
strengthen the supervision and regulation of financial and capital
markets; and
</P>
<P>
-- Supplemental financing mechanism on a quick-response,
self-help, good neighbor philosophy to augment IMF resources.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day meeting, the participants are expected to
discuss the need for a quick-response supplemental financing
facility linked to IMF conditionalities, ways to address the moral
hazard problem, guiding principles and mechanics of the proposed
fund, and regional surveillance and economic cooperation
mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Fund was proposed by Japan at the joint IMF-World
Bank annual meeting in Hong Kong in September, but the United
States initially gave a lukewarm response.
</P>
<P>
Other industrialized nations have resisted Japan's idea of an
independent "Asian Monetary Fund," as they fear that an
independent fund would undermine the IMF conditions attached to
its economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
An IMF official said here Monday that a "broad consensus" has
been reached among countries involved on how the fund should be
structured to help countries suffering economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the opening of the meeting, Philippine Finance
Secretary de Ocampo told a press conference that preliminary
soundings "seem to focus on ASEAN (becoming core members and
contributors to the fund) because that is where the crisis started
 and that is where the contagion effect has spread."
</P>
<P>
Other countries could be joined at participatory level or
contributing level, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The initial deliberations are less in favor of a large pool of
funds" that would call for the establishment of a bureaucracy to
manage it, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Whether there may be a fund at all of a smaller size," he
said. "I leave it to the (participants) to elaborate upon."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed earlier that progress made at the Manila meeting
will serve as valuable inputs to the APEC leaders when they meet
in Vancouver, Canada, on November 24-25 and discuss the Asian
currency situation.
</P>
<P>
The framework proposed at the Manila meeting would also be
discussed at the informal ASEAN finance ministers meeting in Kuala
Lumpur on December 1, he said.
</P>
<P>
If agreed by the ministers, de Ocampo said, such framework
could be presented to the ASEAN Leaders Meeting in Kuala Lumpur on
December 15-16 for their approval.
</P>
<P>
Deputy finance ministers and deputy central bank governors from
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), Japan, the United
States, South Korea, China and other Asian-Pacific nations
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank were also present.

<HEADLINE> Undersupply of Wool May Be Coming: Australian Wool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Wool growers, presently
sitting on a 700 million US dollar stockpile, could face a new
challenge of demand exceeding supply, Australia's key wool body
predicted today.
</P>
<P>
"Signs are there that demand for wool is picking up, albeit
gradually in most markets," Adrian Kloeden, managing director of
the International Wool Secretariat, said.
</P>
<P>
"In not too many years, our problem may well be under-supply,"
he told the Wool Forum in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
"The management of the transition from our current situation to
that of coping with supply shortages will be one of our main
challenges as an industry."
</P>
<P>
Australian wool growers have spent more than a decade living
with a stockpile, which at its peak in the late 1980s was four
million bales and is now 1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
Kloeden, who is also managing director of the Australian Wool
Research and Promotion Organization, said wool exports rose by 13
percent this year, with big increases coming from China and Italy.
</P>
<P>
He said future strong demand was expected from China, Britain
and North America, but demand in European markets would pick up
only slowly.
</P>
<P>
The industry would also suffer the "knock-on effects" of the
Asian currency crisis, which might delay the industry's recovery.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
struggled again today to find a reason to push higher, wallowing
under the 70.00 US level.
</P>
<P>
The local unit settled at 69.78 US cents after range bound
trading for most of the session, down from a close yesterday of
70.15 US cents.
</P>
<P>
NatWest Markets currency strategist Stephen Halmarick said
trade was light and volumes were low as traders again eyed local
share markets for direction with little on the home front to
inspire them.
</P>
<P>
The currency began the day weaker following a choppy overnight
offshore session and drifted lower from there, with traders citing
local selling and an early weakness in the South Korean won as
factors.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 87.66 yen from 87.85 yesterday,
and at 1.2063 marks, from 1.2173 previously.

<HEADLINE> No S. African Found in Luxor Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- South African Embassy
officials in Cairo were checking hotels this morning in the
southern Egyptian town of Luxor to establish whether any South
Africans needed help in the wake of Monday's massacre that killed
67 people.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian authorities has told South African ambassador, Justus
de Goede, that so far no South Africans were found among the dead
or injured, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said embassy staff were making telephone checks
with hotels in Luxor. Yet no South Africans appeared to be
holidaying there.
</P>
<P>
The embassy wanted to make direct contact with any South
African nationals in case help was required.
</P>
<P>
With four flights a week to Cairo from South Africa, about
30,000 to 45,000 South Africans arrive in Egypt every year,
according to Egyptian authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, de Goede said most were en route to other
destinations and only a fairly small percentage stay in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The embassy had not received any panic calls from South
Africans and was still trying to assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
On whether the South African government would issue a travel
warning, he said: "We're checking, we want to assess the
situation. After yesterday's chaos a fuller picture is starting
to form."
</P>
<P>
There were no plans to evacuate South Africans, the embassy
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Pretoria that
the department had fielded a significant number of calls from
concerned South Africans whose family members were visiting
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
About 50 calls had been received since news of the massacre
first broke, spokesman Marco Boni said.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-seven people, 60 of whom were tourists, were gunned down
by 10 armed Islamic militants in a 45-minute killing spree in
Luxor Monday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the dead were European and Japanese tourists.
</P>
<P>
The Jamaa Islamiya, which Egyptian police said left messages
claiming responsibility for the attack, is Egypt's main armed
Islamic group.
</P>
<P>
It has waged an armed campaign since 1992 seeking to overthrow
the government of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and establish
a fundamentalist Islamic state.

CANBERRA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Heated trading in Australia's
telecommunications giant Telstra Corp Ltd continued today, pushing

<HEADLINE> Foreign Money Flows into Kenya at Slower Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Foreign capital is flowing
into Kenya's stock market at a slower rate than earlier this
year, according to the latest Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE)
monthly report.
</P>
<P>
The net inflow of foreign money rose to 105.2 million
Shillings (1.65 million U.S. Dollars) last month from the 95.4
million Shillings net inflow in September, but remained well
below June's peak of 331.9 million Shillings, said the NSE
report.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign turnover in October was 145.775 million
Shillings or 36.3 percent of Kenyan stock market's total turnover
from 135.841 million Shillings or 27.5 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi bourse slid in August following the suspension of
205-million-Dollar aid package by the International Monetary Fund
to Kenya on the grounds of corruption and governance issues. The
Shilling depreciated immediately due to the aid halt.
</P>
<P>
However, the weaker Shilling at around 63.80 to the Dollar
Monday, compared to around 55 in July, means the market is
cheaper for offshore investors.
</P>
<P>
Foreign participation was concentrated in the industrial
sector, which accounted for 52 percent of total foreign turnover
in October.
</P>
<P>
The commercial sector accounted for 28 percent, agriculture 16
percent and financials just four percent, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The most highly traded share by all investors was Kenya Power
Lighting. Its turnover increased to 101 million Shillings in
October from 50 million Shillings in September.
</P>
<P>
The NSE 20-share index lost 132 points to close at 3,314.84 at
the end of October from 3,447.41 in September.

<HEADLINE> US to Move Ties With Pakistan to New Level: Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting US Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said here today that the US wanted to
move its relations with Pakistan to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived here last night for a 20-hour visit,
called on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif this morning. She said the
Clinton Administration was seeking a substantive improvement in
its relations with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Foreign Ministry, Sharif said on
the occasion that it would be his personal endeavor to improve and
cement the relationship with the US.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the policies pursued by his government
to bring economic prosperity to the country and to contribute to
the peace and stability in the region are conducive to
strengthening Pak-US relations.
</P>
<P>
"We want the US to take advantage of the investment and
commercial opportunities in Pakistan and become our partner in
progress and development," said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Albright agreed with Sharif, saying the US wanted to move the
economic and commercial relations to the center of the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Sharif stressed the need for an early resolution of the F-16
issue, the removal of remaining Pressler Amendment restrictions
and full implementation of the Brown Amendment so that the
relationship between Pakistan and the US could be freed from
restraints of the past.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the long-running Afghan crisis.
Sharif stressed that Pakistan had no favorites in Afghanistan and
had been in contact with all the Afghan groups in a bid to
facilitate the intra-Afghan dialogue under the UN.
</P>
<P>
Albright's visit to Pakistan is the first by a US secretary of
state in 14 years. She is also expected to visit India and
Bangladesh after her Pakistani tour.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue to Decline on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
decline on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index fell by another 9.64 points to close at 1689.01
points today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that share prices lowered amid concerns over an
economic slowdown next year. In addition, because of the regional
financial crisis, the Straits Times Industrials Index failed to
sustain despite the early gains.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased to 173.53 million units,
valued at 340.26 million Singapore dollars (214 million US
dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 287 to 73, while 252
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Sime Dar was the most actively traded counter as it registered
a turnover of 7.05 million units. It was followed by the Singapore
Telecom which had 6.62 million shares traded. M. Resources was
next with 6.39 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Creative 50 again led the gainers of the day as it rose by 60
cents to finish at 45.6 Singapore dollars. Jurong Ship gained 25
cents to end at 7.8 Singapore dollars, while local car distributor
Cycle &AMP; Carriage (C&AMP;C) increased by 20 cents to close at 7.35
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Innovest Bhd was the biggest loser as it
declined by 1.49 Singapore dollars to end at 1.83 Singapore
dollars. NBT fell by 1.1 dollars to close at 22 Singapore dollars.
NST finished 77 cents lower at 2.18 Singapore dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Rains hit eastern and western
Uganda, killing a teenager and damaging roads and bridges in
affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Anani Wonasolo, 18, was killed by a huge stone in a landslide
in Nabekye village, Sisilyi sub-county in eastern Mbale district,
and Miria Nabuduwa, his sister, was injured on the waist, legs
and chest, Jerome Baryaga, a policeman in the district, told The
New Vision.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains were hitting the district from November 14,
an earlier report said. A new report reaching here said up to 500
acres of wheat worth of 200 millions of Uganda shillings (some
200,000 u.s. dollars) was devastated in Sebei Elgon cooperative
union alone.
</P>
<P>
In Kapchorwa district in the east, Charles Opio, the resident
commissioner of the district, asked local residents to keep the
roads passable yesterday in his office for bussinessmen to
transport maize out of the district. Many roads and bridges were
damaged in the district. Maize is one of the main crops in the
district. Torrential rains from November 8 made the roads in the
district very difficult to pass, and that caused the decreasing
of price of crops, an earlier report said.
</P>
<P>
In Iganga, still another eastern district, people use canoes
as transport tools instead of vehicles in flooded areas where
bridges and roads were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Western Bundibugyo district was cut off last Saturday by
landslides on the road from Bundibugyo to For Portal. The
officials from the ministry of works, transport and
communications were trying to open an alternative road to
Budibugyo town yesterday.
</P>
<P>
In western Kasese district, floods submerged 360 hectares of
cotton, maize and beans.
</P>
<P>
In another development, president Yoweri Museveni expressed
his "deep sorrow about the tragic incidents and extended the
whole country's condolences to all the families and relatives" to
victims of capsizes on Lake Albert and Lake Kioga in which a
total 36 people died. He asked for the circumstances of the
accidents. The president asked for reports about the tragedies
and improvement of security of canoes and boats on lakes.
</P>
<P>
All 18 bodies on Lake Albert have been found. Of the victims
on Lake Kyoga, three were recovered.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to List World Heritage Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A tentative list of
potential world heritage sites in South Africa is to be compiled
for submission to the World Heritage Center in Paris before July
next year, an official with the Department of Environmental
Affairs and Tourism said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Such sites could boost tourism in the country, while they
could also be protected by the international community, local
media quoted director of cultural resources management Makgolo
Makgolo as saying in Bloemfontein.
</P>
<P>
A site must be of universal value and be an outstanding site,
comparable to other sites in the world, before it is approved by
the World Heritage Center.
</P>
<P>
South Africa became a full member of World Heritage Convention
in October.
</P>
<P>
The list of possible sites will be discussed at a meeting of
the South African World Heritage Convention Committee in February
1998.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the first South African sites will be
approved by December 1999.
</P>
<P>
Makgolo was in Bloemfontein to conduct the first of nine
provincial workshops to identify possible sites in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Although every province has a workshop, it did not necessarily
imply that every province would have a world heritage site,
Makgolo said. There might only be about five in the whole of
South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The arrival of the French left to power in 1981 had forced
the fleeing of French capitals to foreign countries, notably
Britain, Switzerland and Belgium, where taxes on properties were
much lower than in France. Today, heavy taxes imposed by the
government is driving nearly one fourth of the young newly
graduated French college students abroad to seek jobs in foreign
countries each year.
</P>
<P>
-- A fundamentalist commando massacred on Monday with submachine
guns and knives 67 people, including 57 foreign tourists, and
wounded 27, in front of the famous Hatchepsout Temple in Luxor,
Egypt. Among the dead were German, British, Swiss and Japanese
citizens, as well as one Frenchman. The attack was apparently
aimed at depriving Egypt of one of its main income sources. It
was also aimed at President Hosni Mubarak himself, who has never
shown any hesitation to execute and imprison Islamic militants in
his country.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Claimed by the principal terrorist organization of Egypt,
the Jamaa al-Islamiya, the massacre of Luxor, in which 57 foreign
tourists and 10 Egyptians were killed, was perpetrated by about 10
people armed with automatic weapons and knives. Never had Luxor
been hit by such a kind of attack, as more than four million
tourists were expected to visit Egypt this year. Despite the
affirmation by the government to repress Islamic extremism with
firmness, violence persists in the country.
</P>
<P>
-- The local elections to be held in Denmark today will test
the weight of the extreme-right party, the Danish People's Party,
which is nourished by a xenophobia born from the failure by the
Danes to understand the small number of immigrants present in the
Scandinavian country.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Daily Calls on US to Accept Iraq's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian daily today called
on the United States to accept the proposal put forward by Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to avoid another bloodshed in
the region.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, the English-language daily Tehran Times said
that the Iraqi proposal was quite sensible and rational and the
international atmosphere did not favor a military attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Even if the inevitable happens, the U.S. will not succeed to
achieve its goals since the situation of the world today is
totally different from that of 1991, it said.
</P>
<P>
The daily apparently referred to the 1991 Gulf War against
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait launched by Western-allied forces.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. political influence is on the decline, Tehran Times
noted, and "the U.S. sanctions diplomacy specially those imposed
on Iran have not only failed but have bought the U.S. the wrath
of its allies and partners."
</P>
<P>
Aziz made a proposal to the United Nations Security Council
to set up an impartial committee of experts in charge of the
U.N. inspection of Iraqi disarmament in order to end the current
crisis between Iraq and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro Sunday
night, Aziz said that the five permanent members of the Security
Council "should all have the same weight" and "if this formula is
accepted, we would have no objections to the return of the
American inspectors we expelled."
</P>
<P>
The crisis began after Iraq decided on October 29 to expel the
six Americans in the U.N. weapons inspection team on charge of
espionage.
</P>
<P>
The expulsion of the Americans last Thursday prompted 68
non-American members of the team to leave Iraq and triggered a
threat by the U.S. to launch military strike at Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States has dispatched more military forces to the
Persian Gulf, preparing a military attack to force Iraq to
accept the return of Americans in the U.N. inspection team.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also paid visits to
Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia over the past few days to
seek support from the Arab countries for the U.S. military attack.
</P>
<P>
Terming Albright's tour as "a total failure," the Iranian
daily Tehran Times said the trip sent a message to the U.S. that
other countries would not submit to their bullying.
</P>
<P>
The daily also called on the U.N. to play an active role in
defusing tension between Iraq and the U.S., adding that the
U.N. shoulders a great responsibility at this stage.

<HEADLINE> China Aims to Promote Economic Hotels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China's catering industry has
made it a point to explore markets for economic hotels, according
to officials from the Ministry of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Catering Service Department of the ministry
show that up to the end of last year, there were approximately
300,000 catering outlets nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The occupancy rate in these hotels suggested an overall
decrease in 1996, and more serious in luxury hotels than medium-
and small-scale ones. Costumers expressed a dissatisfaction with
safety, sanitary conditions and facilities in economic hotels.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that medium and small-sized hotels must
stop their blind pursuit of high consumption, and target customers
on business trips.
</P>
<P>
These hotels were also urged to improve their cash flow and
invest more in upgrading facilities to further satisfy the
domestic tourist market.
</P>
<P>
The ministry encouraged the hotels to set up room-booking
networks, standardize quality and advertising systems. Moreover,
it predicted chain ownership of economy hotels to emerge in the
future.

LONDON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain and other three smaller European Union states Monday
were given a glimpse of life outside the single currency when the
other 11 countries ignored their objections and pushed ahead with
plans for a new council to manage the euro.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Japan's stock market staged one of its largest one-day rises
Monday, reflecting hopes that the government was finally tackling
the country's mounting economic and financial problems.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- At least six Britons were killed Monday when Muslim fanatics
disguised as police opened fire on visitors at the Pharaonic

tourist sites. At least 67 people were killed in the massacre.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- British officials in Brussels Monday began the search for a
face-saving EU compromise in the tobacco sponsorship row over

Westminster towards reform of party funding.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and Iraq both appeared keen Monday to step
back from the belligerent rhetoric of recent days. But Washington

<HEADLINE> Financial Officials Discuss Proposed Asian Fund in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Deputy finance ministers and
senior central bank officials from Asian countries and the United
States started here today a two-day meeting on the proposed Asian
Fund Facility, which would supplement IMF resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the officials are expected to discuss the need
for a quick-response supplemental financing facility linked to
International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditionalities, ways to
address the moral hazard problem, guiding principles and mechanics
of the proposed fund, and regional surveillance and economic
cooperation mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The fund was proposed by Japan at the joint IMF-World Bank
annual meeting in Hong Kong in September, but the United States
initially gave a lukewarm response.
</P>
<P>
Other industrialized nations have resisted Japan's idea of an
independent "Asian Monetary Fund," as they fear that an
independent fund would undermine the IMF conditions attached to
its economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
Bowing to pressure from the United States, Japan is reportedly
scaling back its proposal.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials said that they are now prepared to propose
alternatives that would be less ambitious than a fully independent
fund. One possibility is for Asian countries to set up a regional
emergency-rescue facility similar to the IMF's credit lines.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Peres: Netanyahu's Policy Illogical, Foolish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli prime minister
Shimon Peres today described the current Likud government's policy
of putting the security issue before peace as being "illogical"
and "foolish."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Peres said Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has failed to keep the commitment
to the Oslo peace accords Israel signed with the Palestinians four
years ago, resulting in "tremendous problems" in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Peres, a member of the Knesset (parliament) of the left Labor
Party, said the security-for-peace policy has proved a failure.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of the land-for-peace formula, which
was the basis of the progress achieved in the peace process during
the previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed optimism that "there will be a change" in the
policy.
</P>
<P>
"Peace carries costs, and expensive ones," and "there is no
free peace," he said, adding that Yitzhak Rabin sacrificed his
life as the cost for peace.
</P>
<P>
Rabin, former Israeli Labor prime minister who spearheaded with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat the Oslo accords, was
assassinated by a radical Jewish youth in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Peres is here to attend the three-day fourth Middle East and
North Africa economic conference which opened Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the conference, saying it is a good
opportunity to advance the peace process through regional economic
cooperation.

ISLAMABAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of

Khan signed three agreements on economic cooperation between the
two countries here today.
</P>

Under another agreement, the U.S. would make 10 million U.S.
dollars available for Pakistan to import U.S. soybeans, the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The combined length of China's
electrified railways now exceeds 10,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The figure now stands at 10,514 kilometers, accounting for 18
percent of the aggregate length of the country's railway lines,
ranking the eighth in the world, according to statistics from the
Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
The ministry says that, at present, the country has 23
electrified rail lines, including some 3,870 kilometers of
double-track lines.
</P>
<P>
China began building electrified railways at the end of the
1950s. The first electrified railway, the Baoji-Chengdu line, was
completed in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Until it started the opening-up and reform drive in the late
1970s, the country had only 1,033 kilometers of electrified
railways in operation. But by early this year, the figure jumped
to 9,480 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Electrification is an important symbol of railway
modernization. After being electrified, railways can be managed in
a more efficient way, officials said, providing better conditions
for train transport.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Inspects Scene of Deadly Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak paid an inspection tour this morning to the southern
archeological resort of Luxor where a bloody terrorist attack
claimed the lives of more than 60 tourists and Egyptians Monday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and ministers of defense,
information and culture accompanied the president to Luxor, about
500 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of interior and health flew to the scene immediately
after gunmen fired randomly at tourists arriving in buses and
fought a two-hour gun battle with the police near the ruins of an
ancient temple on the west bank of the Nile.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-year-old Hatshepsut Temple, the scene of Egypt's
worst terrorist shooting rampage, last month served as the
backdrop of performances of Verdi's Opera Aida, a glittering
fanfare that had attracted thousands of visitors including
Mubarak and many world dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
Up to this morning, 64 people have been killed, including 60
international tourists from Europe, Asia and Latin America. Three
Egyptian security guards and a tourist guide were also among the
dead.
</P>
<P>
The 25 injured include 12 Swiss, two Germans, two Japanese and
one French as well as eight Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
There is still no claim of responsibility but Islamic
militants were suspected of masterminding Egypt's single largest
terrorist crime that targeted tourism, a key foreign currency
earner.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Mamdouh el-Beltagui, who is in London
attending a travel fair, said Monday that Egypt is "not less safe
than any destination" and described the crime as "something you
cannot prevent."
</P>
<P>
The Islamic militants have been leading a violent campaign to
overthrow the Egyptian secular government since 1992. Nearly
1,300 have been killed, mostly policemen and militants but the
violence has been largely confined to the south.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the government has used massive arrests,
military trials and executions to stamp the militant wave.
</P>
<P>
In the previous attack targeting foreign tourists, nine
Germans and an Egyptian drive were killed on September 18 in a
gunshoot and firebomb attack on a bus in front of the Egyptian
Antiquities Museum in Cairo. The two assailants were sentenced to
death on October 30.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, a prime target of terrorism, brought about 4 million
tourists and 3 billion U.S. dollars to Egypt last year.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Non-Traditional Exports to Reach $456m </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's non-traditional
exports (NTES) are expected to reach 456 million U.S. Dollars by
the year 2000, according to a weekly newspaper published today.
</P>
<P>
The initial target figure for the year 2000 is 200 million
dollars, Financial Times said, but this has since been increased
after the target was attained three years before the actual time
frame.
</P>
<P>
The Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) indicated that NTES will grow
to 345 million dollars by the end of 1998 and further rise to 395
million dollars by 1999, with the final goal of 456 million
dollars at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper quoted EBZ director Mwansa Musonda as
saying earlier at a State House press briefing that while NTES
are poised for further growth, this requires investments in the
productive capacities especially in the agro-based products and
agro-processing.
</P>
<P>
The EBZ director added that Zambia's NTES reached above 242.5
million dollars last year, representing about a quarter of the
country's overall export earnings.
</P>
<P>
EBZ has projected a figure of 297 million dollars in NTES for
1997, but it now appears that the figure may be exceeded by the
year end.
</P>
<P>
NTES are contributing significantly to Zambia's total foreign
exchange earnings rising from eight percent in 1990 to 24.3
percent in 1996, said Musonda.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's total export earnings this year, including copper
earnings, the country's biggest traditional foreign exchange
earner, are reported to have reached above.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Zambia's imports has declined by 8.6
percent compared to the same period in 1996 because of a 10
percent decline in imports of non-oil commodities.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to See Stable Shilling Before Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Shilling is expected
to remain stable in the 60 to 65 range against the U.S. Dollar
before the general elections, local reports today quoted Central
Bank of Kenya Governor Micah Cheserem as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic. The Shilling is doing okey. I expect it to
trade in the 60 to 65 corridor against the Dollar in the lead-up
to the general election," Cheserem said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said he was particularly encouraged by politicians --
including President Daniel arap Moi and opposition presidential
candidates -- who have all spoken out publicly against violence
during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Only violence in this period could hurt the Shilling. But in
the absence of that, the Shilling is steady and can only
strengthen," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders are behaving in a honorable way and I think the
worst is well behind us," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling opened at a commercial mean rate of 63.73 to the
Dollar Monday, according to the Central Bank figures.
</P>
<P>
Early last week, the Shilling fell against all hard currencies
as the market reacted negatively to the announcement of the
election date. It slipped to as low as 65.50 against the Dollar
from the 63.50 to 64 range where it had stuck for weeks.
</P>
<P>
But with supply outweighing demand and domestic interbank
interest rates around 28 percent, the Shilling recovered from
some of those losses, opening at 63.73 on the Dollar on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling plunged to as low as 70 against the Dollar after
a decision in July by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to
stop a 205-million-Dollar three-year aid package to reinforce its
protest against corruption and governance issues.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Surge in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Pressure for rising interest
rates continued last month as the market remained volatile due to
uncertainty over the election, according to the November issue of
the Economic Review monthly by the Central Bank of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Principal money market interest rates rose in September and
October following an increase in governmental demand for domestic
credit due to shortfalls in external financing of the budget
deficit, said the review.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall emerged after the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) cut its 205-million-U.S.-Dollar three-year aid package on
July 31 in a bid to reinforce protest against corruption and
governance issues in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The yields on Treasury bills have since shot up from an
average of 19.7 percent in August to 26.2 percent in September
and stabilized at 27.2 percent last month, said the review.
</P>
<P>
High Treasury bill yields necessitated a number of policy
measures and market responses in the three months to October,
among them a shift from deposit holdings to holdings of Treasury
bills and bonds with a distinct slowdown in money supply
expansion.
</P>
<P>
The shift from deposits to government securities created a
squeeze on the banks leading to a rise in the interbank interest
rate from 17.6 percent in August to 26.9 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
The average overdraft interest rate, which is the dominant
cost of investable funds, rose from 27.4 percent in August to 28
percent in September while the average three-month deposit
interest rose from 16.8 percent in August to 18.3 percent in
September.

<HEADLINE> Inflation May Go Uncontrolled in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's 15 percent inflation
target by the end of the year may not be achieved, and the actual
rate could be in the range of 22 to 25 percent, Citibank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in its latest issue of the Citibank Treasury
Letter that it is unlikely that further drops in inflation will
be recorded in the last two months of this year.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore continue to hold the view that the 15 percent
year-end target is unachievable and the actual rate of the
Consumer Price Index will be 22 to 25 percent," said the new
letter.
</P>
<P>
It said the annual rate of inflation has been declining
progressively for the last nine months due to tight monetary
policy pursued by the Bank of Zambia, abundant fresh good
products and the stability in the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
However, all these factors have started moving in the
direction not likely to support further drops in the level of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
"Available broad money supply data shows a five percent
growth. Availability of fresh food products has declined due to
seasonal factors, while pressure in the foreign exchange market
has increased volatility and depreciation in the value of local
currency," said the bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that pressure in the supply of fresh food
products will continue until the next harvest, and maize imports
are likely to lead to higher prices as a consequence of the
expected depreciation in the value of the local currency.
</P>
<P>
This will in turn exert more pressure on the exchange markets
leading to further currency depreciation.
</P>
<P>
Last year the country recorded a 35 percent inflation rate.

<HEADLINE> Retired Mandela to Continue ANC Work: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will step down as leader of the African National
Congress (ANC) next month, an ANC spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Mamoepa, ANC's spokesman, said that Mandela will
almost certainly continue working for the party.
</P>
<P>
Mandela,79,has been president of the ANC since 1991. He became
South Africa's first black president after all-race democratic
elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He has said repeatedly he won't run for re-election to his
party post at next month's ANC national congress or seek a second
term as state president in the next national elections in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But the ANC will ask Mandela to continue working for it after
he steps down, Mamoepa was quoted by local media as saying.
</P>
<P>
"A person of president Mandela's expertise, knowledge, wisdom
and leadership qualities may have to continue to serve in the
organization," Mamoepa said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy state president Thabo Mbeki, who is also deputy
president of the ANC,is the only nominee so far to replace
Mandela as party leader, Mamoepa said.

Andreotti, whose comments were regarded as critical of NATO

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Urges to Observe Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has stressed the importance of abiding by laws of the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech to the whole nation Monday night,
Khatami said that the most important responsibility he shoulders
as president is the enforcement of the constitution except in the
areas directly related to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
He said that the national government should be organized
according to law and that all its departments should comply with
laws.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the judiciary, the legislature, and agencies
related to intelligence, security, law enforcement, culture and
economy to function within the limits of law.
</P>
<P>
Local observers noted that Khatami's speech was a response to
the political chaos among factions triggered by the presidential
elections in May.
</P>
<P>
Different groups have been trading accusations against each
other, and some even resorted to violence against others.
</P>
<P>
Khatami announced in his speech that a special body would be
set up to oversee the implementation of the constitution and find
out loopholes in law enforcement in a bid to avoid abuse or
violation of laws.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his promise to offer more freedom to the people
during the presidential election campaigns, Khatami stressed that
freedom should be based on law, and that differences of opinion
should be resolved through exchange of views.
</P>
<P>
He rejected imposition of views on others in the name of
defending the people and their freedom or in the name of Islam
and its sanctity.
</P>
<P>
Such practices should be condemned and considered as
violations of laws and obstacles to social progress, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Quality Education in Primary, Middle Schools (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China will challenge
examination-oriented education, which is widely applied in schools
across the country, by speeding up reforms of the admission system.
</P>
<P>
This reform will be one of the 10 measures raised by the State
Education Commission (SEC) in its latest curricular.
</P>
<P>
The SEC promised that it would organize experts and experienced
teachers to revise part of the curriculum and textbooks in the
near future to cope with the demand of more quality-oriented
schools.
</P>
<P>
In places where the nine-year compulsory education is
implemented, primary school students must be accepted without
taking any entrance exam at the middle school which is nearest to
their homes, according to the SEC circular.
</P>
<P>
The exam results will no longer play a key role in evaluating
the quality of schooling and work of the teachers. The SEC asks
primary school teachers to give positive and encouraging comments
on the students' behavior and conduct, and evaluate the students'
work with degrees instead of specific scores.
</P>
<P>
In most primary and middle schools in China, teachers will
still write some comments on students' behavior at school at least
once a semester. The comments, often written in a critical way,
sometimes intensifies their relations with students and their
parents.
</P>
<P>
The unified entrance examination to college or university, a
fateful exam in China, will also face reform because of its use as
a barometer by middle schools and primary schools.

<HEADLINE> Regional Meeting on Malaria, Kalaazar Held in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A three-day regional meeting of
South Asian countries on malaria and kalaazar began today in the
Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka to discuss ways for better control of
the diseases.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, sponsored by the World Health Organization's
Southeast Asia Region Office, is being attended by more than 25
specialists from Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aims to achieve better and more successful control
of malaria and kalaazar though improved coordination and
communication among health authorities in the region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being held in the backdrop of an alarming
upsurge in malaria cases in a number of districts along the
northeastern and south-eastern borders of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 1.2 million malaria cases occur in
Bangladesh every year, most of which in 13 forest and hill
districts in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, public health administrators and disease
specialists from the four countries will share their experiences
on malaria control and review the status of joint action plans.
They are expected to lay emphasis on exchange of information and
synchronization of control operations of malaria and kalaazar in
border areas, especially during epidemic outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, a revised malaria control strategy has been in
operation since 1995, aiming to significantly reduce mortality and
morbidity among affected population.

<TEXT>
<P>
The national examination, restored two decades ago at the
proposal of late Chinese Leader Deng Xiaoping, has widely kindled
and increased the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for knowledge
after 10 years of dangling during the Cultural Revolution
(1966-1976). The exam was regarded as the most fair opportunity
available to almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
However, the exam has become contentious because of pressure
brought on school leaders, students and parents. School education
has become more exam-oriented instead of quality-oriented, leading
educators to work out some reform measures.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of the college entrance exam, students and their
parents pick good schools which are well-equipped and have
experienced teachers. Those weak schools, which are less
well-equipped or have less-experienced teachers, are not as
attractive to students as the good ones.
</P>
<P>
Another of the 10 measures is that the SEC will help weak
schools become stronger with better equipment and good teachers.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include training qualified and competent school
principals and teachers, encouraging teaching ethics and
strengthening study on education so as to answer practical
questions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the SEC asked local governments to help create a
loose environment for, and local schools to abide by, relevant
laws and rules to implement quality-oriented education.
</P>
<P>
The SEC also asked cooperation from parents and communities.
Earlier reports said that some parents were worried when their
children did not bring back much homework. They believed that
children were diligent only when they were busy doing their home
assignments.

ANKARA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz is to pay a two-day visit to Italy and Spain to rally

newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz will leave for Rome on November 23 and meet with his

</P>
<P>
On November 24, Yilmaz will exchange views with Spanish Prime

</P>
<P>
Ankara's hope to be included in the EU enlargement process is
becoming gloomy as the European body repeatedly issued signals
that Turkey would not be considered as a candidate for the
enlargement talks.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Turkish leaders and officials have made frequent
visits to some EU countries to persuade them to take a positive
position toward Turkey's EU bid.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been making efforts for years for the full EU
membership, but so far no concrete results have been achieved due
to some differences with the EU on the Cyprus issue, human rights
as well as its weak economy.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- South African Amanda Coetzer
dropped out of the two-million U.S. dollars Chase Championships
here on Monday, while Mary Pierce and Irina Spirlea defeated
their first-round opponents at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
The world No.3 Coetzer was upset 6-3, 6-3 by Nathalie Tauziat
of France. Pierce of France edged Belgium's Sabine Appelmans
6-3, 6-4 while Spirlea of Romania beat Sandrine Testud of France
6-3, 5-7, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Coetzer, who had a 100 percent match record in three meetings
with Steffi Graf this year and clinched one of the four victories
over Martina Hingis, was kept running on Tauziat's combination of
angled baseliners and precise drops.
</P>
<P>
Tauziat stepped into the court with a powerful start by
winning the first three games and ensured the opening set.
</P>
<P>
Coetzer came back a little at 2-0 but swerved again to watch
Tauziat through. Tauziat will play either No.6 Iva Majoli of
Croatia or Germany's Anke Huber.
</P>
<P>
The seventh-seeded Pierce put on her best form to take
Appelmans, giving much more than the Belgian could handle.
</P>
<P>
The French pulled out of last week's Advanta Championships due
to a kidney infection.
</P>
<P>
Her quarter-final opponent will be the winner of Tuesday's
match between Hingis and Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the
Netherlands. Spirlea set up a clash with either third-seeded
Lindsay Davenport or another American Mary Joe Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's only doubles, Gigi Fernandez finished her career
with a bad ending.
</P>
<P>
Helena Sukova and Larisa Neiland overpowered top-seeded team
of Gigi Fernandez and Natasha Zvereva 7-5, 3-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
"It's the right time," Fernandez said when she announced this
would be her last tournament. "I'll be 34 in February. Life
changes, there's different priorities."

Fernandez won 14 Grand Slam tournament titles including French
Open and Wimbledon this year.

<HEADLINE> China Is No Enemy: Schlesinger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. defense secretary
James Schlesinger today said U.S.-China ties are critical and
Americans should avoid exaggerations about China's military
capability.
</P>
<P>
Schlesinger, who spoke here tonight on "Is China a Threat to
American Security and Interests," a function organized by the
National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, said any attempt to
make China a foe "is simply partisan politics."
</P>
<P>
"U.S.-China relationship is a critical relationship, if it is
good, Asia will prosper, Asia will be pretty much at peace, if
there is suspicion and hostility, it will disrupt the region,
disrupt Asia's economic growth, Asia will be unstable and the
whole world will be somewhat unsettled," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-China relationship, he said, should be based on a
strategic understanding on both sides, instead of just attaching
economic importance to the relationship.
</P>
<P>
"For the moment China is only focusing on economic growth as a
reflection of Deng Xiaoping thought," he told an audience of more
than 100 at a downtown Manhattan hotel.
</P>
<P>
China's military equipment are outdated and even its military
expenditure is expected to grow along with its economic growth, it
still "has a long long way to go before it is in a position to
challenge U.S. forces," Schlesinger said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for us to avoid exaggerations about even the
prospective Chinese military threat," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"China is not the enemy, there is not going to be a new cold
war," he went on.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as saying
that "when you keep referring to a country as a future enemy, it
will not be a future enemy, but an enemy today," he asserted: "we
turn to treat China as an enemy, we should know that no one will
follow us...we will be alone."
</P>
<P>
"We can not presuppose that China will turn hostile based on
very little evidence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Currently as a board member of the National Committee on
U.S.-China Relations and senior advisor to Lehman Brothers,
Schlesinger has held three cabinet-level positions in the national
security realm. He served as the secretary of defense between
1973-75 and as the secretary of energy from 1977 to 1979.

<HEADLINE> Public to Have Say on Parliament Site: ANC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The ruling African
National Congress (ANC) said Monday that the public would have a
say on whether parliament should be relocated from Cape Town,
local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa told a news conference that
although the party's policy-making National Executive Committee
(NEC) had deliberated on the matter at the weekend, it had not
reached a decision on the issue because it felt that the matter
had to involve the public.
</P>
<P>
"The NEC felt that the matter of the relocation of parliament
is of such national importance that it should be dealt with in a
rational manner through open and honest debate among the public.
</P>
<P>
"The NEC has charged the extended National Working Committee
(NWC) to make concrete proposals for such a public process," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The NEC met at the weekend to consider recommendations
submitted by a three-men committee set up to investigate the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Although the NEC had earlier said the relocation issue had to
be decided before the end of this year, there was now no specific
deadline when the matter would be finalized.
</P>
<P>
The NWC needed to be given time to accomplish its task and
work out how it could best engage the public in the debate.
</P>
<P>
The matter would therefore not be discussed as expected at the
party's coming national conference in mid-December in Mafikeng,
North-West province.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey released last week, the majority of
urban South Africans want parliament to stay in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey showed that 54 percent of the polled
support Cape Town as the site for parliament, only 17 percent opt
for Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has three capitals: Pretoria (executive), Cape
Town (legislative) and Bloemfontein (judicial).
</P>
<P>
There were proposals that parliament be moved to Pretoria to
save time and money.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Balance of Payments Seen to Turn Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's balance of payments
(BOP), which suffered a deficit of 127 million U.S. dollars in
fiscal 1996-97, is expected to turn around and see a surplus of
216 million dollars in the current fiscal year provided exports
register the projected growth over imports, an official document
said today.
</P>
<P>
The current projection of the BOP for 1997-98 shows a 13.2
percent increase in exports against a 12.6 percent increase in
imports, the document said, adding that this modest growth of
exports over imports will reduce the gap in merchandise trade.
</P>
<P>
Exports in fiscal 1997-98 were projected to fetch 5 billion
dollars, 13.2 percent higher than the estimated 4.418 billion
dollars in fiscal 1996-97. This growth was projected on the basis
of a robust growth of 28.8 percent of knitwear products and a
continuous growth of ready-made garments at 11.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Imports in 1997-98 were projected to increase by 12.6 percent
to 8.015 billion dollars from 7.120 billion dollars in fiscal
1996-97, the document said. The expected increase is due to
continuous demand for investment goods, industrial raw materials
and consumer items.
</P>
<P>
Imports of food grains are likely to take the major share,
increasing by 27.8 percent from 180 million dollars in 1996-97 to
230 million dollars this fiscal year, while non-food imports are
also projected to grow 11.8 percent over the previous year to 7.31
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Trade deficit, estimated at 3.015 billion dollars, is expected
to be partly offset by a projected increase of 14.9 percent in
private transfers -- mainly remittances from workers working
abroad -- from 1.77 billion dollars in 1996-97 to 2.033 billion
dollars in 1997-98, the document said.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit, which was 902 million dollars last
year, is expected to reach 1.032 billion dollars this year, the
document added.
</P>
<P>
The document stated that the government believes that the
current account deficit, though higher than that of the previous
year, is less than 3 percent of gross domestic product and within
the sustainable limit.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Continues to Shrink in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Trade deficit in the
Philippines has shrunk to 8.298 billion U.S. dollars in the first
nine months this year due to robust exports and sluggish imports,
the National Statistics Office (NSO) said today.
</P>
<P>
This represents an almost 10 percent drop from the year-ago
level of 9.212 billion dollars, the NSO said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
During the nine-month period, exports increased by 23 percent
to 18.363 billion dollars from 14.926 billion dollars in the same
period of last year, while imports grew by 10.5 percent to 26.661
billion dollars from 24.138 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Total trade value for the first nine months of the year
increased by 15.3 percent to 45.023 billion dollars, the NSO said.
</P>
<P>
For the month of September alone, exports posted a 24.6 percent
increase to a total of 2.337 billion dollars as imports payments
were registered at 2.875 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the NSO, electronics and components were at the
top of the list of imported goods, followed by telecommunications
equipment, electrical machinery, and industrial machinery and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and Singapore remained as the
Philippines' top markets for both imports and exports, the NSO
said.

<HEADLINE> Another Foreign Priest Kidnapped in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Four heavily armed men,
believed to be former Muslim rebels, today abducted a Belgian
Catholic priest in front of a church in the southern Philippines,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Police said father Bernard Maes, 53, was taken hostage in
Marawi City, Lanao Del Sur province, by former guerrillas of the
defunct major rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF).
</P>
<P>
The MNLF signed a final peace agreement with the government in
September 1996. Manila promised to develop livelihood programs to
help those former rebels integrate into the civilian society.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the abductors were asking for cash benefits
being promised by the government to all rebel returnees in
exchange for Maes' release.
</P>
<P>
Maes was the second foreign priest kidnapped in the southern
Philippines. Earlier, an Irish priest was taken hostage by former
MNLF rebels and was released just recently.

<HEADLINE> Railway Could Make Caves Hot Tourist Attraction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A string of beautiful but
rarely seen limestone caves in southwestern China province could
become a tourist attraction with the completion of a
trans-regional railway next month.
</P>
<P>
The grouping of caves, including nine large ones and numerous
small ones, extend a dozen miles into Longan County in the
southwestern part of Guizhou Province. The caves have waterfalls,
warm springs, underground rivers and a large underground chamber
measuring 1.6 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The caves were first discovered in 1986 by a group of British
geologists. With information obtained from satellites, they
ventured twice into the then unknown caves and concluded that they
might be the most densely grouped limestone caves in the world.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, explorers and scholars from countries such as
Japan, Switzerland, Norway, Canada, the Netherlands and
New Zealand have explored the relatively unknown caves.
</P>
<P>
Connected to the outside world by a bumpy road, the caves have
not been developed as a tourist attraction to help the local
economy as officials had expected.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Nanning-Kunming railway line that is
scheduled to open early next month can bring tourists directly to
the attraction.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Tries to Calm Foreign Exchange Mart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
(RBZ) has increased the rediscount rate by three percent and
should offload all corporate Foreign Currency Account (FCA)
balances onto the foreign exchange market to support the weak
Zimbabwean Dollar.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference last night called to clear the confusion
in the market, Minister of Finance Herbert Murerwa said effective
and decisive measures had to be taken to restore order on the
foreign exchange market following last Friday's crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Dollar plunged to an all-time low last Friday
after coming under heavy pressure from import demand. The central
bank had to pump in some 20 million U.S. dollars to support the
Zimbabwean currency.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean currency nosedived to an all-time low last week,
trading between 19 and 25 Zimbabwe Dollars to one U.S. Dollar
after speculations that the RBZ did not have sufficient foreign
currency reserves to finance import obligations among other
things.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Dollar is now trading at between 13 and 14 to the
U.S. Dollar after the RBZ rescue.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa said in view of the speculative trading on the
Zimbabwean Dollar which led to last Friday's crisis it was
necessary to increase the rediscount rate.
</P>
<P>
The rate rose from 25.5 percent to 28.5 percent to help halt
the dollar's downward slide.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the rediscount rate could be increased again
if the speculative behaviors continued.
</P>
<P>
Monday's increase will result in interest rates rising,
further putting pressure on businesses.
</P>
<P>
Some 160 million U.S. Dollars are being released onto the
market.

<HEADLINE> Terracotta Horses, Warriors Under Well Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Scientists and archeologists say
they have found effective ways to protect cultural relics in the
pits at the site of the "Terra Cotta Horses and Warriors."
</P>
<P>
Located more than 30 kilometers to the east of Xi'an, capital
of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, the pits were first
discovered in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have found nearly 8,000 porcelain horses and
warriors buried in the three pits so far unearthed.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the colored drawings of the porcelain horses
and warriors have begun to roll up or peel off, and earthen
partition walls separating horses and warriors have been damaged
by changes in humidity.
</P>
<P>
To solve these problems, the museum housing the terra cotta
horses and warriors has established a team to carry out research
on protective measures for the relics, with the help of the state
and Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The museum also has imported advanced instruments and equipment
to speed up research.
</P>
<P>
The research group evaluated the elements used in the colored
drawings and then developed aqueous reinforcing solutions for the
remaining colored drawings.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the problem of the earthen partition walls,
researchers used steel plates and reinforcing piles.
</P>
<P>
Researchers also have made progress in protecting the terra
cotta treasures against such threats as earthquakes, climate
changes inside the pits and environmental quality around the
pits.

BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- New steps will be taken by the
Beijing High-Tech Zone to upgrade its industrial structure and
explore more market potential.
</P>
<P>
In the next three-to-five years, the zone will introduce more
advanced technologies, expand the size of its enterprises,
globalize both its production and sales activities and introduce
new methods in technology development, according to a spokesman

</P>
<P>
The efforts will also include the establishment of a better
market system and the improvement of market management, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the zone will grow into one of the best hi-tech
research and development parks in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1988 in the Zhongguancun area in northwestern
Beijing, the Beijing Hi-Tech Zone was the first of its kind at the
national level in China. The zone occupies an area of 100 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
According to administrators, such sectors as software,
bio-engineering, new materials and information will be given
development preference.

<HEADLINE> OPEC to Discuss Oil Quota, Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A rise in both the quota and
price of crude oil is likely to be a crucial topic at an OPEC
meeting to be held here from November 26 to December 1,
Organizing Committee officials said.
</P>
<P>
While some members want a quota increase, others do not,
according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
As for price increase, it will depend mostly on demand. While
oil demand in Europe increased, Asian demand remained unchanged
due to the recent monetary crisis in the region, they added.
</P>
<P>
"The conference will discuss routine agenda items,
administration and finance, restructuring of the organization,
preparation for the conference of parties in Kyoto, Japan, oil
price development and monitoring of production of member
countries," Director General of Indonesian Oil and Natural Gas
Company Soepraptono Soelaiman said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the meeting will determine new quotas and elect a
new secretary general for the next three-year term. The present
secretary general is Rilwanu Lukman from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Former OPEC Secretary General Subroto from Indonesia said on
Monday that in its efforts to stabilize oil prices, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has always
made an approach to non-OPEC oil producing countries, particularly
those around the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
Subroto admitted that at present, OPEC contributes the smaller
portion to the world market, producing 30 million barrels of oil
per day as against 46 million barrels per day by non-OPEC
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Subroto said, of the nearly 1 billion barrels oil
reserves in the world, 77 percent are from OPEC member countries
while only 33 percent are held by non-OPEC countries.
</P>
<P>
OPEC is a permanent, inter-governmental organization created in
Baghdad, Iraq, in September 1960, by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi
Arabia and Venezuela. The founding members were later joined by
Qatar, Indonesia, Libya, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria,
Nigeria, Ecuador and Gabon.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Tourist Agency Suspends Tours to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish Amateur Tourist
Agency announced today it will cancel its arrangements of tours to
Egypt in the wake of a worst terrorist attack in southern Egypt
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The agency said it has decided to withdraw about 600 tourists,
including 300 Swedes, currently traveling in Egypt, and it will
suspend the flight of chartered planes to Egypt within the next
few months.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen
condemned the brutal massacre in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In the terrorist attack in Luxor, one of the most famous
tourist attractions 500 kilometers south of Cairo, a group of
gunmen in police uniforms opened machine-gun fire on foreign
tourists getting off tour buses, killing at least 61 and wounding
85 others.
</P>
<P>
It was the first murder case of its kind which occurred in
Luxor since 1992 when Moslem extremists began to wage attacks
against the tourism industry in an effort to oust the government.

<HEADLINE> Indian Rupee Touches 21-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee touched a
21-month low of 36.89 rupees per U.S. dollar on Monday despite the
intervention of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in both the spot
and forwards markets, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Thus the Indian currency has depreciated by 2 percent over a
span of three weeks.
</P>
<P>
On October 26, the rupee closed at 36.15/19 against the U.S.
dollar and subsequently went on a roller-roaster ride to lose
nearly 75 paise (0.75 rupees).
</P>
<P>
The RBI, the central bank, pumped in an estimated 150 million
to 200 million dollars on Monday to stem the volatility in the
market.
</P>
<P>
There is no perceptible change in the RBI stance vis-a-vis the
rupee, sources here said. The central bank will allow the market
forces to determine the value of the rupee and intervene only to
rein in the volatility, they added.
</P>
<P>
"Insufficient intervention by the Reserve Bank led the rupee to
weaken to a new low," a dealer in a private sector bank commented.
</P>
<P>
Some treasury heads of Indian corporations also pointed out
that a certain degree of political instability in the country was
leading the rupee to weaken. However, they were unanimous in the
view that there would not be a sharp decline in the rupee.
</P>
<P>
"There is no panic in the market. It is the corporate demand
which has triggered the fall," the treasury head of a leading
Indian corporation said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Blasts Terrorist Attack in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today condemned Monday's terrorist attack that took the
lives of 60 foreign tourists visiting a popular sight in Luxor,
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"I wonder what possible use an indiscriminate attack on
innocent people would have in resolving a country's problems?"
Hashimoto told reporters from his residence. "Whatever country it
might be, it would surely never give in to terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister voiced his sorrow for those killed
by Muslim gunmen in the attack. He said he would send his
condolences to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and call on him to
prevent the recurrence of such an incident.
</P>
<P>
Nine Japanese tourists were killed. Victims also included
Egyptian, French, German and Swiss nationals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and Chief
Cabinet Secretary Kanezo Muraoka also condemned the terrorist
attack and expressed their condolences to the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified gunmen, allegedly members of an extremist group
trying to set up a fundamentalist Islamic state, opened fire on
some 250 tourists in the southern Egyptian city. It is so far the
country's worst terrorist attack on tourists.

According to the latest statistics by Toyota Motor (Thailand)
Co., almost all auto makers and dealers saw a decline in their
sales in Thailand, except Honda and Chrysler.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Export of Manpower Continues to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's labor export has
seen a downward trend over the past year mainly due to the
suspension of recruitment by importing countries, Bangladesh
Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA) sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Labor export is a major foreign exchange earner for this South
Asian country, which exports more than 1 million workers every
year. The country earned 60 billion taka (about 1.34 billion U.S.
dollars) in the 1995-96 fiscal year. From January to August this
year, Bangladeshis working abroad remitted 4.01 billion taka
(about 89.5 million dollars) back home.
</P>
<P>
Manpower export declined by 9.56 percent in August this year
compared with the same month of last fiscal year, the sources
said. In September, it fell further by 0.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
If this trend continues, the sector might witness a serious
debacle, said BAIRA Chairman Mohammed Mosharraf Hossain. "Apart
from this it would leave a negative impact on the national
economy."
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh exports manpower mainly to Malaysia, Saudi Arabia
and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Citing the reasons of the decline, the sources noted that
Malaysia, where at least 200,000 Bangladeshi workers have been
working, stopped fresh recruitment for the last two years while
Korea also has not imported overseas workers including those from
Bangladesh for over a year.
</P>
<P>
The lion's share of foreign remittances comes from expatriate
Bangladeshis in Saudi Arabia where about 1 million Bangladeshis
have been working in different capacities, the sources stated. But
Saudi Arabia is also not recruiting fresh workers from Bangladesh
and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The BAIRA chairman said the government should take an urgent
initiative to explore the labor market in Taiwan, Japan, Russia,
the Commonwealth of Independent States and European countries.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Predicts Huge Foreign Investment in Gas Blocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investments in
the exploration and development of Bangladesh's gas fields are
expected to reach 2 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000, Energy
Minister Nooruddin Khan said.
</P>
<P>
Khan told the official news agency BSS on Monday that the
investments are expected to come in when exploration work starts
in 20 gas blocks by 12 companies selected through competitive
bids.
</P>
<P>
The real income from the gas sector would largely depend upon
how competently "we can cash this resource," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Bangladesh has 20 trillion to 50 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas reserves and it is possible that more
would be found in further exploration.
</P>
<P>
So far, six foreign companies have already invested 150 million
dollars in the exploration of eight gas blocks. The government has
set December 15 as the deadline for completing negotiations and
signing of production sharing contracts for another 12 gas blocks.

<TEXT>

ROME, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The security of Europe should be
the responsibility of political organizations, such as the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), rather
than military treaties, said the former Italian Prime Minister
Giulio Andreotti here today.
</P>
<P>
Andreotti's comments, made at a meeting on issues concerning
the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), were regarded as critical of NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
Andreotti said the advantages OSCE provides occur from the fact
that the organization is comprised of more than 50 countries
formerly belonging to two opposing groups during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was sponsored by the Italian Center for Strategic

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The confrontation between
the government and judiciary intensified today as the National
Assembly adopted the amended contempt law, tending to give
protection to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a case of contempt
against him in the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The new law, titled Contempt of Court (Amendment) Act, 1997,
which was passed by a simple majority in the National Assembly
just after 01:00 a.m. today, came only hours after Prime Minister
Sharif declined to tender an apology in the Supreme Court in the
contempt of court case against him.
</P>
<P>
The law, which provides for an intra-court appeal before a
"larger bench consisting of all the remaining available judges of
the court within the country," is expected to go to the Senate in
the morning, where its passage is certain.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Pakistan Muslim League (N) led by Sharif and its
allied parties, which came to power in February this year, enjoys
a majority in both the National Assembly and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The law's passage is being seen as an attempt to preempt any
adverse Supreme Court judgment against Prime Minister Sharif and
others in a contempt of court case, which resulted from remarks
made by Sharif weeks ago during a press conference accusing Chief
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah of overstepping his authority and
undermining the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic aspect of the law is a provision that it
would cover the pending cases and shall be applicable even at the
stage of the show-cause notice proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
opposed the bill, saying this would lead to further division of
the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
She termed the bill mala fide and all the members of her
Pakistan People's Party voiced opposition to the passage of the
amendment to the act.
</P>
<P>
Some Senior Lawyers here are of the view that the amended law
is aimed at removing anomalies in the existing law.
</P>
<P>
An anomaly in the old law was that if contempt was committed
with respect to a high court, there was room for an intra-court
appeal, but if the contempt was against the Supreme Court then the
person did not have the right of appeal -- as Prime Minister
Sharif soon realized, they said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, in an unprecedented move, Sharif appeared personally
in the Supreme Court and denied the charges that he committed
contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in Pakistan's history that an elected
prime minister appeared before the apex court.
</P>
<P>
"I have neither committed contempt of court, nor do I intend to
do that," Sharif said in his written reply to the show-cause
notice issued by the Supreme Court in the contempt of court case.
</P>
<P>
The apex court had adjourned the hearing till Tuesday but
exempted Sharif from personal appearance at the court for one day
due to a short visit by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.

TIRANA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Faced with a serious problem of
high school students abusing narcotic drugs, authorities today
launched an anti-drug week in schools in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the week, many teachers and students
stressed the great harm of drug-abusing to students and expressed
their firm determination to fight drugs.
</P>
<P>
The drug problem in Albanian high schools became worse
recently. A survey of 1000 students in two high schools showed
about 30 percent were taking drugs, and 42 percent of these were
female.
</P>
<P>
The survey was made by the Albanian Youth Drug Abuse
Supervision Centre. The main drugs being taken are cocaine and
heroin, and there is reportedly a drug dealer network in Tirana.
</P>
<P>
The drug abuse issue has caused great concern in the
country. Many official and civilian organizations have taken part
in anti-drug activities.

<HEADLINE> OPEC to Discuss Oil Supply Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The oil ministers of the 11
Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will
discuss quotas on crude oil supplies when they meet from November
26 to December 1, in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
There was reported to be a growing consensus among OPEC members
that the quotas be raised as cold weather in the northern
hemisphere raised oil demand.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer, believed demand
for OPEC oil could be higher even than a 27.2 million barrels per
day figure it submitted to last week's meeting of OPEC planners,
compared with the present 25 million.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela sided with Saudi Arabia in forecasting a higher
demand for OPEC crude next year.
</P>
<P>
A few OPEC members were reported to have disregarded the
current quotas, bringing total OPEC oil output this October to
27.9 million barrels higher than the quotas set.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting coincides with the time the United
Nations-monitored oil-for-food deal comes up for renewal early
December.

BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China's automotive industry is
working with foreign manufacturers to improve the safety records
of Chinese-made vehicles, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A seminar on automotive safety technology, jointly organized by
Machinery Consultants International of the Ministry of the Machine
Building Industry (MMBI) and Volvo Car Corporation, was held
yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We need to learn from advanced auto manufacturers how better
to protect drivers and passengers," said Dong Yang, MMBI science
and technology division chief.
</P>
<P>
Leif Engstorm, chief representative of Volvo's China operations,
said: "As the pioneer of auto safety innovation, we feel it is our
responsibility to work closely with Chinese partners and safety
experts to exchange views and technology."
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Ministry of Public Security indicated
that there were 288,000 traffic accidents in 1996, with the death
toll hitting 73,700, a rise of 26 percent and 25 percent from the
figures in 1992. But the proportion of deaths per 10,000 vehicles
declined from 30.2 in 1992 to 25.6 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
As the automotive industry watchdog, MMBI has issued a set
of regulations governing automobile safety in the last couple of
years.
</P>
<P>
It has decided to build large scale simulation facilities to
carry out collision tests and promote the production of automobile
safety systems.

BANGKOK, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's trade deficit in
the first nine months of this year dropped by 43.44 percent to 193
billion baht (5.07 billion U.S. dollars) from the same period of
last year, according to the Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the period totaled 1.202 trillion baht (31.6 billion
dollars), up by 14.6 percent over a year earlier while imports
were 1.395 trillion baht (36.7 billion dollars), up by 0.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports in September alone were worth 177.37 billion
baht (4.6 billion dollars) while imports totaled 172.88 billion
baht (4.5 billion dollars), resulting in a surplus of 4.49 billion
baht (118 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The baht value of exports since July has looked impressive, but
once currency depreciation is taken into account, the totals are
growing at only single-digit rates compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
Today's local press reports quoted Somphol Kiatphaibul,
permanent secretary of the Commerce Ministry, as saying finance
stability and foreign-exchange rates must be looked at very
carefully when calculating export targets for next year.

<HEADLINE> Two Veteran Democrats Retiring from Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Veteran California
Representatives Vic Fazio and Ron Dellums announced plans to leave
Congress today.
</P>
<P>
Dellums, who became the Democrats' point man on the National
Security Committee, said he would resign his seat effective in
February.
</P>
<P>
Fazio, third-ranking member of the Democratic leadership who
has been mentioned as a potential White House chief of staff,
announced he would retire at the end of the term.
</P>
<P>
Both cited personal reasons for their decisions.
</P>
<P>
They brought to 14 the number of Democratic departures in
advance of next fall's elections, with others anticipated by many
party officials. Several of the departures involve districts that
are expected to be highly competitive at a time when the
Democratic Party wants to devote its resources to targeting
Republican seats rather than defending its own.
</P>
<P>
Democratic spokesman Dan Sallick said only six of the 14 are
likely to be at risk next year, far fewer than was the case at
this point in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
Republicans hold a 228-203 majority in the House, with one
independent and three vacancies. In addition, a Texas
Representative has announced plans to resign shortly.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, eight Republican legislators have announced plans to
retire from the House.
</P>
<P>
In Congress, the 55-year-old Fazio has played an insider's
role, using his seat on the Appropriations Committee over the
years to help his district as well as tending to the needs of his
colleagues in Congress.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the caucus, he has tried to serve as a bridge
between the liberal and more moderate members of caucus.
</P>
<P>
Dellums, 62, rose through seniority to become chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee in 1993, gaining respect from
lawmakers in both parties. He lost his chairmanship after one
term when Republicans gained a majority.
</P>
<P>
He argued persistently for less military spending and more
money for social programs.

COLOMBO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The majority of the unemployed

</P>
<P>
Female unemployment rate in 1996 was 18 percent of the total
work force whereas unemployed males accounted for 8 percent, they

</P>
<P>
Though female participation in development projects has been on

been increased at the same time, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
About three quarters of the unemployed are scattered in rural
areas and most of them are in the prime of life and highly
trainable, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Youths aged between 15 and 29 account for 79 percent of the
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka had an unemployment rate of 14 percent in 1996 and
this year's rate has been projected at 10 percent.

commercial and financial center, now owns intellectual property
rights for a group of new industrial products due to the effective
introduction of overseas technology.
</P>
<P>
To develop an international market and increase
competitiveness, the city has paid more attention to absorbing
advanced technology to raise the production levels in industries
such as automotive, communication facilities and household
appliances.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, Shanghai has established 29 cooperative
enterprises with famous transnational automobile groups. Now, the
Santana car has become a famous brand in domestic and overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the city has introduced 110,000 items of
technology during the 1991-1996 period, with an industrial output
of 37.8 billion yuan (4.72 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has approved 8,653 industrial co-operative items
during its Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1992-1996), involving
12.1 billion US dollars, an eight-fold increase over the figures
in the Seventh Five-Year Plan.

<HEADLINE> Freight Plane Given Certificate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A China manufactured
large freight aircraft was granted a certificate yesterday by
the Civil Aviation Administration of China after seven years'
testing, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Yun-8 F200 is an improved model of the Shaanxi Aircraft
Company's Yun-8 series. It is aimed at both the domestic and
international markets, said Gu Zhongchao, spokesperson with
Aviation Industries of China (AVIC), Shaanxi Aircraft Company's
parent company.
</P>
<P>
Developed by Shaanxi Aircraft Company on the basis of the
Yun-8 F100, the aircraft is a medium-range, medium-sized freight
plane with a similar cargo load to US C-100 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The new airplane has a complete gas-proof cargo hold with a
volume of 212 cubic meters, compared with 31 cubic meters in the
Yun-8 F100 model. The length has been increased to 15.7 meters from
13.5 meters.
</P>
<P>
Improved air-conditioning and cargo transport systems ensure
that the aircraft will be suitable for carrying fresh, live cargos
and for container transport.
</P>
<P>
The life span of the wings has been enhanced due to a change in
its oil-consumption pattern, made possible by the addition of an
obstructing net.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that air freight transport in China will grow
annually by 10.8 percent between 1998 and 2015.
</P>
<P>
After getting to know the issuance of the certificate, some
airline companies have said they are willing to buy or lease the
plane, according to Gu.

<P>
HAIKOU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan province
plans to further improve its communications industry, according to
Wang Houhong, deputy governor of the island province.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the province has built an advanced optical fiber
communications network round the island, which is able to convey
figures, pictures and voice simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The province will build a public information service center so
that the specialized information networks will be able to exchange
information with each other, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
All networks have been asked to remain open for the whole
society to share resources, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Hainan began developing its information industry in 1993. It
first designed and established a financial computer system for
accounting among five provincial banks, which were put into use
ahead of other provinces in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The province then set out to establish other specialized
information networks for police operations, tourism and medical
insurance.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Position on APEC's Planned Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will urge the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to focus on
strengthening the finance system when an APEC fund is established,
rather than on stabilizing currencies.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi revealed this stance on his first day in office at
the Commerce Ministry Monday. He will take part in the APEC
ministerial meeting in Vancouver, Canada, this weekend, according
to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said APEC's planned fund would complement the
International Monetary Fund by providing members with an
additional means of drawing up economic recovery plans.
</P>
<P>
But Thailand would suggest that the fund's role be for
strengthening the financial system and technical cooperation and
not stabilizing currencies as favored by some senior officials.
</P>
<P>
The Vancouver meeting is likely to focus on ways the APEC fund
could help financially-troubled Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said he would discuss the issue with Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai and state agencies to formulate an official position
on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Mexican President Confident About Financial Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Mexico is one of the
developing countries that survived the recent financial turmoil
because of its responsible economic policy, Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of a financial brokers
convention, Zedillo said it is of the utmost importance that the
country be protected from extreme financial moves in the world
markets.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he affirmed, it is even more important that the
current economic policy -- which was implemented some 15 years ago
-- be a responsible one. Only under that condition will the
nation enjoy economic growth along with social justice, he said.
</P>
<P>
He commented that world financial conditions leave little room
for prudence and responsibility, and sometimes they are not
present at all in the world monetary market.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo asserted that mature and objective management of the
Mexican financial market has given confidence to the economy over
the last few weeks despite the difficult situations that occur in
international markets.
</P>
<P>
The President said that Mexicans do not want another financial
crisis with high punitive costs for the average people, which
occurs as a result of a low domestic savings rate and excessive
dependence on foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that his government will continue to maintain a
healthy treasury, assure political stability, lower inflation and
interest rates, and achieve a wise level of indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said the stock market will continue to be a cornerstone
of the financial system in Mexico, so that the country can
continue to make full use of foreign capital and domestic
savings.

narcotic drug control project individually and collectively.
</P>
<P>
According to today's official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar, local medical officers are being trained on drug abuse
surveillance and substance abuse management.
</P>
<P>
The training also includes collecting data for demand reduction
as well as statistics on drug addicts to support law enforcement
bodies in demand reduction measures.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President
Carlos Menem today ruled out possible negative effects upon his
country's economy during the present international financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the award ceremony of the "National Prize For
Quality, 1997," the president said: "We are enduring firmly this
international crisis." He described it as a tremendous shake for
the entire world.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide economy, especially in southeast Asia, has been
affected by a currency crisis sparked by Thailand's devaluation of
the Baht on July 2.
</P>
<P>
Menem underlined the strength shown by Argentina against this
new financial turmoil and compared it with the "Tequila effect"
triggered by the 1994-95 peso crisis in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Unlike what had happened during the peso crisis, the country's
monetary reserves this time continued increasing instead of
plunging during the weeks following the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank reported that by October 23, deposits totaled
three billion U.S. dollars while the reserves had fallen one
billion dollars. The granting of credits remained stable.
</P>
<P>
However, during the "Tequila Effect" in early 1995, about eight
billion dollars were pulled out of banks and left the country, the
bank said.

<P>
BELGRADE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Deputies of the Bosnian Serb
parliament today urged the Republika Srpska (RS) President,
Biljana Plavsic, to dissolve the interior ministry established in
Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
The 45 deputies from the ruling Serbian Democratic party (SDS)
and Serbian Radical party (SRS), who met in Jahorina five days
ahead of early legislative polls, voted unanimously for a
declaration. It warned the RS president not to pursue foreign
policies, which were not approved by the Bosnian government and
the foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
The parliament's declaration also warned the president not to
do anything that violated the RS constitution and laws.
</P>
<P>
The statement condemned "inappropriate behaviour of foreign
armed forces that went beyond their mandate and seriously
endangered order and peace... bringing them almost to occupation
status."
</P>
<P>
Deputies also raised doubts over the legality of the
parliamentary elections to be held this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The November 22-23 polls were not "scheduled legally", but
imposed by the international community on the Serb entity in
Bosnia, their declaration said.
</P>
<P>
"International pressures were encouraged by the RS president
Biljana Plavsic," who dissolved the assembly on July 3 in an
anti-constitutional move, it said.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians also said they opposed any revision of the
Dayton peace accords and any modification of the SFOR mandate.
</P>
<P>
Deputies said they remained firm on reinforcing relations
between the RS and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), until
"final and definite unification." The RS and FRY signed a special
relations treaty in February.
</P>
<P>
In its session today, deputies refused to dissolve the
parliament, until the new mandates of those elected at the weekend
polls are verified.

CHANGSHA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province in central
China reported an outstanding harvest of rice, cotton, orange and
rapeseed this year.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Hunan harvested 28.7 billion
kilograms of grain, up 1.8 billion kg from last year, and cotton

The output of rapeseed, an important source of edible oil in
China, hit a record high with 1.04 million tons, 10.9 percent

In addition, apart from incessant efforts to spread scientific
farming techniques, the province is encouraging large-scale
production of agricultural products that integrate planting,

A recent survey conducted in Beijing shows that among the young

</P>
<P>
"Good neighborhoods are a tradition for the Chinese", said Zhou

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- After six months of operation,
an auto-parts manufacturing center with billions of yuan in
funding is going smoothly in east China's Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
"The project is a symbol that Shandong is to be made China's
largest base for auto-parts production," said Zhang Shulin, an
official from the Ministry of Machine-building Industry.
</P>
<P>
The project was funded by the First Automobile Works, Shandong
Automobile Industry Corp. and the Dawoo Group in the Republic of
Korea (ROK). Zhang said auto-parts production is a weak point in
China's automotive industry, and that cooperation between China
and ROK provides an opportunity for improvement.
</P>
<P>
To support the project cities such as Yantai, Qingdao and
Weihai have improved their water and electricity supplies, as well
as communications and other infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Engines and transmission equipment are being built especially
for the new designs such as the T-10 and J-100 vehicles built by
the Dawoo group.
</P>
<P>
Experts are confident that the project will benefit such
industries as iron and steel manufacturing, electronics and
petrochemicals in Shandong Province. (

<P>
WARSAW, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Studies by scientists in Poland
have again linked smoking with many serious ailments such as
cancer and heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Witold Zatonski, a professor at the Warsaw Cancer Research
Center, said that when smoking a cigarette, a person inhales about
4,000 poisonous chemicals; among that number, 40 are capable of
causing cancer.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals enter the blood supply through the respiratory and
circulatory system and affect many vital organs. The process is
repeated with each cigarette, he said.
</P>
<P>
The professor also warned against the danger of second-hand
inhalation of cigarette smoke. Non-smoking wives of smokers are
more likely to suffer from cancer than non-smoking wives of
non-smokers, he said.

PANAMA CITY, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) will carry out a training project in Panama
to help improve working skills of the country's low-income
workers, Panama's Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare said today.

Panama suffers a shortage of modern and skilled workers.
Without access to any professional training, would-be workers,
especially those from impoverished regions, are usually unskilled.

The ministry said the IDB-sponsored three-year project is
designed to change the situation.
</P>
<P>
The project will benefit workers from different sectors of the
national economy, including those who need to update their skills
and knowledge so as to reach senior executive posts as well as
technical management.
</P>
<P>
The workers-training program consists of specific packages
adjusted to the actual needs of Panamanian companies. The only
requirement for workers or employers is to go to the ministry and
ask for training, the ministry said.

HAVANA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Negligence of the driver was
the cause of a bus crash that killed 57 people on November 6 in

conclusion published here today.
</P>
<P>
The bus crashed in a collision against a passenger train of the

The governmental commissions that carried out the investigation
found out that the rail was in good conditions, and that the
traffic signs worked well and visibility on an area of 300 meters
from the site of the crash was also good enough.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Residents of China's
Heilongjiang Province on the Sino-Russian border traded a record
of 250 million U.S. dollars in goods with their Russian
counterparts in the first 10 months of this year, an increase of
50 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang officials attributed the growth in border trade to
the flexible nature of the trade and to preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
Compared with traditional border trade, such transactions are
characterized by small quantity, fine quality and expedited
settlement.
</P>
<P>
To encourage trade, the Chinese government early last year
introduced tariff exemptions for transactions of less than 1,000
yuan (120.48 U.S. dollars) per person per day.
</P>
<P>
More staff members have been added in commodity inspection and
market and technical supervision to ensure trade quality.
</P>
<P>
The northernmost Heilongjiang Province has a border with Russia
of more than 3,045 kilometers, along which more than 20 ports of
entry have been opened.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Tells Iraq to Follow U.N. Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has called on Iraq
to abide by the U.N. Security Council's resolutions issued
following the Gulf War in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"Without complying with the resolutions, Iraq will always face
the same situation from time to time," Foreign Minister Ali Alatas
said here last night.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Indonesia has expressed its deep concern over
the worsening crisis between Iraq and the United States, offering
the hope that the crisis would not explode into a new war.
</P>
<P>
"As I stated before, Indonesia is very concerned about the
worsening situation. Indonesia still hopes there remain ways to
solve the problems through diplomatic approaches," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been bracing for possible U.S. military action
following its expulsion last Thursday of Americans working for the
U.N. special commission overseeing the disarming of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said late Sunday that his
country is not looking for confrontation with the United States
and wants a solution with the U.N. Security Council "through
dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the U.N. sanctions against Iraq have so far caused
suffering for innocent people including children, women and the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
"So Indonesia and other countries hope that the long-standing
conflicts can be solved as soon as possible through dialogue among
the interested parties," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Settle Dispute With Iraq Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
today that he intended to settle the dispute with Iraq peacefully
but did not rule out any options in a diplomatic endeavor backed
by military action.
</P>
<P>
"I am trying to settle this issue peacefully. But our
diplomatic efforts must be backed by our strong military
capabilities. We cannot rule out any options," he told a meeting
at a Cessna plane factory in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not elaborate how to end the dispute, which began
last month when the U.N. Security Council approved a U.S.-British
bill to threaten new sanctions by restricting Iraqi officials from
traveling abroad, and Iraq decided to expel American inspectors in
the U.N. Special Commission, alleging they were gathering
intelligence in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz Sunday proposed to end
the dispute with the United States, saying that Baghdad would
readmit American weapons inspectors if the U.N. Security Council
agreed to change the makeup of the inspection teams, with equal
representation given to each permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
But the United States flatly rejected the idea, saying Iraq had
no right to determine the composition of the U.N. weapons
inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States and Britain have discussed with
France and Russia a proposal to make "modest adjustments" to
improve the oil-for-food program for Iraq, providing Baghdad
cooperated with U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq said the deal was a "non-starter" in solving the
current dispute. It emphasized those diplomats should instead
address how sanctions, imposed in 1991, would be eased or lifted.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the inadequate inspection system for Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons programs would be as grave a
threat to world peace as the nuclear threat in the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
"What they (the inspectors) are doing matters. It matters to
you, to your children and to the future," he said.
