<HEADLINE> Pak Achieves Record Rice Production in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan registered a record
rice production of 4.7 million tons during 1998-99 fiscal year
(July 1-June 30) which was 300,000 tons more than that of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Food and Agriculture Ministry said Thursday
that 2.2 million tons rice was sufficient to meet domestic needs
and 2.5 million tons of surplus rice could be exported to add to
the foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
During 1997-98, Pakistan's rice production stood at 4.43
million tons and more than two million tons of surplus rice was
exported that year earning a total of 554 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the current year, Pakistan exported
852,860 tons worth of 203.7 million dollars. Rice export is
expected to increase by the end of the current financial year as
rice production was more than the previous year and the surplus
could be exported, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
They said that a significant increase had been registered in
the production of wheat, cotton, rice and sugarcane during the
current fiscal year. Pakistan has started exporting of sugar and
demand for Pakistani cotton abroad was growing.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Pakistan would bring to an end the import of
wheat within two years and wheat produced within the country would
be sufficient to meet the domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
They said that to achieve this objective, agriculture was being
organized on modern lines and availability of tractors, fertilizer
and seeds was being facilitated on soft terms.

<HEADLINE> France Calls on Guinea Bissau To Respect Cease fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday called on the two
groups in conflict in Guinea Bissau to respect the terms of the
Abuja cease-fire agreement and help establish a peacekeeping force
from the Western African Economic Community (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
"We urge the signing parties to respect the cease-fire and do
everything possible to apply the terms of the Abuja agreement,
which was signed on November 1, in particular that section
establishing an interposing force of ECOMOG," said French Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French President Jacques Chirac, who is on a visit
to Portugal, denied Thursday that France is involved in the
conflict of the tiny West African country.
</P>
<P>
"France, I say it clearly and officially, has not intervened at
any moment and in any way in this conflict," said Chirac at a
press conference in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
Guinea Bissau's Vice-Prime Minister Francisco Fadul and the
rebels loyal to General Ansumane Mane have accused the French navy
of supporting the forces loyal to President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
</P>
<P>
The French navy ship "Siroco," which is carrying 300 ECOMOG
forces, is waiting for a pause in the fighting to land the
peacekeeping soldiers.

<HEADLINE> France, Britain May Send 25,000 to 30,000 Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- France and Britain are working on
a plan to send a peace-keeping force of 25,000 to 30,000 troops to
Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo, said French Defense Minister
Alain Richard on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Richard said the two countries are preparing supplementary
studies to those of NATO on establishing a peace-keeping force in
Kosovo, once an agreement is reached between the country's warring
factions in Rambouillet, France. Peace talks between the sides
are due to start Saturday outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
``The Europeans will exert a constructive influence and
manifest a will to take responsibility'' to solve this problem, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The force will consist of five brigades and the chief of staff
of this force could be that of the Allied Rapid Reaction Force of
NATO, which is based in Germany and commanded by the British, he
said.
</P>
<P>
France will take part at the brigade level with about 5,000 men
and will join the chief of staff, he added.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said that French troops already based in
Macedonia will be the core of the French brigade and will serve as
a forerunner of the peace-keeping force.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao Thursday evening ended his official visit to South Africa
and left Johannesburg for home, thus winding up his four-nation
African tour.
</P>
<P>
South African officials from the Foreign Ministry, Chinese
Ambassador Wang Xuexian, as well as the staff of the Chinese
embassy and representatives of the Chinese businesses in South
Africa saw the Chinese leader off at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Hu visited the Chinese embassy in Pretoria
and met its staff as well as representatives of the Chinese
businesses.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in South Africa, Hu held talks with his South
African counterpart Thabo Mbeki and met President Nelson Mandela
and National Assembly Speaker Frene Ginwala.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the two countries signed agreements on
economic, trade and technological cooperation, the establishment
of a joint commission on economy and trade, and civil air
transport.
</P>
<P>
A letter of intent on the establishment of a consultation
mechanism between the two foreign ministries was also signed.

<P>
Hu started his African tour on January 23. Before his trip to
South Africa, he visited Madagascar, Ghana, and Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Second Attempt to Unfold Space Mirror Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian cosmonauts failed in
their second attempt Thursday to unfold a mirror on board the Mir
station intended to beam reflected sunlight from space to earth.
</P>
<P>
The mirror, made of thin film, started rotating at a command
from Mission Control, but stopped shortly after, Itar-Tass
reported.
</P>
<P>
Experts are analyzing the situation but there might not be a
third attempt to unfold the 25-meter-diameter mirror, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The project, dubbed Znamya (Banner), was intended to eventually
set up huge solar reflectors in stationary orbit to generate light
and heat for the cities of Russia's Arctic north where darkness
lasts for months at a time.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Troops to Be Deployed in G. Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A group of the west African
peace-keeping force ECOMOG waiting on a French navy ship off
Bissau will immediately be deployed in the capital, reports
reaching here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The latest cease-fire brokered by a Togolese ministerial
delegation remained in force on Thursday morning, Artur Magelhaes,
Charge d'Affaires of former colonial power Portugal, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the late night fighting in Bissau Wednesday was
not a significant breach of the peace agreement signed by
President Joao Bernardo Vieira and rebel leader General Ansumane
Mane.
</P>
<P>
The latest cease-fire was agreed only hours after foreign and
defense ministers from Togo arrived in Bissau at mid day of
Wednesday for mediation between the two warring parties on behalf
of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
Gunfire stopped just before midnight Wednesday, said witnesses
in the capital, which has been rocked by heavy shellings for the
past four days.
</P>
<P>
At least 80 people have been killed and 300 wounded in the
capital since the fighting broke out at the weekend, according to
hospital officials.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops are to be deployed in the tiny west African
country under a peace accord signed by the two parties last
November in Nigerian capital Abuja, to replace soldiers sent by
Senegal and Guinea backing President Vieira.
</P>
<P>
Troops loyal to the president control only the center of
capital Bissau while the main airport north of Bissau and the rest
of the country are mostly held by the rebels under the command of
Mane.
</P>
<P>
The conflict between the two parties in Guinea Bissau broke out
last June when President Vieira sacked Mane for alleged arms
smuggling to separatists in southern Senegal.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Remains Model for Asia, Britain Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- British government said on
Thursday that Hong Kong remains "a model of good human rights
practice in Asia" a year and a half after the handover of
sovereignty from Britain to China.
</P>
<P>
In the latest six-monthly report on Hong Kong, the British
government said the provisions of a joint Sino-British declaration
on how Hong Kong would be run for 50 years after Britain ended its
rule at the end of June 1997 were being carefully observed "in all
important respects."
</P>
<P>
"Eighteen months after the handover, our judgment remains that
'One Country, Two Systems' is working well, and that the Joint
Declaration is being properly upheld," Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said in a foreword.
</P>
<P>
"Respect for human rights and the rule of law remain strong
characteristics of the Hong Kong system. The HKSAR (Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region) government continue to act with
autonomy in key areas such as the economy," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"Our basic assessment across the range of issues is positive.
We believe that Hong Kong remains a model of good human rights
practice in Asia. We naturally welcome commitments from the HKSAR
government to uphold this," the report added.

<HEADLINE> New Orders to Factories Rise in December, but 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Commerce Department
said Thursday that although new orders to factories rebounded in
December, the gain did not prevent 1998 from becoming the weakest
year for manufacturing since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Orders rose 2.3 percent in December to a seasonally adjusted
343.5 billion dollars, the biggest increase in 13 months.
</P>
<P>
But,the Department said, orders for all of 1998 -- 4.03
trillion dollars -- were just 2.1 percent higher than the year
before. That compared with a healthy 5.4 percent gain in 1997 and
was the weakest year since orders posted a 2.3 percent decline
seven years earlier.
</P>
<P>
The weakness was particularly pronounced at U.S. blast furnaces
and steel mills, which are competing with cheap steel imported
from Russia, Brazil and Korea. Their orders fell 12.5 percent, the
biggest decline in at least 15 years. And the increase for
aircraft was anemic, a 0.2 percent gain over 1997.
</P>
<P>
Both figures reflect the world economic crisis that began in
Asia, and then struck Russia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
However, on the bright side, orders for computers and office
equipment surged 19.4 percent, the biggest gain in 14 years. And
orders for communications equipment jumped 12.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods surged 3.6 percent while orders for
nondurable goods rose just 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The overall increase for orders in December suggests the
economy carried considerable momentum as it moved into 1999.

<HEADLINE> WIPO Chief Inaugurates Industry Advisory Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Director General of the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Dr Kamil Idris opened
the first meeting of the newly-established Industry Advisory
Commission (IAC) here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural meeting of the IAC marked "a historic shift in
the policy of this organization and in the vision which we would
like to have for this universal body", said Idris.
</P>
<P>
The IAC was established as part of the WIPO chief's efforts to
take into consideration the broadest range of opinions in the
context of policy-making and medium-term planning.
</P>
<P>
Idris believed that the IAC would be an important forum for
governments, the private sector and WIPO, saying that without this
dialogue it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the WIPO to
continue to be relevant to industry, which are the main users of
the WIPO's services.
</P>
<P>
The IAC meeting has brought together some 20 senior
representatives of industry. During the two-day meeting,
participants will discuss the implications for intellectual
property of rapid changes in the industries.
</P>
<P>
The IAC aims to identify and review issues that may need to be
dealt with by the WIPO from the specific perspective of industry
and the market sector.

<HEADLINE> UK Farmers Criticize Beef-on-bone Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- British Farm Unions reacted
angrily on Thursday to an announcement by farm minister Nick Brown
that the ban on sales of beef on the bone would stay for another
six months.
</P>
<P>
"To the ordinary man in the street, it must seem nonsensical
that the beef on the bone ban should remain in place," said Nick
Gill, president of the National Farmers Union.
</P>
<P>
He accused the government of having taken an "ultra, ultra
precautionary approach" in keeping the ban in place because of a
minuscule chance that someone eating in-bone beef could catch the
brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
"Consumer safety must be the priority of the government, but
continuing the ban appears to us to be totally disproportionate,"
said George Lyon, president of the Scottish Farmers Union.
</P>
<P>
But the Meat and Livestock Commission sympathised with Brown's
argument that the reputation of British beef must be a factor in
the decision.
</P>
<P>
"The risk is vanishingly small, but a huge amount of time and
effort has been spent restoring confidence in British beef, and we
would not want to see that jeopardised," Director General Colin
Maclean was quoted by Reuters as saying.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Praises Egypt in Promoting Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Prime Minister Kim
Chong-Pil Thursday spoke highly of the efforts by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak to help promote peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Mubarak, Kim praised
Mubarak as a "strong and influential" statesman who is keen on
maintaining regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the meeting, Mubarak apprised him of the
developments in the Mideast situation, especially the peace talks
between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979, considered a key mediator in the Mideast peace
process. It especially supports the Palestinians' cause of
restoring their national rights.
</P>
<P>
Kim briefed Mubarak on the developments in the ties between
South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK). He also expressed gratitude for Mubarak's message to
Pyongyang, which urged the DPRK to hold direct dialog with South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
Egypt maintains traditionally good relations with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Kim said he also delivered an invitation from South Korean
President Kim Dae-Joon to Mubarak to visit Seoul, adding the
Egyptian leader has accepted the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to South Korea's investment in Egypt, Kim said a
large team of businessmen is accompanying him to seek economic and
technical cooperation with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which established diplomatic relations with Egypt
in 1995, has invested 160 million U.S. dollars in oil, auto and
electronic industries, banking and construction in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Asian country has expressed readiness to invest more in
Egypt's national projects, including the land-reclamation Toshka
project in the south to channel Nile water to irrigate a swatch of
desert.

<HEADLINE> 1,248 Zimbabweans Die of Malaria Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,248 people died of
malaria in Zimbabwe out of 872,872 cases reported last year, the
Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and Child Welfare said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the ministry Bright Mpofu said that most of the
cases were reported from February to May -- the peak of the
country's wet season.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said more than 23 million Zimbabwean Dollars
(about 1.4 million U.S. Dollars) were spent during the year in
purchasing spraying equipment for vector control.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is transmitted by the mosquito parasite which breeds in
wet and humid conditions.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that some cases of drug-resistant malaria
had been reported, Mpofu said that the incidence was still at

<HEADLINE> Serbia Decides to Attend Peace Talks on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A diplomat from the
Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations told Xinhua on Thursday
that the Serbian Parliament has decided to send a delegation to
the peace talks on the Serbian province of Kosovo, scheduled for
Saturday in France.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, reached by Xinhua on the phone, said, "the
Serbian decision is true."
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, to be held outside Paris, is part of the
January 29 decision by the six-nation Contact Group, in charge of
the Balkan diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Government of Yugoslavia has asked the Serbian
Republic to decide whether to send the delegation. Serbian
deputies voted 227 to three to attend the peace talks, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Government has appealed for a peaceful settlement
of the Kosovo problem, and the respect of the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Serbia and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo, the southern Serbian province,
about 11 months ago after ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90
percent of the province's population of 2 million, resorted to
force for independence.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade has called on the U.N. Security Council to convene an
emergency session on Kosovo to prevent NATO's armed aggression of
the Balkan country, but the Council is scheduled to have the
meeting later this week.
</P>
<P>
NATO, again without the authorization of the Security Council,
has decided to launch military strikes against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, which has been seen here as a violation of
the U.N. Charter and norms of international law.

<HEADLINE> Last IRA Prisoner on British Mainland Freed on Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- An IRA man jailed for conspiracy
to cause explosions in London was freed on Thursday on appeal
because of what a judge called "highly unusual circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Mullen, the last Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoner
held on the British mainland, was jailed for 30 years in 1990 for
plotting an IRA bombing campaign in their guerrilla struggle to
end British rule over Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Lord Justice Rose said there was "no challenge to the propriety
of the trial" but the conviction was quashed because of the
"unlawful manner" of Mullen's deportation from Zimbabwe to face
charges.
</P>
<P>
He said Mullen had been deported from Zimbabwe not on the
direction of the chief immigration officer of Zimbabwe as should
have been the case but on a direction either from Britain or the
Zimbabwe secret service.

<HEADLINE> Non-Aligned Countries Put Forward Four Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Non-Aligned
Countries made four proposals here Thursday at a plenary session
of the Conference on Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The proposals of the group, also known as the Group of 21,
include:
</P>
<P>
-- To establish an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament;
</P>
<P>
-- To re-establish an ad hoc committee to negotiate for a
non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and
effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile
material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices;
</P>
<P>
-- To establish an ad hoc committee on prevention of an arms
race in outer space and effective international arrangements to
assure non-nuclear weapon states against the use or threat of use
of nuclear weapons be re-established;
</P>
<P>
-- To propose for the conference to appoint special
coordinators to deal with the issues of expansion of membership
and the conference's improved and effective functioning.
</P>
<P>
Current President of the conference, Ambassador Robert Grey of
the United States, said there were many common elements between
his proposal for a program of work for the conference and the one
offered by the Group of 21, although there were some differences
as well.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the conference could agree on a pragmatic program and
initiate work on common grounds. He also hoped that all members
would show their flexibility and that the conference could agree
on its program of work when it meets again in full session on
February 11, 1999.

<HEADLINE> UK Basic Rates Fall Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON February 4 (Xinhua) - The Bank of England surprised
economic observers here Thursday with an unexpectedly large
half-point cut in interet rates.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) reacted
to the deepening economic slowdown by reducing base rates from 6
percent to 5.5 percent - the fifth monthly cut in succession.
</P>
<P>
The latest GDP figures showed the UK economy was slowing
sharply. It grew by just 0.2 percent in the last quarter of 1998,
the lowest rise in six years.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts even predict that the UK GDP will probably slide
into negative growth this year.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector has been in recession for sometime.
Consumer spending meanwhile remains quite weak, retail sales
falling a seasonally adjusted 0.9 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The MPC said it had taken account of the prospects for
international activity and prices, domestic costs and consumer
demand.
</P>
<P>
It also said the latest projections implied a cut was needed to
keep inflation on path for the target of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The move was largely welcomed by employers and unions, who had
been pressing for a reduction of at least 0.5 percent in the cost
of borrowing to protect jobs and prevent the economy sliding into
recession.
</P>
<P>
Kate Barker, chief economic adviser at the Confederation of
British Industry, said the move was "good news for industry at a
time when trading is difficult in many sectors".
</P>
<P>
Ian Peters, Deputy Director-General of the British Chambers of
Commerce said business would "cheer this decision as a bold move
and as evidence that the Bank is listening effectively".

UNITED NATIONS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has designated Miles Stoby, assistant
secretary-general, as coordinator for preparations for the United
Nations Millennium Assembly, Fred Eckhard, U.N. spokesman, said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard told a press conference that Stoby;s appointment took
effect on January 11.
</P>
<P>
Annan has indicated his intention to convene a series of
regional hearings as well as related events in preparation for his
reports to the Millennium Assembly, to be held in September 2000.
</P>
<P>
Stoby will work closely with and report to U.N. Deputy

</P>
<P>
Stoby has most recently been serving as executive director of
the United Nations Fund for International Partnership.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> S. African Police Offer Reward for Korean's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South African police
Thursday offered a reward of 250,000 Rand (42,000 U.S. Dollars)
for information leading to the arrest of the killer(s) of Daewoo
South Africa's President Yong Koo Kwon.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were at this stage looking for a single
suspect, who was seen running from the murder scene.
</P>
<P>
Kwon, 49, was shot in the head on Tuesday night when he arrived
at a guest house in Sandton, Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The shot was fired through the driver's side window of his car
while he was waiting for the remote-controlled gate to open.
</P>
<P>
The perpetrator fled without taking the car or any of Kwon's
possessions, fuelling speculation that he might have been
assassinated.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted a local police officer,
Fanie van der Watt, as saying that preliminary investigations
indicated that the killing was more likely the result of a
hijacking gone wrong than an assassination.
</P>
<P>
He said evidence collected at the scene, as well as evidence
from an eyewitness, pointed to a failed hijacking attempt.
</P>
<P>
Van der Watt, who took over the investigation Thursday, said
that an eyewitness saw a single suspect running from the scene.
</P>
<P>
"We will investigate all possibilities, but from the
information we have at this stage we feel that this was a
hijacking and not an assassination."
</P>
<P>
"Kwon's car was automatic. The moment he was shot the car
started moving forward into the yard automatically. The suspect
might have panicked and run."
</P>
<P>
Deputy area commissioner for northeastern Johannesburg, Perumal
Naidoo, said Wednesday that he believed Kwon was assassinated.
The commissioner said that a hijacker would not have left Kwon
sitting at his car's steering wheel with all his possessions still
on him.

<HEADLINE> Syria Voices Full Support for Lebanon's New Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Bashra Assad, the son of and
heir to Syrian President Hafez Assad has declared unlimited
support for Lebanon's new regime under President Emile Lahoud,
</P>
<P>
The junior Assad made the declaration in an interview with the
Lebanese newspaper Al Kifah Al Arabi after a brief visit to the
country on Wednesday, the Orient radio reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bashra, whose country has 35,000 troops in Lebanon and
is a main power broker, paid warm tribute to the nationalist
spirit with which Lahoud restructured the Lebanese army after
the 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese should carefully study this accomplishment and
copy it in all other institutions of the state," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud, former army commander, was chosen by the then
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi as Lebanon's head of state last
October and was sworn in a month later.
</P>
<P>
During his nine-year term as the army commander, the 15,000
demoralized troops plagued by sectarian dissension were
transformed into a cohesive fighting machine of 65,000.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese people were so impressed by this feat that
they were unanimously in favor of Lahoud for president. The
people have spoken and I do not think that it is in
anyone's interest to speak otherwise," Bashra said.
</P>
<P>
Bashra's remarks have been seen apparently a heavy blow on the
country's leading opposition figure Druze overlord Walid Jumblat
who has accused Lahoud of trying to militarize the current regime.
</P>
<P>
Bashra also voiced unflinching support for Lebanon's resistance
movement fighting to dislodge Israel from a border enclave it
occupied in south Lebanon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
He denied that Syria is using the resistance as a
pressure card to seek an Israeli withdrawal from Golan Heights
Israel captured from his country in the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
"The description actually dwarfs the resistance. The resistance
is not a card in anyone's hand," Bashra said.

<HEADLINE> Six CIS Countries to Extend Collective Security Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of Russia,
Belarus, Armenia, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan confirmed
the intentions of their countries to extend their participation in
the CIS Collective Security Treaty, Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Georgia expressed its readiness to prolong its participation
after a certain adaptation of the treaty," Interfax quoted Ivanov
as saying after a meeting of foreign ministers of the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which was signed in Tashkent on May 15, 1992, by
Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, is due to expire in
April this year. Belarus, Azerbaijan and Georgia joined the pact
later.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which came into effect in 1994 when it was ratified
by all the signatory countries, stipulates that the member states
may withdraw from it upon the expiration of a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
In a blow to CIS integration, Uzbekistan said Wednesday that it
would terminate its membership in the CIS Collective Security
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Tashkent does not consider expedient further membership in the
regional security alliance, Interfax quoted a high-ranking source
in the Uzbek Foreign Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The Collective Security Treaty, in its current form, does not
meet present-day requirements, and does not perform its
functions," the source said.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal also represents a setback for Russia's efforts
to strengthen its role in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Tashkent opposes Russia's military activity in individual CIS
countries," Interfax quoted the source as saying.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Russian Defense Ministry expressed regret for
the move but rejected the assertion that Moscow has stepped up
military activity in CIS countries.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is pursuing a restrained policy and is curbing military
activity, particularly in CIS countries and in neighboring
regions," said Leonid Ivashov, head of the ministry's Department
for International Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He noted at the same time that "individual members of the CIS
are increasing the number of military exercises with the
participation of NATO units, particularly near the Russian
borders," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's session, the Uzbek foreign minister was
silent on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Uzbek foreign minister confirmed his
country's intention to withdraw from the treaty, Ivanov said: "The
Uzbek side said nothing."
</P>
<P>
He said participants approved a draft protocol on the
prolongation of the treaty which will be discussed by interested
CIS leaders during the next summit scheduled for February 26.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the summit will deal with "reforming the CIS and
activating the cooperation of Commonwealth countries, primarily in
the economic sphere."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Accuses Eritrea of  Shelling at Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Office of Ethiopian
Government Spokesperson Selome Taddesse announced that Eritrean
forces began continuous shelling from their posts at Geamahlo on
the Badme-Sheraro front beginning 6 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Office said on Tuesday at 4 p.m., the
Eritrean forces carried out heavy shelling for 45 minutes at the
Zalambessa front.
</P>
<P>
"The Eritrean regime has embarked on this new round of shelling
within days of President Isaias Afwerki's January 31 statement in
which he insisted that 'Eritrea will never fire the first
bullet,'" the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that "this week's shelling comes as
United Nations Special Envoy for Africa, Mohamed Sahnoun, is in
the region to persuade Eritrea to accept the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) peace proposals."
</P>
<P>
The statement recalled that "just prior to the OAU High Level
Delegation meeting in Ouagadougou in December 1998, Eritrea
initiated shelling around Sheraro and Adigrat, followed later by
attacks in Central Tigrai and Adi Gushu. "
</P>
<P>
The statement also said Eritrean forces shelled the Biara
locality of Badme-Sheraro on January 23, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia urges the international community to see Eritrea's
actions for what they are and apply more tangible pressure to the
government in Asmara so that there may be a peaceful resolution to
the conflict," the statement concluded.
</P>
<P>
The OAU and the United Nations have stepped up their diplomatic
efforts to resolve the nine month-border dispute between Ethiopia
and Eritrea in recent weeks amid fears the two sides are again on
the verge of war.
</P>
<P>
OAU Spokesman Ibrahim Dagash said on Tuesday that the OAU was
awaiting response from Eritrea to the reply the OAU had made to a
set of questions Asmara raised on proposals for resolving the
border dispute.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Special Envoy for Africa sahnoun flied to Asmara on
Tuesday and is expected to arrive here Thursday in a new effort to
stave off war between the two neighbors over their disputed
border.

<HEADLINE> Another Plane Crashes in Angola: Authorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- An Antonov-26 transport plane
crashed Thursday when it tried a forced landing in Luzamba Airport
in eastern Lunda-Norte Province, a source with the Angolan Civil
Aviation Bureau said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The source said that 15 passengers of the 24 people including
four Russian crew members aboard the plane were wounded and they
had been sent to hospitals in capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
This is the second air tragedy following the crash of an
Antonov-12 plane in Cazenga, the most densely-populated area in
the capital early Tuesday morning. Thirty people were killed in
the first crash and 28 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the consecutive crashes occurred
because the planes the Angolan government leased from the former
Soviet Union states were discarded before they were used in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
According to the data released by the Angolan Civil Aviation
Bureau, the plane which crashed Tuesday was made in Ukraine in
January 1963 and from January 1998 up to this month, 10 Antonov-12
planes crashed in the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Says Its Floriculture With Bright Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Investment
Authority said on Thursday that Ethiopian floriculture has a
bright future because of the country's ideal agro-economic
potential to produce flowers in good quality and quantity.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, addressing a one-day
meeting on opportunities for floriculture in Ethiopia, Tadesse
Haile, General Manager of the Authority, said Ethiopia's proximity
to Europe and Middle East countries enables it to have access to
market.
</P>
<P>
Tadesse said the involvement of the private sector in the
development of floriculture is encouraging, although it is not up
to expectations.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ethiopian government has already established an
export promotion agency under the Office of the Prime Minister to
encourage and promote export.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian Investment Authority, only six
projects with an aggregate capital of over 14.5 million U.S.
Dollars have been established in floriculture and flower accounted
to only 0.02 percent of Ethiopia's total commodity export in
1997/98.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting aims to sensitize the business community to
agro- economic and marketing potential of floriculture in
Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Accession Talks to Proceed as Planned: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides said Thursday that he believes Cyprus'
accession talks with the European Union (EU) will proceed as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Larnaca airport on his return from a tour to
Brussels and Athens, Kasoulides described his meeting with EU
Commissioner for External Relations Hans Van den Broek as very
good and productive.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed about the accession process and developments in
the Cyprus issue in relation to this process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his talks in Athens, Kasoulides said he had a warm
exchange of views with his Greek counterpart Theodoros Pangalos on
recent developments in Cyprus and the EU accession process.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said discussions from now on will focus on how to
proceed and how to make the most of the present possibilities for
the benefit of the Cyprus issue and the accession process.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990 and started accession
talks with EU in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Brussels, where NATO's headquarters is
based, Kasoulides reiterated Cyprus' request of a NATO
international force to station on the island.
</P>
<P>
"This (NATO) force could be deployed on the island even before
a solution to the Cyprus issue is reached. It should have a U.N.
Security Council mandate and the consent of Turkey," Kasoulides
said.
</P>
<P>
With the deployment of the NATO troops, Turkey and Greece can
withdraw their troops from the island in accordance with the 1960
Agreement of Guarantees, and Cyprus' National Guard can be
disbanded.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bicommunal federation formula, but the peace talks
between the two sides broke down in 1997.

After the mid-December U.S.-British bombardment of Iraq, Iraq
declared it will not recognize the no-fly zones imposed by the
U.S.-led western allies in northern and southern Iraq following
the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in
the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from alleged
Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched four nights of air strikes on
Iraq on December 16-19 last year to punish it for what Washington
claimed its failure not to fully cooperate with the U.N. weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors were authorized by the U.N. to oversee Iraq's
disarmament of weapons of mass destruction in accordance with
resolutions adopted after the Gulf War, sparked by Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Iraqi air defense force and U.S.- British
warplanes patrolling the zones have become commonplace since
the raids last December.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Saddam ordered to reward any Iraqi who can
shoot down U.S. or British warplanes violating Iraqi airspace.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Complained Over Entry of Intelligence Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Thursday
complained to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that a senior
United States official entered Iraqi territory form Turkey last
month without permission.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. chief, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahaf said on January 13, 1999, "a certain Elizabeth
Jones, an aide to the Untied States assistant secretary of state
for Near Eastern affairs, entered northern Iraq through Turkish
territory at the head of a delegation from the United States and
British intelligence agencies and accompanied by a number of
officials from the Turkish ministry of foreign affairs."
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf said the entry of Jones and her delegation into Iraqi
territory, without the approval of the Iraqi authorities, was "an
egregious violation of Iraq's sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.N. chief to "intervene directly with the
governments of these states and to urged them to desist from
their persistent interference in the internal affairs of Iraq and
to honor the Charter of the United Nations," which affirmed
respect for the sovereignty, political independence and
territorial integrity of U.N. member states.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A memorial garden was launched
here Thursday at the Headquarters of the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP), in remembrance of those who lost their
lives in the bomb blasts in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam on August 7,
1998.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and UNEP Director-General
Klaus Toepfer inaugurated the ceremony. They also unveiled a
plaque on a rock in the center of the garden.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, President Moi said, "the garden will remind us
of the senseless destruction of life that takes place in the world
around us as a result of the irresponsible activities of a few
people who have lost the meaning of the sanctity of human life."
</P>
<P>
"It will also serve as a symbol for us to call for peace in the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer said at the ceremony that "this memorial garden is
first and foremost, for all of us, a daily reminder of the need to
commit ourselves to the peaceful solution of all kinds of
conflicts not only here in Kenya but all parts of the world."
</P>
<P>
The garden is designed in the shape of the U.N. logo within
which a variety of shrubs, trees and grass forms the continents of
the world. With its 257 tea and coffee plants, the garden also

<HEADLINE> EU Links Further Palestinian Aid to Peace Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union plans to make
further aid to the Palestinians dependent on progress of the Middle
East Peace process, the bloc's rotating president Germany said
Thursday at the start of a Palestinian donor conference.
</P>
<P>
Both Palestinians and Israelis had to fully comply with the Wye
peace accord, said German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer at the
Frankfurt conference attended by some 50 states and international
organisations and representatives from the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the European Union (EU) expected absolute
transparency in the Palestinian Authority's finance and budget
affairs as well as better conditions for private investment.
</P>
<P>
Israel, he said, had to guarantee the already approved tax
revenue transfer to the Palestinians and boost transport links
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The international donor states have approved 3.65 billion
dollars for the Palestinian Authority since 1993 of which 2.5
billion dollars has been disbursed, according to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the single biggest donor state and has made
available 1.2 billion marks (714 million U.S. dollars) in part
through its EU donations, said the German Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said developments in the Palestinian region - which has
been under Israeli occupation since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War -
were mixed.
</P>
<P>
Living standards had actually declined over the past five years
despite international aid, he said, adding, however, that schools
and water supply had been improved through EU help.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference is expected to agree a framework for
further aid to the the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian
President Yassir Arafat was due to attend the conference Friday
before travelling to Bonn for further talks with Fischer and other
German leaders.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank Helped Finance Building of Auschwitz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Deutsche Bank helped finance
the building of the Nazi concentration camp of Auschwitz in which
more than one million inmates, mostly Jews, were killed, a
Deutsche Bank historian said in Frankfurt on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bank's own historical institute had established the facts
from a study of archive material of Germany's largest bank
relating to World War Two.
</P>
<P>
The bank's branch in the Kattowitz - now Katowice - in Upper
Silesia, had provided credits to finance construction work at the
camp in then-German-occupied Poland.
</P>
<P>
The construction work was on the site of the IG Farben concern
at Auschwitz (now Oswiecim) and in the camp of the Nazi Waffen SS.
</P>
<P>
The extended Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp held about
1.3 million inmates between 1940 and 1945. Some 1.1 million of
them were either put to death or died of the appalling hardship
and disease.
</P>
<P>
The concentration camp had a total area of 40 square kilometres
with an surrounding isolation area of five kilometres. It
contained the notorious gas chambers in which the victims were put
to death.
</P>
<P>
The IG Farben corporation, as it then existed, made the Zyklon
B gas used in the extermination of European Jews.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the Deutsche Bank documents comes as the bank
faces compensation claims in the United States from Holocaust
victims.
</P>
<P>
Auschwitz is widely regarded as the deadliest camp established
by the Nazi regime in pursuit of its notorious "final solution" in
which an estimated six million Jews perished.
</P>
<P>
When entering the camp, prisoners saw the over the main
entrance the now-infamous words "Arbeit Macht Frei" (work makes
you free).

<HEADLINE> Iraq Desires Dialog with Arab League: League Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Arab League chief Esmat Abdel
Meguid said here on Thursday that Iraq has expressed willingness
to hold a dialog with the league on issues concerning Arab unity.
</P>
<P>
Meguid made the remarks after a meeting with Iraqi Foreign
Undersecretary Nabil Nejm, who conveyed to him a message from
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Baghdad's views on the
communique issued by a recent Arab foreign ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meguid said the message "reflects Iraq's desire for a
constructive dialog" with the Arab League at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
Saddam's message came in response to a letter sent to him by
Meguid on January 26, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Meguid explained in the letter the league's viewpoint on the
communique and what happened during the foreign ministers' meeting
held here on January 24, in reference to Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf's storming out of the meeting, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The communique of the meeting called for political means
instead of military options in solving the Iraqi issue and urged
respect for Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
But as the communique fell short of condemning the U.S.-British
mid-December attack on Iraq, as demanded by Baghdad, al-Sahhaf
walked out of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meguid reiterated that the communique includes positive points
in favor of Iraq and that it rejects the use of force against the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said he informed Nejm of the league's keenness for
preserving the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iraq.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Republicans Turn Against Live Testimony, Fact-Finding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Republicans
moved to bring President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial to a
prompt conclusion Thursday as Majority Leader Trent Lott signaled
a lack of support for live testimony and Republican lawmakers
shrank from an effort to declare the president guilty without
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a closed-door Republican caucus, Lott told
reporters the Senate was "on track" for a final vote on the two
articles of impeachment by February 12, or perhaps a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
For their part, Democrats renewed a call for a formal censure
of the president but only after the trial ends.
</P>
<P>
Clinton. who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in the two
articles of impeachment in connection with his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The two articles were
approved by the House along partisan lines on December 19 last
year.
</P>
<P>
Lott made his comments shortly before the resumption of the
trial, and an effort by House prosecutors to summon Monica
Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal for live testimony.
</P>
<P>
Republicans have been trying to find an exit from a trial that
is unpopular with the public. Democrats have increasingly referred
to the proceedings as a "Republican trial."
</P>
<P>
"The longer it goes, the more it becomes a partisan trial, a
Republican trial," Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the Democrats were drafting a proposal to censure
Clinton and expected to have it completed in a day or so.
</P>
<P>
"It does not appear that the votes are there for live
witnesses," despite a desire by House prosecutors to summon
Lewinsky and the two others to testify, Lott said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Republicans also indicated Thursday that prospects
were dimming for a proposal that would conclude Clinton committed
wrongdoing without removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
``The Democrats have blocked it. We don't want this to break
into a partisan melee,'' said Republican Senator Larry Craig.
</P>
<P>
Lott predicted that videotaped depositions of Lewinsky, Jordan
and Blumenthal will be made public.
</P>
<P>
As for live testimony, a majority of 51 votes would prevent
that.
</P>
<P>
Republicans held a party meeting to search for a solution to
the "findings of fact" dilemma, unhappy to have the trial end with
a straight acquittal.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote to convict a
president and remove him from office -- a margin both parties
agree is not within reach -- but the "finding of fact" would only
need a majority.

<HEADLINE> More Reproductive Health Services Needed for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- One in every 48 women in the
developing world dies from pregnancy-related causes each year,
compared to one in 4,000 in developed countries, the World Bank
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Bank blamed the high death rates in the developing
countries on lack of access to good reproductive health services
and counseling.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bank, 120 million poor couples in the world
are still denied access to such services. Lack of access is most
serious in sub-Saharan Africa and in several countries in Asia and
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The leading cause of death and disability for women in the
developing world is poor maternal and birth-related problems, the
Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The Bank sounded the warning as experts and policy makers gather
in the Hague, Netherlands, next week to review progress since the
1994 International conference on Population and development in
Cairo, capital of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
It said that governments can no longer afford not to invest in
population and reproductive health programs -- the most cost
effective public health initiatives developing countries can
undertake. Such investments are also inexorably linked to economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The Bank said it has been working with developing countries to
implement the landmark agreement signed in Cairo and to integrate
its population and reproductive health activities into its core
agendas of poverty reduction and human development.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the Bank has provided a total of 2 billion U.S.
dollars in loans for population and reproductive health
activities.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for End to Fighting in Guinea-Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday called on all parties to end fighting in
the capital of Guinea-Bissau and show their respect of the January
3 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here through his spokesman, Annan said,
"The Secretary-General calls on all parties to halt military
operations and to respect international humanitarian law and to
facilitate the free flow of humanitarian assistance to affected
populations."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is deeply dismayed at the resumption of
fighting between Government forces and forces loyal to the
self-proclaimed Military Junta, which has already resulted in the
loss of a high number of innocent lives and a new exodus of
civilian population from Bissau," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General welcomes ECOWAS' ongoing efforts to stop
the fighting and urges both parties to abide by the Abuja
Agreement of November 1, 1998 and to respect the new ceasefire
accord which they signed on February 3, 1999," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS, namely the Economic Community of West African States is
mediating peace in the country, where heavy artillery and light
weapons fire rang out in the capital of Bissau within hours of a
ceasefire signed by President Joao Bernardo Vieira and rebel
leader Ansumane Mane, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The brief burst of firing on Wednesday night came from the
center of the devastated West African coastal capital, Bissau,
almost four hours after the Togolese-mediated accord came into
force.
</P>
<P>
Another accord signed by the two sides in November last year in
Abuja, the Nigerian capital, to end civil war that erupted on June
7, 1998 was shattered by renewed fighting last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two warring parties have accused each other of starting the
latest violence that has killed scores of people.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Bissau residents were on the run again just as
they were returning from fleeing earlier fighting, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Last year's accord called for a force of African peacekeepers
to be sent to Bissau to replace troops from French-speaking Guinea
and Senegal propping up the president.
</P>
<P>
Civil war began in the former Portuguese colony after Vieira
sacked Mane as army chief over charges of arms smuggling to rebels
in neighboring Sengal's Casamance Province.

<HEADLINE> Audi Posts Record Sales, Turnover in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Audi, a subsidiary of
Europe's largest carmaker Volkswagen surged to record sales and
profit in 1998, the firm announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was up by more than 20 per cent to in excess of 27
billion marks (16 billion U.S. dollars), Audi AG announced in
Ingolstadt. The VW subsidiary sold 599,509 cars worldwide, or 9.7
per cent more than in 1997. Production was up by 11 per cent to
619,000 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The number of Audi employees reached 42,372 - the highest level
in the history of the marque.
</P>
<P>
"Audi has achieved its ambitious targets for 1998," said board
chairman Franz-Josef Paefgen. Since Audi emerged from crisis in
1994 the company has more than doubled turnover and increased
sales by 60 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Detailed sales figures for 1998 were not disclosed but pre-tax
profits were said to be on target. The firm had estimated its 1998
profit earlier at 1.6 billion marks (1 billion dollars) compared to
1.1 billion marks (0.6 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Audi sold 244,127 cars at home (up 2.3 per cent), overtaking
its rival BMW in the process by selling more than 10,000 more cars
that the Munich-based maker. Audi's market share, however,
actually declined over the period from 6.8 per cent to 6.5 per
cent.
</P>
<P>
Western European sales were up by 15 per cent while sales in
the United States were hoisted by more than 39 per cent to 47,517.
In Japan the Asian financial crisis dented sales by 18 per cent.
Around 8,800 units were sold there in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Audi said its upmarket A6 saloon was a strong seller last year
along with the new TT sportscar introduced in Germany at the end
of last October. The factory turned out 13,682 TT units in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Audi's investment in 1998 was also at a record level, with two
thirds of the more than 3 billion marks(1.8 billion dollars) spent
being earmarked for product development.

ADDIS ABABA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations

arrived here on Thursday in a new effort for a peace solution to
the nine-month border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson of the Office of Ethiopian government, Selome
Taddesse said that "Ethiopia welcomes Sahanoun's visit because we
do not want to leave any stone unturned in the search for peace."
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency reported Thursday that Sahanoun is

</P>
<P>
However, there is no any official announcement here on the

peace plan but Eritrea has not accepted two of its clauses, saying
it wants clarification.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Spokesman said here Tuesday that the OAU was awaiting
response from Eritrea to the reply the OAU had made to a set of

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Plans to Introduce VAT in Year 2,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government said it
will launch a new tax system, the value added tax (VAT), to
replace the current sales' tax in application in the country, in
the framework of the government's plan to secure Rwanda's economic
future.
</P>
<P>
According to Henry Kanyesime Kapeli, VAT Deputy Coordinator at
Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA), this new system will enable
Rwanda to have a reliable tax base. The sales' tax stands at 15
percent, but the VAT percentage is yet to be determined, the
Rwanda News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It will promote exports, in minimizing tariffs that inhibit
export competitiveness and will have a direct bearing on
production or output decisions,'' Kapeli said.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of VAT is also expected to limit the
application of VAT excises on a few goods like petroleum,
alcoholic beverages, and tobacco, as well as to simplify the
system of tax administration.
</P>
<P>
The VAT will also help check fraud which has become rampant in
the country's customs office and tax collection services, Kapeli
declared.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Finance said that in the
framework of continued commitment to economic reform program under
the Economic Structural Adjustment Facilities (ESAF) as
recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Rwandan
government intends to raise tax revenues from 10 percent to 11.7
percent of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
RRA Chairman Edward Larbi Siaw announced last week that his
organization is targeting 86 billion Francs (about 246 million
Dollars) in 1999 from tax revenues, which is about 21 billion
Francs (60 million Dollars) more than in the year 1998.

<P>
TEHRAN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran Thursday strongly rejected
accusations by Palestinian police officials that Tehran is making
efforts to support the re-election of the hardline Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that the
Palestinian officials are trying to justify their subservience to
Israel and suppressing the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Asefi's words came in response to the remarks by Palestinian
police chief Ghazi al-Jabali Wednesday that Iran is financing the
Palestinian Islamic resistance movement (Hamas) to launch attacks
against Israel ahead of the May election.
</P>
<P>
Jabali said the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) had
received various kinds of information about an Iranian plot aimed
at influencing the Israeli election in favor of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the remarks, Asefi said Iran holds the view that all
Israeli factions and parties are the same in nature and their main
objective is to trample upon the rights and interests of Muslim
countries, Palestine in particular.
</P>
<P>
He called on the PNA leaders to rely on the support of the
Palestinian nation instead of pinning hope on political games of
the Israelis.

<HEADLINE> Archaeologists Discover 800-Year-Old Rock-Hewn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A team of archaeologists
has discovered an ancient rock-hewn church believed to be over
800-year-old at a place called Anteleziba, northern Ethiopia, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the church resembles the Monolithic Churches of
Lasta built by King Lalibela, an Ethiopian Emperor who ruled from
1181 to 1221.
</P>
<P>
The church found in a four-meter-long cave has three rooms and
six pillars that support its ceiling which is engraved with shapes
of cross, the report quoted the department of North Gondar zonal
culture, tourism and information as saying.
</P>
<P>
The team of archaeologists had discovered earlier another
rock-hewn church deemed to have been built some 800 years back in
the same area, said the report.

<P>
NICOSIA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides on Thursday said any multi-national forces to be deployed
in Cyprus should have its terms of reference defined by the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Clerides told reporters that he will accept the deployment of
either a force of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or
a force whose composition will be determined by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cyprus News Agency, Cyprus' Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides, while visiting Brussels, repeated a government
proposal for a NATO force to be stationed in Cyprus, within the
framework of the island's demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, initially put forward some years ago, asks for
the withdrawal of Turkish and Greek forces from the island, as
well as the disbanding of Cyprus' National Guard.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of
the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in
Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are 35,000 Turkish troops and some
4,500 Turkish Cypriot armed forces in the northern part of the
island. About 2,000 Greek troops are stationed in southern Cyprus
together with the 19,500-men Greek Cypriot National Guard.

<P>
CAIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were killed
and 6 others injured on Thursday when a six-story building
collapsed in Alexandria, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
An interior ministry source said civil defense workers found
two bodies and rescued six people injured in the incident in the
Mediterranean port city, 190 kilometers northwest of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers were continuing search for possible survivors
trapped in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
The source said 10 families used to live in the building,
without mentioning the exact number of people in the building when
it collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the collapse is not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
Building collapses are not uncommon in Egypt, where poor
materials and shoddy construction techniques result in weak
structures. Extra floors are often added without proper government
permits.
</P>
<P>
Last month, another six-story building collapsed in Giza
governorate of Cairo, killing more than five people and injuring
at least seven others.

<HEADLINE> Drought Management Policy Launched in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
launched Thursday a drought management policy which takes into
account various problems caused by drought and has significant
impact on socio-economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
The policy designed on the basis of Zimbabwe's experience with
drought puts emphasis on harvesting and efficient utilization of
water, and increased productivity in both commercial and communal
areas.
</P>
<P>
It also emphasizes on land use planning, and proper management
of natural resources and the environment.
</P>
<P>
The policy was launched by Public Service, Labour and Social
Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro here in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The minister challenged Zimbabweans to preserve water to ensure
their household food security through irrigation farming.
</P>
<P>
"It is the duty and responsibility of all of us Zimbabweans to
ensure that we prepare to combat the effects of drought not to
respond to drought as a crisis," she said.
</P>
<P>
Planning commissioner Richard Hove said there was need to
improve the capacities of the communities to cope with drought
problems through training.
</P>
<P>
"The drought policy management cannot be a reality without
effective coordination and participation of various sector
ministries and other stakeholders," she added.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein, in Critical Condition, Expected Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein Ibn
Talal, said to be in a critical condition at a U.S. hospital
after cancer treatments, is expected to arrive home Friday for
close supervision and further treatments.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old monarch would be rushed in a helicopter to the
King Hussein Medical City, a military hospital named after
himself, upon his arrival in Amman, the Jordan TV reported
Thursday Evening.
</P>
<P>
The king`s body has apparently refused to accept the bone cells
taken from his family members and transplanted into his body on
Tuesday at the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, the United States, reports
reaching Amman Thursday quoted unnamed official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
This was the second bone marrow transplant Hussein received
as part of the lymphatic cancer treatments at the U.S. hospital,
and the following two weeks would be critical for the monarch,
according to Jordanian Ambassador to Washington Marwan Muasher.
</P>
<P>
Hussein left Amman for the hospital on January 26, when he was
suffering from recurrent fevers and low blood counts, a symptom
apparently triggered by a recurrence of lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
At the same hospital, Hussein had received a six-month
chemotherapy and the first bone marrow transplant during the
second half of 1998 before he returned to Amman on January
19.
</P>
<P>
During his one week-stay at home, Hussein removed his brother
Hassan Ibn Talal as the crown prince in a dramatic shakeup over
policy differences and named his eldest son Abdullah Bin Hussein
as the new heir to the Jordanian throne.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, known for his strong national and Arab sentiment in
home and foreign affairs, had been the crown prince for the past
34 years before he was dethroned by Hussein on January 26, hours
before the king left again for the U.S..
</P>
<P>
In a rare move, Hussein, before leaving for the U.S. again,
delegated all powers to Abdullah, except the rights of making
amendments to the constitution and signing major international
accords.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said he reconsidered the heir to the throne in the best
interests of the nation instead of personal considerations.

<HEADLINE> UK Rehearing on Pinochet Ends, No Verdict Delivered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain's highest court on
Thursday ended its rehearing of the case of whether former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet enjoys immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
But the panel, formed by seven Law Lords, did not say when it
would deliver a ruling.
</P>
<P>
"(We) are extremely grateful for the most persuasive
arguments," Lord Browne-Wilkinson, head of the panel, told lawyers
for both sides after the 12-day hearing in the landmark case.
</P>
<P>
He said it would take time to make a decision, and the
lords "will report their views to the house in due course".
</P>
<P>
The Law Lords are members of the House of Lords, the upper house
of the British parliament. They are expected to report their
decisions to that chamber.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in London last October on a warrant from
Spain accusing him of involvement in the torture and deaths of over
3,000 people during his 17-year rule which ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Last November, a panel formed by five Law Lords ruled he had no
immunity from prosecution, which paved the way for him being
extradited to Spain to face those charges. But the decision was set
aside after it emerged that one of the five judges had links to the
human rights group Amnesty International.

Lawyers said on Thursday that they expected the new panel would
take at least as long as the last one did -- two weeks -- to decide

Pinochet's lawyers assert that as a former head of state he
is immune from prosecution. Spain's lawyers said Pinochet had
allegedly committed "crimes against humanity" for which there is
no immunity under international law.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, now lives under police guard at a hired mansion
in the south-west suburb of London, waiting for the result of
the rehearing. He will be free to fly back to Chile if the panel
rules in favor of him.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Peace in Guinea-Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Thursday called on all parties to halt military
operations in Guinea-Bissau, respect international humanitarian
law and to facilitate the free flow of humanitarian assistance to
affected populations.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was contained in a statement read to the press here,
the acting president of the Security Council, Michel Duval of
Canada, at the end of the closed-door morning session of the
15-member body.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Security Council expressed concern over the
sporadic renewal of fighting, and called on all parties to halt
military operations, respect international humanitarian law and to
facilitate the free flow of humanitarian assistance to affected
populations," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council urged the parties to renew their
commitment to the Abuja Agreement of November 1, 1998 in letter
and spirit, and to respect the new ceasefire accord signed on
February 3, 1999," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"There was also wide support for all of the international
efforts to help bring peace to Guinea-Bissau, especially by ECOWAS
(the Economic Community of West African States), and specifically
note the efforts of the President of Togo, in his capacity as
Chairman of ECOWAS," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council urged those who can to assist
ECOWAS in these efforts," it added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued a statement
through his spokesman, calling for an end to the fighting in the
West African country's capital of Bissau and voicing his welcome
to the ongoing effort by ECOWAS to mediate peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Heavy artillery and light weapons fire rang on in Bissau within
hours of a ceasefire signed by President Joao Bernardo Vieira and
rebel leader Ansumane Mane.
</P>
<P>
An earlier accord signed by the two sides in November last year
in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, to end civil war that erupted on
June 7, 1998 was shattered by renewed figting last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Civil war broke out in the former Portuguese colony after
Vieira sacked Mane as army chief over charges of arms smuggling to
rebels in neighboring Senegal's Casamance Province.

he can continue to fight for peace."

<P>
Jordan's ambassador to Washington, Marwan Mouasher, said the
king had completed a round of chemotherapy and the next two weeks
would be critical in determining if the chemotherapy is working
and the second bone marrow transplant, undertaken last Tuesday,
was being accepted.

<HEADLINE> China Committed to Environment Protection, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 4 (xinhua) -- To enhance the global
protection of the ecological environment helps create a harmonious
and coordinated polictical and economic environment, Chinese
Vice-Minister of Environment Protection Song Ruixaing said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-Minister made these remarks at the ongoing
20th session of the Governing Council of the U.N. Environment
Program.
</P>
<P>
He said that cooperation in the field of the environment is
in the common interests of the people living on this planet.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is making great efforts in its
environment protection and hopes that various countries join their
hands in achieving sustainable development in their each country
and in the world at large, he said..
</P>
<P>
Song noted that over the past decade, China has achieved an
average annual economic growth of nine percent while environmental
 pollution and ecological degradation with commensurate speed has
been avoided due to forceful measures adopted . Obvious
improvement of environmental quality has been achieved in many
areas in China, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Song pointed out that the situation of the global
environment is still worrisome. Efforts should be made to find the
basic law and common policy actions to achieve sustainable
development in view of the evolution of the earth as a whole and
the socio-economic development of the human society.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government highly values the UNEP's active role in
global environmental affairs. UNEP has played its role and made
great contributions to such fields as global environment
legislation and enforcement, environment education and
information, monitoring and assessment, and the promotion of
clean production technology, song said.
</P>
<P>
Song said that China suffered a serious flood in 1998, which
caused enormous losses of lives and property. With the support of
UNEP and Habitat, Chinese experts in cooperation with
international specialists are formulating a plan for the
protection of the ecosystem at the source of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Song told the session that the Chinese government has approved
a national plan for ecological construction and great efforts are
being made in rehabilitation of the environment in major cities,
regions, watersheds and sea waters.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government always suppots the strengthening of
UNEP, and its reform and revitalization, Song said, stressing
that the role of UNEP in the global environmental affairs should
be further be enhanced.

JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Botswanan President Festus

</P>
<P>
Mogae also expressed his appreciation over China's stance in

</P>
<P>
The Botswanan president spoke highly of China's economic

<HEADLINE> Security Council Backs Renewed Diplomacy Over Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday voiced its support for "renewed and urgent
diplomatic efforts to reverse this negative cycle on the military,
political, security and humanitarian fronts" in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The acting president of the Security Council, Michel Duval of
Canada, said in a statement read to the press here that the
15-nation council expressed its support "for renewed and urgent
diplomatic efforts to reverse this negative cycle on the military,
political, security and humanitarian fronts" in the African
country.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the council received a sober assessment on the
deteriorating military, political, security and humanitarian
situation" in Angola, and "expressed their concern over the
numerous examples of the worsening situation described by the U.N.
Secretariat officials," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the council expressed their condolences to the
government of Namibia on the killing of a member of the Namibian
contingent" of the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA), and
expressed their "continued concern over the safety of U.N.
personnel," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Hedi Annabi, the U.N. assistant secretary-general in charge of
peacekeeping operations, briefed the Security Council Thursday
morning as the council met behind closed doors to discuss the
current situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Issa Diallo, U.N. special envoy in Angola, is waiting to
deliver a letter from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
"Annan is writing to ask for his (the president's) personal
view" on the continued U.N. presence in Angola, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Annabi, who just returned from a Angola visit few days ago,
told a press conference Wednesday that the U.N. mission has been
unable to revisit the two U.N. plane crash sites, brought into
being in the wake of the incidents which took place on December 26
and January 2.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the Angolan government and (the rebel) UNITA has
allowed the mission to do so because of security reasons," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the relocation of U.N. personnel to the Angolan
capital of Luanda and the repatriation of non-essential personnel
from Angola are well under way on the ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, due to non-cooperation from the two Angolan warring
parties, has recommended the withdrawal of U.N. peacekeepers from
the southwestern African country. However, the Security Council
later decided to maintain some limited U.N. presence in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Angola has been long locked in a civil war shortly after its
independence in 1975. The 1994 peace accord was shattered by the
government offensives against the rebel UNITA in central Angola in
December last year.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Interim Accord Will be Reached in Two Weeks, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Yugslavia and ethnic Kosovo
Albanians will reach an interim peace accord within two weeks after
talks open in France this weekend, the European Union special envoy
for Kosovo said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident... we will reach agreement in this short time,"
said Wolfgang Petritsch, the European Union (EU) special ambassador
for Kosovo at a Bonn news briefing with U.S. Kosovo envoy, Christopher
Hill.
</P>
<P>
Both Petritsch and Hill were upbeat after the Yugoslav parliament
voted Thursday to attend talks which open Saturday in Rambouillet,
France. Kosovo Albanians had agreed to attend earlier.
</P>
<P>
"We are going in assuming that we are going to achieve success,"
said Hill, adding: "We've gone through a lot of Balkan mud to get
where we are."
</P>
<P>
Petritsch cautioned the tone at the start of negotiations would be
crucial given that very heterogeneous parties - especially the ethnic
Albanian side - would be attending.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed success was in reach: "There will be a fully
developed interim solution in 14 days. This is supposed to be an
interim accord planned for three years."
</P>
<P>
Hill, Peritsch and Russia's Kosovo envoy, Boris Mayorski are the
chief negotiators at Rambouillet which is being presided over by
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook.

<HEADLINE> Academicians Become China's First Group Having Private Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 121 academicians
with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the Chinese Academy
of Engineering (CAE) became the first group of individuals with
access to private medical care.
</P>
<P>
The famous scientists have received medical care cards which
entitle them to private care at a new health care center in
Zhongguancun, China's Silicon Valley. They will enjoy access to
services provided by a staff of nine general practitioners paid by
the government.
</P>
<P>
Wealthy families in old China were the only people who could
afford private doctors and the special services were banned for
long period following the founding of New China.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Bao Jinglong told the academicians to "simply call and
we'll respond immediately when you need help."
</P>
<P>
Bao said the center will provide long-term health care
services, including physical examination and consulting. He said
doctors must maintain the confidentiality of a patient's health
record.
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey revealed that scientists working in
Zhongguancun ventures have an average life span of 60 years, 13
years less than the average life expectancy for Beijing residents
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
 CAE Academician Zhang Guangxue expressed regret about failing
to get sufficient physical exercise when he was young. "However,
it's not too late since we now have our own doctors."
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the government has begun to provide the first
group of private doctors to its famous scientists shows that the
country is greatly concerned about their health," according to Zhu
Zonghan, director of the Beijing Health Care Bureau.
</P>
<P>
 He also disclosed that ordinary citizens will soon be able to
enjoy the services of private doctors.

<HEADLINE> Extra Effort Needed to End Africa's Wars: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- For too long, conflict
in Africa had been seen as inevitable or intractable or both when
it was neither, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said.
</P>
<P>
In an address upon receiving the 1999 Black History Makers
Award at the Associated Black Charities in New York on Wednesday
night, Annan said that he had made peace and progress in Africa a
priority of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
Conflict in Africa, as everywhere, was caused by human action,
and could be ended by human action, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the reality that shames us for every conflict we allow
to persist," he said, "It is the reality that must make us go the
extra mile to end Africa's wars, so the rich potential of its
people can be unleashed."
</P>
<P>
The 1999 Black History Makers Award was shared by Jackie
Joyner-Kersee and Gordon Parks, U.N. officials said on Friday.
Past winners included U.S. General Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
Since he became the first U.N. Secretary-General form black
Africa more than two years ago, Annan has attacked great
importance to peace and development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
There are currently close to 20 armed conflicts going on in
Africa, U.N. officials said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Holds at 28-Year Low in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. jobless rate held at a
28-year low of 4.3 percent in January because of the booming
economy creating new jobs at a brisk pace, the Labor Department
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Financial firms and construction companies as well as retailers
all reported job gains in the month.
</P>
<P>
The number of workers on payrolls outside the farm sector rose
by 245,000 following growth of 298,000 in December. The seasonally
adjusted rate matched the level achieved in December and April of
last year, and before that in 1970, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
The report shows the U.S. economy entering the new year with
considerable momentum after growing during the final three months
of 1998 at the fastest rate in 2 and half years.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed the average hourly wages of
nonsupervisory workers rising 6 cents in January to 13.04. It was
the largest monthly increase since August. Over the year, hourly
earnings have increased 50 cents, or 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, January job gains
were led by services industry which added 114,000 jobs.
Engineering and management services continued their strong growth,
with payrolls rising by 27,000 and 17,000 jobs, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Finance and real estate each added 11,000 jobs. Retail
employment rose by 30,000. Payrolls increased by 13,000 at
trucking firms, 11,000 at communications companies and 36,000 in
local government.
</P>
<P>
The booming construction industry added a seasonally adjusted
15,000 jobs even though severe weather in the Midwest and
Northeast halted some work. Since September, construction has
added 184,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, job losses continued in manufacturing. Payrolls fell
by 13,000 jobs, bringing job losses since last March to 285,000,
reflecting the loss of export sales to troubled economies,
principally in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Holds Israeli Responsible for Skirmishes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon rejected on Friday an
Israeli allegation that it should be responsible for what it
called "the worsening situation in south Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
"Israel turned the truth over and forged the fact by holding
Lebanon responsible for escalation of conflicts in the border
area," Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said it is Israel, which is occupying Lebanese territory,
not the Lebanese government, that should shoulder any
responsibility for the violence in the area.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that fighting against Israeli occupation is a
legal right for both the army and the people of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The premier's remarks came as a response to an Israeli report
to the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan delivered by
Israel's U.N. Ambassador Dore Gold.
</P>
<P>
The report held Beirut responsible for the escalation of
violence in Israeli occupied south Lebanon and the border area and
said Israel reserves the right to strike back in "self-defense."
</P>
<P>
In the past week, conflicts between Israeli forces and
Lebanese guerrillas spearheaded by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God, were on the rise in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 after two invasions, under the pretext of shielding its
northern border areas from Lebanese guerilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah fired several Katyusha rockets into Israel causing
some injuries, apparently in retaliation for Israeli attacks that
killed a Lebanese mother and her five children.
</P>
<P>
There has been no report of human casualties arising from the
almost daily skirmishes over the past week.

<HEADLINE> Four Men Jailed for Manslaughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Four men received jail terms
of up to 14 years on Friday in Dublin for killing Detective Jerry
McCabe during a botched armed robbery in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Dublin, the Irish Republic's
capital, all four were also sentenced to five years for
maliciously wounding McCabe's colleague Ben O'Sullivan and five
years for firearms possession, all to be served concurrently. A
fifth man, John Quinn, 31, got six years for conspiring to commit
robbery.
</P>
<P>
The four men pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but not capital
murder of a state servant, at Dublin's Special Criminal Court
early this week. In Ireland the charge of capital murder of a
state servant carries a mandatory 40-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
The court jailed Pearse McCauley, 34, and Kevin Walsh, 42,
both for 14 years, Jeremiah Sheehy, 36, for 12 years and Michael O'
Neill, 46, for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said he was glad the men had
been brought to justice but regretted they had not been convicted
of the original charge.
</P>
<P>
McCabe and O'Sullivan were escorting a postal van containing
81,000 Irish pounds (117,000 U.S. dollars) when a jeep rammed
their parked car in the County Limerick town of Adare, 177
kilometers southwest of Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Four men in balaclavas and military fatigues leapt out of the
jeep. One fired a burst of shots from a Kalashnikov assault rifle
into the police car without warning. Three shots hit McCabe, who
died minutes later.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Banks Urged to Upgrade for Greater Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong has urged local banks to make ready to meet greater
competition and upgrade themselves to compete with others.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a celebration dinner Friday to mark the 50th
founding anniversary of the Overseas Union Bank (OUB), the prime
minister said "our local banks not only need to be the best in the
region. They have to hold their own against competition from
international banks, like Citigroup, Deutche Bank or HSBC."
</P>
<P>
Goh emphasized that this is necessary because of the continuing
rapid globalization of the financial industry, which has not been
slowed down and rolled back by the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Noting there was a wave of mega-mergers and strategic alliances
during the last year, Goh said "size alone does not guarantee
survival but it does help when you are up against bigger sumo
wrestlers."
</P>
<P>
"Local banks need to assess how the game has changed and
identify their roles and strategies in this new environment," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the merger of Development Bank of Singapore (DBS)
and the Post Office Savings Bank (POSBank) last year, the prime
minister said the merger will enable DBS to become not only a
market leader in Singapore, but also be a significant player in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"The move consolidates the strengths of DBS and POSBank,
introduces new talent into the merged entity, and gives it the
size and vitality to compete in the banking world's premier
league. More importantly, it will bring about a new mindset to
think international and to make a quantum improvement from the
status quo," he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
Goh also gave emphasis to enhancing technology in the financial
industry, saying "Telephone and Internet banking will become
increasingly important."
</P>
<P>
Citing a report that about one in six Europeans will be using
the cyberway to do direct banking, Goh said local banks should
launch electronic commerce services to capitalize on this new
medium as many transactions are still done using paper cheques in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"We should use information technology to integrate financial
services, logistics, shipping and trade sectors," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the financial situation in his country, the prime minister
said non-performing loans of the five largest local banks have
remained manageable, at 6.6 percent of their total global loans in
the third quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the fact that Singapore's economy depends heavily
(about 70 percent) on external demand for goods and services and
all these were largely transacted through local banks over these
years, Goh said the traders have many other options in an
increasingly globalized economy.
</P>
<P>
OUB, one of the Bir Four Banks in Singapore, first opened its
doors on February 5, 1949, with a staff of 27 and now it has 40
domestic branches and 21 overseas offices and branches, offering a
comprehensive range of banking and financial services.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler, Executive
Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said on Thursday
that he would leave his post when his contract expires in June.
</P>
<P>
Butler, at the same time, stressed that his tenure was far
less important than completing Iraq's disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Butler said "I would not be seeking a
renewal of my contract," he said.
</P>
<P>
Butler chastised reporters for concentrating on his own
future rather than on Iraq's concealment of documents and
materials relating to its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"You are swallowing something that is not right. Read the
document we have tabled in the Security Council on Iraq's weapons
and its history of concealing of them," he said in reference to a
recent report presented by him to the Security Council late last
month.
</P>
<P>
Russia, one of the five permanent members of the Security
Council, has called upon Butler to resign, saying that he was
unprofessional and biased, a position backed by other members of
the Council.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Calls for End to Arms Sales in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- "The world cannot ask
Africa to develop and then blight its development efforts through
the sale of arms and ammunitions that fuel Africa's civil
conflicts," the administrator of the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP), James Gustave Speth, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The culture of war is a stark denial of the right to
development, to life itself," he said. "We must say 'no' to the
trade in death. Nowhere have small arms wrought as much havoc as
that found in Africa where national conflicts have turned millions
of people into refugees and internally-displaced persons."
</P>
<P>
Speth was speaking at a region-wide meeting of UNDP's
Africa-based resident representatives. By some estimates, 90
percent of the world's low-intensity conflicts in the 1990s are
being fought in Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are currently close to 20 armed conflicts going on in
Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speth said the challenge for the international community is to
help Africa achieve its development objectives "by promoting free
and fair trade, by facilitating foreign investment and private
sector of development and by promoting, through programs of
technical cooperation, the empowerment of Africa's own people and
institutions."
</P>
<P>
UNDP had refocused its programs and approaches to address some
of the underlying causes of conflict in the world and noted
successful efforts in Mali to help the government limit the spread
of small arms.
</P>
<P>
"Before conflict arises there is need for preventive
development as a complement to preventive diplomacy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"During a conflict it is very important that development work
stay as active as possible to contain and limit and ameliorate the
effects of the conflict. And after conflict, it is important that
in building the peace that the demobilized soldiers, that the
returning refugees, that the internally displaced people be
reintegrated into communities with vibrant opportunities," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Community development and family livelihoods must be promoted,
criminal justice systems put in place, issues of land tenure
resolved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Political and economic reforms, including respect for human
rights, must take place, basic government capacities should be
built or rebuilt, and there needs to be reconciliations through
equity and social development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many countries are making significant headway in creating
conditions for peaceful, equitable development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must reinforce these positive trends," he said, "We must
find ways to redouble our efforts in countries that offer models
to the region, and we must also find ways to insulate these
positive trends from the risks of spreading conflicts."
</P>
<P>
Resident representatives from 45 African countries are
attending the meeting, scheduled for February 1-6. which has its
theme "Africa in the New Millennium: Doing Business Differently."

<HEADLINE> Russia Snubs U.S. Criticism on Arms Sales to Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday blasted U.S.
criticism of its arms sales to Syria, saying Moscow does not
recognize "the extraterritorial nature of American laws."
</P>
<P>
The statement, made by Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin, was in response to the U.S. State Department's
intention to cut aid to Russia if Moscow sells conventional anti-
tank weapons to Syria.
</P>
<P>
"We proceed from the fact that military cooperation between
sovereign states is their inalienable right in conformity with the
right of self-defense enshrined in the U.N. Charter," Yakushkin
told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"When implementing cooperation with other countries in this
sphere, we strictly abide by our international obligations,
including in the sphere of non-proliferation and export control,
as well as the regime of sanctions under the aegis of the United
Nations," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said Syria has given its guarantees that Russian weapons
will not be re-exported without Moscow's consent and that the
purchased military hardware would only be used for declared
purposes.
</P>
<P>
"We have no evidence that they transfer Russian weapons to
third countries or to armed and terrorist organizations operating
in the region," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Russian anti-tank equipment referred to
by the United States "is a defensive weapon" and that "such
deliveries do not undermine the balance of forces in the region."

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Government Discusses International Economic Integration Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese government urged its
ministries and branches to design their own international economic
integration strategy in line with the adjusted structure of the
economy, development prospects of the regional and world market.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports of local press Friday, in a regular
monthly cabinet meeting for January, which was held in Hanoi on
Wednesday and Thursday under the chairmanship of Prime Minister
Phan Van Khai, Vietnamese government criticized some ministries
and state-owned businesses for their failure to be aware of the
urgency and severity of competition once Vietnam integrates into
world commerce.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese government said such a failure has led to stagnant
restructuring of their production and investment.
</P>
<P>
The government said many Vietnam's businesses still remained
bogged down in their old work style which harbored inefficiency
and dependency on government subsidies. Some businesses still
dreamed of being protected by the government's customary tariff
barriers.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai stressed Vietnam cannot
"play its own rules" while the rest of the world joins the process
of globalization, trade and investment liberalization, regional
and international integration.
</P>
<P>
Khai noted, the readjustment of the investment structure in the
integration process bears fundamental and urgent significance, and
is vital to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Planning and Investment Ministry was assigned to
monitor and collaborate with the trade, industry and foreign
ministries, the government office and other relevant ministries
and branches to design a master plan of integration strategy
basing on ministerial plans. The master plan will be submitted to
Vietnam's prime minister in March 1999.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Reduction in Bank Charges to Facilitate Euro Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
announced Friday that it would take action aimed at pressuring
banks in the euro-zone into reducing charges for changing cash to
facilitate the use of the single currency euro.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, has found that some banks are charging hefty fees for
changing cash from one euro-zone currency to another.
</P>
<P>
Despite the launch of euro on January 1, the national
currencies in the 11 euro-zone countries will continue to
circulate until 2002, and their value against each other has been
fixed.
</P>
<P>
The commission said it set March 31 this year as the deadline
for banks to publish information on bank charges. The information
has to include charges for exchanging euro zone banknotes, cross-
border checks, money transfers and credit card payments.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said the publication of detailed
information on bank charges will be essential to promoting
competition by reducing conversion and transfer fees.
</P>
<P>
The commission encourages the public to report details on
suspected cases of non-compliance with the legal framework for the
single currency.

BRUSSELS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
on Friday that it had reserved its opinion on the international
anti-doping agency to be set up in the fight against drug-abuse
among athletes.
</P>
<P>
A commission official told the press on Friday, one day after
the world anti-doping conference, that the 15-nation European
Union had reserved its approval for the agency, which the union
demands have to be independent and transparent.
</P>
<P>
The union is set to consult the member states before making a
joint decision.
</P>
<P>
A commission working group on anti-doping affairs is scheduled
to meet on February 19 in Brussels to provide member states with
legal and ethic basics on the issue. Some member countries
already have more rigorous legislation concerning doping and drug-
abuse.
</P>
<P>
The same European Commission official said that some of the EU
member states want to know whether police cooperation is needed in
fighting doping as an organized crime.
</P>
<P>
The world anti-doping conference gave concerned parties three
months to come out with a decision on the formation and mission of
the international anti-doping agency.

<HEADLINE> EU Stresses Minimum Income For Social Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
stressed on Friday the importance of a minimum income in the
European Union (EU) member states and described it as the "final
safety net" of social protection.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, studied a report on minimum income in 13 of the EU member
countries. Italy and Greece are excluded from the report.
</P>
<P>
The study was aimed to evaluate the role of national social
protection schemes in the fight against poverty, and to analyze
the contribution social protection systems make toward the social
and economic integration of the union.
</P>
<P>
The commission agreed in 1992 to start reviewing the
fulfillment of the schemes to judge whether there was sufficient
resources and assistance in the social protection systems.
</P>
<P>
The minimum income schemes deal primarily with the most acute
situations of poverty and they help the poorest in society by
covering basic needs without any requirement for prior
contributions, according to commission officials.
</P>
<P>
Minimum incomes tend not to act in isolation in social
protection systems but instead form part of a range of benefits
and social services.
</P>
<P>
The commission concluded that the rise in the number of minimum
income beneficiaries since the end of the 1980s can best be
explained by the higher and persistent unemployment rate within
the EU.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the numbers of people who have experienced social
disruptions in their lives such as family breakdown, forced
migration, homelessness, and over-indebtedness also serves as a
reason.
</P>
<P>
Single men and single-parent families are over-represented
among those who seek social assistance in the form of minimum
income in EU member countries.

<HEADLINE> China's Promising Wine Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China's market share for
spirits continues to shrink while wine gains increasing popularity
with Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
 Experts contend that the Chinese are paying greater attention
to health along with increasing prosperity resulting from the
reform and opening policies. As a result, relatively inexpensive
and nutritious fruit wine is enjoying an ever increasing market
share.
</P>
<P>
 Recent reports indicate that China produced 200,000 tons of
grape wine in 1998. A nationwide survey of 70 products offered by
58 wineries in the fourth quarter last year revealed that the
qualification rate reached 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
 The State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision, which
sponsored the survey, reported that the qualification rate for 27
products offered by 22 medium- to large-sized enterprises hit 100
percent. It also noted that the advanced production facilities and
management expertise of joint ventures has ensured stable product
quality.
</P>
<P>
 The bureau disclosed that eight low quality products were
produced by small-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
 Experts point out that China has a vast potential wine market,
but the country's wineries will not gain a firm foothold in the
international market unless they develop brand name products.

<HEADLINE> Thai King Praises "Sincerity" of Sino-Thai Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Sincerity is a distinguishing
feature of the bilateral relations between Thailand and China, the
Thai King, Bhumibol Adulyadej, said to visiting Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan Friday.
</P>
<P>
The King noted that bilateral relations has been consolidated
ever since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1975.
</P>
<P>
One distinguishing feature of the relations is that the two
countries treat each other open-heartedly and cooperate sincerely,
the King said.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese-Thai relations enjoy solid foundation and broad
prospects," the King said.
</P>
<P>
He also showed his gratitude to China for its help after
Thailand was mired into the financial crisis in July, 1997, and
appreciated what China achieved in the economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Tang said China and Thailand are as close as relatives.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries have no historical problems that can not be
solved by the forefathers, nor conflicts of interests at present,
but only friendship and cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang mentioned the joint statement he signed with Thai Foreign
Minister Surin Pitsuwan earlier Friday, saying it will bring a
better Sino-Thai relations into the new century.
</P>
<P>
Tang also thanked the King for his enthusiasm and devotion to
supporting the development of the relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The frequent visits to China by the members of the royal family
also served as a "bridge of friendship" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the 50-minute meeting, the King showed great interest in
China's Three Gorges Project, listening carefully to Tang's
briefing on how the project survived the catastrophic flood last
year and the preliminary function it performed.
</P>
<P>
Tang arrived here on Thursday for a three-day working visit.
Earlier Friday, he held talks with Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
after signing the joint statement with Surin and delivering a
speech on China's foreign policy and China-Thailand relations.
</P>
<P>
Tang will leave for Beijing Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Revolutionary Base Alleviates Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The poverty-stricken Luliang
Mountainous area in north China's Shanxi Province, one of China's
revolutionary bases, has succeeded in helping over one million
local residents escape poverty over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Luliang, an area which President Jiang Zemin visited in early
1994, has reduced its poverty-stricken population from 1.43
million in 1994 to 300,000 in 1998. The area's gross domestic
product (GDP) has grown by an annual 10 percent in recent years.
The average per-capita income of rural residents reached 1,417
yuan in 1998, rising at an average annual rate of 169 yuan in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The local government and farmers joined in a massive effort to
control soil erosion, one the major causes of poverty, on over 267,
000 hectares. Related efforts resulted in a substantial increase
in farmland and forest coverage.
</P>
<P>
The revolutionary base has allocated over one billion yuan to
build roads linking all local villages.
</P>
<P>
Luliang has earmarked some 700 million yuan for the
construction of 1,000 new schools, with 99.3 percent of local
children currently attending school.
</P>
<P>
Over of 1.5 million farmers have received technical training
and have in turn contributed greatly to local economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Power Plant in Uganda to Save Firewood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The hydro power plant at Karuma
Falls in Jinja, 80 kilometers east of capital Kampala, will save
28 billion cubic centimeters of firewood per year in the whole of
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in the talks between President Yoweri
Museveni and the Chief Executive Officer of NORPLAN, a Norwegian
company, Ian Lindermark at the president's home in Mbarara
district in southwestern Uganda Thursday, a press release from the
President's Office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lindermark, accompanied by technocrats from his company which
is planning to build the power plant, briefed the Uganda president
about the progress made so far and said that the project
definition report is under completion.
</P>
<P>
The plant, on completion, will have a maximum capacity to
generate 200 megawatts of electricity and will have minimum
environmental consequences, the manager added.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that all power generation projects are welcome to
Uganda because the demand for power in the country is still great.
</P>
<P>
He explained that power is needed to cater for the suppressed
demand and reverse the environmental threat.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's current demand for power stands at 260 megawatts and
the famous Owen Falls Plant in Jinja accounts for 80 percent of
the demand.
</P>
<P>
Chronic lack of power often hamper the development of the
country's economy and load-shedding affects the lives of many
people in both cities and upcountry areas.

<HEADLINE> Russia Abandons Space Mirror Experiment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday decided to
abandon its ambitious experiment to reflect sunlight on the Earth
after the failure of two attempts to open a giant mirror aboard
the "Progress" cargo ship.
</P>
<P>
The press service of Mission Control near Moscow said the
cargo ship and the unfolded space mirror will descend from its
orbit over the Pacific Ocean later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The remnants will burst into flame when the they re-enter the
Earth's atmosphere. Remaining debris is expected to fall into the
Pacific Ocean, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Flight commander Vladimir Solovyov, who supervised the
attempts to unfold the mirror from the Mir space station, said the
mirror's 25-meter-diameter membrane and its unfolding mechanism
could not be detached from the "Progress" to ensure its safe
flight and reliable descent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the failure, Solovyov was optimistic that the program,
dubbed Znamya, or Banner, to illuminate areas on Earth with a
reflector from space would have a great future.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a second mirror ready to go, but another such
experiment on Mir seems unlikely in the near future since there is
no space available on the next scheduled flight to Mir.
</P>
<P>
The continuation of similar experiments may be expected only
on the future international space station, Solovyov said.

BRUSSELS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
published on Friday an estimate of civil damages inflicted by the
conflict in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European

BRUSSELS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has started
a two-day emergency humanitarian mission Friday to transport
desperately-needed medical supplies to the war-torn African
country of Guinea-Bissau.
</P>
<P>
Flights, to be coordinated by the union's European Community
Humanitarian Office, will transport 20,000 doses of vaccines and 1.
5 tons of surgical equipment to wounded patients and locations
where an epidemic of meningitis has broken out.

kilometers from the country's capital city of Bissau.
</P>
<P>
The health of those who were wounded in the seven-month-long
civil war has worsened due to a lack of medical and surgical
supplies in local hospitals. Some 30 wounded have already died
due to the lack of proper treatment.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation

MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Duma on Friday
passed the government's 1999 budget in the fourth and final
reading by an overwhelming vote of 308-58 with six abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The final vote came after the lower house of parliament passed
an amendment on cutting spending for the presidential
administration by 117 million rubles (about 5.09 million U.S.
dollars) instead of the 235 million rubles (10.22 million dollars)
originally sought by lawmakers and another on the provision of
additional funds to low-income pensioners, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Despite the amendments, the main parameters of this year's
budget remained unchanged from the first reading. It envisions
federal spending at 575.04 billion rubles (25 billion dollars),
and revenues at 473.67 billion rubles (20.6 billion dollars). A
maximum deficit is planned at 101.37 billion rubles (4.41 billion
dollars), or 2.54 percent of the gross national product (GDP).
Inflation will total 30 percent by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Jordanians Desperately Pray for Hussein's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Deadly silence prevailed on the
Amman streets Friday as Jordanians are praying desperately for
King Hussein's health, who is losing his battle against lymphatic
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Shops are closed and there was virtually no traffic commuting
in the capital, as Jordanians stayed around radios and televisions
in their cars or houses, waiting in vain for news that their
beloved monarch would rise from the sickbed again.
</P>
<P>
The cancer-stricken monarch was flown home, semi-conscious and
suffering from liver and kidney failures, Friday morning from
the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, the United States where he Tuesday
received a second and unsuccessful marrow cell transplant as part
of the cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
He was rushed to the King Hussein Medical City, a military
hospital named after himself, for close medical care and
supervision upon his arrival in Amman while his health is
apparently deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
Roads leading to the hospital were blocked by soldiers and
police officers, who have been keeping journalists from
approaching the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Soon after his arrival, Channel one and Channel two of the
Jordan TV terminated their normal broadcastings of commercial
advertisements, TV drama series and routine entertainment
programs, to put up the same show, in which a solemnly dressed
religious leader told religious stories and praised Islam
doctrines.
</P>
<P>
Hussein left the U.S. hospital upon his own wish, and was
accompanied by a group of U.S. doctors during his journey home.
</P>
<P>
After his cancer was detected in 1998, King Hussein had said
that he would spend his last days with his people in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic shake-up over policy differences in January,
Hussein sacked his brother Hassan Bin Talal as his successor and
named his eldest son Abdullah Bin Hussein as the new crown prince
and heir to the Jordanian throne.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, known for a strong national and Arab sentiment in
domestic and foreign affairs, had been the crown prince for the
past 34 years before he was dethroned by Hussein on January 26.
</P>
<P>
Hussein had delegated all powers to the 37-year-old Abdullah,
except the rights of making amendments to the constitution and
signing major international accords.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who had received education in Britain and the U.S.,
is also an army major general in charge of the most elite special
force of the kingdom that supervises the security of the Royal
family.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Health-Care Computers at Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada's health-care system may
be in trouble as it tries to meet deadlines for fixing Y2K
computer problems, a House of Commons committee said.
</P>
<P>
While most other essential services seem to be in good shape,
the health-care system apparently does not have the money or the
skilled personnel to test and repair all its key systems before
the year 2000, the house said in a report to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Ontario province alone, the cost of eliminating Y2K problems
in hospitals could go as high as 700 million Canadian dollars (462
million U.S. dollars) over three years. The provincial government
however has added only 300 million Canadian dollars (198 million U.
S. dollars) to the health-care budget to pay for computer problems,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Health care is of "almost universal importance" to Canadians,
but this sector "remains challenged by slow vendor responses, lack
of funding and lack of skilled personnel," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also said it is unlikely that essential services,
such as electricity and communications, will be interrupted.
Canadians should be "reassured that this important issue is being
addressed but should not be complacent," it stated.
</P>
<P>
Federal, provincial and many local governments in the country,
particularly those of bigger cities, appear to be working out
contingency plans if there are disruptions to services, the report
said.

Currently, the factory is among the biggest of its type in

willing to learn and employ a great 'can-do' spirit if given the
proper level of motivation.
</P>
<P>
As for Motorola's plans for China, he said he would stick to
the four principles already agreed: bringing advanced technology
to China; speeding up localization of products; providing training
and promotion for Chinese employees; and establishing joint
ventures and cooperative enterpirses and cooperating with State

<HEADLINE> Mandela Rules Out Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Friday ruled out the reintroduction of the death
penalty, but said there is room to tighten existing legislation to
combat crime.
</P>
<P>
In his state of the nation address to parliament, which was
broadcast live, Mandela said: "This government is not about to
joint the chorus baying for the death sentence or to reverse our
human rights gains."
</P>
<P>
He said the statistics showed that there had been a reduction
or stabilization in most serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
"Murder, for instance, has declined by 10 percent since 1994,"
said the president.
</P>
<P>
He said all negative responses to the question of crime "arise
from a failure to appreciate the fact that turning the tide
against crime cannot be achieved overnight."
</P>
<P>
"There are also deliberate efforts to sensationalize and
politicize this issue," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Mandela admitted that on the matter of crime, "more can be
done, and more must be done."
</P>
<P>
"For instance, should interference with witnesses and murder of
 policemen and (police-) women not attract very harsh mandatory
sentences?
</P>
<P>
"What about the form and content of evidence that should be
given to defense attorneys in bail applications?" Mandela asked.
</P>
<P>
"For it does not help for the police to do their work and for
the justice system to be efficient, if criminals will subvert
investigations and prosecution by violent and foul means."
</P>
<P>
He blasted burgeoning urban terrorism in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Mandela avoided apportioning blame to any organization or
individual by name.
</P>
<P>
However, in an apparent reference to the vigilante group,
People against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad), the president said:
"What started off expressly as a campaign against gangsterism has
now become a violent and murderous offensive against ordinary
citizens and law-enforcement agencies."
</P>
<P>
"What is portrayed as moral and God-inspired against
oppression, exploitation and imperialism, has assumed the form of
terrorism to undercut Cape Town's lifeline and destabilize a
democratic government," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This campaign is rotten to the core; it is misguided; and its
attempts to invoke religion is blasphemous," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted to assure the people of Cape Town that his
government knew who these people were, who trained and backed
them.
</P>
<P>
"And steadily we are building water-tight cases against them
that will ensure that they stay in jail for a long, long time,"
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Following last year's bomb blast in Cape Town's Planet
Hollywood restaurant, several bomb attacks occurred in the city
this year, including two explosions near police stations.
</P>
<P>
Six members of Pagad's paramilitary G-force have been arrested
on charges of possession of illegal weapons. Police hailed the
arrests as a breakthrough to their fight against terrorism.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Bridging partisan divisions, the Senate charted a course to
wrap up President Clinton's impeachment trial next week without
Monica Lewinsky testifying and likely without any "findings of
fact" that would cite presidential misconduct while leaving him in
office.
</P>
<P>
-- A cancer stricken King Hussein was carried aboard his
private jet in Minnesota and borne home to Jordan in a desperate
race against time to die in the kingdom he has ruled through 46
turbulent years.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate approved a plan to show "all or parts" of Monica
Lewinsky's videotaped disposition during floor arguments on
Saturday. That will give the nation its first chance to see and
hear her own account of the illicit affair with President Clinton
that led to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
-- Richard Butler, embattled chairman of the UNSCOM charged
with disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, said that he
did not expect to seek another term as chairman but that he would
strongly resist any effort to oust him.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ha sternly warned
Americans that the U.S. cannot remain "an oasis of prosperity"amid
global economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
-- Brazil and the International Monetary Fund reached
preliminary agreement on new economic targets for the troubled
nation that will imply even more belt tightening and potentially
higher interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Israel Confident in Smooth Power Transition in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- As Jordan's ailing King
Hussein remains in critical condition, Israel Friday expressed
confidence in a smooth power transition in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Aviv Bushinsky, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's spokesman, as saying that the Israeli government is
confident that Jordanian Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Hussein's
succession to the throne will take place smoothly.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein returned to Jordan on Friday after apparent
failure of cancer treatment in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian regime is stable and Israel has every reason to
believe that this stability will continue, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
And the relations between Israel and Jordan will remain strong,
he added.
</P>
<P>
It is unknown yet whether the meeting between Israeli leaders
and Crown Prince Abdullah will take place as scheduled. It depends
on the Jordanian authority, he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon are scheduled to
travel to Jordan on Sunday to meet Crown Prince Abdullah, who was
appointed as King Hussein's successor at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both Netanyahu and Israeli opposition party Labor
leader Ehud Barak Friday prayed for King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
During a debate on the 1999 state budget early Friday morning,
Netanyahu interrupted the session by saying that Hussein's plane
would soon pass over Israel to return him to his country and to
"his people who love him so much."
</P>
<P>
"We are all praying for a miracle, for a positive change. May
it be God's will," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Barak joined Netanyahu in calling on the Israeli people to pray
for the monarch.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Jordan signed a historic peace treaty in 1994.

<P>
PARIS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine Friday welcomed a decision by the Serb parliament to send
a delegation to the conference on Kosovo in Rambouillet, just
outside of Paris, France, which will begin Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The positive response of Belgrade and the Albanian's of Kosovo
is a result of the international diplomatic community asserting
force on the country, which should continue without respite, said
Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
He said the only objective of the talks will be to achieve
results that will solve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The talks in Rambouillet will start this Saturday, a date
prearranged by the Contact Group, with the sole objective being to
achieve results," said the minister.
</P>

<P>
YONGPYONG, South Korea, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan, a
debutant of last edition of the Games, won its first gold medal in
the Asian Winter Games on Friday from its figure skater.
</P>
<P>
Tatyana Malinina came from behind after the short program to
take the women's singles title, a victory which boosted Uzbekistan
to join China, South Korea, Japan and Kazakhstan on the gold medal
count.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Shizuka Arakawa, leader of the short program, came in
second and her teammate Fumie Suguri was third in the event.
</P>
<P>
China took the other three golds in the men's singles, pairs
and ice dancing in the three-day competition.

<P>
Uzbekistan also took two medals, all from the ice rink, in the
sport including Roman Skornyakov's silver of the men's singles and
Natalya Ponomareva and Evgemou Svorodpvs' bronze in the ice
dancing.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan didn't send the defending ice dancing skaters to the
Games, leaving chances to the Chinese pairs Wang Rui and Zhang Wei
to win the ice dancing gold.
</P>
<P>
"It's pity for the Games that Kazakhstan did not send the
skaters for the ice dancing," said Zhu Chengyi, secretary general
of the Chinese delegation. "Their skaters are really very good and
of the world level."
</P>
<P>
There were a total of 38 skaters participating in the figure
skating, with only four duos for the pairs and three for the ice
dancing.

<HEADLINE> Senior HK Official on Work for Right of abode issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong official
Friday outlined the work for the special task force on
implementation of the Court of Final Appeal's Judgment on the
right of abode in Hong Kong of mainland residents.
</P>
<P>
Anson chan, administrative secretary of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), said at a meet-the-media session
after the first meeting of the special task force that the first
task is to try and assess the potential pool of people who are
likely to come to Hong Kong for residence.
</P>
<P>
The task force is chaired by Anson Chan. Its membership
includes the Secretary for Security, the director of Immigration,
the Secretary for Education and manpower, the secretary for Health
and Welfare, the Secretary for Housing, the Secretary for Home
affairs, the Secretary for the Treasury, the Law Officer (Civil
Law) and the government Economist.
</P>
<P>
The task force will critically assess the implications of the
Court of Final appeal's ruling, and oversee the implementation
measures to ensure the orderly arrival of mainland children with
right of abode in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that the establishment of the task force aims to
implement and comply with the Court of Final Appeal's judgment as
regards the Certificate of Entitlement Scheme.
</P>
<P>
She said the mainland authorities will as soon as possible
carry out two surveys, one in Guangdong and one in Fujian, with
the purpose of trying to assess the likely number of eligible
people, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Census and Statistics Department will also carry
out a household survey which will be conducted between March and
May. The results are likely to be available at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
"This will give us a more accurate assessment of the likely
potential pool of people. Before the launching of this survey and
as it will take a few months for us to produce results, all the
bureau heads will be doing a preliminary assessment of the likely
demand on various services," she said.
</P>
<P>
Next week, the Director of Immigration will be having further
talks with the mainland authorities to agree on arrangements for
the orderly assessment of entitlement with a view to issuing the
Certificate of Entitlement.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we have reached agreement with the mainland
authorities on this front, we will of course make an announcement,
" she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine rebel group agreed
to temporarily set aside the issue of independence to give its
peace talks with the government a chance to move forward, a senior
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Robert Aventajado, presidential adviser for flagship projects,
told reporters here that this was the one thing achieved during
his meeting with Hashim Salamat, chairman of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF), Thursday in Mindanao, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"Salamat said we should set it aside and give negotiations a
chance to succeed. If we impose conditions now, we are
straitjacketing ourselves," Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado, who was sent by President Joseph Estrada to deliver
a peace message to the MILF, said that he and the rebel leader
also agreed on the need for the peace talks to proceed.
</P>
<P>
Salamat also agreed to meet Estrada at a neutral place to
re-establish goodwill between the government and the MILF,
Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said earlier that he would like to meet MILF
leaders when he visit Mindanao later this month, but the
territorial integrity is un-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
The government is also scheduled to start three days of peace
talks Monday with the MILF, which has been fighting for an
independent Islamic state in Mindanao in the past 20 years.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's police
narcotics officers crippled a syndicate in recent two operations
this week, arresting five people and seizing 53 kilograms of

</P>
<P>
The suspects, said to be trafficking drugs from Thailand to

<HEADLINE> Jordan Suspends TV Entertainment Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordan suspended normal
entertainment programs on television soon after cancer-stricken
King Hussein was flown home in a critical condition Friday morning
from a U.S. hospital.
</P>
<P>
Channel one and Channel two of the Jordan TV terminated their
broadcastings of commercial advertisements, TV drama series and
routine entertainment programs, to put up the same show, in which
a solemnly dressed religious leader told religious stories and
praised Islam doctrines.
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary move by the Jordan TV was taken soon after
King Hussein arrived home after a second and unsuccessful bone
marrow transplant as part of the lymphatic cancer treatments at
the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Amman airport Friday morning, the
63-year-old monarch was rushed to the King Hussein Medical City, a
military hospital named after himself, for close medical care and
supervision while his health is apparently deteriorating for
failure of part of his internal organs.
</P>
<P>
The king's body has rejected the bone cells taken from his
younger sister Basma and transplanted into his body on Tuesday at
the Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
Hussein left the hospital upon his own will, and was
accompanied by a group of U.S. doctors during his journey home.
</P>
<P>
The king had hinted in 1998, after his cancer was detected,
that he would spend his last days with his people in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
At the Mayo Clinic, Hussein had received a six-month
chemotherapy and the first bone marrow transplant during the
second half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic shake-up over policy differences in January,
Hussein sacked his brother Hassan Bin Talal as his successor, and
named his eldest son Abdullah Bin Hussein as the new crown prince
and heir to the Jordanian throne.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, known for a strong national and Arab sentiment in
domestic and foreign affairs, had been the crown prince for the
past 34 years before he was dethroned by Hussein on January 26.
</P>
<P>
Hussein had delegated all powers to the 37-year-old Abdullah,
except the rights of making amendments to the constitution and
signing major international accords.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah is also an army major general in charge of the most
elite special force of the kingdom that supervises the security
of the Royal family.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt. Worried About U.S. Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Ambassador to the United
States, Antonio dos Santos Franca "Ndalu" said in Washington that
his government is puzzled at and worried about the U.S. policy
toward Angola, the official Angolan news agency ANGOP reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ndalu said this at a seminar organized by the U.S.-Angolan
Trade Council Thursday.
</P>
<P>
ANGOP quoted the Angolan ambassador as saying that his
government could not accept the U.S. policy which is based on
treating the rebel National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) as an equal to the legal government, because the UNITA
military group led by Jonas Savimbi has been mainly responsible
for the renewed civil war in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
"Honestly speaking, my government is puzzled at and worried
about the U. S. policy," the ambassador told the seminar.
</P>
<P>
"In our impression, what the U.S. is saying and doing shows
that the U.S. has been treating the Savimbi group the same way as
it treats the Angolan government, " he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Ndalu noted that the Angolan government still gives
priority to its relationship with the U.S. and has been seeking to
promote these ties in various fields.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has its important interests in Angola," namely trade
and regional security, Ndalu said, adding that the two countries
can reach consensus anyway.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from international economic institutions, U.S.
officials and some diplomats from African states attended the
seminar.

<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Motorola has announced that
China born Chung-ding Tam has been appointed as the first Asian
president of the company's Asia-Pacific region based in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
A citizen of Hong Kong, Tam -- who likes to be known as CD --
started his career with Motorola in Hong Kong 30 years ago. In
1996, he was sent to the United States to manage one of Motorola's
semiconductor worldwide groups.
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely happy to return home," he said at a press
conference announcing the appointment in Beijing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The new job is obviously a major challenge which I look
forward to," he said. "But more significantly, this is the first
time that an Asian, and particularly a Chinese, is on the board
and able to influence and direct activities of the entire company
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"It also means that I'll be heavily involved in China's
interface with Washington, and be able to outline to the U.S.
government China's positive achievements in the world," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"I am not a new comer to China," he said. In 1987, Tam came to
China as a member of a Motorola study team, which was in the
country to discuss cooperation with the government so that
Motorola could contribute to building the electronics industry in
the country.

<HEADLINE> UN Urged for Implementing Resolutions on Kashmir Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Special Committee on
Kashmir of Pakistan's National Assembly Friday urged the U.N. to
get its resolutions on Kashmir implemented and hold plebiscite in
Jammu and Kashmir at the earliest possible date to ensure peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The Committee made the call in a memorandum which was presented
to U.N. representative J.K Robert in Islamabad after the
conclusion of a solidarity march held on the occasion of "Kashmir
Solidarity Day".
</P>
<P>
"We urge the international community to extend their full
support to the suffering people of Jammu and Kashmir in their
difficult struggle against Indian occupation," said the
memorandum.
</P>
<P>
It said the international community, particularly the United
Nations has important responsibilities to promote the early
peaceful settlement of this fundamental issue and to bring about
an end to the tragic saga of the Kashmiri people.
</P>
<P>
February 5 is observed as "Kashmir Solidarity Day" by the
Pakistani people annually not only to express solidarity with the
Jammu and Kashmir people, but also to remind the international
community of the pledge to enable Kashmiris to decide their future
in accordance with their own wishes as stipulated by the relevant
U.N. Security Council resolutions, it added.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum said that in the backdrop of nuclearization of
South Asia in 1998, Jammu and Kashmir have become a nuclear
flashpoint and that regional security situation has become
extremely volatile.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable that India did not accept any offers of good
offices from the international community. It even refused to
receive the Special envoy of the U.N. Secretary General in June,
1998," it noted.
</P>
<P>
All political parties of Jammu and Kashmir also presented a
unanimous memorandum Friday to the U.N. representative on the
occasion in which they demanded of the United Nations that Kashmir
dispute be settled according to the U.N. Security Council
resolutions on Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum further demanded that India should withdraw its
forces from Kashmir and allow international Human Rights
Organizations to visit India-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations should take special measures to stop gross
violations of basic human rights and atrocities being perpetrated
by Indian troops on innocent Kashmiris in Kashmir, it said.

A statement issued here by the office said that the intended

of African Unity (OAU) framework agreement, a peace proposal fully
accepted by Ethiopia," said the statement.

<P>
"Today's attack by Eritrea is a flagrant violation of the
United States- brokered moratorium on air strikes agreed to by
Ethiopia and Eritrea in June of 1998," it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The office said in a similar statement issued Thursday that
Eritrean forces shelled from their positions at Geamahlo on the
Badme-Sheraro front beginning at 6 a.m. Thursday.

Africa arrived in Addis Ababa Thursday and held talks with
Ethiopian leaders in the same day. Sahnoun is expected to hold
talks with U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia Friday.

war.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Accepts No Conditions for Its Admission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen said here Friday Cambodia's admission into ASEAN
should be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Disagreeing with the wording that Cambodia should set up a
senate to facilitate its entry into ASEAN, Hun Sen said if setting
up a senate is a condition for Cambodia to enter ASEAN, he
considers it as an interference into Cambodia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Setting-up of a senate is completely an internal matter of
Cambodia and is a must for Cambodia, but not to please ASEAN but
Cambodian people, he said during the question and answer session
at a public lecture here organized by Malaysia's Institute of
Diplomacy and Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
"What attracts Cambodia most for entering ASEAN is the
principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs,"
Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia's support for Cambodia's entry into ASEAN had
a "high political value."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday after the talks between Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and Hun Sen, Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed
Hamid told reporters that Cambodia needed to fulfill the
requirement of establishing a Senate to facilitate its formal
entry and Hun Sen informed Mahathir that he was moving in that
direction according to the law and constitution of Cambodia to do
so.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nagano to Launch Investigation into Olympic Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- During the celebration of its
first anniversary of the Winter Olympic Games, Nagano will set up
an investigation of Olympic bribery.
</P>
<P>
Yushiro Yagi, secretary general of the Japanese Olympic
Committee (JOC), will lead a seven-member panel to investigate the
city's bid.
</P>
<P>
In a wake of the sweeping flurry of Olympic bribery in the
world, Nagano has burned account books when it was alleged to give
gifts to top International Olympic Committee members and spend
lavishly on IOC officials before Nagano was chosen.
</P>
<P>
An investigation of Salt Lake City's successful 2002 Winter
Games bid resulted in a seires of resignations of top IOC
officials, and now other cities including Nagano also are involved
in the corruption.

<HEADLINE> French Automaker Renault Sees Sales Increase in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The French automaker Renault saw
a 17.33 percent increase in sales in 1998 compared to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Renault's sales figures last year stood at 243.9 billion francs
(about 41 billion U.S. dollars), compared to 207 billion francs (
35 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The increase was due mainly to continuous progress in the
European market, where Renault's Megane was the second best
selling car in Europe last year, said Renault.
</P>
<P>
Renault sales also increased 20 percent in 1998 in South
America.
</P>
<P>
Renault's sale of specialty vehicles reached 2.128 million
around the world, a 15.81 percent increase compared with 1997.
</P>
<P>
The company's sales of vehicles for industrial use increased by
18.84 percent, while both its sales of trucks of more than five
tons in Europe and trucks of more than 16 tons -- Mack Trucks --
in the United States remained stable.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Friday listed achievements of his government since
1994 in his state of the nation address to parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Our transition has been managed with such success that some
generously invoke the imagery of 'miracle'," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, some 30 percent of South Africans lacked access to a
safe supply of water near their homes. Today, after three million
people have benefitted from the government's water supply program,
that has been reduced to 20 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, less than 40 percent of South African households had
electricity, now 63 percent are connected to the electricity grid.
</P>
<P>
He said only about 25 percent of homes had telephones in 1994,
but now 35 percent of homes are linked to the telephone system.
</P>
<P>
On housing, he said despite the hiccups in the first two years
after 1994, the government now has developed the capacity to build
15,000 houses every month.

<HEADLINE> 55,000 Inland Residents Settled in Hong Kong in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 55,000 inland residents
had been settled in Hong Kong in 1998, an official from the Exit-
Entry Administration under the Ministry of Public Security said
today.
</P>
<P>
Among them, some 26,000 people are the offspring of permanent
Hong Kong residents who were born in China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Ministry of Public Security now
examines and approves immigration applications according to a
unified nationwide standard set by the ministry, which is quite
scientific and fair compared with the previous practice of giving
quotas to different provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
"This makes it easier for inland children under the age of 14
to join their relatives in Hong Kong and Macao, while allowing
some inland residents to settle in Hong Kong and Macao to look
after their elderly parents and relatives, who are above the age
of 65 and in need of support," the official said.
</P>
<P>
It is said that during the same period, some 4,390 inland
residents settled down in Macao and 1,770 migrated to Taiwan.

BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said today that news media will play an important and positive
role in increasing exchanges and cooperation between China and the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Jiang met with Norman Pearlstine, editor-in-chief of U.S.-based
Time Inc. and noted that China needs to enhance the exchanges with
the international community in order to further promote mutual
understanding and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He added that China has not only scored remarkable achievements
in economic development, but has also witnessed the rapid
development of its cultural and journalism sectors since the
introduction of reform and opening some 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed his appreciation for Time's commitment
to advancing friendship with China and enhancing the mutual
understanding between peoples in the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Time will sponsor the Fortune Global Forum in Shanghai in
September. Jiang pointed to the significance of the forum which
will be held shortly before the 50th anniversary of the founding
of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Pearlstine praised China's monumental achievements during the
past 20 years of reform and opening.
</P>
<P>
He said Time is committed to offering just and objective
reports on China, as well as to promoting improvements and further
development in Sino-U.S. relations.

<HEADLINE> Security Tightened in Britain After Theft of IRA Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The British government on Friday
ordered the police to step up security in case the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) militants resume attacks on the British
mainland.
</P>
<P>
This followed an admission by the IRA that some of its weapons
had been stolen by dissidents opposed to the Northern Ireland
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Some of the weapons have reportedly been recovered, but the
unprecedented public acknowledgment of the incident has
dramatically underlined increasing tensions within the republican
movement and fears of renewed violence.
</P>
<P>
Following the IRA's statement, published in the Republican News
Thursday, Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam conceded that the
peace process was going through a "difficult period" as the
deadline to form the province's power-sharing executive body looms.
</P>
<P>
"The story about IRA arms theft confirms that," she said. "It
also confirms the need for decommissioning all weapons, and there
is no doubt that we need to make political progress now."
</P>
<P>
The public admission of an internal inquiry confirms what has
long been suspected; IRA dissidents have had access to at least
some of the organization's weapons.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Unionists have suggested that the peace process
may need to be put on hold or "parked," until the IRA and the main
loyalist paramilitary groups destroy or surrender some of their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Decommissioning continues to be a major stumbling block in the
implementation of Northern Ireland's Good Friday agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A top government official in
south China's Guangdong Province has ruled out any "under-the-
table operations" concerning the debt repayment of its bankrupt
investment arm, the Guangdong International Trust and Investment
Corp.(GITIC)
</P>
<P>
Wang Qishan, the provincial deputy governor, said at a meeting
Thursday with 30 representatives from investment administrative
institutions in Hong Kong and Singapore that GITIC's filing for
bankruptcy and debt repayment have followed a legal process.
</P>
<P>
"The court has received the case and there can be no such
things as `under-the-table operations'," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that China's financial system is undergoing
important restructuring to adjust itself to the market economy,
which will fundamentally separate governmental functions from
enterprise operations.
</P>
<P>
Wang disclosed that the province has made a thorough financial
examination of another investment arm, the Yuehai Group, and will
enhance supervision by setting up an asset-administration company.
</P>
<P>
Yuehai will hold a creditors meeting to reveal its new asset
administration on February 28, and has pledged to reveal its
financial report to creditors regularly.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Hits 9-month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar pole
vaulted more than one U.S. cent to hit a nine-month high Friday,
cheered by solid buying by offshore investors.
</P>
<P>
Growing positive sentiment about Australia's economic
performance lifted the local dollar through 65 U.S. cents and to
levels not seen since May last year.
</P>
<P>
"Some very strong buying in the New York session Thursday night
took it up to the 65.00 U.S. cents and further buying here today
has taken it up to 65.20 U.S. cents," Colonial State Bank foreign
exchange manager Peter Whitley said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Australian dollar had put in a very strong
performance on the day on the back of solid, portfolio type
buying.
</P>
<P>
The local currency surged to close at its high for the day of
65.20 U.S. cents, more than one and a quarter U.S. cents above its
close Thursday of 63.90 and well ahead of post float lows of 55.30
U.S. cents reached in August last year.
</P>
<P>
Whitley also noted that investors were beginning to look at
Australia in a more positive light considering the country's
strong economic performance of late.
</P>
<P>
"Low inflation, budget surpluses, strong GDP, all those sort of
things, I think Australia is being looked at in a much better
light," Whitley said.
</P>
<P>
Australia's inflation measure, the consumer price index rose
1.6 percent in year-on-year terms in the December quarter of 1998
and the Australian economy grew by 5.0 percent over the year to
the third quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates, the Australian dollar also gained ground.
</P>
<P>
It closed here at 0.5734 euro from 0.5636 Thursday and 72.73
Japanese yen from 72.31.

<HEADLINE> China's Winter Wheat Hit By Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though the wheat is growing well compared with last year, an
official from the Ministry of Agriculture said, it is not as
healthy a crop as before this winter.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, the drought has hit ten million ha
of wheat-planted land and some wheat in some major wheat-producing
provinces, such as Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi and Shanxi has already
begun to die off.
</P>
<P>
Met departments have also forecast higher temperatures than
normal in February which is expected to worsen the drought.
</P>
<P>
From last September, the Yellow River and Huaihe River basins
and regions of North China have had less than 50mm of rainfall
with higher temperatures exacerbating the situation.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the drought, the proportion of good wheat
seedlings decreased by 0.5 percentage points over that before the
winter arrived, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The drought and warmer weather also encouraged more insects and
plant diseases. In central China's Henan province, for example, 1.
8 million ha of wheat has been hit by plant diseases and plagued
by insects, twice the acreage of recent years.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the wheat crop makes it through the winter safely,
experts attending the seminar have urged local governments to take
measures, such as irrigation and spreading manure, to keep wheat
in good condition.
</P>
<P>
The experts are now further worried about a fall in the summer
grain yield. In 1998, the summer grain yield dropped by 15 billion
kg over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
During the two day long seminar, the experts also discussed
the problems of developing high-quality early rice, wheat and corn.

CANBERRA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A new and reliable blood
testing has been found and should be used for the 2000 Sydney
Olympics to detect human growth hormone, Australia's drugs chief
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Peter Sonsken, an endocrinologist based at London's St Thomas'
Hospital, said he has found a new testing method and informed the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) at the drug conference in
Lausanne Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the IOC did not agree to hold a press conference for
him because it has not decided to accept the test.
</P>
<P>
The IOC said it will no introduce blood testing at the Games
unless a 100 percent accurate test is found.
</P>
<P>
John Mendoze, general manager of the Australian Sports Drug
Agency said that the agency would give a full research for the new
method before it recommends it for domestic testing in Australia.

<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The news media in China have
been urged to boost public awareness of science and technology to
improve people's attitudes and allow proper progress of the
country's legislative procedures.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Fifth "Science Star" News Awards, Lu Yongxiang,
president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) said, "The
spreading of knowledge about science and technology is essential
to improving people's understanding and to helping them become
fair-minded."
</P>
<P>
Supervision of the mass media is playing an important role in
the healthy development of the society, Lu commented, adding that
the correct guidance of public opinion is really needed in China,
which is in a period of both economic and social transition.
</P>
<P>
He said that the mass media has the responsibility to
popularize the new scientific and technological knowledge and
provide the public with information about the sustainable
development of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Lu pointed out that scientific results are only really
effective when they are commonly used in the society and the
resolution of many major scientific issues have involved
contributions from various social circles, including the mass
media.
</P>
<P>
He told the assembled media representatives that their job was
to spread information at all levels.
</P>
<P>
The CAS, as one of China's fonts of all scientific knowledge,
will cooperate with the mass media to help the public get a better
grasp of national policies on scientific principles and policies,
as well as profiling scientists and publicizing the results of
their research.
</P>
<P>
The CAS presented their awards to the editors, writers and
producers of 73 newspaper, radio and television news reports, as
well as of three news photos.

bring "major risks."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Close Weaker on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed mostly
lower on Singapore Stock Market Friday due to a lack of buying
support following slump in regional exchange and the overnight
drop on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) slid down 18.72 points
to close at 1,360.18 points in light trading.
</P>
<P>
The total volume decreased to 158.30 11 million units worth
283.91 million Singapore dollars (about 168.44 million U.S.
dollars), reflecting pessimism prevailing over the market. Falls
outnumbered rises by 200 to 48 with 173 shares unchanged.
</P>
<P>
SembCorp managed to withstand another day of bashing before
ending on a volume of 14.09 million shares. ST Engg was the second
most heavily traded stock with a volume of 10.77 million stocks.
DBS Land was next with a volume of 7.69 million counters changing
hands.
</P>
<P>
SIA F recovered with a 70-cent run-up to finish at 11.80
Singapore dollars. It was followed by SIA 200 that climbed up 40
cents to close at 6.90 Singapore dollars. SIA picked up 10 cents
to end at 7.00 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 headed the descent of the day with
a fall 90 cents to close at 20.50 Singapore dollars. UOB F
retreated 45 cents to end at 9.10 Singapore dollars. SPH 100 lost
40 cents to finish at 19.00 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers noted the market gyrated from Thursday's positive to
negative territory and shares were taking their direction from
regional bourses.
</P>
<P>
They attributed today's fall to lack of buying support that
could prop the gain on the previous day.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of dismal corporate earnings expected to be one of
the worst ever is sparking some jitters, but dealers said it may
just be an excuse to sell during lackluster trading.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Ties With Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, China, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Africa policy
will not change regardless of changes in world situation and in
their respective countries, Vice Foreign Minister Ji Peiding said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a 13-day four-nation Africa tour by China's Vice
President Hu Jintao, who stopped over in Kunming, Ji told
reporters that China's Africa police is based on the common and
long-term strategic interests of China and Africa.
</P>
<P>
During his just-concluded visit to Madagascar, Ghana, Cote d'
Ivoire and South Africa, Hu said that China treasures the time-
tested friendship with African countries and both sides have
always supported each other in their political struggles for
independence and in national construction and world affairs.
</P>
<P>
Citing Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Africa in 1996,
Hu said President Jiang has put forward a five-point proposal for
building a Sino-African relationship of long-term stability and
full cooperation in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He added that China will continue to provide assistance to
African countries without any political pre-conditions.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the four nations highly valued China's policy to
Africa and promised to enhance contacts and cooperation between
the two sides in various fields, with an aim to bring the stable,
vigorous Sino-African friendship into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said China will encourage its enterprises to invest in
Africa, strengthen exchanges with their African counterparts and
explore the new possibilities of mutually-beneficial cooperation
between them.
</P>
<P>
He stated that China will develop various forms of economic and
trade cooperation with these nations in line with the principles
of mutual benefit to make the China-Africa cooperation an example
of the south-south cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China respects the road of development and political systems
chosen by the African countries and supports their just struggle
for national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,
as well as their efforts to maintain internal peace and stability,
Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government will call on the
international community, especially the developed countries, to
pay more attention to Africa's interests and extend economic help
to African countries.
</P>
<P>
China is fully confident that Africa is bound to have a bright
future despite various difficulties at the moment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hu exchanged views with the four African leaders on a wide
range of topics concerning bilateral ties and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-president also briefed the African leaders on
the latest political and economic developments in China,
reaffirming China's resolve to adhere to the policy of reform and
opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Hu began his Africa tour on January 24 with an aim to further
consolidate the traditional Sino-African friendship.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Opera Heads for U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China's famous Beijing Opera
House set off on its first ever trip to the U.S. today for a two-
week tour taking in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington and New
York.
</P>
<P>
The troupe of young performers, who are skilled in singing,
dancing and martial arts, will mainly perform a revised version of
the classic story of Hua Mulan, a traditional opera about a girl
who joined the army and disguised herself as a man. She became a
great warrior and was hailed as a heroine.
</P>
<P>
The story, which is about 1,500 years old, has recently been
released as a cartoon film by the U.S. Disney movie company to
considerable acclaim worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The opera troupe comes under the jurisdiction of China's
Ministry of Culture which is encouraging a revival of the 200 year
old Beijing Opera, and is recognized as the country's main
national performance dance. It is keen to introduce it to the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
Americans and Chinese living in the U.S. will also be able to
enjoy selected episodes taken from other traditional Beijing
operas.
</P>
<P>
Artistic Director Liu Changyu, a famous actress in China, who
will direct performances in the U.S., told Xinhua that she
considered it a really good idea to introduce Beijing opera to
American audiences and to bring this wonderful traditional art to
Chinese people living there.
</P>
<P>
"We have been preparing for the shows for almost three months,
and our troupe has given top priority to the visit to ensure its
success," she added.
</P>
<P>
Liu also expressed the hope that the U.S. tour will enlighten
the American people about traditional Chinese art and culture and
encourage friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the China Beijing Opera House is also expected
to tour Europe in March this year.

MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
undertaking a 45.4-billion-peso (1.7 billion U.S. dollars)
infrastructure program this year to enable the country to recover
quickly from a regional financial crisis.
</P>

In a report published here Friday, Secretary Benjamin Diokno of

to the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), which will
build 29.3 billion pesos (761 million dollars) worth of roads,
bridges, ports and other public works projects.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Transportation and Communications is getting
the next biggest slice of the 1999 infrastructure budget with 6.5

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Launches Reproductive Health Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A project to offer reproductive
 health consultations and medical service to youth has been
launched in Maputo and Quelimane City in northern Mozambique's
Zambezia Province.
</P>
<P>
Consultation and medical service centers will be established in
the two cities as part of the projects, according to Mateus
Katupha, Mozambican Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Noticias daily quoted Katupha as saying Thursday at
the launching ceremony of the project that the reason for the
project was that Mozambican youths lack the knowledge of sexual
and reproductive health, and of their rights and obligations in
reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the lack of education in reproductive
health in schools, communities and families has brought passive
influence to youths who currently know little about reproductive
health.
</P>
<P>
The ignorance has ended in pre-marital birth, mis-carriage, and
high rate of sexual diseases and AIDS, he said.
</P>
<P>
Katupha urged enough attention to be given to reproductive
health education in schools, communities and families.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the project will cost some 2.27 million
U.S. Dollars in the coming two years.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's AD Party Finds Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chief Falae defeated Chukwuemeka Ezeife, former governor of
Anambra State, by 62 votes to eight at the end of voting by an
electoral college in capital Abuja Thursday, media reports said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The electoral college is made up of members of the National
Executive Committee and the national caucus of the party.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the results, the acting National Chairman of the
party, Chief Aya Adebanjo, said Chief Falae would be presented to
the Technical Committee of the alliance between AD and the All
People's Party (APP).
</P>
<P>
He noted that the committee would then assess him along with
the candidates of the APP and determine which of them would be
nominated as the alliance's joint candidate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 15 governors-elect of both parties have endorsed
the alliance between the two parties, saying in a communique
issued after a meeting in Abuja Wednesday they "pledged to work
for the success of the alliance and expressed the determination to
ensure victory at the presidential and the National Assembly
elections."
</P>
<P>
However, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) has threatened to
withdraw from the remaining aspects of the on-going transition
program if the Independent National Electoral Committee (INEC)
attempts to amend the fundamental guidelines for the program.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in capital Abuja Thursday, PDP
National Publicity Secretary Dele Cole said that such amendments
as approval for a merger, joint logo and common candidate list for
the AD/APP were contrary to rules governing the formation and
registration of political parties.

LAGOS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has stressed the need to diversify the
nation's economy and "return agriculture to its pride of place."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the commissioning of the fertilizer blending plant
in Enugu of Enugu State Thursday, he noted dwindling oil revenue
dictated that Nigeria must look for an alternative -- agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The Head of State described the commissioning of the fertilizer
plant as very encouraging, adding that the only way Nigeria could
guard its independence was by looking inwards, local press
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that "if we focus our attention on the local
production of fertilizer, Nigeria can confidently feed itself and
even export food in the very near future."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the fertilizer to be produced at the plant was
suited to the country's soil structure, adding it was a welcome
development.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Minister of Science and Technology Major
General Sam Momah stated that the machines at the fertilizer plant
were all manufactured by Nigerian engineers.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Receives Regional Gas Pipeline Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Secretariat of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has received a draft
report of the feasibility study of the West African Gas Pipeline
Project.
</P>
<P>
This Day newspaper Friday quoted an official statement issued
by the community as saying that a meeting of the Project
Implementation Committee would be held next month in Lome or Abuja
to discuss the feasibility study.
</P>
<P>
Once the study is completed, the next stage will be to
negotiate a concession agreement with the West African Pipeline
Company which will build and operate the pipeline on commercial
basis.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the Ministerial Steering Committee on the project
held last month in Accra, capital of Ghana, expressed its
commitment to the project and the need to "fast-track" its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The project is the outcome of an agreement for the supply and
transmission of natural gas signed in Lagos of Nigeria in
September, 1995, by the governments of Benin, Ghana, Nigeria and
Togo.
</P>
<P>
The proposed project will serve the four countries while the
possibility of including Cote d'Ivoire in the project in future is
also being envisaged, according to the feasibility study.
</P>
<P>
The study was financed by Chevron, Shell Petroleum Development
Company, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Societe
Beninoise du Gas, Societe Togolaise Gas and Ghana National
Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The project involves the construction of an offshore gas
pipeline, estimated at 600 kilometers long, to transport natural
gas from the ELP Terminal in Lagos or any other gas export
terminal to Cotonou of Benin, Lome of Togo as well as Tema and
Takoradi in Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Calls China "True Friend" of Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and China are true
friends in need, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said on Friday
when meeting visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said Thailand is grateful for the sincere help China
extended to the country when it was hit by the financial crisis in
mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
China has contributed one billion U.S. dollars to the
International Monetary Fund as part of the organization's rescue
package for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Chuan also said that the joint statement signed by the foreign
ministers of the two countries earlier Friday will usher the
already friendly and cooperative bilateral relations to a new era.
</P>
<P>
Tang and Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan signed the Joint
Statement of a Plan of Action for the 21st Century earlier on
Friday, which covers all dimensions of the bilateral relations and
serves as a blueprint for the relations in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said Thailand is willing to develop its cooperation with
China in the fields of politics, economy, culture and
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Tang labeled the good-neighborly relations between China and
Thailand as "all-dimensional and all-weather," saying the two
countries trust each other and cooperate closely.
</P>
<P>
He said the joint statement shows the direction and establishes
a framework for the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
As for the financial crisis, Chuan expressed his appreciation
of China's role as a responsible country, which, by stabilizing
the RMB, helps stabilizing the financial situation in Asia and
alleviating the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said he appreciates and admires China's achievement of a
7.8-percent growth of the gross domestic products (GDP) despite
many difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Tang said signs have shown that Thailand has made great
achievements in overcoming the crisis.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to further its cooperation with Thailand in
financial system reforms and to make its efforts on establishing a
new, equitable, rational and efficient financial and economic
order, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang arrived here Thursday for a three-day working visit. He
will head back for Beijing on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> China Draws New Zealand in First Day at Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEN ZHEN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Seeded New Zealand, weakened
with the withdrawal of number one player Brett Steven, was held to
a 1-1 draw by hosts China composed mostly by debutants in the
first two singles at the opening day of the first round of Davis
Cup Asian-Oceania Zone Group A here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Although we lost the first single, I am quite satisfied with
my players' performance today," said the Chinese team captain Wang
Fuzhang.
</P>
<P>
He added that the winning point of the tie lies in the doubles
to be held Saturday.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand number two player Mark Nielsen did not meet much
trouble in first single match, putting his team 1-0 lead in
straight sets with his powerful forehand top-spins and back-
handers. He beat 19-year-old debutant Zhu Benqiang, now ranked 791
th and the highest in his team, 6-3, 2-6 and 7-5.
</P>
<P>
But the fast Chinese Zhang Yu kept his team's winning chance,
evening the score at 1-1. He was fully stretched before defeating
Alistair Hunt, who replaced injured 29-year-old Brett, with his
accurate placements at 6-1, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 4-6 and 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand top player Brett Steven, who is semi-finalist
in Auckland Open three weeks ago, withdrew from the singles just
one hour before the opening single of the tie because of tenden
injury in his right foot.
</P>
<P>
According to the draw made here, world number 100 Brett, the
highest ranked player here, will take on the Chinese number two
player Zhang Yu, who now ranked 567 in the world.
</P>
<P>
However Brett is confident in his team, saying "We can win the
tie".
</P>
<P>
The head-to-head record between the two sides has the New
Zealanders leading 2-0.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepali Parties Haggle Over Election Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The main political parties in
Nepal are all campaigning for election to the 205-seat House of
Representatives on May 3 as announced by King Birendra, but they
are haggling over the election schedule.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Congress (NC), the major ruling partner, prefers
three-phase elections.
</P>
<P>
NC President and Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala called
the upcoming elections a matter of life and death for the party.
He called on all party workers to discipline themselves to win an
overwhelming majority.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism,
CPN-UML) opposes the idea of phase-wise polls. Press reports
quoted President Man Mohan Adhikari as saying that holding
elections in three phases is the prime minister's design which
smacks of conspiracy. "But we will not let Prime Minister Koirala
succeed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There can not be phased polling, there can be no change in the
date after the king declared the date for the polls," CPN-UML
General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
As recommended by Prime Minister Koirala, King Birendra
dissolved the House of Representatives on January 15 and announced
general elections on May 3, the third since the multi-party
parliamentary system was restored in the Himalayan kingdom in
1990.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) and the
two factions of the National Democratic Party (RPP), the main
players in the country's politics, favor polls in one single day
as was the case in the past two elections held respectively on May
12, 1991 and November 15, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's constitution, the king determines the date
for the election on the recommendation of the Council of
Ministers, the cabinet. However, the House of Representatives
Election Act 1991 empowers the Election Commission to announce the
date and time for elections.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Koirala said that it is up to the Election
Commission to decide the schedule for the polls. He said the
government has reached an agreement with the constitutional body
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Dev Prakash Rana, assistant to the election commissioner, told
Xinhua Friday that the Election Commission will make a decision
after convening an all-party meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
He said that 102 parties have been registered with the
commission for the elections.
</P>
<P>
Nepali newspapers said that if the elections are conducted in a
single day, 70,000-90,000 police personnel will be required to man
all the polling booths. But the Home Ministry can mobilize only
28,000 of the 40,000-strong police force at its disposal.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission is not keen on hiring temporary police
as they had been found to be partisan in earlier elections, the
newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
"We're ready to provide security arrangement according to the
decision of the Election Commission," Gopendra Bahadur Pandey,
spokesman for the Home Ministry, told Xinhua Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry has made very well security arrangement
for the election. "There will be no security lapses in the
elections," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Flown Home in Critical Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein was flown
home Friday in a critical condition after an unsuccessful bone
cell transplant during cancer treatments at a U.S. hospital.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Amman airport, the 63-year-old monarch
was rushed in an ambulance to the King Hussein Medical City, a
military hospital named after himself, for close medical care and
supervision while his health is apparently deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
The king`s body has apparently refused to accept the bone
cells taken from his younger sister Basma transplanted into his
body on Tuesday at the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, the United States.
</P>
<P>
This was the second bone marrow transplant Hussein received as
part of the lymphatic cancer treatments at the U.S. hospital, but
his health deteriorated with failure of part of his internal
organs.
</P>
<P>
Hussein left the hospital upon his own wish, and was
accompanied by a group of U.S. doctors during his journey home.
</P>
<P>
The king had hinted in 1998, after his cancer was detected,
that he would spend his last days with his people in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Hussein left Amman for the hospital on January 26, when he was
suffering from recurrent fevers and low blood counts, a symptom
apparently triggered by a recurrence of lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
At the same hospital, Hussein had received a six-month
chemotherapy and the first bone marrow transplant during the
second half of 1998 before he returned to Amman on January 19.
</P>
<P>
During his one-week stay at home, Hussein removed his brother
Hassan Ibn Talal as the crown prince in a dramatic shakeup over
policy differences, and named his eldest son Abdullah Bin
Hussein as the new heir to the Jordanian throne.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, known for a strong national and Arab sentiment in
domestic and foreign affairs, had been the crown prince for the
past 34 years before he was dethroned by Hussein on January 26,
hours before the king left again for the U.S..
</P>
<P>
In a rare move, Hussein, before leaving for the U.S. again,
delegated all powers to the 37-year-old Abdullah, except the
rights of making amendment to the constitution and signing major
international accords.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said he reconsidered the heir to the throne in the best
interests of the nation instead of personal considerations.

<HEADLINE> China's Military Technology Put to Civilian Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China has set up a large
computerized data bank to provide information about military
technical knowledge, skills and expertise which can be applied in
the civilian commercial, business and agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
So far, it has listed 20,000 cross-over areas and will add more
than 1,000 each year.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago a number of military organizations involved in
manufacturing equipment and products and provincial government
departments linked to national defense were invited to explore
ways in which computer networks could be used to categorize
military scientific expertise for the civilian industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
Since then a computer network has been set up across the
country involving local government departments and enterprises
involved in technology work.
</P>
<P>
The program was actually kick-started in 1988 but without the
use of high-speed computers. At that time the Chinese military had
only transcribed a group of 210 procedures and published them in
book form for the commercial sector.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1989 a further 2,336 procedures, which have
enormous potential for civilian use, were on offer and in that
format a total of 3,288 have been written down.
</P>
<P>
An example has been the wide adaptation of scientific research
for growing plants in space which has boosted the use of
fertilizers and improved soil quality, resulting in the increase
of grain output in southwest China's Guizhou Province by more than
100 million kilograms.

<HEADLINE> mee020506hke - Israeli Scientists Arouse New Hope for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
discovered a mechanism that may eventually lead to higher success
rates of bone-marrow transplants, the Jerusalem Post daily
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists of Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science found out
how human stem cell migration works by transplanting human stem
cells into lab mice with weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
Bone marrow transplantation is a last resort treatment
that saves the lives of many patients with leukemia, lymphoma,
and other cancers and blood disorders.
</P>
<P>
In a bone marrow transplantation, a patient receives a
transfusion of stem cells, which find their way through blood
circulation to the patient's bone marrow and then start producing
new, healthy blood.
</P>
<P>
But many transplants fail because, usually, very few stem
cells reach their proper destination.
</P>
<P>
The scientists discovered major elements of the mechanism
responsible for stem cell migration to the bone marrow. In
addition, they succeeded in increasing the proportion of stem
cells capable of reaching the marrow.
</P>
<P>
They found that only human stem cells equipped with a certain
type of receptor, called CXCR4, migrated from circulating blood
to the bone marrow of experimental mice.
</P>
<P>
The receptor enables the cells to travel to an "attracting,"
signaling, molecule called SDF-1, which is released by bone-marrow
cells. It is this molecular "attractor" that guides human stem
cells through the blood vessel walls into the marrow cavities.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found, however, that only a small number of
human stem cells display the CXCR4 receptor on their surface,
a fact that explains why so few stem cells are successfully
transplanted; patients typically end up with only 10 percent of
the normal number of these cells.
</P>
<P>
This low success rate was used to be attributed to what was
believed to be rapid stem cell differentiation. Under this theory,
stem cells that entered the marrow cavity "disappeared" because -
instead of proliferating - they quickly matured into different
types of blood cells.
</P>
<P>
However, the new study suggests that stem cells may also
"disappear" because they lack the CXCR4 receptor and therefore
fail to migrate to the recipient's marrow.
</P>
<P>
The researchers also found that most human stem cells that
don't express the CXCR4 receptor on their surface nevertheless
have the potential to do so.
</P>
<P>
When, before a transplant, the stem cells are treated in a test
tube with natural growth factors that stimulate them to express
the CXCR4 receptor, they will convert into migrating cells
capable of contributing to daily blood production.
</P>
<P>
In the Weizmann study, the technique increased the number
of successfully transplanted functional human stem cells from 25
percent to more than 90 percent.

<HEADLINE> Debt Dues against Pakistan around 200m DLRs: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Ishaq Dar
has said debt arrears against Pakistan are around 200 million U.S.
dollars after the agreement with Paris Club for rescheduling of
Pakistan's debt of 3.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dar said that the debt dues of 200 million dollars would be
paid within a week's time, according to a report by the Associated
Press of Pakistan (APP) Friday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is also totally current with its international donors
and there is no outstanding overdues payable to international
preferred creditors including World Bank, International Monetary
Fund (IMF), Asian Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank and
International Finance Corporation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Even after making bulk of the payment against debt arrears
during the last two weeks, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves
stand at 1.7 billion dollars, said Dar.
</P>
<P>
The Minister made it clear that debt dues were not worth 1.4
billion dollars as an amount of 1.1 billion dollars was already
transferred to the rescheduling amount.
</P>
<P>
Dar said the latest arrangements with the Paris and London
Clubs will take Pakistan out of the debt trap which the country
has been facing for many years.
</P>
<P>
Although Pakistan's financial position was on sound footing
than that of few months ago, yet the hard work and concerted
efforts were direly needed to be undertaken to place the country
on the rails of fast growth, Dar noted.
</P>
<P>
There is no need to be complacent over the recent development
on economic fronts, the minister said, adding that untiring
endeavors were indispensable to ensure stable and sustainable
economic conditions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Resumption of IMF fund and World Bank assistance and
rescheduling of foreign debt worth 3.3 billion have pulled

<HEADLINE> Most Australians Favor Non-political President: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Most Australians favored an
appointed non-political president, a newspoll commissioned by
Australian Republican Movement (ARM) has found.
</P>
<P>
The poll found 59 percent of the 1,200 respondents were in
favor of replacing the Queen with an Australian citizen as head of
state and 71 percent were opposed to the head of state being a
politician.
</P>
<P>
"These are very, very big numbers and they indicate that there
is strong support for the convention model (which advocates a
non-political president)," the ARM's chairman Malcolm Turnbull
told reporters outside the state parliament in Melbourne Friday,
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Turnbull said the model developed by the Australian
Constitutional Convention last year was being put through
parliament and would be put to the Australian people in a
referendum in November this year.
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident results of last weekend's poll, which
showed a majority in favor of the "yes" vote which supported the
convention model, would be reflected at the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Turnbull said the survey showed people were opposed to the
American-style of government where an elected president had the
powers of head of government as well as head of state.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a definite preference for an elected head of
state who was not a politician.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Reveals Positive Signs of Peace With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Friday that the prospects of a permanent
ceasefire with Muslim rebels in the southern Philippines are
brighter after his representative met a rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here, Estrada said he was pleased by the report
from Presidential Adviser Robert Aventajado on the outcome of his
meeting with Hashim Salamat, chairman of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) Thursday in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Estrada said, Salamat expressed his
commitment to implementing a "ceasefire forever."
</P>
<P>
This is a "good sign" that the peace process could succeed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that his government is working on a new peace
formula to make the peace process with the MILF a success.
</P>
<P>
"We are formulating a new scheme to make this peace process a
success, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada stressed that the constitution and territorial
integrity are non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
The government reached a ceasefire with the MILF last Wednesday
after a week-long heavy fighting, which killed over 30 people.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which is fighting for an independent Islamic state in
Mindanao, will start three-day formal peace talks with the
government Monday.

<P>
NICOSIA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus stock market is on
an upward trend and more and more investors are coming into play
tasting the fruits of the bull market, a weekly market review said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The review, issued by the Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corporation Limited (CISCO), said the CISCO All-Share Index shot

<P>
The gains of the last five trading sessions are estimated at
4.9 percent, the second best weekly return within the current

percent gains.
</P>
<P>
The rise in prices was escorted by a similar increase in the

(52.4 million U.S. dollars) for the week.
</P>
<P>
The all-time high record of the daily volume of transactions

<HEADLINE> Ancient Tomb Discovered in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A young farmer has accidentally
uncovered the first Yuan Dynasty tomb ever found in China's
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Jincheng was watering his pear trees in Pucheng County
when he spotted a pit and thought it was a simple cave where wild
animals might hide.
</P>
<P>
After pouring in water to frighten off any animals but with no
response, he climbed in and realized it was an old tomb.
</P>
<P>
Using a torch, he saw that the inner walls were covered with
exquisite murals and frescoes. Later he covered the pit with a
stone slate and immediately reported his find to the local
cultural relics department.
</P>
<P>
An archaeological survey has proved that the tomb was a joint
burial ground dating back to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). The
owner had been a middle-ranking official of Mongolian nationality
while his wife was a Han woman.
</P>
<P>
"The murals are of high artistic value, well preserved and have
retained their bright colors," said Liu Hengwu, who was in charge
of the excavation.
</P>
<P>
The western wall passageway portrays a scene of grazing sheep
and cattle and on its eastern side is a painting of sedan chairs.
</P>
<P>
In the coffin chamber itself, the northern wall depicts a pair
of figures who sit facing each other, while there is a painting of
wine being poured on the western wall. A dancing scene is painted
on the eastern wall while on the southern side is a picture of two
geese flying over grass.
</P>
<P>
Liu added: "These murals vividly portray the life of Mongolian
people, their custom, indoor decoration, household utensils and
architectural style. They are valuable for studying cultural
exchanges between the Han and Mongolian people."

<HEADLINE> Philippines' January Inflation Up by 11.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' year-on-year
inflation in January rose to its 84-month high at 11.6 percent due
mainly to high food prices, the National Statistics Office said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, the office said that the
inflation rate in the first month of the year rose to 11.6 percent
from 10.4 percent last December.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise was mainly due to the 13.2 percent jump in the
price index for food, beverage and tobacco from measly 11.2
percent in December 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
Prices of fruits and vegetables climbed up by 47.5 percent in
the month, the office said.

<HEADLINE> China-Thailand Joint Statement on Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text
of a joint statement signed here Friday by visiting Chinese
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and his Thai counterpart Surin
Pitsuwan on the development of the two countries' all-directional
cooperation toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Thailand (
hereinafter referred to as "the two sides") have, since their
formal establishment of diplomatic relations on 1 July 1975,
conducted smooth cooperation on the basis of friendship, equality,
mutual benefit and reciprocity in the political, economic, trade,
military, educational, scientific, technological and other fields.
The top state leaders, heads of government, and peoples of the two
countries have all played an important role in inheriting and
continuously developing such cooperative relationship, which has
become a good example of harmony and amity between countries of
different social systems. The good cooperation between the two
sides not only serves the fundamental interests of China and
Thailand, but also contributes to peace and development in Asia
and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the 21st century, the two sides agree that they
should, on the basis of their common interests and the friendly
relations they have developed over the past twenty years and more,
further expand their all-directional cooperation and relations of
good-neighborliness and mutual trust, so as to bring China-
Thailand relationship to a new stage of development. To this end,
the two sides hereby make the following statement, which shall
serve as a framework and guideline to be followed and implemented
by the two sides:
</P>
<P>
1. The two sides have affirmed that the United Nations Charter,
the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the principles
established in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast
Asia and other universally recognized principles of the
international law should be the basic norms governing the
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
2. The two sides will maintain close contacts and exchanges
between their state leaders, and encourage frequent mutual visits
and exchanges at all levels, high levels in particular, between
the executive, legislative and judicial departments of the two
sides in the interest of a comprehensive, stable and sustained
development of Sino-Thai bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
3. The two sides have decided to maintain the mechanism of
annual consultations between senior officials of their Foreign
Ministries, through which to exchange views on political issues of
bilateral and multilateral contexts. The consultations will be
hosted by the two sides alternately, and will follow up on this
Joint Statement from a policy perspective. Diplomatic organs of
the two countries will make full use of all occasions to maintain
frequent contacts and meetings with each other.
</P>
<P>
4. The two sides agree to strengthen security cooperation
through confidence-building measures. This will include enhanced
cooperation between their strategic and security research
institutes, strengthened consultations between their military
personnel and diplomatic officials on security issues, exchange
between the two militaries of each other's experience in
humanitarian rescue and assistance, and disaster reduction, and
exchanges of military science and technology as well as
information of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
5. The two sides will, on the basis of the principle of
equality and mutual benefit, expand their friendly and mutually
beneficial cooperation in the fields of trade, investment,
agriculture, industry, merchant shipping, science and technology.

8. The two sides will vigorously promote their cooperation in
tourism, and fight against problems associated with tourism. The
two sides will also work together to encourage tourists of third
countries to travel to both countries.
</P>
<P>
9. The two sides are ready to work together to develop closer
contacts in the judicial field, exchange information and data, and
further strengthen their law enforcement cooperation in combating
cross-border organized crimes, drug trafficking, smuggling,
economic crimes, illegal border-crossing and other criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
10. The two sides respect each other's legal system, and will
ensure that, in case of any lawsuit involving citizen(s) of the
other side, it be resolved in a just and fair manner through
proper judicial procedures.
</P>
<P>
11. The two sides will strengthen their consultations and
cooperation over regional and international issues of common
concern at ASEAN, ARF, APEC, ASEM, UN, WTO and other multilateral
forums, so as to enhance regional and international peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
12. The Chinese side states that it fully respects the
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Thailand.
The Thai side reaffirms that it recognizes the Government of the
People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China,
acknowledges the position of the Chinese Government that there is
but one China and that Taiwan is an integral part of Chinese
territory.
</P>
<P>
13. The two sides are satisfied with the development of
friendly relations between China and ASEAN and its members, and
believe that China-Thailand cooperation has helped promote the
relations between China and ASEAN in all fields. The Chinese side
expresses its appreciation of contributions made by the Thai side
to the closer China-ASEAN relationship. The Thai side reiterates
that it will continue to play a positive role in further enhancing
the China-ASEAN friendly relationship.
</P>
<P>
14. The two sides are of the view that in spite of risks and
challenges, the pursuit of peace, security and cooperation still
represents the mainstream of the situation in their region, and
that, Asian, especially East Asian Countries, after making
necessary adjustments, will be able to gradually overcome their
temporary difficulties caused by the recent financial turmoil, and
Asia will continue to be one of the most dynamic and most
promising regions in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
15. The two sides have realized that the trend towards a multi-
polar world is gaining momentum and the force for peace is growing
in strength, and that it is the pressing call of our times and an
inevitable trend of history to establish a new, peaceful, stable,
equitable, and rational international political and economic order.
And the two sides undertake to make active and concerted effort to
further develop their bilateral relations and to promote lasting
stability and prosperity in the region and in the world as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: King Hussein Flown Home in Critical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein Ibn Talal
was flown home Friday in a critical condition after an
unsuccessful bone cell transplant during cancer treatments at a
U.S. hospital.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Amman airport, the 63-year-old monarch
was rushed in a helicopter to the King Hussein Medical City, a
military hospital named after himself, for close medical care and
supervision while his health is apparently deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
The king`s body has apparently refused to accept the bone
cells taken from his younger sister Basma transplanted into his
body on Tuesday at the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, the United States.
</P>
<P>
This was the second bone marrow transplant Hussein received as
part of the lymphatic cancer treatments at the U.S. hospital, but
his health deteriorated with failure of part of his internal
organs.
</P>
<P>
Hussein left the hospital upon his own wish, and was
accompanied by a group of U.S. doctors during his journey home.
</P>
<P>
The king had hinted in 1998, after his cancer was detected,
that he would spend his last days with his people in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Hussein left Amman for the hospital on January 26, when he was
suffering from recurrent fevers and low blood counts, a symptom
apparently triggered by a recurrence of lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
At the same hospital, Hussein had received a six-month
chemotherapy and the first bone marrow transplant during the
second half of 1998 before he returned to Amman on January 19.
</P>
<P>
During his one-week stay at home, Hussein removed his brother
Hassan Ibn Talal as the crown prince in a dramatic shakeup over
policy differences, and named his eldest son Abdullah Bin
Hussein as the new heir to the Jordanian throne.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, known for a strong national and Arab sentiment in
domestic and foreign affairs, had been the crown prince for the
past 34 years before he was dethroned by Hussein on January 26,
hours before the king left again for the U.S..
</P>
<P>
In a rare move, Hussein, before leaving for the U.S. again,
delegated all powers to the 37-year-old Abdullah, except the
rights of making amendment to the constitution and signing major
international accords.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said he reconsidered the heir to the throne in the best
interests of the nation instead of personal considerations.

<HEADLINE> China's Real Estate in Favorable Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China's real estate index,
which is one way of indicating the industry's health, reached 103.
63 last year, up 3.91 points from the previous year, an official
report said today.
</P>
<P>
The report jointly issued by the National Bureau of Statistics
and the China Business Climate Monitoring Center attributes the
rise to increased investments, a drop in the number of unoccupied
buildings and improved housing sales.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, investments in real estate development totaled 414.4
billion yuan, up 13.9 percent on a year-on-year basis, and the
area of unoccupied buildings decreased by 114.4 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Apartment prices increased in the first half of last year, but
were edging down in the second half of the year, noted the report.
</P>
<P>
In addition to increased investment, the country launched three
building programs for low-price houses last year, which sent the
whole real estate sector soaring. Financial institutions also
provided more mortgages for people willing to buy houses.
</P>
<P>
The real estate index entered a favorable climate in April last
year and since then, the figure has increased to reach a peak of
103.94 points in August and then fluctuating a little until the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The drop is attributable to the decrease in the indices for
land development, finished houses, new housing construction
projects, income from land transfer and investment in real estate
last year.

<HEADLINE> China-Thailand Joint Statement on Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text
of a joint statement signed here Friday by visiting Chinese
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and his Thai counterpart Surin
Pitsuwan on the development of the two countries' all-directional
cooperation toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Thailand (
hereinafter referred to as "the two sides") have, since their
formal establishment of diplomatic relations on 1 July 1975,
conducted smooth cooperation on the basis of friendship, equality,
mutual benefit and reciprocity in the political, economic, trade,
military, educational, scientific, technological and other fields.
The top state leaders, heads of government, and peoples of the two
countries have all played an important role in inheriting and
continuously developing such cooperative relationship, which has
become a good example of harmony and amity between countries of
different social systems. The good cooperation between the two
sides not only serves the fundamental interests of China and
Thailand, but also contributes to peace and development in Asia
and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the 21st century, the two sides agree that they
should, on the basis of their common interests and the friendly
relations they have developed over the past twenty years and more,
further expand their all-directional cooperation and relations of
good-neighborliness and mutual trust, so as to bring China-
Thailand relationship to a new stage of development. To this end,
the two sides hereby make the following statement, which shall
serve as a framework and guideline to be followed and implemented
by the two sides:
</P>
<P>
1. The two sides have affirmed that the United Nations Charter,
the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the principles
established in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast
Asia and other universally recognized principles of the
international law should be the basic norms governing the
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
2. The two sides will maintain close contacts and exchanges
between their state leaders, and encourage frequent mutual visits
and exchanges at all levels, high levels in particular, between
the executive, legislative and judicial departments of the two
sides in the interest of a comprehensive, stable and sustained
development of Sino-Thai bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
3. The two sides have decided to maintain the mechanism of
annual consultations between senior officials of their Foreign
Ministries, through which to exchange views on political issues of
bilateral and multilateral contexts. The consultations will be
hosted by the two sides alternately, and will follow up on this
Joint Statement from a policy perspective. Diplomatic organs of
the two countries will make full use of all occasions to maintain
frequent contacts and meetings with each other.
</P>
<P>
4. The two sides agree to strengthen security cooperation
through confidence-building measures. This will include enhanced
cooperation between their strategic and security research
institutes, strengthened consultations between their military
personnel and diplomatic officials on security issues, exchange
between the two militaries of each other's experience in
humanitarian rescue and assistance, and disaster reduction, and
exchanges of military science and technology as well as
information of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
5. The two sides will, on the basis of the principle of
equality and mutual benefit, expand their friendly and mutually
beneficial cooperation in the fields of trade, investment,
agriculture, industry, merchant shipping, science and technology.

<HEADLINE> Dry Weather Threats Kenya's Tea Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The current dry spell may
adversely affect tea production in Kenya's major tea-growing
areas, said an official of the Kenya Tea Development Authority
(KTDA) here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gerald Munene, KTDA's director, said if the dry weather goes
on, the production would go down by 30 percent, and lack of rain
was a worrying factor in the growing areas, he was quoted as
saying by Friday's Daily Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Although the growing areas hit by the dry weather, Munene was
still optimistic that the long rain season expected in March
would come on time and boost the crop.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tea Board of Kenya, tea production in this
east African country in1998 hit a record high of 294 million kg,
an increase of 33 percent over the previous year due to heavy
rains brought by the El Nino in 1997 and early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is the world's leading exporter of black tea, mainly
going to Pakistan, Britain, Egypt, Sudan, Yemen and other Middle
Eastern countries. Tea is Kenya's leading foreign exchange
earners ahead of tourism, coffee and horticultural products.

<HEADLINE> IMF Mission Expected to Visit Kenya Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- An IMF mission is expected to
visit Kenya next month and if everything goes well, the talks on
a new Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) loan could
resume by the late April to May, the Daily Nation newspaper
Friday quoted an IMF senior official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) hopes to restore lending
to Kenya by April or May if the Kenyan government meets the
conditions set by the IMF, said Fetus Osunsade, IMF's resident
representative in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended its ESAF loan to Kenya in July 1997 on the
grounds of official corruption and poor governance, sending the
Kenyan economy into a recession from which it has not recovered.
</P>
<P>
Two major conditions are required to meet before talks can
restart. One is that a director be appointed to head the revamped
Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority, the other is that the government
submit a detailed report to the IMF on the Golderberg scandal, in
which huge government subsidies were allegedly paid for
fraudulent gold exports.
</P>
<P>
If these conditions are met, the IMF mission would come to
check that the government was implementing its budget as laid out
and that the battle against corruption was progressing.
</P>
<P>
The government gave IMF a report on the Goldenberg scandal last
year but the IMF wants it to include details on how authorities
investigated the alleged fraud.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Passes 1999 State Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 5 (Xinhua)-- The Israeli Knesset
(parliament) passed the 1999 state budget by a vote of 51 to 39
early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The budget, totaling 53.75 billion U.S. dollars, was passed
after the coalition has been secured by 137.5 million dollars in
extra funding.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the budget bill will enable the government to
renew purchases for the health system and military and to launch
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The budget allocates 8.5 billion dollars for defense and 16
billion for social services. Within the social services section, 5
billion dollars are set for education, 3 billion for health
services and 735 million for religious matters.
</P>
<P>
The parliament failed to pass the budget last December due to
internal conflicts and demands for extra funding in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
However, the debate on the budget bill also rocked the Knesset
session which lasted from Thursday night to Friday morning as
Knesset members from the coalition and oppositions provoked one
another into fits of rage.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Dan Tichon tried for many times in vain to
ratchet the tension down a notch.
</P>
<P>
Before the voting, Labor Party Chairman Ehud Barak said Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's economic policy was total failure,
adding that in putting together the 1999 state budget, Netanyahu
surrendered to pressure from the extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Tichon officially announced his departure from the
Knesset after the budget was approved.
</P>
<P>
He has decided to run his own business, not to run in the
upcoming parliament elections in May this year as a member of the
Likud.

<HEADLINE> New Oil Field Begins Production in South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A new oil field in the South
China Sea, jointly developed by oil companies from China, Italy
and the United States, has been put into production, becoming the
10th operational oil field in this area open to foreign
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Huizhou No.32-5 oil field, some 160 km to the south of Hong
Kong, was found in 1996 with oil reserves exceeding 67 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Joint exploration began in July 1998, involving the China
National Offshore Oil Corporation, Italy's Agrip and the U.S.'s
Chevron and Texaco. The Chinese side holds 51 percent of the oil
field's interest and the foreign partners share the rest
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the oil field, daily output is set at
10,000 barrels in the initial stage and is expected to reach to 27,
000 barrels, with the use of state-of-the-art offshore oil
technology.
</P>
<P>
The nine other oilfields in production in the South China Sea
reported a combined crude oil output of 91.25 million barrels last
year, making the area the fourth largest offshore oil producer in
China, after Daqing, Shengli and Liaohe, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Rare Giant Panda Dies in Tianjin Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A rare giant panda died last
night in Tianjin zoo after suddenly falling ill last week despite
the efforts of teams of veterinary surgeons and zoo officials to
save its life.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the 28-year old panda, named Zhai Zhai had
developed symptoms of renal failure but had been quite sick for
several days before, refusing his food and passing blood in his
urine.
</P>
<P>
 Vets from Beijing and Tianjin had desperately tried all they
could do to save the panda's life, including blood transfusions,
oxygen-feed and injections, but failed to save the animal who was
vomiting continuously.
</P>
<P>
Zhaizhai, whose age is equal to over 70 years in human terms,
first came to Tianjin from northwest China's Gansu Province 19
years ago, immediately becoming the zoo's star attraction. He has
even visited Japan as a distinguished guest of a major zoo for
mating purposes.
</P>
<P>
The panda had contracted epilepsy and a cataract due, mostly
to old age, but zoo keepers thought he was also lonely, after his
mate Rong Rong died suddenly in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Animal psychologists thought that a new mate might help to
improve his life and cheer him up. So last month they shipped in a
female panda from southwestern Sichuan province, thousands of
miles away.
</P>
<P>
According to zoo keepers it has been very hard to find a
suitable mate for Zhaizhai since there are now only just over 50
in zoos.
</P>
<P>
After a long search, however, they came across the 16-year old
female, named Lannier, in Sichuan province's Wolong nature reserve,
who had been found starving in the wild six years ago. Her arrival
in Tianjin caused quite a stir and the local government was forced
to bring in police to control the thousands of sightseers.
</P>
<P>
Zhaizhai was very friendly towards her when she first arrived
until he became ill, and now his keepers think that her presence
might have accelerated his illness.
</P>
<P>
China now has about 1,000 such giant pandas in the wild in
southwest and northwest China.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Chinese Children Learn Their Mother Tongue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A book of collected articles
written by overseas Chinese children makes its debut today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Titled "Overseas Chinese Children's Hearts," the volume is the
first of its kind ever published in China. The articles were
written by children aged six to fifteen, some born overseas, but
many who have moved to foreign countries because their parents are
now pursuing their studies there. These children now speak English,
Japanese, French, German, and Dutch in their daily life, and to
many of them China is mysterious and far away, and they often ask
their parents why they can't play as their peers, but have to
spend so much time learning Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"Because we are Chinese people, and wherever we go, we should
be able to speak and write in the language of our motherland," Liu
Lijun, a scholar who once studied in England, told her twelve-year
old son. Many parents like Liu have taught their children Chinese
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has established over 3,000 overseas
Chinese schools which now offer regular Chinese courses for
children and publish teaching materials. The "People's Daily"
overseas edition began a "Learning Chinese" column in 1996 to help
these children further understand Chinese culture, and stimulate
their interest in studying the Chinese language. At the end of
1997, the "Learning Chinese" column grew into a special page which
incorporates teaching methods recommended by experts, together
with children's articles about how they have improved their
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"When I read my daughter's articles in the 'People's Daily', I
feel on top of the world," said Liu Lijun.
</P>
<P>
Li Wenfei, an eleven-year-old girl living in Canada, wrote: "I
will try not to become a 'banana', a person with yellow skin who
cannot speak or write Chinese. The book that debuted today,
published by the Fujian Education Publishing House, includes over
280 articles written by overseas children during the past year,
many of which are being published for the first time.

<P>
HARARE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and the United States
have formed a partnership to find solutions to the HIV/AIDS
pandemic and to support individuals and families living with AIDS,
the daily Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sandra Thurman, visiting Director of the National AIDS Policy
in the White House, Thursday stressed the need for establishing
the partnership to enable the two countries to combat the scourge.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters at the end of her tour to Zimbabwe, which
took her to AIDS prevention sites and orphanages, Thurman urged
Zimbabwe to continue working with U.S. Agency for International
Development, whose 14 million Zimbabwean Dollars (350,000 U.S.
Dollars) AIDS awareness program would be intensified as a result
of the partnership.
</P>
<P>
She said because of the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, her government
had set aside 10 million U.S. Dollars for supporting children
orphaned by AIDS- related deaths in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
She said it would be impossible to control AIDS if people
failed to come forward for voluntary HIV/AIDS counselling and
testing.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China will invest 400 million
yuan (48 million U.S. dollars) in an afforestation project to
improve the ecosystem along the Yangtze, Pearl and Yellow rivers
and also to aid the poor in the areas.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to plant forests covering areas of more than
33,000 hectares in southwest China's Guizhou Province and
northwest China's Shaanxi Province by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Trees which grow fast and have high economic value, such as
paulownia, are preferred. Logging mills to process the timber will
also be built.
</P>
<P>
The project will be funded by Guangzhou Chenwei Investment Co.
Ltd. and Cang Shi Commercial Enterprise Co. Ltd. and
technologically supported by the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences and Chinese Academy of Forestry Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Experts have conducted scientific checks of Guizhou Province at

<HEADLINE> Illegal Immigrants Increase in Singapore in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for Home
Affairs Wong Kan Seng told a workshop Friday that 23,000 illegal
immigrants and overstayers were arrested in the city state last
year, a 65-percent rise over the figure of 14,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wong said at the Home Team Workshop'99 that out of the total of
23,000 people detained, 12,314 were put under arrest as a result
of coordinated island-wide joint operations involving both police
and the SIR (Singapore Immigration Registration) officers, adding
another 800 illegal immigrants and overstayers surrendered
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Wong said the illegal immigrants and overstayers arrested in
1998 came from over the region and the majority stole in via the
Causeway and the Johor straits linking Singapore and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He warned police and home teams not to let down their guards,
saying that the illegal immigrant problem will stay on for some
time as the uncertainty of regional economic situation will lead
some people to make their way to Singapore to look for job and
food.
</P>
<P>
The minister also drew attention to the new situation in which
more traffickers used the sea as a means of entry after
enforcement were stepped up at the Causeway.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Death Toll Keeps Rising in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The cholera death toll in Zambia
has kept rising as the disease broke out last month in this
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
In Ndola, capital of Copperbelt Province in north Zambia, the
death toll has shot up to 12 and the number of cases have risen to
383.
</P>
<P>
Ndola Town Clerk Emmanuel Chenda Thursday confirmed the deaths
and said the measures were being worked out to open another
cholera center in Nkwazi township.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Times of Zambia newspaper quoted Chenda as saying they
were now having about 18 to 20 admissions a day and by Thursday
they had 40 people admitted.
</P>
<P>
In Lusaka, the death toll has reached nine in the last 24
hours. A total of 121 cases have so far been reported in the city
since the disease broke out last month.
</P>
<P>
In Kabwe, capital of Central Province, medical team is on alert
to prevent the outbreak of the disease.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arable Land Continues to Drop in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- In spite of increased
protection measures, China's limited amount of arable land is
expected to have decreased by 200,000 hectares in 1998 from the
previous year, central land resource authorities have warned.
</P>
<P>
China has about seven percent of the world's arable land but
more than 22 percent of the world's population, and, in 1997, it
lost more than 135,000 hectares of arable land.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yongkang, minister of land and resources, told a national
television and telephone conference earlier this week that the
country faces a difficult task in keeping the amount of arable
land in balance.
</P>
<P>
The country's "Land Management Law", which took effect on
January 1 this year, sets a goal of maintaining a "dynamic
equilibrium", meaning stopping the decrease in the amount of
existing arable land while improving its quality.
</P>
<P>
The law embodies the strictest land protection measures in the
world, analysts claim.
</P>
<P>
It says that only the central government has the right to
approve other uses of basic farmland, referring to the minimum
amount of land necessary for meeting social needs, which should
account for at least 80 percent of the arable land in an
administrative area.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that his ministry will this year focus on supervising
enforcement of the law across the country while formulating
necessary rules and regulations.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to get 2.4b U.S. dollars from Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
certain to get some 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in loans to
complement the country's state budget for 1999/2000 from Japan
under the Miyazawa Plan aid package.
</P>
<P>
"I was told last night that Japan will offer 2.4 billion U.S.
dollars as part of the Miyazawa Plan," Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita told
reporters after his meeting with visiting Hubert Neiss, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Asia-Pacific director here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa announced a
30-billion-dollar initiative for Asia named after him when he
attended a meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in
Washington in October. The aid package was initially proposed for
five Asian countries hit by the current economic crisis, including
Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Sources at Ginandjar's office told reporters that the
announcement followed a meeting he had with visiting Japanese
vice-minister of finance for international affairs Eisuke
Sakakibara late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Ginandjar, the aid might be disbursed any time. He
also said that the loans would be used to complement a deficit of
the state budget for 1999/2000 starting April 1, reaching a total
of 9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the 4 billion U.S. dollars have been met from the
project development aid, while the rest of the 5 billion U.S.
dollars is expected to be obtained from Japan, the Asian
Development Bank and the World Bank. And Japan has confirmed
extending a new loan of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said the 2.4 billion dollars in loans were only "the
first stage of the Japanese assistance" for Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"The second stage will be disbursed as co-financed programs
with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank," he said,
adding that the funds from the first disbursement could be used
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Neiss told reporters that the discussion on the new
letter of intent had been completed.
</P>
<P>
The new letter of intent will be first evaluated by the IMF
executives before being signed, Neiss said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Looking For 9 Percent Growth This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Beijing expects to have a GDP
of 220 billion yuan (about 26.5 billion U.S. dollars) and 9
percent growth this year, an increase of 19 billion yuan over the
1998 figure, Beijing mayor, Jia Qinglin, said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report to the second session of the 11th
Beijing Municipal People's Congress, which opened here today, Jia
said that the year 1999 is crucial for China's development in the
next century and that this goal will be conducive to social
stability and economic development, and help increase revenues,
and improve the standard of living, and establish a good
environment for the celebrations, marking the 50th anniversary of
the founding of New China and the return of Macao this year.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Beijing will work hard to expand the domestic
demand and drive the economic growth through investment and
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Fixed assets investment is expected to reach 124.5 billion yuan,
up 11.6 percent; retail volume, 128.4 billion yuan, up 10 percent;
financial revenues, 25.23 billion yuan, up 11 percent; loans to be
issued, 377.66 billion yuan, up 13.5 percent; and retail prices
increase to go up 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that the city government will increase allocations for
key projects, infrastructure and housing construction, and will
have 8 million square meters of housing space completed. Exports
are expected to hit 2.7 billion U.S. dollars, with Latin America,
Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Commonwealth of Independent State
the major markets.
</P>
<P>
He said that Beijing will also plan to use 2.2 billion U.S.
dollars of overseas funds or 2.5 billion U.S. dollars if possible.
</P>
<P>
The city government will place stress on the development of hi-
tech and service trades, encourage that of electronics,
information technology, biology, medicines, and environmental
protection and power-saving projects.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sees U.S. Economy to Grow at 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
predicted on Thursday the U.S. economy will increase by 2 percent
this year and next, much lower than the 3.9 percent recorded last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton described in the annual economic report of
the president the U.S. economy as one whose health could hardly be
better, with strong growth, low unemployment, tame inflation,
rising wages and burgeoning federal budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
"Now, on the verge of another American century, our economy is
at the pinnacle of power and success," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, also forecasts that unemployment rate, which fell to 4.3
percent in December, would rise to 4.8 percent this year while
inflation, which fell to a 12-year low of 1.6 percent in 1998,
would rise to 2.3 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
White House officials said that there were some risks to their
forecasts, notably from the global financial crisis that began in
Thailand in July 1997 and has since spread through East Asia,
Russia and parts of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
But they also stressed that the key factor that has derailed
other recent economic expansions -- a rapid rise in inflation --
is so far absent, suggesting that the current expansion may
continue to roll on.
</P>
<P>
By last December, the U.S. economy has kept growing for 93
months, the second longest expansion since records began to be
kept in 1854. The longest U.S. expansion was the 106-month run in
the 1960s, fueled in part by the heavy government spending on the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
The report repeats the president's argument for using the vast
surpluses the White House predicts over the next 15 years -- 4.47
trillion U.S. dollars -- to shore up Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
"I hope you will support our efforts to save a substantial
portion of this surplus until we have secured Social Security,
stabilized Medicare and guaranteed low interest rates for another
15 years," Clinton said in a speech to business people on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Social Security, the retirement income program established in
1935 and funded by payroll taxes, is expected to go bankrupt in
2032 and Medicare, a health care program for the elderly set up in
1965, will begin to run out of money in 2008.
</P>
<P>
In his State of the Union speech, Clinton proposed devoting 62
percent of the anticipated surpluses to Social Security and
another 15 percent to Medicare.

LOS ANGELES, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A price war in the chip
industry Thursday sent stock indexes spinning lower, according to
reports from both Wall Street and Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 62.31 to 9,304.50. The

</P>
<P>
Intel Corp is leading the race toward lower prices by launching
an aggressive pursuit of low-end PC market share, said Merrill
Lynch chip analyst Tomas Kurlak, who forecasts an intense pricing
pressure concentrated in the low-cost computer market, the core
customer base for Intel's chief rival-- Advanced Micro Devices.
</P>
<P>
Intel shares tumbled 8 9/16 to 130 1/8, while AMD dropped 2
before being halted shortly before the closing bell at 18 15/16.
</P>
<P>
The negatives dogging chip stocks led many top-tier computer
hardware issues. Dell, Compaq, IBM, Apple and Hewlett-Packard
followed in the direction of declining.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the declines to Intel's recent 40-percent
price cut on its competing Celeron chip.
</P>
<P>
Some market pundits and observers have been warning for months
that the high valuations on technology shares, particularly on
those of Internet companies, could not hold up forever. Some
worried that technology had been so responsible for the market's
overall advances, that once the technology bubble burst, the
entire market would cave in.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Seeks $300 Million Credit to Revive Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
consented to a 18 billion Shillings ( about 300 million U.S.
Dollars) credit facility from the World Bank to help revive the
country's tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
The government has asked the World Bank for the money, but it
has yet to get a clear message that how much the bank will
provide, the Kenya Times daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The hotels need money for refurbishment, many firms are facing
collapse and we have to explore ways of giving soft loans," said
Elizabeth Masiga, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Tourism
and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
The money is expected to maintain standards in the hotels to
international levels, market Kenyan tourism in the world and
improve on the fleet network in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The industry faced a record low in arrivals last year and many
tourist establishments faced collapse. The sector is surviving on
the mercy of bankers and other creditors who have relaxed their
regulations, according to economic analysts here.
</P>
<P>
The current situation has prompted the government to enter into
high level discussions with the World Bank to create a credit
line to support the tourism and the negotiations are still in the
process.
</P>
<P>
A financial analyst familiar with the tourism in Kenya said
that once the money arrives, there should be a dramatic change in

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has suffered a
loss of two billion Shillings (about 2.9 million U.S. Dollars)
from the drought which grips most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Iwvata, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and

Addressing the parliament in the central city of Dodoma
Thursday, he said the government has distributed 35,000 tons of
grain to the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the World Food Program (WFP) and the Food and

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Suspends Maize-Meal Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
suspended the issuing of permits for maize-meal exports to ensure
a steady and consistent supply of maize grain in the country, the
daily Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Lands and Agriculture Tobias Takavarasha said in
a statement Thursday night that the suspension was with immediate
effect and that the measure was being taken to ensure that
uninterrupted maize-meal supply local consumers while the
distribution problem was being resolved.
</P>
<P>
He said a review will be undertaken in light of the progress
that will have been made in normalizing the situation.
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes at a time when most parts of the country
have been experiencing a serious maize-meal shortage. The shortage
has been attributed to distribution problems, while some millers
have been accused of hoarding stocks to press the government to
increase the price of maize- meal, the country's staple food.

<HEADLINE> China Values Partnership with ASEAN: Chinese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great importance
to its friendly relations and cooperation with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), visiting Chinese Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan said in his speech delivered in the Thai Foreign
Ministry here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that China considers the establishment of a
good-neighborly partnership of mutual trust oriented towards the
21st century with ASEAN as its set policy.
</P>
<P>
"China's growth will pose no threat to any country," he said.
"We need a long-term peaceful international environment, a sound
surrounding environment in particular, for our socialist
modernization drive."
</P>
<P>
"We in China stand ready to work together with ASEAN countries
to make contribution to maintaining regional stability, overcoming
all kinds of difficulties caused by the financial crisis and
promoting peace and development in Asia and the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Tang said that China-Thailand relations serve as
a model of good-neighborly, friendly and mutually-beneficial
cooperation between countries with different social systems.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the joint statement of the two countries on a plan
of action for the 21st century, which he just signed with his Thai
counterpart Surin Pitsuwan, Tang said there is no precedent yet in
the world that two countries have mapped out in writing a
blueprint for cooperation in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"This statement demonstrates the aspirations of the two
governments and peoples for and their determination in enhancing
China-Thailand friendship from generation to generation," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the prolonging economic crisis in Asia, Tang said Asia
still has its strong points, since "the countries have already
laid a solid foundation for their economy and their people have
not given up their good tradition of hard working and
self-improvement through continued efforts."
</P>
<P>
Tang said the financial crisis has had a number of adverse
effects on China. The year of 1998 witnessed for the first time in
15 years a minus growth rate in its foreign trade volume. In
addition, China was hit by the kind of flood rarely seen in
history.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we have overcome the effects of the financial
crisis, conquered the floods and attained a gross domestic product
(GDP) growth rate of 7.8 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China strives to keep the value of RMB stable even
though the country had to pay a price.
</P>
<P>
"The financial crisis will not stagnate China's reform and
opening up process. We will further deepen our economic and
political restructuring, open wider to outside world, strive to
close our gap gradually with the world's advanced level and
achieve rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Agrees to Increase Primary Surplus, Pledges Lower Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) announced Thursday they had agreed to increase
the country's 1999 primary surplus to over 3 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
In a joint news conference, Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro
Malan and IMF managing vice-director Stanley Fischer said the
initial 2.6 percent surplus agreed on last year with the IMF would
go up to between 3 and 3.5 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Malan also said annual real and nominal interest rates would go
down from the current 39 to about 25 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
He said this year's annual inflation rate would remain well
below 10 percent, although talks with the IMF dealt with raising
the target for inflation this year.
</P>
<P>
Before flying back to the United States, Fischer said a final
accord between Brazil and the IMF would be reached within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
IMF chief negotiator Teresa Ter-Minassian said that the final
primary surplus figure was still being discussed.
</P>
<P>
Malan said a prompt privatization of the energy and the
financial sectors was among the measures that will be taken by the
Brazilian government to meet the goals requested by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said that the Brazilian government should first stop
the price rise triggered by the three-week long currency
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not know when the IMF would be able to satisfy
Brazil's bid to obtain earlier a second payment on its 41.5
billion rescue package.
</P>
<P>
Brazil hopes to receive the second installment of 9 billion U.S.
dollars from the IMF soon. But one of the IMF officer Francisco
Baker said the money would be available only after the fund's
board of directors approves the report being prepared by the team
of IMF technicians, probably in March.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Missiles, Bombs Destroy Iraqi Air Defenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British missiles
and bombs have destroyed about one-fifth of Iraqi air defenses,
most in the past five weeks of clashes between Western warplanes
and Iraqi planes and anti-aircraft installations in no-fly zones,
Pentagon officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Since December 28 when confrontations began between U.S.
warplanes and Iraqi air defenses, there have been 40 Iraq anti-
aircraft batteries that have been hit, the Pentagon officials said.
That is more than those hit during December 16-19 bombing raids
against Iraq, in which about two thirds of the 34 Iraqi air
defense sites were targeted by U.S. and British fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
The officials said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had in recent
days pulled back his least mobile anti-aircraft missile batteries
from the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
They said the question remains whether it was only a temporary
retreat by Iraq, which this year has challenged no-fly zones more
than 80 times by trying to shoot down U.S. British planes.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi government on Thursday reiterated its
defiance of the no-fly zones, which Iraq considers a violation of
its sovereignty. "Iraq will persist in its resistance of the
planes belonging to American and British aggressors violating our
national airspace," the Iraqi News Agency quoted an official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In response, Pentagon vowed to "continue to answer them with
strikes."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that we are having a very grave impact on the Iraqi
air defense system. We have diminished its ability," said Navy
Capt. Michael Doubleday, a Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Pentagon estimates it has reduced Iraq's air
defense system by 20 percent since the mid-December air strikes
known as the Fox Operation.

<P>
LUSAKA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is facing a shortage of
10,000 tons of urea for this farming season, with Eastern Province
being the worst hit.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Friday quoted managing director of Omnia
Fertilizers Maurice Jangulo as saying here that the country needs
a total of 28,000 tons urea but only 18,000 tons have been
dispatched.
</P>
<P>
However, Jangulo said that Zambia would have no problem with
the D-compound fertilizer as the required 33,000 tons has already
been distributed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said his company has distributed most of
fertilizer inputs and is awaiting the rest of the fertilizer
consignment from the Food Reserve Agency (FRA).
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for FRA to buy and release the rest of the
fertilizer so we can complete the distribution program for 98/99
farming season," he said.
</P>
<P>
FRA agricultural support manager, Emmanuel Ngulube, said FRA is
trying its best to meet the farmers' demand for fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer from Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe is expected in
Zambia over the weekend, according to the local newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Dominique Wilkins Agrees to Terms with Magic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Dominique Wilkins, a nine-
time All-Star forward, agreed to terms on a two-year contract with
the Orlando Magic on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the league's new collective bargaining agreement, Wilkins
can be paid $1 million in each of the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
Wilkins, 39, has not played in the NBA since the 1996-97 season,
when he averaged 18.2 points per game for the San Antonio Spurs.
He spent part of last season in Italy.
</P>
<P>
In 14 NBA seasons, Wilkins scored 26,534 points, eighth most in
league history, and averaged 25.3 per game. He was the member of
the first-team All-NBA in 1986, when he led the league in scoring
at 30.3 points per game.
</P>
<P>
Except for the two years that Michael Jordan played baseball in
1994 and 1995, Wilkins was the last player other than Jordan to
lead the NBA in scoring.
</P>
<P>
The signing of Wilkins, the older brother of Magic guard Gerald,
virtually eliminates any chance Orlando had of landing premier
rebounder Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
Rodman last month had said he wanted to play with the Los
Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat or the Magic, but has made it difficult
for teams to reach him directly.

<P>
DHAKA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Two companies of Bangladesh and
India have signed a technical cooperation agreement for production
and marketing of hybrid rice seeds in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed here Thursday between Bangladesh's
Advanced Chemical Industries Ltd.(ACI) and India's Proagro Seed
Company (PSC), covers complete transfer of technology for
development and multiplication of hybrid rice locally, the
Financial Express newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a memorandum of understanding signed with the PSC
in 1996, the ACI has already carried out field trials on varieties
of PSC-cultivated hybrid rice in 40 districts under different
agro-ecological conditions and the trials were successful.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Bangladeshi government has approved the seed
"Alok-6201" for distribution and local production and two other
varieties of hybrid rice seeds are expected to be approved by the
government for marketing and multiplication locally.
</P>
<P>
The ACI has a target of marketing 1,000 tons of hybrid rice
seeds this year, the ACI chairman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ACI chairman said the expected yields of hybrid rice
"Alok-6201" in the farmers' field were six tons per hectare
against the yields of five tons per hectare of high-yield-variety
rice BR-29.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of hybrid rice seeds cultivated in India are
supplied by the PSC, which is now testing the seeds in Bangladesh,
Myanmar and Vietnam, according to the PSC's managing director.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's 59 Districts Hit by Arsenic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Arsenic, a deadly mineral in
water, has so far attacked as many as 59 out of Bangladesh's 64
districts, according to a government official.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Local Government and Rural Development Zillur
Rahman said in the parliament Thursday that the government has
approved a non-governmental organization-aided emergency project
to supply pure water, which would be implemented at a cost of
about 1.79 billion taka (about 36.9 million U.S. dollars) from
this month.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, arsenic-affected tubewells will be
identified and alternative arrangement for pure water will be
made, he was quoted Friday by The New Nation as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the first three years of the project, 400 villages will
be free from the contamination of arsenic, which mixes up with
underground water through natural process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arsenic was in the water of 30,209 tubewells in 61 districts,
he noted, adding that after investigation, arsenic was detected
above the acceptable-level in the water of 7,192 tubewells and
people have been already advised not to drink or use the water for
cooking.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh suffers most seriously from arsenic pollution in the
world and the government has already taken a series of measures to
control arsenic contamination.

<HEADLINE> China Loosening Textile Export Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to loosen
its rigid control of textile export quotas after learning that
competitiveness is being hampered.
</P>
<P>
A flexible quota policy will be used to allow companies that
did well in 1998 to have better quotas this year, said Wang
Shichun, a senior Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation official.
</P>
<P>
The old method of the government giving certain companies fixed
quotas without considering previous export volume was abolished,
Wang announced at the ongoing national foreign trade conference
here.
</P>
<P>
Export quotas are used by countries every year to keep other
countries from exporting too much and causing panic on the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
China's textile exports were worth 42.9 billion U.S. dollars
last year, or 23.3 percent of the country's foreign trade income,
but Southeast Asia has become more competitive after the currency
devaluations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has announced that it will maintain its
economic growth in 1999, after the remarkable 7.8 percent growth
last year, but there are problems in foreign trade if the country
maintains the stability of the yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have repeatedly asked foreign trade companies
to take steps to overcome difficulties by exploring new markets
and improving their management, and Wang said that the ministry
will encourage exports to regions without quota controls and
increase marketable product exports.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Expects More Early Rainfalls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to see
more off-season rain until May, but it will not help much to
alleviate the looming water crisis, the Meteorological Department
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The clash of a high-pressure mass, which spread from China,
with a hot air current above Thailand has triggered rainfalls in
northern, northeastern and central provinces down to Bangkok and
some eastern provinces, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The high-pressure mass will cause a slight temperature drop in
Bangkok and other provinces till the beginning of next week, when
the weather will return to normal.
</P>
<P>
A similar weather pattern can occasionally occur again until
May and will thus bring more rainstorms.
</P>
<P>
However, the off-season downpours will not be enough to solve
the looming water crisis, which is being caused by the step
depletion of water in major reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's raining season usually begins in June and ends in
October. But it is common for some rainstorms to occur in the dry
season because of the clash of hot and cold air currents, the
department said.

<HEADLINE> Xue Leads Chinese Medal Sweep in Women's 1,000m </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YONGPYONG, South Korea, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Veteran skater
Xue Ruihong Friday led a Chinese clean sweep in the women's 1,000m
speedskating on the penultimate day of the Asian Winter Games,
boosting her country's gold medal count to thirteen.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Xue, winner of the women's 500m on Wednesday,
covered the course with a time of one minute 23.61 seconds for her
second gold medal of the Games.
</P>
<P>
Yuang Chunyuan, silver medalist on Wednesday, failed to turn
the tide and came in second again in 1:23.64.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal went to Ling Xuesong, who was fifth on
Wednesday and skated as a replacement for her teammate Wang Manli
today to clock 1:24.23.
</P>
<P>
Japenese Yumiko Soda timed 1:24.33 to finish fourth, followed
by her teammate Narita Aki at 1:25.27.
</P>
<P>
"I was emotional here today, clinching one more gold as a 31-
year-old athlete who is not in her best form and who is to retire
after the Games, so moved for two consecutive gold medals here,"
Xue said after the race.
</P>
<P>
"I was thrilled to leave my beloved sport with double golds in
my hands," she added.
</P>
<P>
"I had planned to quit after the Nagano Olympics because I had
a long career and because I was growing older, but I changed my
mind. I attended the National Winter Games last month and the
Winter Asiad, which proved to be a right decision."

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Suing Government Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese have become more
aware of their rights and People's courts in China have been
handling a larger number of suits against government officials in
recent years, Procuratorial Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Bixin, deputy presiding judge of the Supreme People's
Court's administrative litigation court, recently told the daily
that some 80 people are taking administrative action against the
government each year and about 40 percent of them are winning
their cases.
</P>
<P>
Jiang attributes the increase to the law on administrative
litigation of 1989 and says that courts at all levels have made an
effort to protect people's rights.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the administrative cases involving farmers are on
the rise, he said most administrative cases occur in areas of
medium economic development, and that few people in coastal areas
or western parts of the country sue the government.
</P>
<P>
Cases against township governments account for a large number
of the administrative cases, Jiang acknowledges, and more
government departments at the ministry or commission level have
been taken to court in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Match Exports Growing </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China exported 10 million U.S.
dollars worth of matches to 46 countries in the Middle East,
Africa, and Latin America last year, according to Wednesday's
International Trade News.
</P>
<P>
China's match output has been declining for years to some 15
million cases in 1998 because of the popularity of cigarette
lighters and electric lighters in urban areas, according to the
China Association of Chemical Products for Daily Use.
</P>
<P>
China now has 194 enterprises in match production, 120 of
which are owned by the country, according to the Association, and
many are affected by a shrinking market and poor performance. But
13 brands account for a large proportion of the domestic market
and have been major exporters and suppliers of hotels and
restaurants with high quality products.
</P>
<P>
Matches are still the major form of ignition in China's vast
rural and mountainous areas.

<HEADLINE> Millions of Children Forced Into Sex Trade: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Some Asian countries,
experiencing new economic hardships, report a notable increase in
the number of children being pushed into the streets and into
prostitution, an international child rights group claimed in its
latest study.
</P>
<P>
Although preventive measures are being adopted by some
countries, millions of children are being forced into the sex
trade, said ECPAT International, which means "end child
prostitution, child pornography and the trafficking of children
for sexual purposes."
</P>
<P>
In the developed world sexual exploitation and seduction of
children via the Internet has become a major impediment in dealing
with the subject despite international public outcry against
sexual exploitation of children.
</P>
<P>
ECPAT has urged all countries to enact and enforce legislation
to protect girls from sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, child
prostitution and pornography.
</P>
<P>
Apart from reinforcing legislation, the group has stressed that
commitment from governments is essential to training and
motivating law enforcers and making the courts ready to sentence
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
It said particular care should be taken that judicial
procedures do not aggravate the trauma already experienced by the
children.
</P>
<P>
Alternative means of livelihood to children victims and their
families to prevent further exploitation have also been suggested
in the study.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Complains About Insufficient U.N. Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has complained that it
is not receiving a sufficient amount of aid from U.N. agencies as
targeted.
</P>
<P>
The complaint was made on Thursday by Lieutenant-General Khin
Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council, at a coordination meeting on implementation of projects
in the country with the assistance of the U.N. Development Program
and other U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
"The appropriate amount of the assistance of U.N. agencies
could not be received due to disparaging accusation and blockades
imposed by some western nations with regard to the assistance of
U.N. agencies," Khin Nyunt charged.
</P>
<P>
He called for effective use of the U.N. aid and continuous
assessment of the U.N. aided projects and their implementation,
making sure that they bear fruits.
</P>
<P>
Providing aid to Myanmar are also the U.N. Children's' Fund,
the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Atomic
Energy Agency, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, the World Health Organization, the U.N. Drug Control
Program, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the Economic
and Social Council of Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
In July last year, a similar meeting was held to assess the
projects implemented in the country with U.N. aid.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, which became a member of the United Nations in April
1948, has been getting assistance from its agencies since 1951.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia President Rules Out Referendum in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Thursday ruled out a referendum in East Timor as an option
to decide on the future of the province, The Jakarta Post reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia would press ahead with its offer of special status
with wide-ranging autonomy for the province, but if this was not
accepted, Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
He added that would turn to the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR) for a decision on the future of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The MPR would then have to determine whether East Timor
remained Indonesia's 27th province or not, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government would table its proposal for the MPR to decide
in the assembly's next session in November, should the talks at
the United Nations have failed.
</P>
<P>
"There is no other alternative... a referendum cannot be held
because East Timor became part of Indonesia not through a
referendum, but through an MPR decree," Habibie said after meeting
with House Speaker Harmoko at the Merdeka Palace.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony before 1975. Indonesia
announced the integration of East Timor into the country in 1976
and declared it as the 27th province, but the United Nations never
recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government last week announced a major shift in
its policy on East Timor, offering independence if the territory
rejects Indonesia's offer of special, broad autonomy package.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said the armed forces as the protector of the people
would abide by whatever the MPR decided on East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The East Timorese would still take part in the general election
slated for June since the territory would still be part of the
republic at that time, the president added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas
would leave for New York on Friday for the latest round of
U.N.-sponsored talks with his Portuguese counterpart on the future
of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said that by April the two sides should complete the
autonomy package or model that would be offered to the East
Timorese.

<HEADLINE> State-owned Enterprises Urged to Upgrade Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A number of key state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) have been urged to set up development and
research centers by the end of next year to undertake
technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
"Accelerating the development of new technologies and products
is the only way out for SOEs stranded in a tight corner," Zhang
Zhigang, vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission,
was quoted by today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
He warned that these enterprises will probably lose bank loans
and material supply privileges if they do not pay sufficient
attention to upgrading technology.
</P>
<P>
Analysts commented that Zhang has made the remarks at a crucial
time as China gradually sorts out problems hindering major large
and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that almost half of China's large and medium-sized
SOEs are losing money, as they lack the "technological innovation
capacities" necessary for the sustained development" amidst cut-
throat competition from private and overseas-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is vital for them to initiate technology
innovation programs, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is to render full support to encourage
these enterprises to upgrade their technologies, and set up
additional intermediate agencies to assist during the process,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Another commission official said that China has made progress
in establishing a research and development system. Up till now,
203 state-level and 500 provincial- and city-level such centers
have been approved, and the number is increasing steadily.

BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China plans to use more than 2.
86 billion U.S. dollars of overseas funds to improve the
environment in the final years of the century.
</P>
<P>
The funds will come mainly from World Bank, Asian Development
Bank and Japanese loans, according to Zhu Guangyao, vice-director

</P>

Overseas funds have helped make up for the country's lack of
environmental protection funds and boost its pollution controls.
However, the scale of overseas funds is insufficient, Zhu said,
quoted by the China Environmental News today.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that there should be an effort to use funds for
biodiversity protection and environmental industry and technology.
</P>

China has used more than 3.3 billion U.S. dollars of funds from
the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and Japan in the field

BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Second-hand goods have become a
promising business in China, as people with money often replace
their old-fashioned items with newer ones at a faster pace.

According to the State Administration of Internal Trade, the

annually.
</P>

In order to cater to a growing number of needs, many markets
are providing repair, renovation, and leasing services and some

BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China's pharmaceutical industry
is bloated and too many manufacturers can't sell their products,
the Market Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
It said that in the January-August period of last year, the
pharmaceutical industry reported an output of 113.3 billion yuan,
but it only had sales of 64.45 billion yuan as the market was more
than saturated and many companies were suffering from surpluses.
</P>
<P>
A study of 2,460 companies in July found that they had 17.78
billion yuan worth of stockpiles, a year-on-year increase of 800
million or 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
This has forced many companies to offer discounts that are
estimated nationwide to be worth more than eight billion yuan in
all, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission and the State Drug
Administration have put a ban on any new pharmaceutical projects
and have told local governments not to approve such projects.

Speaker of the House of Representatives (DPR) Harmoko said on
Thursday that Habibie signed into law on February 1 the three
bills on political parties, general elections and the composition
of the People's Consultative Assembly, the DPR and the provincial
and regency legislatures.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko said the house and the government together appealed to
the people, all the nation's socio-political forces and the
political parties to support the June 7 election and enable it to
proceed in a democratic fashion.
</P>
<P>
He said political parties contesting the election as well as
other socio-political forces should work to ensure a safe, orderly
and smooth general election.
</P>
<P>
When the three bills were endorsed by the house on January 28,
government officials said they would undergo a one-month period of
public dissemination before Habibie signed them into law.
</P>
<P>
This was intended to give time to the more than 100 new
political parties not represented in the house to digest the
contents and raise objections and possibly demand revisions.
</P>
<P>
There was no official explanation of the sudden change of
timing in signing the bills into law, the Jakarta Post reported.

<HEADLINE> One Province Does 2.7 Bln Yuan Worth Of Life Insurance Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Henan Provincial Branch
of the China Life Insurance Company set a record last year with 2.
74 billion yuan (about 330 million U.S. dollars) worth of business,
a 55 percent increase from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The central government's various reforms and decreases in
interest rates last year changed the common people's attitudes
about competition and risk and made them see that a life insurance
policy is reasonable.
</P>
<P>
Henan Province has a large population and the largest potential
life insurance market and the rapid development of its economy
raised per capita incomes in urban areas to 4,219 yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Life insurance is the most popular but professionals predict

director of the province's border trade bureau.
</P>
<P>
Major commodities include forestry products, textiles,

<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government
published Thursday its new standards for the production and use of
geotextiles, a new type of building material, to improve
construction quality.
</P>
<P>
A joint meeting of seven central government departments also
called for the popularization of geosynthetic materials that are
already widely used in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The new material is thought to be as important as cement,
timber, steel and iron, and can be used for better seepage
prevention, drainage, and building reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
It played an important role in the fight against the serious
summer flooding last year in China.
</P>
<P>
China has over 200 enterprises producing 200,000 tons of the
new material annually, but neither the amount of supplies nor the
quality meet market demands.
</P>
<P>
The departments, including the State Economic and Trade
Commission, Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Water Resources
and State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision, announced
28 standards for the production and the use of geotextiles.

HANGZHOU, February 5 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
will give priority to the development of about 100 small towns in
its latest effort to accelerate the urbanization process,
according to a provincial official.
</P>
<P>
Special efforts will be made to direct more rural and township

<HEADLINE> China to Build More Homes for Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The increasing amount of both
ageing population and one-child generation in China has been
stimulating a demand for senior citizens' homes.
</P>
<P>
Although an average of 74 percent of the people above 60 are
living with their family, the need for pension houses which can
provide accommodation, medicare and other services is increasing,
according to a China Daily report today.
</P>
<P>
China, the world's most populous country, will have 126 million
people over 60 by the year 2000, accounting for 10.1 percent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
Care for ageing parents used to be provided exclusively by
their children in China since filialty is one of the fundamentals
of the Confucian doctrine which has reigned in the country for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
"Things have, however, changed in recent years," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
As a national housing reform encourages people to buy flats
with bank loans, more young couples who have to live with parents
due to lack of housing or money are capable to move out.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, when the children born under the "one couple, one
child" policy since the late 1970s grow up, more pension houses
will be needed, because every child will have to support elderly
parents and maybe grand-parents.
</P>
<P>
"It would become too much of a burden for the young couple to
care for them," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, whose pension houses accommodate only 0.6 percent of
the old population now, will adopt a new regulation this year to
encourage private and foreign investment in building "homes for
the elderly".
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Construction is collaborating with the China
National Committee on Ageing to work on a national standard on
community planning.
</P>
<P>
The regulation will demand that certain space should be
reserved for pension houses and activity centers for old people
when new residential buildings are designed.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Foreign Trade Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's foreign trade,
including the border trade, in the first 10 months of 1998 reached
3.256 billion U.S. dollars, increasing by 745 million dollars over
the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The latest official economic indicators, issued by the Central
Statistical Organization, show that the country's export in the
first 10 months of 1998 amounted to 888.5 million dollars while
its import was 2.368 billion dollars, registering a trade deficit
of 1.479 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Myanmar-China bilateral trade totaled 305
million dollars, 68 million dollars more than the corresponding
period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's main exports are agricultural, marine and wood
products while its chief imports cover capital, intermediate and
consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has since November 1997 carried out major adjustment of
its border trade policy, turning its border trade into a regular
one and using the U.S. dollar in quoting prices and settling
accounts.
</P>
<P>
The country extends privileges to entrepreneurs who export at
least 2 million dollars' worth of goods.
</P>
<P>
To promote the development of border trade services, Myanmar
has shortened the period required to obtain export/import permits
from one week or one month to 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Myanmar has opened a total of 12 trade points along
its border with neighbors, including six are on border with China,
four with Thailand and one each with India and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The introduction and implementation of these measures have
helped boost Myanmar's foreign trade.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Draws 7 Bln Dollars' Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Myanmar
reached 7.089 billion U.S. dollars at the end of October 1998,
according to a latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The investment, from 23 countries and regions, covers 303
projects with the oil and gas sector drawing the largest amount of
2.296 billion dollars, followed by manufacturing, hotels and
tourism, and mining.
</P>
<P>
The figures issued by the Myanmar Central Statistical
Organization also show that Singapore ranked first among foreign
investors, injecting into the country 1.485 billion dollars,
followed by Britain, Thailand and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar adopted an open-door market-oriented economic
policy in late 1988, the investment environment gradually improved
with foreign investors stepping in.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the impact of the Asian financial crisis,
Myanmar received only 1.25 billion dollars of foreign investment
in 1997, 1 billion dollars less than that in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The country drew over 200 million dollars' foreign investment
in the first 10 months of 1998, accounting for 20 percent and
10.86 percent of that absorbed in the same period of 1997 and 1996
respectively.

BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The China National Nuclear Corp.
(CNNC), which acts as both administrator and manufacturer in the
country's nuclear sector, is going to split into two entities,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
One group will be larger with businesses ranging from the
mining of uranium to nuclear fuel, isotopes, nuclear manufacturing
for both military and civilian use, nuclear waste treatment and
nuclear safety.
</P>
<P>
The other one will take charge of building nuclear power plants,
while tapping other construction markets.
</P>
<P>
Huang Guojin, director of the CNNC's restructuring office, said
that the plan still needs approval from the Standing Committee of
the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the administrative function of the CNNC
will be handed over to the State Commission of Science, Technology
and Industry for National Defense.
</P>
<P>
After the restructuring, CNNC, which now employs over 200,000
people, will be transferred into real enterprise groups. They will
be built in line with requirements of Corporate Law and of a
modern enterprise system, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"The year 1999 will be a landmark for the development of the
nuclear industry," said CNNC spokesman Zhang Weixing, "It will be
a year for the new to replace the old."
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Air Force Learns from Foreign Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- All senior officers and other
top ranking individuals in China's air force have learned advanced
military skills and been trained in management techniques by the
air forces of a number of foreign countries during the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken to train its key professionals for the
next century as quite a few of the divisional commanders are
expected to be promoted to higher positions and have a significant
influence on developing China's military air force in the future.
</P>
<P>
The program was the first of its kind in the history of China's
air force and senior leaders believed it would broaden the minds
of those sent abroad and encourage positive changes in the way
personnel are trained.
</P>
<P>
Those sent on the courses included divisional commanders,
presidents of academies and senior officers from air force bases.
They spent time working with the military air arms of Pakistan,
Thailand, Turkey and the United States through from 1996 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
Now, their briefing reports. which they were asked to compile
on their return, about the differences between the air forces,
their style of command, combat readiness, training of aircrew and
the range of equipment and aircraft, have come to the attention of
Chinese top military chiefs.
</P>
<P>
"We've learned a lot from foreign air forces about operational
training and management that will be conducive to strengthening
our own air force and pilots," said Zhang Baozhong, a divisional
commanding officer.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the visits have helped him understand better the
military strategy drawn up by China's Central Military Commission
and underlined the importance of quickly building up a strong and
highly professional air force.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Information Center for Retired Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A national information center
for retired scientists and technicians will be established in
China to further tap the potential of their talent in life's "
second golden period".
</P>
<P>
The information center will be a blessing for China in its dire
need for scientific achievements, said Zhang Wenfan, president of
China National Committee on Ageing (CNCA), quoted by today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The center will be helpful to half the country's retired
scientists and technicians who have failed to find a place they
have wished for in their professional roles, according to Cheng
Yong, director of the CNCA's policy research department.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the China Federation of Old Scientists and
Technicians (CFOST) indicate that a quarter of the retired
scientists and technicians are working for either their former or
a new employer, and another quarter are staying at home.
</P>
<P>
There were 4.06 million Chinese scientists and technicians aged
above 60 in 1996, 20 percent of the total. Of these, 800,000 had
held senior professional positions, half of the country's elite,
according to CFOST.
</P>
<P>
Education was hindered in China during the cultural revolution
(1966-1976). A vacuum of scientific talents resulting from the 10-
year educational gap will soon appear, said Xiao Zhenyu, a
researcher with the Gerontological Society of China.
</P>
<P>
By 2002, all the people graduated from universities before 1967
will retire, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
The gap between demand and supply of talent will exceed 10
million during 2001-2010, CFOST Chairman Cheng Lianchang predicted.
</P>
<P>
The symptom has already surfaced this year, with China needing
7.5 million more people with college education or vocational
training above the number of actual school graduates, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
China's male professionals retire at the age of 60, while
females are expected to leave their posts at 55.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Minister Calls Debt Cut Uphill Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- It is very difficult for the
Indonesian government to reduce the country's foreign debt in its
1999/2000 budget as the national economy is still in crisis,
Finance Minister Bambang Subianto said.
</P>
<P>
"Reducing foreign debts will be very difficult although there
are two alternatives," Subianto said at a plenary session of the
House of Representatives on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two alternatives were increasing the domestic revenue and
reducing expenditure, both for routine and development purposes.
</P>
<P>
"Both alternatives are hard to implement," the minister was
quoted by Antara News Agency Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the 1999/2000 State Budget starting April 1, foreign debt is
set at 77.4 trillion rupiah (9.1 billion U.S. dollars) or 55
percent of domestic revenue.
</P>
<P>
Foreign debt will be used for activating the economy which had
become stagnant because of the crisis, Subianto said.
</P>
<P>
The government had been rescheduling the country's foreign debt
due in 1999/2000 so that the repayments would not burden the state
budget.
</P>
<P>
"The debt due for repayment include bilateral loans worth 0.8
billion U.S. dollars and export credit facilities worth 1.9
billion U.S. dollars," Subianto said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on debt rescheduling was reached at a meeting
with creditors in September 1998, he added.

<P>
CHONGQING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation Limited is to move its China headquarters to
Shanghai by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The move is in response to the rapid development of the bank's
business in the Chinese mainland, a senior bank official revealed
at a recent ceremony marking the establishment of the bank's
Chongqing office.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, one of
the largest banks in Asia, has more than 600 offices in 32
countries and regions. It was also among the first group of
overseas banks allowed to open offices in China after the
initiation of the reform and opening policy in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The bank established a representative office in Beijing in 1980
and later upgraded it to a branch. The bank now has eight branches
and three offices throughout China with a staff of over 800.
</P>
<P>
Its branches in Shanghai and Shenzhen are also among the few
foreign banks authorized to engage in business using the Chinese
yuan as currency.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Ping'an Street to Be Modeled on Ancient Dynasty Styles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The national capital of Beijing
is rebuilding its Ping'an Street connecting the city's east and
west downtown districts in the styles of the Ming (1368-1644) and
Qing (1644-1911) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Municipal Government sources said that the 7-kilometer
Ping'an Street, dubbed the second Chang'an Street, the city's main
east-west thoroughfare, will have a road width of 33 meters with
six lanes, and will have many modern features when it is completed
in August.
</P>
<P>
By then, the street will handle some 4,000 motor vehicles per
hour, and traffic congestion in the central part of Beijing will
be greatly alleviated.
</P>
<P>
The street now has a dozen cultural and historical sites under
state or the municipal protection. To insure that the new street
blends with the well-preserved ancient sites, municipal
departments have set strict design requirements.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the structures on both sides of the street will be
low-rise buildings under nine meters high, with the color limited
mainly to light grey, and overpasses will not be allowed along
this corridor. Only double-arm lampposts and unified commercial
ads will be allowed on the new Ping'an.
</P>
<P>
The design, which has won the approval of experts, also follows
detailed stipulations concerning the tiles, walls, roofs and
decorations for shops and bungalows lining the street.
</P>
<P>
This entire construction project will cost 2.7 billion yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Health Ministry
will launch next month a nationwide campaign against tuberculosis
next month.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to diagnose at least 90 percent of cases by
2001, lowering by two thirds the number of patients and mortality
rates before 2007.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 Brazilians die every day from tuberculosis --
over 5,800 a year -- while about 90,000 more people catch the
disease every year.
</P>
<P>
Sao Paulo State registers the highest number of cases, with 18,
000 new cases and 1,500 tuberculosis-related deaths annually. Rio

ROME, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's new ambassador to Rome
said Thursday that he was confident the two countries could
restore the excellent relations disrupted by the dispute over
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the excellent relations between Italy and Turkey
in the past, I am sure it will be easy and possible to return to
the previous situation," Nekati Utkan told the press as he arrived
Thursday at Rome airport.
</P>
<P>
He said that his job was to find ways to "promote friendship
and cooperation between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The arrival of Ocalan in Italy on November 12 last year sparked
a diplomatic incident after Rome refused Turkey's demand for his
extradition for trial on terrorism charges.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan left Rome on January 16 and now reportedly lives in
Russia or an Arab country.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Stock Market Fluctuates Marginally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The stock market in Shanghai
fluctuated within a narrow band in January, with turnover up
slightly from December, according to statistics offered by the
stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Stock Index of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE)
closed last month at 1,134.67 points, down 12 points from the
closing of December. The index's monthly high was 1,174.43 points
and its monthly low was 1,104.5 points.
</P>
<P>
The SSE 30 Index, based on 30 blue-chip shares selected from
more than 4,00 A shares for domestic investors, finished January
at 2,755.78 points, down four points from December.
</P>
<P>
Monthly stock turnover totaled 54.86 billion yuan in January,
which was slightly more than in December but was 30 percent less
than the same month of last year. The volume includes 54.61
billion yuan in trading in A shares and 250 million yuan in
trading in B shares reserved for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the relatively slow market in January to
the fact that many institutional and individual investors adopted
a wait-and-see attitude as the traditional lunar year Spring
Festival, the most important Chinese holiday, approaches.
</P>
<P>
Five new shares were listed in the Shanghai bourse in January,
including one B share.
</P>
<P>
By the end of January, a total of 139 billion yuan in shares
had been issued through the Shanghai exchange, with market
capitalization hitting 1.06 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that trading in funds totaled 7.7 billion
yuan in January, more than twice the figure for December, while
transaction of bonds plunged 31.6 percent from December to 148.3
billion yuan in January.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's central bank
will be revamped following the naming of its new governor, Arminio
Fraga.
</P>
<P>
Only two out of five department heads will remain in office,
State Debts director Paolo Zaghen and Financial System Norms and
Organization director Sergio Darcy.
</P>
<P>
The other three, Claudio Mauch, in charge of fiscalization,
Demosthenes Madureira, from international affairs, and Carlos
Eduardo Tavares, from management, will be replaced.
</P>
<P>
But the five central bank directors will remain in office until
the Senate approves the new candidates.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the Brazilian government has not officially
announced the changes that will take place, as modifications are
expected in the bank's board of directors and in the international
department which could be split in two.
</P>
<P>
The bank could also create a new exchange department, possibly
headed by former central bank official Emilio Garofalo, currently
employed in the Foreign Trade Chamber.
</P>
<P>
Economist Paulo Leme, the vice-president of the U.S.-based
Goldman-Sachs bank, could be named to head the other department in
charge of international affairs and attracting foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Marcio Gracia, a teacher with Rio's Catholic Pontifical
University, could become the director of the monetary policy
department, an area headed by former central bank governor
Francisco Lopes during President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's first
term.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch: IOC to Adapt to Demands of Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic
Committee (IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch said here on
Thursday that the IOC would adapt to the demands of the times.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the closing ceremony of the World Conference on
Doping in Sport, the president said: "Since its creation in 1894,
the International Olympic Committee has never hesitated, giving
the due consideration to political, social, scientific and
technological developments, to adapt to the demands of the times."
</P>
<P>
"It will continue doing so now and in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch pointed out: "United by sport and for sport, the
International Olympic Committee is determined to accept the
challenge it faces to resolve its problems quickly and serenely."
</P>
<P>
The IOC has embroided by vote-for-favour scandal surrounding
Salt Lake City's bidding for the 2002 Olympic Winter Games
recently. IOC's investigation has led to resignation of four
members with five more suspended.
</P>
<P>
Corruption and doping are regarded as the two main problems
which stagger the Olympic Movement. The drug scandal in the Tour
de France cycling race last summer resulted in the opening of the
World Conference on Doping in Sport.
</P>
<P>
After three-day discussion and debate, the conference reached
agreement in such main areas as education, prevention and athletes'
rights; Olympic Movement Anti-doping Code; Uniform policy of
punishment for drug offence; establishment of anti-doping agency;
responsibilities of relevant sports organizations as well as
collaboration between the Olympic Movement and public authorities.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said to press after the conference that he was very
pleased with the agreement of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting was very positive in many fields," he said, "the
most positive field is that the punishment to doping offence will
be much tougher from now-on."
</P>
<P>
Some delegates from EU countries during the conference
questioned the structure of the independent anti-doping agency,
saying that any involvement of IOC members in the agency would
make it doubtful on the credibility and independence of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch expressed his gratitude to the suggestions and added:
"we not only need governments from Europe, but also from other
parts of the world."
</P>
<P>
The issue of uniform sanction policy during the conference also
attracted different views from some international sports
federations. Taken into consideration of the opposition from FIFA,
world soccer governing body, and international federations for
tennis and cycling, the anti-doping conference made a compromise
when making the decision on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The final declaration said:"In accordance with the wishes of
the athletes, the IOCs and a large majority of the IFs, the
minimum required sanction for major doping substances or
prohibited methods shall be a suspension of the athlete from all
competition for a period of two years, for a first offence.
However, based on specific, exceptional circumstances to be
evaluated in the first instance by the competent IF bodies, there
may be a provision for a possible modification of the two-year
sanction."
</P>
<P>
Samaranch highly praised the resolution, saying it was the best
one in Olympic movement history.
</P>
<P>
"It will benefit Olympic Movement. When making the resolution,
we took into account the different situation of special cases
which some IFs may meet," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is to preserve the Olympic unity. In Olympic Movement,
we trust our partners, trust international federations. I should
say the Olympic Movement is more united than ever," added the
president.

<HEADLINE> Romania Sets Up National Solidarity Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government
decided Thursday to set up a social welfare fund called National
Solidarity by imposing a 10 percent tax on all types of gambling.
</P>
<P>
The fund is meant for additional allowance for families with
two or more children, the payment of subsistence allowances, of
additional benefits that do not exist at the moment, as well as
for investments in welfare and social services.
</P>
<P>
The money will be paid by the over 500 companies currently
operating various types of gambling: casinos, lotteries, contests
on television and pooled wagering on sport.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor and Social Security is to cash in 1999
on account of this extra-budgetary fund, around 500 billion lei,
which means one third of the fund got from the state budget, State
Secretary Simona Marinescu estimated.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Rejects Live Testimony From Monica Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate moved
Thursday to bring President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial to a
prompt conclusion, rejecting a last-ditch request by House
prosecutors to summon former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
for live testimony.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senate Republicans also shrank from a plan to
declare Clinton guilty without ousting him from office.
</P>
<P>
With 25 Republicans joining Democrats, the Senate rejected,
70-30, the prosecutors' request to issue a subpoena requiring the
young woman at the center of the impeachment drama to testify in
the well of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
With support from several Democrats, however, Senate
Republicans approved the House prosecutors' request to show at the
trial this weekend "all or portions" of the videotaped depositions
of Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House
adviser Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and White House lawyers would have up to three
hours each to show portions of those videotapes Saturday before
the two sides begin closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in the two
articles of impeachment in connection with his relationship with
Lewinsky. The two articles were approved by the House along
partisan lines on December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, emerging from a closed-door meeting with
fellow Republicans, Majority Leader Trent Lott declared the Senate
was "on track" for a final vote on the two articles of impeachment
by February 12, or perhaps a day earlier. Democrats renewed a call
for a formal censure of the president, but only after the trial
ends with his acquittal on charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
While the drive to end the trial picked up steam, Republicans
thwarted a Democratic request to skip the airing of any witness
testimony and move directly to closing arguments. The idea offered
by Minority Leader Tom Daschle was rejected 56-44.
</P>
<P>
Senators began laying the groundwork for the trial finale,
unanimously voting to admit the depositions into the official
trial record. The three had been interviewed in private by House
prosecutors earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
But they turned away House prosecutors who pressed for live
testimony by Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
White House special counsel Gregory Craig opposed Lewinsky's
live appearance and the release of the videotapes, too.
</P>
<P>
"We think it is a bad idea," Craig told the senators, arguing
the tapes would "produce an avalanche of unwelcome" testimony
"into the living rooms of the nation." He argued that only written
transcripts should be made public.
</P>
<P>
The request for Lewinsky's appearance was expected to lose as
several Republicans already had indicated they would join the 45
Democrats in opposing in-person testimony. "It does not appear
that the votes are there for live witnesses," Lott told reporters
before the trial resumed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the first president in the U.S. to be subjected to a
trial since President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one
vote in 1868. A two-thirds Senate vote is needed to convict
Clinton and remove him from office. No one believes there are
enough votes in the Senate to remove Clinton.

<HEADLINE> US: NATO Needs New Strategic Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The NATO alliance needs a new
strategic concept to meet security challenges beyond the territory
of its 16 member states, United States Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We... need forces, doctrines and communications assets that
will allow us, when necessary, to address the challenges of ethnic
strife and regional conflict that directly affect our security but
lie beyond NATO territory," said Talbott in a speech to the German
Society for Foreign Policy in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
NATO also needed means to cope with threats posed by the spread
of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, set up in
1949 to counter the Soviet Union-led East Bloc, was now less
likely to face European security challenges involving collective
defense.
</P>
<P>
NATO was facing a far more diverse and far-flung set of threats
than it did half a century ago, he said. "In other words, there
are many dangers in the world that can strike in downtown Bonn or
Cologne."
</P>
<P>
Talbott argued it would not be necessary to change NATO's
founding treaty to cover out of area missions at the alliance's
April 23-25 Washington summit. NATO leaders are due to debate a
new alliance concept which the U.S. wants to expand the range of
possible missions.

"The framers of the Washington Treaty were careful not to
impose arbitrary functional or geographical limits on what the
alliance could do to protect its security," said Talbott.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed NATO remained a consensus organization. "We do
not go anywhere as an alliance unless all our members want us to
go there."
</P>
<P>
NATO, he said, should also not act in isolation from, or in
defiance of the United Nations or the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we must be careful not to subordinate NATO
to any other international body," said Talbott. "The alliance must
reserve the right and the freedom to act when its members, by
consensus, deem it necessary."

<HEADLINE> Surgical Mission to Benefit Over 5,000 Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S.-based
humanitarian and medical relief body Thursday launched its 1999
worldwide mission to correct facial deformities for over 5,000
children in 18 countries.
</P>
<P>
The Operation Smile started the nine-week mission at the United
Nations in New York, which was attended by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan who said the mission's purpose is the same as the
U.N.'s for the well-being of mankind.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 medical volunteers and 2,000 of their
colleagues in target countries will correct cleft lips, cleft
palates and other deformities for children in the Americas,
Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Besides providing free treatment to children, the mission
trains local medical professionals and provides necessary
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Since it was founded in 1982 by Dr. William Magee and his wife
Kathleen, the Operation Smile has treated over 45,000 children
around the world.
</P>
<P>
One out of 500 children is born with a correctable facial
deformity, which may lead to debilitating medical complications,
such as mulnutrition, infections and diseases in addition to
emotional trauma and social isolation.
</P>
<P>
A surgical procedure costs about 750 U.S. dollars and takes
less than an hour on an average, according to the Operation Smile
which plans to do some 10,000 operations this year.

<HEADLINE> Israel Says Palestinians Not Fulfilling Wye Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Israeli U.N. envoy
Dore Gold said Israel had made tangible concessions of land and it
had completed protocols over a new Palestinian airport and
industrial park.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, with the exception of the modification of the
PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) Charter and the enactment
of a partial anti-incitement law, the PLO has not fulfilled any of
its obligations that appear in the Wye River Memorandum," Gold
said.
</P>
<P>
"Israel cannot ignore Palestinian noncompliance any more than
it will reject signed peace agreement, " the Israeli envoy said.
</P>
<P>
"The only choice for Israel is to say yes to peace, but to
insist on peace with reciprocity ... that is, Israel will go
forward if the Palestinians implement their obligations as
well," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Wye accord was signed in Washington in October by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations General Assembly on Friday will resume the
tenth emergency special session to consider "Illegal Israeli
actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied
Palestinian Territory" which was sponsored by the Group of Arab
States and supported by the Movement of Non-Alignment Countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Rejects Live Testimony from Monica Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate moved
Thursday to bring President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial to a
prompt conclusion, rejecting a last-ditch request by House
prosecutors to summon former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
for live testimony.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senate Republicans also shrank from a plan to
declare Clinton guilty without ousting him from office.
</P>
<P>
With 25 Republicans joining Democrats, the Senate rejected,
70-30, the prosecutors' request to issue a subpoena requiring the
young woman at the center of the impeachment drama to testify in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
With support from several Democrats, however, Senate
Republicans approved the House prosecutors' request to show at the
trial this weekend "all or portions" of the videotaped depositions
of Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House
adviser Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and White House lawyers would have up to three
hours each to show portions of those videotapes on Saturday before
the two sides begin closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in the two
articles of impeachment in connection with his relationship with
Lewinsky. The two articles were approved by the House along
partisan lines on December 19 last year.
