<HEADLINE> EC Issues Green Paper for Noise Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has proposed its first step in a noise abatement program by
launching a green paper on future noise policy.
</P>
<P>
The EC hereby wants to stimulate public discussion on the
matter by outlining options for action at the EC level as well as
areas where the EC action will be of added value in cooperation
with its member states and local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Such options include the creation of a new framework based on
shared responsibility involving target setting, monitoring of
progress and improved data collection and comparability across the
European Union (EU) countries.
</P>
<P>
The new framework will entail future community action in the
fields of assessing methods of noise exposure, actions to further
reduce noise from road, rail and air transport, as well as
simplification of legislation on noise from outdoor equipment.
</P>
<P>
Around 80 million EU citizens are suffering from unacceptable
noise levels. The EC intends to improve the situation and bring
the number down.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Likely to Regain Consciousness on Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
who underwent a heart by-pass surgery earlier today, is expected
to regain consciousness on Wednesday, the surgeon in charge of
the operation said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Renat Akchurin, head of the team of 12 surgeons and
experts who performed the operation on Yeltsin, told a news
conference after surgery that the operation had ended "quite
successfully and no exclusive situations had arisen in the
process."
</P>
<P>
He added that the president might regain consciousness on
Wednesday after the effect of the anaesthesia ended, and he would
be able to breathe without the assistance of the breathing machine.
</P>
<P>
According to Akchurin, there was every reason for saying
Yeltsin's "heart muscle can function actively." During surgery,
the president's heart was stopped for 68 minutes and blood and
oxygen were supplied to organs from an artificial source, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, a ventilator was used to help the president
breathe, which was a normal procedure after surgery of this sort,
the professor said. Doctors would be able to decide on the exact
time for removing the artificial breathing machine on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Asked when Yeltsin would be able to return to normal activity,
Akchurin said it would be possible to make forecasts only on the
fifth or sixth day after surgery.
</P>
<P>
He said that the progress and phases of the post-operation
period in Yeltsin's health would depend on a cluster of factors.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that primary factors are "how well the heart works
in the early post-operation period, how much blood was transfused,
how the lungs respond to this blood transfusion and how the lungs
are able to gradually take over the functions of the artificial
respiration apparatus."
</P>
<P>
He said coronary by-pass operations lasted not less than six
hours "in good clinics", and the initial post-operation recovery
took at least 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's heart operation lasted seven hours, starting at 0400
GMT and ended at 1100 GMT.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the process of the operation, Akchurin told
reporters: "I was making efforts to forget that it was the
president. I regarded him as my patient."
</P>
<P>
The professor also thanked all his Russian and foreign
colleagues who had helped both in preparing for the surgery and in
the course of the operation.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The president of Pakistan dismissed the government of
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on charges of corruption, abuse of
power, intimidation of the judiciary and a breakdown of law and
order.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton in a final campaign gallop across the
country, called on his supporters to "saize the day." Bob Dole,
his voice so hoarse that others had to do much of his speaking
for him, swept through the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Campaign '96 ended yesterday amid strong indications that
voters were either bored or unhappy with the quality of the
presidential race, but keenly engaged in many local and
statewide battles that could reshape statehouses and determine
which party controls Congress.
</P>
<P>
-- Kremlin spokesman said Boris Yeltsin's heart bypass
surgery could take place in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Merck &AMP; Co. has spent more than $1 billion over the past
decade to create Crixivan, one of the most promising drugs ever
to attack AIDS. It has paid off.
</P>
<P>
-- The last days of the race saw a role reversal for the
leading presidential contenders, with Dole embarked on a loosely
scheduled, round-the-clock campaign marathon and Clinton's
organization marked by coporate efficiency, Perot ended his
campaign with $2 million of TV advertising attacking the ethics
of both his rivals.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Exports Boosted by Weaker Rand: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's exports
are being boosted by weaker Rand and the current account is
beginning to show a marked surplus, Trade and Industry Minister
Alec Erwin said today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Cape Town, Erwin said the underlying
situation in the balance of payments is in fact healthy because
exports were growing before the depreciation of the currency
early this year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, exports will of course grow faster with the falling
Rand, while imports became more expensive and are beginning to
decline, said the minister, but he did not give any official
figures.
</P>
<P>
South African Rand has lost more than 25 percent of its values
since mid-February this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Erwin, South Africa's imports remain very much
machinery and equipment, a good sign for robust economic growth
considering that investors are bringing equipment in despite
increased prices.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a trade protocol within the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), Erwin said an ambitious target of
six months has been set to finalize the tariff phase-down period.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on tariff reform will soon begin and an
announcement about this could be expected early next year, added
the minister.

<HEADLINE> Feature: "Gaza The Big Prison"  (Part 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, Palestinian self-rule region, November 5 (Xinhua) --
Vending on the beach road that runs through the Gaza Strip, Smail
Mohammad Shamalah wished he could one day sell in Israel -- just
within a reach of dozens of kilometers -- for a much higher
prevailing price.
</P>
<P>
"Only 10 Shekels (about three U.S. dollars) for a large basket
of red peppers here," said Smail, a 47-year-old farmer, pointing
to his harvest laid out for sale, and "150 shekels (45 dollars)
for the same quantity in Israel."
</P>
<P>
Shekel is the Israeli currency still in circulation here and
in the West Bank. Since a self-rule was established in 1994, no
Palestinian currency has been backed up so far.
</P>
<P>
Smail is only one of the nearly 900,000 people confined to the
350-square-kilometer Palestinian Self-Rule strip -- with its
border with Israel closed -- which many locals label as "Gaza the
Big Prison."
</P>
<P>
The closure was imposed by Israel on the Gaza strip and West
Bank in March following a wave of suicide bombing attacks by
extremist Palestinians in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Despite a mounting outcry for a free border-crossing from both
the Israelis and Palestinians, the Israeli authorities,
periodically reassessing the situation, have not decided when the
closure will be lifted,
</P>
<P>
The Gaza Strip had been under Israeli military administration
from 1967 to 1994. Under a Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement,
the Palestinians in the strip began implementing self-rule in May
1994.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the economic mainstay of the local population;
nearly three-fourths of the land area is under cultivation. The
chief crop, citrus fruits, raised on irrigated lands, is exported
to European and other countries. Truck crops, wheat and olives
are also produced. Light industry and handicrafts are centered in
Gaza, the chief city of the area.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been blamed for putting the area entirely in a
state of dependence during its 27-year rule, and its frequent
closure on the strip has made the area difficult to live in.

<P>
"The closure causes us a loss of 6 million U.S. dollars per
day," said Majdi Khaldi, director general of the Ministry of
Planning and International Cooperation of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The loss is inflicted on Palestinian laborers, farmers,
contractors and export-import traders, affecting the life of all
the Palestinian people and the economy in the autonomous region,
Majdi said.
</P>
<P>
Smail, a father of five boys and four girls, said in a bitter
voice that he entirely relies on a 0.3-hectare farm in south of
the Gaza city to feed his children and hardly affords to buy meat
even once a week.
</P>
<P>
Turning saddened eyes to his peppers, Smail muttered, "I would
sell at any price" because it is "better than letting them get
rotten."
</P>
<P>
Isa Sh. El-Qarra, public information officer of the
U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza, confirmed that
dozens of thousands of Palestinian laborers are hedged in here,
pushing the local unemployment rate up to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever we need to recruit a worker or a secretary, hundreds
of applications usually pour in," the officer said.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian journalist working for a foreign press
organization complained he could not pass across to the West Bank
to do his job despite holding the Israeli-authorized press card.
</P>
<P>
According to Majdi, the PNA-planned infrastructure
construction in the Gaza Strip has come to a standstill because
no necessary materials are allowed in. A giant port south of the
Gaza city has been planned as the self-rule region's only outlet
to the sea but still remains in paper.
</P>
<P>
International donor countries are balking at honoring their
pledges. The disbursed international donation for the Core
Investment Program 1996 mapped out by the PNA was only 7.6
percent of the total cost estimated at 551.9 million dollars,
official statistics suggested.
</P>
<P>
Sulafa Hijjawi, director general of the Planning center
affiliated to President Yasser Arafat's office, shared the view
that the living condition in Gaza is deteriorating because of the
border closure.
</P>
<P>
She also deplored violence, to which "both Palestinians and
Israelis will be victims," adding "we don't want to go back to
the past of war and conflict."
</P>
<P>
She called for international pressure on the Israeli hardline
government to implement the signed agreement to stop catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli Oslo accords reached in 1993 draws a
blueprint for a peaceful pass from Gaza to the West Bank, but the
Palestinian and Israeli sides are still far apart on details.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Protest Turkish Fighters' violation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government intends
to protest to the appropriate bodies over Turkish fighters'
violation of its air space, government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides said here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the incident took place Monday when two
Turkish F-16 fighters violated Cyprus' air space while taking
part in joint military manoeuvres between Turkish and Turkish
Cypriot forces.
</P>
<P>
He said that this is the first time Turkish fighters actually
land in the airport near the Turkish-controlled village of
Lefkoniko. In the past, the fighters restricted themselves to
violating Cyprus' air space, without touching down, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said that on several occasions Turkish navy
vessels have also violated the Republic's territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Turkish and Turkish Cypriot forces began
Monday a four-day joint military manoeuvres on and around the
Turkish-controlled northern part of the island, with the
participation of around 30,000 troops as well as tanks, ships
and planes.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkish Cypriot sources, the joint military
manoeuvres, which are held annually, would be bigger this year in
response to last month's joint Greek and Cypriot military
exercise.
</P>
<P>
The National Guard, the Republic's armed forces, last month
staged military exercises, code-named "Nikiforos '96", with the
participation of Greece's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Greek navy vessels reached Cyprus ports while Greek air force
jets took part in the manoeuvres.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece reached a joint defense pact in November
1993.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, are at odds over this
eastern Mediterranean strategic island, which has been divided
since Turkish invasion in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Supply of Optical Fiber Running Short </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide supply of optical
fiber is running short due to explosive growth in demand for fiber
optic cable, according to a report of the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
Driven by an expanding market for Internet access and other
high-speed communications links, annual installation of optical
fiber worldwide has doubled since 1993, to an estimated 16.25
million miles this year.
</P>
<P>
"The rate at which the growth occurred has surprised just about
everybody," Clifford L. Hund, telecommunications marketing
director for Corning, the world's largest optical fiber
manufacturer, was quoted as saying. "No one is getting all the
fiber they want."
</P>
<P>
Demand for optical fiber has run about 10 percent higher than
production in the last year, leaving the supply about 1.25 million
miles short of what buyers are seeking, the report said by quoting
a leading figure of AT&AMP;T, the largest U.S. telephone company.
</P>
<P>
Analysts and communications executives are attributing the
acute short supply for optical fiber partly to the tremendous
growth in U.S. demand for optical fiber. Two new national
telecommunications networks with a total cost of 2.6 billion U.S.
dollars are under construction, which are meant to compete with
the national webs of the big three long distance carriers -- AT&AMP;T,
MCI communications and Sprint.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pak President Takes Drastic move to Sack PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari today dissolved parliament, dismissed the government of
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and named veteran politician Meraj
Khalid to head a caretaker administration to supervise general
elections on February 3.
</P>
<P>
In a six-page long dissolution order, the president, who once
was a close ally of Benazir, gave the reasons for the move in
strong word.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the government sought to undermine the
independence of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
He accused the government of killing innocent people in the
so-called "police encounters", which have been regarded as
extra-judiciary killing.
</P>
<P>
The government also deliberately delayed to implement the
Supreme Court judgment on the appointment of judges, which caused
difficulties in court work, and more important, threatened the
independence of judiciary, the president charged.
</P>
<P>
The former government's corruption and mismanagement are also
believed to be main reasons for the president to take such a
drastic move.
</P>
<P>
Benazir and her husband have long been accused by the
opposition as the most corrupted in the country.
</P>
<P>
The opposition disclosed that the couple has bought a luxury
mansion over a sprawling land of 355 acres in the scenic British
town of Surrey near London for a sum of 25 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Though they vehemently denied the report, people in street tend
to believe in the opposition's version as Benazir was never able
to give sound prove that they did not buy the property.
</P>
<P>
The economic situation in the country is far from satisfying.
During the past one year, the Pakistani currency of rupee has been
devalued more than 25 percent against other major foreign
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange reserve has declined from 2.72 billion US
dollars in January 1995 to 865 million dollars at the end of
September this year.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the economic difficulties, the government took
strong measures to induce heavy taxes in order to meet the
conditions of International Monetary Fund (IMF) and get much
needed loans.
</P>
<P>
The government's measures expectedly drew strong protests from
all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
President Leghari, once a faithful supporter of the government,
could not tolerate the scene and advise the government to take
care of its governing.
</P>
<P>
However, Benazir took the president's advice as a threat and in
a number of occasions hinted that the president was involved in
"conspiracies" against her government.
</P>
<P>
Benazir's boldness and words lack of thinking finally cost her
dear. Local media said she was good at turning friends into foes.
</P>
<P>
Asif Zardari, Investment Minister and Benazir's husband, was
reported to have been taken into custody by the army while Benazir
is not allowed to move out of the Prime Minister House.
</P>
<P>
The president named Miraj Khalid, an 80-year-old politician and
rector of International Islamic University, as the caretaker Prime
Minister and announced fresh elections on February 3.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker prime minister along with his 12-member interim
cabinet were sworn in this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the deposed Benazir Bhutto was reported in a high
spirit and ready to fight back through court, though many doubts
if she could win over the court against whom she had been fighting
so hard for more than six months.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the main opposition Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz
Group) (PML-N) Nawaz Sharif welcomed the president's decision,
saying it was what the opposition had been fighting continuously
for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Qazi Hussain, chief of the religious party Jamaat-i-Islami (JI)
which staged a dramatic sit-in demonstration last week in the
capital, also welcomed President Leghari's move.
</P>
<P>
It was hoped that the promised fresh elections would be held in
due time to avoid further turbulence in the country.

<HEADLINE> Traders to Talk on Duty-Free Information Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The world's major trading
powers are close to strike a deal in global talks to remove all
import duties on information technology products by the year 2000,
the Journal of Commerce reported today.
</P>
<P>
A lot of trading partners expect to put the issue on the agenda
at the Trade Ministers Summit in Singapore in December, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
They expect to remove all duties on items ranging from
semiconductors, computers and software, to telecommunication
equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. estimates, global production of information
and technology products is near 1 trillion U.S. dollars and global
trade in the sector is worth around 500 billion U.S. dollars, with
the United States' share close to 100 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Production of such goods is forecast to reach 2.5 trillion U.S.
dollars by 2006.
</P>
<P>
The accord would be a most-favored-nation bound tariff
agreement, and would be subject to rules of the World Trade
Organization. Some politically sensitive items may not be on the
duty-ending list, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
To avoid confusion, it said, the list is drawn up on both a
tariff classification and also by description so there cannot be
any misunderstanding about the products covered.

<HEADLINE> Deputy PM: Egypt, China to Consolidate Ties, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and China, the two ancient
civilizations of the world, can consolidate their long-term ties
upon the commonness they have shared in the past, Egyptian Deputy
Prime Minister Youssef Wali said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wali, who is also agriculture and land reclamation minister,
made the remarks when meeting with Ye Xuanping, vice-chairman of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
who arrived here Sunday evening on a week-long visit.
</P>
<P>
"China and Egypt take the same stand upon many major
international issues of importance," Wali said.
</P>
<P>
"We both maintained that no kind of foreign interference
should be allowed on the pretext of human rights," said the
deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt attaches great importance to the friendship with
China," he said, adding that China has made an excellent
impression on President Hosni Mubarak during his six previous
visits there.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Egypt in May, which
coincided with the 40th anniversary of forging diplomatic ties
between the two countries, has pushed forward the Sino-Egyptian
friendship, he continued.
</P>
<P>
Wali also expressed the hope that the two countries would
further their agricultural cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In response, Ye highly spoke of the social and economic
achievement Egypt has made under the leadership of Mubarak, saying
both China and Egypt are confronted with the task of developing
national economy.
</P>
<P>
Ye believed that deeper friendship and closer cooperation in
the spirit of equal benefit between the two countries could be
realized in the days to come.

</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar

JERUSALEM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said today that Israel should attend a
regional economic conference scheduled to be held in Cairo on
November 12-14, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made it clear that he does not accept the
position that Israel should not attend the Cairo conference
because various Arab delegations have decided to boycott it.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stated his position in a telephone conversation with
Minister of Industry and Trade Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky revealed that the prime minister believes Israeli
delegations as many as possible, should go to the conference,
establish ties and develop cooperation with Arab businesses.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that he himself will go to Cairo and
recommend that Israeli businessmen follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu clarified his attitude after Minister of National
Infrastructure Ariel Sharon announced a few days ago that his
ministry would boycott the conference because of the current
atmosphere in the Arab world. Officials of the Agriculture
Ministry have expressed their support for Sharon's position.
</P>
<P>
But Danny Gilman, Chairman of the Israeli Chamber of
Commerce, have called on Israeli businessmen to participate
in the Cairo conference and exert every effort to make it a
success.

<HEADLINE> Israel: No Major Changes in New Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said today the new agreement being drawn up
with the Palestinians does not differ significantly from the
original one.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the remarks during a tour of the West Bank town
of Hebron to learn "first-hand" information on the problems both
in military and political aspects regarding the upcoming
redeployment of Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
The minister, accompanied by Army Chief of Staff Amnon
Lipkin Shahak and other military officers, held separate
meetings with the representatives of the Jewish settlement leaders
and Palestinian Mayor Mustfa Natsche to discuss the Hebron
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Mordechai blamed the Palestinian
Authority (PA) for the delay in signing an agreement, which
he said could have been signed weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing negotiations with the PA. I think the
other side, the Palestinians, are not ready to come to
conclusion of an agreement about redeployment in Hebron," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he predicted that, after Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat returned from his recent European tour, serious
negotiations would resume to finalize the deal "in a very short
time" in order to continue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mordechai made it clear that the agreement being
drawn up would not differ significantly from the one signed
by the previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
"There are not so many changes. From the beginning, we said
that we were going to follow the agreement that had been
signed. We just say that we must clear about the security of the
Jewish community living here in Hebron, and we have to allow the
Jews that are living here to be able to continue their life and
to improve them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PA strongly rejected Israel's demand for major changes
in the original Hebron agreement, which remained the central
obstacle blocking progress in the talks so far.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai described his meeting with the Jewish settler
leaders as good, which concentrated on issues related to the army
redeployment in the town. He would also hold another meeting with
the settlers on political aspects of the pullback.
</P>
<P>
However, most settlers were angry and upset about the
upcoming redeployment. They complained that Mordechai only held
10-minute face-to-face talks with them.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about possible violent attacks by the
Palestinians following the redeployment, Mordechai said that
Israeli soldiers would be able to respond to such violence.
</P>
<P>
He added that red lines would be drawn for the Palestinians in
order to protect the safety of the 450 Jews who are surrounded by
200,000 Palestinians in the volatile town.
</P>
<P>
A sense of pessimism prevails among the Jewish settlers
pending the redeployment, most of whom predicted more bloody
conflicts with the Palestinians. The settlers have already
decided to hold large protests to oppose the long-delayed
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In another development, U.S. special peace envoy Dennis Ross
is to return here Wednesday in a bid to wrap up the Hebron
agreement. Ross returned to Washington last week after his
three-week mediation here failed to produce an agreement.

JOHANNESBURG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Namibia today called on

crisis of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by the Speaker of National Parliament, Moses
Tjitendero, when he was opening a workshop in Windhoek for
southern African law makers.

troops in eastern Zaire, is not enough.
</P>
<P>
Tjitendero described the situation in Zaire as a threat to
regional peace and it should be dealt accordingly. enditem

<HEADLINE> China's First National Cotton Trade Fair Opens in Zhengzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China's first national cotton
trade fair, representing a major reform in the country's cotton
circulation mechanism, opened today in Zhengzhou, capital of
central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
In the past, cotton has been mainly purchased, processed and
sold by state-run supply and marketing enterprises. Beginning this
year, the State Council has decided, cotton allocation between
provinces will also be managed through trade fairs, but under
state guidance.
</P>
<P>
At the fair, cotton suppliers and buyers can seek out trade
partners under the limits of cotton allocations established by the
central government.
</P>
<P>
The state will also determine guiding cotton prices, rather
than unified state prices, in order to reflect the
supply-and-demand changes in the market.
</P>
<P>
The state stipulates both standard prices and a floating range
for cotton. However, traders can strike a deal within the limits
of the state's set margins.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the national fair, other fairs will also be held
regularly, but no deals are allowed to be made outside these
events.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 600 trade representatives will participate in the
four-day Zhengzhou fair.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng sent a letter of congratulation to the
fair's organizers, noting that cotton is the country's second
major, next only to grain, and is the key material for the textile
industry.

TIANJIN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China's housing industry should
be supported and a housing market be established to meet people's
demand for comfortable living quarters, State Councillor Li
Tieying said today at a meeting on housing system reform held in
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said that the
country's housing reform is advancing steadily. By the end of
June, he said, more than 26 billion yuan (more than three billion
U.S. dollars) had been allocated nationwide for housing funds.
</P>
<P>
Officials from housing reform departments of 23 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Provided with homeowner loans, local employees are more hopeful
about the chances for buying their own houses, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Progress is being made on an affordable housing project
designed to produce high-quality houses at a low price in a good
environment, he pointed out. In 1995, over 10 million square
meters of housing were built in 1995, and over eight million
square meters of houses were sold.
</P>
<P>
Li, also head of the Housing System Reform Office under the

<HEADLINE> Cairo Conference to Focus on Economic Field: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today the upcoming Cairo economic conference will
focus on the economic field and inter-Arab cooperation within a
regional framework, defying all political odds.
</P>
<P>
The third Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference
will give an additional push to sustained development activities
in the Mideast region, Moussa said in statements carried by the
Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
"The promotion of inter-Arab cooperation lies in the core of
the Middle East regionalism," Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it is impossible to diverge politics from
this conference completely, since there is something hindering
the peace process enough to affect the atmosphere. "It will be
shrouded in a certain political atmosphere," said the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo economic conference will be convened at a time when
the Middle East peace process has stuck on all fronts due to the
hardline policy adopted by the Israeli Likud government under
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the minister said there will be an intensive
attendance at the economic sessions due to be held on November
12-14, adding that a number of foreign ministers will also take
part in the opening session.
</P>
<P>
Moussa disclosed that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will
meet with the foreign ministers during the conference and with
his counterparts who will be present on the occasion, according
to MENA.
</P>
<P>
At least 3,000 businessmen, government officials,
representatives of international, regional and Arab economic
institutions and Arab funds from 99 countries, and about 1,200
companies including 400 Egyptian ones will take part in the
economic gathering.
</P>
<P>
The first and second Middle East and North Africa economic
summit conferences were held separately in Casablanca, Morocco,
in 1994 and Amman, Jordan, in 1995.

officials.

and South Airlines, provide the service.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Capping a year-long political resurgence, President Clinton
won re-election, becoming the first Democrat since Franklin D.
Roosevelt to win a second full term. Surveys of voters indicated
that a robust economy persuaded them he deserved a second term.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. officials said they are considering sending some
American troops to Central Africa for logistical support in an
international force to aid refugees caught in the fighting
between Zaire and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton was re-elected to the White House,
boosted to a landslide electoral-vote victory by a growing
economy that tempered the voter anger of the past two elections.
</P>
<P>
Republicans apparently maintained their majority in the
Senate and the House, signaling the prospect of another two
years of divided government that would put clear restraints on
the president in a second term.
</P>
<P>
-- President Boris Yeltsin underwent a seven-hour operation
to circumvent five dogged arteries supplying blood to his heart.
Surgeons and Kremlin officials announced that the operation had
been a success and that Yeltsin regained consciousness.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton won a second term as president in a comfortable
victory over Dole. But he faces a perilous second term with a
host of legal and ethnical inquiries under way.
</P>
<P>
-- Benazir Bhutto remained confined to her home under heavy
guard and her husband was in police custody a day after
Pakistan's president ousted her as prime minister for corruption
and mismanagement.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Prime Minister Goran
Persson today visited Shanghai, China's largest commercial and
industrial city, as part of his ongoing tour of the country.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi held friendly talks with Persson, who
praised the city's rapid development.
</P>
<P>
"I was deeply impressed (by Shanghai's economic growth) and
hope there will be further cooperation between Sweden and
Shanghai," Persson said.
</P>
<P>
This morning, the Prime Minister presided over the opening
ceremony of the Swedish Consulate-General in Shanghai, whose
business sphere will cover the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and
Anhui.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, Persson visited a Sino-Swedish joint venture,
the Ericsson and Simtek Electronics Company, in suburban
Shanghai. He also attended the signing ceremony of a long-term
cooperation agreement between Shanghai's Baoshan Iron and Steel
Group and Sweden's LKAB.
</P>
<P>
Sweden is the first Western country to establish diplomatic
relations with the People's Republic of China. The two countries

aviation, shipping, industry, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 35 Swedish companies or Swedish-Chinese
joint ventures in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Iran Indifferent Toward US Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran said here today that it is
indifferent toward the result of the U.S. presidential elections
and anticipates no change in U.S. policy toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Rowhani, Vice-Speaker of Parliament and Secretary of
the Supreme National Security Council, made the remarks shortly
after the announcement of the re-election of U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
refrained from making any comment on the victory of
U.S. President Bill Clinton, saying "it is too early to make any
comment."
</P>
<P>
Rowhani said that Iran sees no difference on who would be the
president in the United States since both the Democratic Party
and Republican Party peruse the same hostile policy toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iranian specialists on foreign relations believe that with
the re-election of Clinton, four more years of sanctions on Iran
would continue unabated.
</P>
<P>
"A Democratic Clinton in the first four years of his
presidency tried every means to put pressure on Iran. Now he is
re-elected, so four more years of pressure on Iran will follow,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said "the Democrats in the U.S. see themselves a victim of
the hostage crisis which led to the defeat of Democratic Jimmy
Cater's re-election efforts in 1980, and to the subsequent 12
consecutive years of Republican administrations in the United
States."
</P>
<P>
On November 4, 1979, Iran's radical students took over the
American embassy in Tehran and 62 Americans were held as
hostage, which led to the crisis between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Iran and the United States have remained hostile
to each other. The United States now accuses Tehran of
supporting international terrorism and seeking nuclear
weapons. It even threatened to launch a military strike against
the Iranian targets.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Maleki said
that Iran would not have dialogue with the United States no
matter what result comes from the U.S. presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"With this condition, we don't think about the dialogue with
the United States."
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had recently rejected the
call by American government officials for dialogue with Tehran
and called on the whole nation to struggle against the United
States as a religious duty.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Making Brisk Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
is making a brisk recovery after Tuesday's heart by-pass surgery.
</P>
<P>
His spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, told a news briefing in
the Kremlin today that Yeltsin "is rapidly recuperating after the
operation, astonishing doctors by the force of his organism." The
president was impatient to be moved to the Moscow Central Hospital
and to get through the rehabilitation period faster.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the doctors met this morning and concluded
that Yeltsin was stable and his condition satisfactory and
consistent with the surgery.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Yeltsin's arterial blood pressure was in
the range of 110/80 to 120/80 mm Hg and the heart rate about 80
beats per minute, all normal for the operation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said doctors would meet on Thursday to decide
when Yeltsin might be moved from the Cardiology Research Center to
the Central Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The by-pass operation on Yeltsin took place between 0700-1400
hours Moscow time (0400-1100 GMT) on Tuesday. The president
recovered from general anaesthesia around 0640 Moscow time (0300
GMT), this morning.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's family and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin visited
the president at 1000 Moscow time (0700 GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
The presidential press service said Yeltsin signed a decree
which terminated the temporary presidential powers of Chernomyrdin
after surgeons weaned him from the artificial respiration machine
at 0600 Moscow time (0300 GMT) this morning.
</P>
<P>
Presidential powers, including control of the so-called
"nuclear button", had been delegated temporarily to Chernomyrdin
during the operation and the early hours after it.
</P>
<P>
United States veteran heart surgeon Michael DeBakey, who talked
with Russian surgeons operating on Yeltsin, said he was sure the
Russian President would be able to play his favorite tennis in
three to four months on condition that he was "a good patient" and
followed doctors' advice, the Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. heart surgery patriarch praised the skills of his
Russian pupil, Renat Akchurin, who headed the team of 12 surgeons
and experts performing the operation. He said everything went
perfectly well during the operation.

ISLAMABAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Caretaker Cabinet
today decided that all VIP lounges at airports stand abolished as
of today in their present form.
</P>
<P>

"Henceforth, there will be no government involvement in

The Cabinet noted that use of VIP lounges at the airports has
become a measure of class status which is an anachronism in an
Islamic and democratic order.

<P>
"However, the VVIP lounges meant for the president, prime
minister and visiting heads of state will continue as at present
but will be redesignated as state lounges," he said.
</P>

cabinet has decided to cut down expenditure on the maintenance of
cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made here today at the first meeting of the
13-member caretaker cabinet.

<P>
"Henceforth, they shall travel in business class on tours
abroad," he said, adding, "while traveling within the country,
they will be entitled to economy class."
</P>
<P>
"Taking note of the practice in the past to misuse official
vehicles, the cabinet decided that every minister and the entitled
official shall only be allowed to use one official car each," he
said.

should be reserved for use by him, Haqqani noted.
</P>
<P>
"There will be neither a pilot car nor police route lined up
for Khalid," he added.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also decided to cut down the size of the government
and restructure it to realistically suit a developing country like
Pakistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet directed the ministers to look into the various
projects under implementation by their ministries to ascertain
their need and usefulness, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani President Farooq Leghari dissolved parliament and
sacked the government led by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on

<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to increase
mutually beneficial cooperation with foreign businessmen in
hi-tech areas, including the aviation industry, a senior Chinese
legislator said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of China's National People's

The US transnational corporation is a world-renowned

products in aviation and other industries.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that China, with its rapid economic development, has
a large potential market with good prospects in the aviation
industry.

Consequently, he said, there are many opportunities for
furthering cooperation between the Chinese aviation circle and its
foreign partners.

Wang expressed his appreciation for Sundstrand's devotion to
cooperating with its Chinese partners, and said he believes his
company's business in China will continue to expand.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to set up more special economic zones, namely the Export
Processing Zone (EPZ), to further attract foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating this year's investors conference here today, Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina noted that besides the present two EPZs in
Dhaka and Chittagong, the largest sea port city in the country, a
new EPZ is being set up at Gazipur near Dhaka while two more EPZs
have also been approved to be set up at Mongla port in the South
and a place in the North.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea is setting up a private EPZ on 2,100
acres on the opposite bank of Karnaphuli river in Chittagong,
which is likely to be operational within next two years.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken up adequate measures including legal
support to safeguard foreign and local investments, the prime
minister said, describing the passage of a bill on the private EPZ
by the parliament recently as an unprecedented step to attract
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said that her government after coming to power has
successfully removed bureaucratic barriers and bottlenecks to
investments. "An effective and balanced economic system and easy
conversion of currency system has already started functioning in
Bangladesh," she stressed.

profits of 162,000 Cyprus pounds in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
CA's Press and Public Affairs Manager Tassos Angeli said

<HEADLINE> '96 Beijing Int'l Coin Convention Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of enthusiastic coin
collectors flocked to the '96 Beijing International Coin
Convention, which opened today at the China World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
Chen Muhua, Vice-Chairman of China's National People's Congress
Standing Committee, and Dai Xianglong, President of People's Bank
of China, were present at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The fair, which ends on November 10, is the second of its kind
held in China; both were hosted by Beijing, according to Yang
Fuji, Deputy General Manager of China Gold Coin Incorporation.
</P>
<P>
The convention was established in response to the eager demands
of coin makers and collectors, and especially overseas coin mints,
Yang noted.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition covers 2,100 sq m and has 120 booths, the
majority of which are occupied by 70-plus companies from over 20
foreign countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Participants from abroad marveled at the show's size and
success.
</P>
<P>
Tamar Gilead from the Israel Government Coin and Medals
Corp. Ltd., said she never imagined there could be so many
visitors and buyers, and that she was impressed by the enthusiasm
of local coin collectors.
</P>
<P>
Kirsten F. Petersen, director of the International Markets of
the Austrian Mint, said the company participated in last year's
fair, and hoped to learn more about the Chinese market this time.
</P>
<P>
China issued its first gold coin, the Panda, in 1979, and since
then over 800 sets of various gold and silver coins have been sold
in both domestic and international markets, according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
Overseas coin manufacturers and dealers have shown an
increasingly stronger interest in Chinese-made coins and the
Chinese coin market, thanks to the efforts of Chinese coin-makers
to improve their quality and technology.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that the issuing of gold and silver coins has not
only strengthened exchanges between local and foreign collectors,
but also reaped huge profits for the state revenue, since the
coin-manufacturing industry is more profitable than the
jewel-making sector.
</P>
<P>
He said China sells 100,000 to 200,000 ounces of gold coins
annually.

<HEADLINE> Senior Legislator Stresses Importance of Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture plays a key role
in China, and is related to the country's overall stability and
unity, a senior Chinese legislator stressed during an inspection
in central China's Henan Province, which ended today.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day tour to check up on the implementation of
the Agriculture Law, Buhe, vice-chairman of the National People's
Congress Standing Committee, urged those working in local people's
congresses to remain clear-headed about the legislative objectives
of the law, which are aimed at strengthening the fundamental role
of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He called for more investment in agriculture, better water
conservancy facilities, stable farmland, and stronger protection
against natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the law should help agriculture make the
transfer from the planned economy to the socialist market economy,
he said. The growth of rural economy should be achieved under an
intensive mode, he added, and advanced science and technology
should be put to practical use.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, he emphasized the importance of securing the
rights and interests of farmers, as well as the need to create
fewer burdens for farmers, and help more rural people overcome
poverty.

<HEADLINE> China Puts Priority on Expanding 41 Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China will put priority on
expanding the capacity of 41 airports in some major cities over
the next five years, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The airports in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other
provincial capitals and coastal cities handle 95 percent of all
air travelers in China, according to Shen Yuankang, deputy
director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
</P>
<P>
At today's opening ceremony of the three-day "21st Century
China Aviation" international seminar, held in Zhuhai in south
China's Guangdong Province, Shen said that by the year 2000, the
total cargo volume of China's air transport will reach 14 billion
ton-km, passenger volume 100 million people and airmail shipments
two million tons.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that over the past dozen years, the
growth rate of China's civil aviation was four times that of the
world's average.
</P>
<P>
The total handling capacity of China's civil aviation ranked
11th among all countries in the world in 1995. In 1980, China was
35th.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country's total cargo transport volume by air came
to seven billion ton-km, with 50 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has nearly 800 air routes, including 85
international routes leading to 53 cities in 33 countries. In
addition, 18 air routes link China's inland areas with Hong Kong
and Macao. There are also 25 charter plane routes.
</P>
<P>
China has formulated policies about overseas investment in
China's civil aviation, and airports in Xiamen, Wuhan, Jinan,
Shenzhen and Beijing have been constructed or upgraded with loans
from foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, stocks of some Chinese airline companies are
expected to be listed on overseas stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 20 Sino-foreign joint ventures are engaged in
China's civil aviation industry, especially in airplane
maintenance and food services.
</P>
<P>
John F. McDonnell, board chairman of the McDonnell Douglas
Corporation's (MDC), said at today's seminar that the company has
manufactured 35 MD planes over the past 12 years in China,
together with Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The planes are performing well in China and the United States,
he said, as are another 1,100 MD-80 planes in service around the
world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the MDC will be engaged in long-term cooperation
with China to produce civil planes. In the near future, he added,
80 percent of the body parts of the MD-90 planes will be ordered
from four Chinese companies.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Clinton's Reelection Benefits From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The strong economy has
helped U.S. President Bill Clinton win a second term today in a
landslide victory over his Republican challenger Bob Dole, making
him the first Democratic president to win re-election since
Franklin Roosevelt in 1936.
</P>
<P>
Presidential victories in 30 states and the District of
Columbia gave Clinton 379 electoral votes to 159 for Dole. It
takes 270 to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
The tale of Clinton's victory seemed to result from voters'
rating personal and national prosperity far above the character
issues and tax-cut promises Dole issued.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, the U.S. economy continued to grow. In
the third quarter of this year, its growth was 2.2 percent and the
growth for the whole year is expected to be 2.4 percent, which
hits second in the G-7 industrial countries, or only after that of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
During the four years, more than 10.7 million jobs were
created, reducing the unemployment rate of seven percent in 1992
to 5.2 percent late this year, the lowest in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate remained at about 3.0 percent, which is almost
equal to the economic growth rate. The favorable ratio is also
rarely seen in recent history of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade from January to August this year reached 1176.4
billion U.S. dollars, or 20 percent higher as compared with the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Stock market has been encouraging in the past years. During the
past 10 months, the accumulated increase of the Dow Jones
Industrial Index grew by 17.7 percent. In mid-October, the index
hit a record high of 6,000 points.
</P>
<P>
The federal deficit reduced by 64 percent to 109 billion U.S.
dollars in 1996 fiscal year, or the lowest in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the average family income increased by 1,600
U.S. dollars in the past four years, and crime rate in the past
year reached the lowest level of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The positive economic situation stemmed not only from the
policies of the Clinton administration, but also from the American
economic operation law itself, the improvement of world economic
environment and the efforts of the Republican-controlled Congress
to downsize the budget deficit. To the average American voters,
however, they attribute all the economic improvements to the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
A majority of voters in surveys at the polls said the economy
was in good shape -- fewer than 20 percent thought that way when
they denied George Bush a second term in 1992. Voters told
pollsters as they left ballot stations that they felt the country
is now on the right track and their personal financial outlook is
much rosier.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also seized the chance to parade the improvements as
achievements of his administration in an effort to woo voters to
his side.
</P>
<P>
Signs of Clinton's reelection emerged early this year. Since
May, almost of all the polls showed that Clinton took a lead of 15
to 20 percentage points over Dole.
</P>
<P>
As an effort to raise his standing in the polls, Dole announced
a plan of 15 percent cut of tax a few days before the Republican
National Convention in August in San Diego, California.
</P>
<P>
But, his plan failed to be accepted by the voters who welcomed
it but also suspected its feasibility because Dole did not tell
them how he will do it when the budget deficit remains huge. This
is one of the major reasons for Dole's defeat.
</P>
<P>
Republican members of the Congress forced the government to
shut down late last year because of the budget crisis. This also
left a poor impression of the Republican Party on many voters,
which offset the effort made by Dole to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
Disunity of the Republican Party was another cause for Dole's
defeat. Several weeks ago, some prominent Republican figures began
to keep a distance from Dole when they felt Dole had no hope to
win the election.
</P>
<P>
For Dole, he attacked Clinton's policies more than gave voters
what he wants to do if he is elected during the campaign. Without
clear policies, he was sure to loose.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. news media, voters chose Clinton not because
he is an ideal president but because they already know what his
policies are.
</P>
<P>
Many voters even believe that Clinton is not trustful in the
political scandals such as Whitewater, FBI files and political
donations from foreign authorities and companies.
</P>
<P>
In reality, investigations on those issues have not ended. The
Republicans are still pressing for further investigations. But
most voters just seem not to care much.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian-US Ties to Become Closer After Clinton's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today Egypt anticipated the all-important ties with
Washington would become ever closer following the reelection of
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"We hope, or rather, we are certain bilateral cooperation
within the peace context will be boosted until a just and balanced
peace is established in the Mideast, especially as the U.S is the
prime sponsor of the peace march," Moussa said following a meeting
with President Hosni Mubarak this morning.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said they reviewed the developments of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the peace process will witness progress after
Clinton's election for a second four-year term and the end of
campaign pressure, he expressed hope for an enhanced American role
to give more impetus to the peace march based on the 1991 Madrid
conference and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday's visit to Cairo by Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy, Moussa said the visit will focus on the entire peace
process, especially developments on the Palestinian-Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
But, he added, it would not deal with the Syrian-Israeli and the
Lebanese-Israeli tracks.
</P>
<P>
Regarding a British proposal for creating a Middle East
cooperation organization, Moussa said it might have links to the
recent international and European peace drives in the region.
</P>
<P>
During his recent tour of the Gulf, British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind suggested setting up a forum for security
cooperation and settlement of disputes in the Middle East,
similar to the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He praised Rifkind's peace efforts on the whole, but termed
this issue as premature. "Such a body needs certain conditions and
a certain situation," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot think of setting up such an organization before
meeting these conditions," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Moussa told reporters that such talk should come
with the establishment of just peace in the region in line with
the land-for-peace principle, the implementation of the relevant
U.N. resolutions and negotiations on all outstanding issues,
including Jerusalem, the refugees and the establishment of a
State of Palestine.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Islamic militiamen have
carried out their largest operation ever against bandits and
dismantled all illegal road blocks along the road linking
Mogadishu with the central regions.
</P>
<P>
According to Chairman of the Islamic court in Beletuein,
Shiekh Abdullahi Ali Barkhadle, 49 bandits were rounded up in the
two-day operation.
</P>
<P>
Court officials said the bandits will be brought before the
Islamic justice of Hiran region and face punishments ranging from
hand amputation to cross amputation of a hand and a foot and
killing according to the severity of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
Some of the travellers who have been robbed, raped and
tortured during looting will stand in the court as the jury
against the bandits, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The action, the first of its kind in the region was taken
after the road linking Mogadishu with the central regions had
almost become impassable.
</P>
<P>
Truck drivers said the worst part lies between Jowhar town, 90
Km north of the capital, and Beletuein, 300 Km North of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The commuters and truck drivers had tried to use other side
street to avoid the banditry on the main Tarmac road. however,
this had caused other intolerable road accidents.
</P>
<P>
So far, six lorries had overturned on the road linking Jowhar
with Beletuein in the last six days, resulting in more than 30
people killed and 43 others seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
The operation by the Islamic court of Hiran will bring some
relief to the everyday commuters as the V.I.P.s and prominent
businessmen would use airplanes without the dangers posed by
these bandits.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Reiterates Israel's Commitment to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
reiterated here today his country's commitment to the Middle
East peace process, saying that Israel hopes to live peacefully
with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with King Hussein of Jordan
following their meetings, the Israeli president told reporters
that the Jewish state realized the need to deal with the
Palestinians in order to make peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We know now in Israel that we must deal with Chairman
Arafat," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Ground has been laid for the future of the Middle East,"
said Weizman, who arrived here earlier today on his first
official visit to the kingdom, referring to the Jordanian-Israeli
peace treaty and the Palestinian-Israeli Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli head of state expressed confidence that solution
to the issue of Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank city
of Hebron would be found despite the lack of confidence between
the Palestinians and the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Israel would move quickly to the final status
negotiations with the Palestinians once the issue of Hebron was
settled.
</P>
<P>
"After Hebron (was settled), in three to five years, we will
discuss and conclude the final status negotiations with the
Palestinians, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), whatever
the solution will be," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that after Hebron the two sides must carry on the
peace initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether his visit will boost the peace process and
remove the tensions in the Jordanian-Israeli ties, Weizman said
his talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Palestinian
leader Chairman Arafat and his visit to the kingdom were
themselves "a boost to the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"If there were some tension (in the ties between Jordan and
Israel)," he would discuss with the king and they would keep in
close touch with each other, Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
He told the press conference that he hoped his visit would
ease the tensions between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli president said if Jordan and Israel would clinch
more, that would be a signal and a push for the whole area to
move forward.
</P>
<P>
He added that if there would be a real peace in the region,
there could be a lot of cooperation between the region's
countries, especially Jordan, which has the longest border with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming Middle East and North Africa economic
conference scheduled to be held in Cairo Tuesday, he said all the
countries who love peace should take part in the meeting, no
matter how they were disappointed with the things that had
happened during the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, King Hussein vowed to work closely with the
Israeli president to help bring about further progress of the
peace process and consolidate the foundations already created for
peace and a better future for all the peoples in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said he felt general commitment to the peace process
during his talks with Mubarak, Arafat and Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that without the participation of
Syria and Lebanon, it would be impossible for comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival here, Weizman and King Hussein held
a closed-door meeting, which was followed by an expanded meeting
attended by the Israeli president's entourage and senior
Jordanian officials including Crown Prince Hassan and Prime
Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
Weizman will later today visit Jordan's Arab Potash Company,
which has established a joint venture with Israel's Dead Sea
Works.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Zoo Has Another Giant Panda Cub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A giant panda female cub, born
one month ago at the Beijing Zoo, has safely pulled through the
most vulnerable period of her new life, the zoo's director said
today.
</P>
<P>
The cub now weighs 1,520 grams, putting on an average weight of
46 grams a day. She is the sixth giant panda cub born in Chinese
zoos in 1996, but is the only one to survive this year, said Zong
Ying, director of the zoo.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the little panda will live," Zong said,
adding that the zookeepers do not know which panda is her father.
</P>
<P>
Zoo keepers have tried to breed the mother panda, named "Lele,"
with two male pandas on five occasions since May.
</P>
<P>
Lele gave birth twice before, in 1992 and 1994. Both of the
baby pandas have survived.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate there are about 1,000 giant pandas living in
both the wild and captivity.
</P>
<P>
China, where most of the giant pandas live, has launched a
decade-long research program for studying the reproduction and
breeding habits of giant pandas, in hopes of discovering ways to
protect the species. However, they face an continuous challenge,
as the death rate of newborn pandas is still high, Zong said.
</P>
<P>
He said this problem will be discussed at an international
seminar on giant pandas, scheduled to be held in Beijing at the
end of the year.

<HEADLINE> China Prepares For Agriculture Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China's first agricultural
survey, which has taken three years of preparations, is expected
to begin on January 1, according to He Huanyan, of the National
Agricultural Survey Office (NASO).
</P>
<P>
He said more than six million workers will visit some 230
million rural households in approximately 800,000 villages, and
more than 20 million rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He noted that NASO has almost completed its training of
provincial and county level personnel, and that the next round of
training will start late this month for those at the village level.
</P>
<P>
NASO is allowing some mountainous areas of Yunnan and Qinghai
provinces, and the Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia
autonomous regions to start their survey in October, he said,
explaining that "heavy snow will certainly close those regions in
winter and it will be difficult to conduct the survey then."
</P>
<P>
To increase public awareness of the importance of the survey,
China has decided to designate December as a publicity month for
this unprecedented event, adding to the radio talks, which was
started last month at the Central People's Broadcasting Station,
he said. "Posters, letters from the government, vans with
loudspeakers, announcements between TV shows, artistic
performances, and other means will be employed for this purpose."
</P>
<P>
China's agricultural survey has also received various kinds of
support from the United Nations Food And Agricultural
Organization, the Italian government, and the United States,
Republic of Korea, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that they held that the survey will make the size
of the farmland clearer, as well as the size and quality of the
rural labor force and how many people have migrated to cities to
look for work this year.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey will help the central government in
macro-economic policies and will be of great help as a reference
guide to investors with an interest in China's agriculture, they
added.
</P>
<P>
China plans to conduct such a survey at an interval of ten
years.

</P>
<P>
"There are agreements which have already been signed and which
could never be breached.... The Israeli forces should withdraw
from Hebron," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably enough, the current Israeli government is
procrastinating and completely disavowing the principles on which
a political settlement was based," he deplored.
</P>
<P>
"We earlier made repeated warnings that the Israeli government
breaches agreements, does not possess credibility or honor
pledges.
</P>
<P>
Statements released by the EU countries coupled with French
President Jaques Chirac's recent visit to the region are clear
evidence of the EU's concern about the Israeli decisions and its
request to return the peace process to zero point, he said.
</P>
<P>
This, he cautioned, "would imperil security and peace in the
region and give way to violence and terrorism.... I hold the
Israeli government fully responsible for that."
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi told reporters that his visit is aimed at following
up the work of the committee assigned to implement resolutions
adopted by the recent Cairo pan-Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon coordination and cooperation between Egypt and
Palestine, he praised Egypt's "key" role in buttressing up the
Palestinian cause and the Middle East peace process and returning
it to the right track after Israel forsook it.

<HEADLINE> Macao Garment Exporters Target Japanese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Macao businessmen are seeking to
expand exports of textile and garments to the Japanese market
following declining exports to the United States, the Macao Daily
News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said in a report that some Macao garment
manufacturers have started to tap non-quota markets like Japan
after competition in quota-markets like the United States and the
European Union became fiercer.
</P>
<P>
They said that in the long run, the Asian market will be the
preferential market for garment makers in Hong Kong and Macao, as
traditional quota markets are shrinking.
</P>
<P>
"Japan, South Korea and some other Asian countries have a high
consumption level," the report quoted a local businessman as
saying. "Consumers there prefer famous brands and high quality,
and that is what Macao is now producing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other preferential conditions include the vicinity to Macao,
high density of urban population and free exchange of foreign
currency in those regions, the businessman said.
</P>
<P>
Local manufacturers said they expect to explore the South
Korean market after entering the Japanese market, and then move on
to Singapore and Malaysia in about 1998. After that, they will
try China's market in around 2000.
</P>
<P>
Macao's exports to Japan grew by 12.4 percent in 1995 compared
with the previous year. It surged by 35.1 percent in the first
eight months of 1996 from the same period of last year. About 70
percent of Macao's exports to Japan were garments and other
textile products.
</P>
<P>
Macao's garment exports to Japan exceeded 100 million patacas
(about 12.7 million US dollars) between January and August, making
Japan the third largest importer of Macao garments, although they
accounted for only 1.3 percent of all garment exports by Macao in
the period.

Solomon Islands Deputy Prime Minister Danny Philip said that his
government was now focusing on attracting more foreign direct
investments from newly developed countries in the Southeast Asian
region.
</P>

He said Malaysian investments in the Solomon Islands were low,
totaling only 12.8 million ringgit (about 5 million US dollars)
mostly concentrated in the forestry sector, especially logging and
timber milling.
</P>
<P>
The principal objective of his visit here is to promote
investment opportunities in the Solomon Islands by Identifying
companies with the capacity and business interest to form joint
ventures and trade ties, Philip said.
</P>
<P>
He assured Malaysians that investment in the Solomon Islands is
safe, saying his government would not bow to pressures from
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to revoke the licenses of
Malaysian companies involved in logging activities.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would support companies which engage in
post-logging and downstream activities.
</P>
<P>
Philip invited Malaysian companies to tap the tourism potential
in the archipelago, which is not only famous for its exotic beach
resorts but also World War II relics like frigates and tanks.
</P>
<P>
Philip suggested that Malaysian companies form joint ventures
with local partners in the islands in the fields of tourism,
resort development, fishery processing, safety match
manufacturing, timber processing and sea transportation services.
</P>
<P>
He said the Solomon Islands would appoint a consul from the
Malaysian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to look after its
business interest while Malaysia would have its representative in

well as their principles and policies for governing Hong Kong,
through consultative meetings.
</P>

taken up by a person with the ability of decisiveness and in
leadership.
</P>
<P>

his best to go down to the grassroots level to learn about their
ideas on the selection of the Chief Executive and the Provisional

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Indian Industry Minister
Murasoli Maran said today that the government cannot have an exit
policy and throw out its workers just because somebody wanted to
do so.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the economic editors conference here, Maran said
that "the only thing we can do is to make the voluntary retirement
scheme more attractive and minimize social distress."
</P>
<P>
He said that the government was not averse to selective
protection to domestic industry for meeting the challenge of
multi-national corporations. "How can there not be protection in
special local industry? Even the United States has resorted to
protection for its automobile sector," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the minister also underscored the importance of
foreign funds through foreign direct investment, particularly in
the infrastructure sector, for bringing the gap between domestic
saving and the country's capital requirements.

CANBERRA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar defied
an interest rate cut to end firmer against the US dollar today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 79.08 US cents from 78.68 US
cents on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was in contradiction with the general rule that lower
interest rates weighed the currency down.
</P>
<P>
Local traders said that investors had factored in a bigger
interest rate cut than today's reduction and been dumping the
Australian currency in the past few days. They had to buy the dip
today.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut official cash rate by
50 basis points to 6.50 percent from 7 percent today.

The Australian dollar ended at 90.47 yen against the Japanese

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani police today broke
into the Central Secretariat of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP),
the ex-ruling party led by Benazir Bhutto, and arrested five PPP
workers.
</P>
<P>
The accident was triggered by 50 PPP workers who launched a
protest in front of the Parliament House at 2:30 PM local time
(0930 GMT), and burned a portrait of Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, who were later dispersed by the police, run
into the PPP Central Secretariat in Islamabad, which is only one
km away from the Parliament House, and threw stones to the chasing
police.
</P>
<P>
Then the police broke into the Secretariat, clashing with the
PPP workers and nabbing five.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistani journalist at the scene was injured during the
clash.
</P>
<P>
Many windows of the house were broken.
</P>
<P>
Yazar Kiyani, a PPP official who is in charge of the
Secretariat, told reporters at the scene it was the second time
the Secretariat was attacked by police in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
He strongly condemned such attacks.
</P>
<P>
The political scene in Pakistan has totally changed since early
Tuesday when Leghari dissolved the National Assembly and sacked
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
About 20 PPP workers staged a protest in front of the
Parliament House at 11:30 am local time (0630 GMT) today.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls For Cooperation After Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Re-elected U.S. President
Bill Clinton today called on the Republicans to put aside politics
and work together for what he called "America's future."
</P>
<P>
With a landslide victory in the election, Clinton easily sailed
into a second term, becaming the first re-elected Democrat
president since Franklin Roosevelt in 1936.
</P>
<P>
At an exuberant rally in Little Rock, capital of Arkansas,
Clinton called on the Republicans to "put country ahead of party"
to meet with great challenges and unlimited possibilities.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to put politics aside, join together and get the
job done for America's future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said Clinton was swift in making a gesture of
bipartisanship toward the Republicans who were disappointed over
their candidate Bob Dole's defeat.
</P>
<P>
They believed that it is possible that Clinton might ask Dole
to head a bipartisan commission charged with finding a way to keep
Medicare from going bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
"The most lasting and important thing that I have
learned ... is this: When we are divided we defeat ourselves, but
when we join our hands and build our families and communities and
our country, America always wins," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was not trying to shake up Washington following the
election. His agenda is limited, restrained by budget problems and
the more conservative mood of voters, observers said.
</P>
<P>
He promised to balance the budget, get more children to read
and more students to college, lower crime rates, and reform
welfare and the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott pledged a fresh effort to cut
taxes and shrink the government. Republicans will cooperate with
Clinton, he said, to a point.
</P>
<P>
"Both the president and the Republicans felt obliged to move
toward the center," Brookings Institution presidential scholar
Thomas Mann said. "The public sent a signal and they listened."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Dole sent congratulations to Clinton for his
re-election and pledged to support him. But he told his supporters
at his Washington headquarters that the Republicans would keep the
Senate and the House.

KUNMING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Sale of detergents that contain
phosphorus will be prohibited in the Dianchi Lake area in
southwest China's Yunnan Province by 1997.
</P>
<P>
There will be fines imposed on people selling detergents that
contain phosphorus in the lake area from January 1 next year,
according to a decision made in Kunming, which contains Yunnan's
largest lake, Dian Chi.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to cut the amount of phosphorus dumped
into the lake by one half. Phosphorus content accounts for 53
percent of the sewage into the lake, according to government
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The move also calls for detergent producers in the city to
develop high-efficiency less harmful products to meet the market
demand for phosphorus-free detergents. The municipal technological
supervision bureau will regularly publicize the names of better
detergents.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Executive On Company's China Development Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- An executive with Motorola
(China) Ltd. says that the company will continue giving priority
to its China development program, and will bring more advanced
technology and investment to the country by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The remark came from Yang Hongqing, a vice president of the
company, at the '96 Expo Comm China, the largest trade show for
telecommunications equipment here. Yang said that in order to
survive the increasing competition in China, the program will
focus on technology transfers, increased investment, cooperation
with local enterprises, and localization of senior and mid-level
management personnel.
</P>
<P>
Motorola is one of the big winners in the fledgling market,
with sales of 3.2 billion dollars on the Chinese mainland and Hong
Kong in 1995, accounting for 12 per cent of the company's total
sales.
</P>
<P>
Motorola has told the Chinese government that it would put 1.2
billion US dollars into China by the end of the century, keeping
it the leading foreign investor in the country's electronics
sector.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that Motorola had the debut of a full range of its
latest telecom products at the '96 Expo, including the StarTAC
cellular phone, FLEX paper, and CDMA (code diversion multiple
accesses) equipment and modems. The localization rate of Motorola
products has improved, with 47 per cent of components being
produced in China, and higher than 60 per cent for the company's
pagers, which are manufactured in Tianjin and Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, a "reciprocal model" has been formed
between Motorola and China's electronics industry, according to
industry analysts. Last year alone, the company's exports from
the United States to China totaled 1.2 billion dollars, providing
jobs in many states, such as Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and
Texas. At the same time, Motorola employs 8,000 people in China, a
figure that is expected to hit 10,000 by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Though market competition will become tougher in the next few
years, Motorola, as one of the biggest suppliers of cellular
phones and pagers in China, is still confident of maintaining its
leading position in the profitable market.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Pays First Visit to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
arrived here today on his first official visit to Jordan to
remove differences in the Jordanian-Israeli ties and push forward
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The visit is also the first by a senior Israeli official
following a strain in relations between the two countries. The
strain was caused by Israel's unilateral actions in Arab east
Jerusalem in September and by Jordan's demand that the Israeli
government of right-wing Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu honor
all agreements his predecessors signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
According to Jordanian officials here, President Weizman
always had a standing invitation to visit Jordan after the
signing of a peace treaty between the two countries in October
1994.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was renewed last month during a telephone
conversation between King Hussein and the Israeli president.
</P>
<P>
The visit had been expected to take place shortly thereafter
but was postponed so as not to have an impact on the ongoing
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on Israeli redeployment in the
West Bank city of Hebron, the Israeli press reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Ambassador Shimon Shamir told reporters that Weizman's
visit to the kingdom would go a significant way in improving
Jordanian-Israeli relations and reaffirming both sides'
commitment to implement the provisions of their 1994 treaty.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Jordanian and Israeli governments as
well as businessmen were working closely ahead of the Middle East
and North Africa (MENA) economic conference to be held in Cairo
next Tuesday to discuss joint projects and business ventures.
</P>
<P>
"We are sure that the visit of the president will signal a new
page in Jordanian-Israeli relations and the talks the president
will have here will be helpful in advancing the Middle East peace
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am fully confident of the two countries' ability to
overcome all differences," said the ambassador when asked whether
Israel thought the crisis in ties with Jordan was sparked by its
unilateral moves in Arab Jerusalem in September.
</P>
<P>
Jordan strongly protested Israel's failure to inform the
kingdom of its decision in late September to open a new entrance
to a tunnel that runs near Islamic holy places in Arab Jerusalem,
given the Jewish state's recognition of Jordan's "special role"
vis-a-vis Islamic shrines in the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
Shamir said President Weizman and King Hussein would discuss
the Middle East peace process as well as the bilateral relations
with a view to examining what could be done to advance the
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, particularly on the
Israeli-Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli head of state will also visit the Arab Potash
Company on the Dead Sea, which, together with Israel's Dead Sea
Works, has launched a 90-million-dollar joint venture to produce
bromine using Israeli technology and Jordanian raw materials,
infrastructure and management.
</P>
<P>
The visit to the potash plant, said the ambassador, was an
indication of Israel's strong desire to develop close economic
ties with Jordan.

BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Known as "the Kingdom of
Copper", Chile has proven copper reserves of 185 million tons,
accounting for a quarter of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Rich in forest resources, the nation is also the largest
exporter of wood products in South America. With 10,000 kilometers
of coastline, it has become the world's fifth largest fish
producer.
</P>
<P>
The country, located in the southwest of South America and in
the west of the Andes Mountains, has a population of 13.61 million
and an area of 756,000 sq. km.
</P>
<P>
Stretching from the south to north for about 4,200 km, with an
average width of only 180 km, it is known as the longest narrowly
shaped country in the world.
</P>
<P>
Chile is also abundant in other mineral resources including
niter, iron, molybdenum, gold, silver, aluminium, coal, oil and
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Chile, a former Spanish colony, won independence from Spain on
February 12, 1818.
</P>
<P>
On December 15, 1972, Chile established diplomatic relations
with the People's Republic of China, becoming the first South
American country to have formal ties with China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China's lovable Giant Panda has
had to move over in the affections of the country's animal lovers.
</P>
<P>
A new survey shows that dogs and cats are the best loved
animals among Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The survey, by the Horizon Survey Corporation, said that 72.5
percent of the 1000 surveyed residents in large cities, such as
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wuhan, expressed their fondness
on certain animals.
</P>
<P>
Domestic and wild animals are equally divided when it comes to
fondness for animals, said the survey. But it added that dogs and
cats enjoy the lion's share of people's affections, at 23.6
percent and 16 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
A total of 49 kinds of animals were on the most-liked list
among the Chinese, including giant pandas, rabbits, birds, fish,
monkeys, chickens, bears, pigeons and horses.
</P>
<P>
A research fellow at the survey corporation said that the study
represents the overall view of urban residents in eastern and
central China.
</P>
<P>
The survey also analyzed the differences between the
regions. Dogs are favored by residents in Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou cities, while cats are in by whisker among Wuhaners.
</P>
<P>
There is also a difference between the sexes. Males prefer
dogs, while cats purred their way into the affections of more
females.
</P>
<P>
As for the age gap, dogs and cats are loved by more people
under 30-year-old, with a variety of choices selected by older
people.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- African countries today
urged the international community to help them get space
technology to promote their economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The call was made in Pretoria by African delegates at the
on-going second United Nations regional conference on space
technology for sustainable development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The delegates said their governments realised the importance

</P>
<P>
Space technology had tremendous potential for contributing to
the development of Africa, particularly through improved
management of natural resources, improved communications,
enhancement of food security and the mitigation of natural
disasters, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, space technology, in terms of satellite remote
sensing, geo-positioning systems, satellite meteorology,
atmospheric sciences and satellite communications, are far from
being effectively utilized by most African states.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference was opened on Monday with the
attendance by representatives officials of national aeronautics
and space administrations of African states, the European Space
Agency and the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs.

Under the plan, safe corridors allowing refugees to return to
their camps would be created and secured.

France is also arguing for an international conference on
peace, security and stability in the Great Lakes to be organized

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Frederick
Sumaye today inivted foreign investors to come and invest in Tanzania
because it is placed strategically, geographically and politically.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said this when giving a keynote speech to about
450 foreign and local would-be-investors attending a four-day
international investment and technology forum here.
</P>
<P>
He said private investment is welcome in sub-Sahara Africa and
Tanzania especially has the potentials in terms of market and
material and human resources.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said Tanzania as a coastal country, has eight neighbours and
five of them are land-locked and depend on the Tanzanian ports
and services for their incoming and outgoing goods.
</P>
<P>
The eight countries, he said, were connected to Tanzania through
sub-regional groupings including East African Co-operation (EAC),
Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the political stability was a point to be
put into consideration plus the tourist, mining and agricultural
potential the country has.
</P>
<P>
The Acting Minister for Finance, who is also Minister in the
Planning Commision, Daniel Yona, told participants that Tanzania's
major problem of plentiful of taxes was caused by the fact of a narrow
tax base which the government is soon to solve by widening the base
and lowering the tax rates without affecting the revenue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Director General of the United Nations Industrial
Organization (UNIDO) Mauricio de Maria Y. Campos said that Tanzania
could attract foreign investments if the problems of high taxes and
unpredicatable tax plicies were solved. enditem

He urged countries in eastern and southern Africa to forge new

comprising representatives of the United States, France, Syria,
Lebanon and Israel, took the decision in a south Lebanese
border town Tuesday night, Beirut Ad-Diyar daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The committee started the meeting Tuesday morning in the
headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Naqoura at
Lebanon's request to review a Lebanese complaint against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon had filed to the committee the complaint over an
Israeli bombardment Sunday at south Lebanese villages, which
resulted in wounding a Lebanese civilian and damaging some houses.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said a woman was injured in the Louwaizeh
village while she was fleeing the bombardment.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the meeting, the Syrian delegation to the
committee asked for tackling the issue of two Lebanese families
deported by the Israeli occupation forces from the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in the last week of
September. Lebanon demanded the committee to ban the Jewish state
from repeating the deportion, and its demand was supported by the
 French delegation, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Around 11:00 p.m. (21:00 GMT), the committee voted for the
passage of the decision, then the discussions were turned to the
Sunday bombardment.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring committee was set up under a U.S.-brokered
cease-fire understanding that ended a 17-day Israeli blitz
against the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in Lebanon
last April. In the blitz, some 200 people, mostly civilians, were
killed.
</P>
<P>
The understanding bars Hezbollah and Israeli from targeting
civilians or launching attacks from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
But it allows guerrilla raids on Israeli troops in the
south Lebanon buffer zone and gives both sides the right
of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the five-nation committee said Israel was
responsible for shelling a south Lebanese village and
"deplored" the damage and injures it caused.

<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
plans to send its auto industry into overdrive with a major
shake-up.
</P>
<P>
The province is to drive forward with a target for its
automobile industry during the next five years, today's "China
Automotive News" reports.
</P>
<P>
It aims to build a group of auto-oriented enterprise groups,
and promote its name-brand automobile products in domestic and
even overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Hebei will build a group of large enterprises under the plan,
each with annual sales surpassing 500 million yuan, including
Tangshan Gear Factory and Changzheng Motor Vehicle Plant.
</P>
<P>
Some local high-quality products, including light-duty and
heavy-duty automobiles, gearboxes, brakes, wheel hubs, batteries,
and farm vehicles, will be promoted for home and abroad sales.
</P>
<P>
The promotion drive is expected to help the province form an
annual production capacity of 160,000 light-duty trucks, and
300,000 farm vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In order to reach the target, the province has converted a
group of plants into group enterprises, with annual sales
exceeding 1.5 billion yuan each, such as the Baoding Automobile
Group, Shengli Automobile Group, and Shijiazhuang Internal
Combustion Engines Parts Group and Huabei Farm-Use Trucks Group.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Boycott Cairo Economic Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz has announced that his country would boycott a forthcoming
Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference slated to be
held in Cairo from November 12 to 14, a Beirut daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz noted it was the same reason which forced Lebanon
to refrain from participating in the first Middle East and
North Africa Economic Conference in Casablanca in 1994 and the
second conference in Amman in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister was quoted by the Christian-owned Nida
Al-Watan as saying that the Cairo conference "is not different
from multi-lateral peace negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon insists that it not attend any kind of multi-lateral
peace talks with Israel as long as no concrete progress is
achieved in the bilateral negotiations, which have been
deadlocked since last year.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that the current stagnancy in the bilateral
negotiations with Israel obliged Lebanon to adhere to its firm
position refraining from taking part in the multi-lateral peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Agency France-Presse, he said
that "as long as the peace process is politically frozen,
but a fallback has been witnessed, we don't think that it
is useful to work for reaching progress in the economic
field and to discuss on the post-peace stages."
</P>
<P>
"How could Lebanon economically cooperate with a country which
continued the daily bombardment on south Lebanon and with which
Lebanon was nearly in a state of war," the foreign minister asked
rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria are the only two Arab states boycotting
the multi-lateral peace talks since the beginning.

<HEADLINE> China Probes Way to Tame Yellow River (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Based on scientific study and proof, scientists twice
transformed the project, and changed the method of storing water
and depositing silt, ensuring the project plays its normal role in
anti-flood work, irrigation, water supply to nearby cities, and
power generation.
</P>
<P>
"The construction and transformation of the Sanmen Gorge
Reservoir accumulated experience for constructing more, larger
projects along the river," said Zuan Lianan, Chairman of the
Yellow River Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the construction of the Xiaolangdi Water
Control Project has benefited from the experience of the
construction of the Sanmen Gorge Project.
</P>
<P>
In addition, scientists have made headway in harnessing the
Wuding, Sanchuan and Huangpu rivers, tributaries of the Yellow
River on the Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the amount of soil and sand washed into the Yellow
River has reduced by 300 million tons annually since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
While probing ways to harness the Yellow River, people have
succeeded in using the muddy water to irrigate farmland and
discharge silt to transform it into soil.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that some 27 billion cubic meters of water from
the Yellow River is diverted to irrigate farmland each year, and
130,000 hectares of sandy and saline-alkali soil have been turned
into fertile paddy fields in the lower reaches of the river.

<HEADLINE> Toyota to Cut Luxury Car Prices by 10 Percent in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Toyota Motor Corp.'s U.S. arm
said Tuesday in New York that it will cut the 1997 prices of two
of its Lexus luxury coupes by up to 10 percent from a year earlier
to cash in on a weaker yen.
</P>
<P>
The price cuts will apply to the SC300 and SC400 Lexus sports
coupes, Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc. said. These models are
sold in Japan under the Soarer brand.
</P>
<P>
The latest price cuts follow a series of similar price cuts by
Japanese automakers in the U.S. market. All have benefited from a
weaker yen in boosting price competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The SC300 model will be priced at 39,000 dollars, after a cut
of 4,400 dollars or some 500,000 yen, while Toyota will slash the
price of the SC400 model by 1,600 dollars to 50,800 dollars, it
said.
</P>
<P>
To counteract these moves, General Motors Corp. (GM) of the
United States has cut the prices of Cadillac luxury cars which
compete with the Luxus cars.
</P>
<P>
But GM's cuts were smaller than those of Toyota cars, making GM
cars less price-competitive, they said.

<HEADLINE> Tourists to Israel to Decrease: German Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- German tourism officials
predicted that the number of tourists to Israel from European
Christians, one of the mainstays of Israel's tourism market,
would drop unless the political situation changes, reported The
Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Gisela Meyer-Amler, managing director of the German travel
company Biblische Reisen, and Klaus Behrendt, the associate
director for travel to Israel, made the remarks in an interview
with the paper.
</P>
<P>
Established 30 years ago, the company was the first in Germany
to take groups to Israel. It handles some 40,000 travelers a
year, with about half of them going to Israel, according to
Meyer-Amler.
</P>
<P>
"We have lived through every crisis -- the Six-Day War, the
Yom Kippur War, the war in Lebanon in 1982, the intifada
(uprising), even the Gulf War -- but we have never seen such a
dramatic drop in reservations," Behrendt said.
</P>
<P>
The two German officials, who met with Israeli Tourism
Minister Moshe Katsav earlier Tuesday, said, however, that the
minister did not appear to appreciate the gravity of the problem.
</P>
<P>
"We were surprised that the minister said he expected an
increase in tourism. Probably in the Israeli government they
don't realize how bad the problem is," Meyer-Amler said.
</P>
<P>
Meyer-Amler and Behrendt are currently on a visit to Israel
with a group of 50 of the company's employees, the first time
they had organized such a tour.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Review Taxes to Attract More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has directed the Ministry of Finance to form a task force to
review complaints that taxes in Tanzania were too high and
duplicative compared to other countries in the sub-Sahara region.
</P>
<P>
Opening the International Investment and Technology Forum here
today, President Benjamin Mkapa said that the government has
heard those pleas.
</P>
<P>
"I have consequently directed the Ministry of Finance to form
a task force on tax rationalisation," he said in his speech read
on his behalf by Vice-President Omar Ali Juma.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa said the task force will draw membership from
the business community, the Tanzania Revenue Authority and the
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
He said the task force will review the outstanding issues in
respect of the tax proposals which were earlier submitted by the
business community in the context of the 1996/97 budget proposals.
</P>
<P>
The president said the objective is to incorporate such
proposals in the 1997/98 budget and reiterated that Tanzania
belongs to regional groupings, all of which were striving for
harmonisation of monetary and fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to the time-frame attaining these regional
objectives in the East Africa Co-operation (EAC), Southern African
Development Community (SADC) and Common Market for East and Southern
Africa (COMESA)," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, President Mkapa asked the business community to be aware
of the government priorities attached to observing the rigid fiscal
targets of the 1996/97 budget to achieve full donor support.
</P>
<P>
He said the fiscal measures which are contained in the 1996/97
budget may be quite painful but explained that the sacrifices were
temporary as a condition to the consolidation of investors'
confidence in conducive climate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Mkapa told about 450 participants, including
more than 250 foreign and near 200 local prospective investors that
the government planned removal of visa requirements to citizens of
countries of strategic investment and trade importance to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was aware of the problems that visitors
to Tanzania are faced with when applying for entry visas and
work permits.
</P>
<P>
The objective of rationalisation was to provide promptly
long-term work permits to foreign investors to Tanzania and
remove visa requirements to citizens of some strategic
importance.
</P>
<P>
Citing further areas which were receiving urgent attention,
President Mkapa said the government has revised the National
Investment Promotion and Protection Act with a view to removing
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Other policies for review include the labour laws which will be
rationalised to make them answerable to the envisaged investment
climate.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the government was also keen on developing roads and
other means of transport, communications, energy, water and other
services which facilitate investments.
</P>
<P>
He exhorted the local and foreign investors to venture into
agriculture, mining, industrial manufacturing and tourism sectors,
areas which he said had greater investment potential.
</P>
<P>
The president assured the investors of protection, peace and
stability which he said Tanzania has enjoyed since achieving
independence in 1961.
</P>
<P>
The four-day forum has been organised by the Ministry of Industries
and Trade in collaboration with the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP), the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO)
and Investment Promotion Center (IPC) of Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Iran, DPRK Hold Security Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Officials of Iran and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) held their first
round of talks here Tuesday on expanding cooperation in the field
of national security to deal with their "common enemy" of the
United States, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
Quan Jin Tak, acting Minister of National Security of the DPRK
and head of a DPRK delegation, was quoted by IRNA as saying "Iran
and Korea had a common enemy, namely the U.S. government, and
that they both were striving hard to protect the fruits of their
revolutions in the face of Washington."
</P>
<P>
A diplomat from the DPRK Embassy in Tehran said on condition
of anonymity that "we had talks on public security rather than
the national security."
</P>
<P>
But IRNA reported that the two sides held talks on the
national security.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK diplomat was quoted as saying that the DPRK
appreciated Tehran's support for Pyongyang in its struggle
against the U.S. administration and that it was willing to
benefit from the Islamic Republic of Iran's experience in
maintaining security and peace.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Deputy Interior Minister Gholam Hussein Bolandian said
at the meeting that Tehran appreciated DPRK's support for Iran
during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war and expressed hope that the
talks in Tehran would pave the way for broadening cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two countries Tuesday also reportedly
focused on such topics as criminal investigation and records and
possible joint projects between the law enforcement university of
Iran and the officers' academy of the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The four-member Korean delegation arrived here Tuesday and is
scheduled to stay here for four or five days, according to the
DPRK Embassy.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, Mozambique Jointly Fight Locusts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government last
week sent 5,000 litres of the chemical fenitrothion to Mozambique
to help control the breeding of red locusts before they swarm
into Zimbabwe and place crops at even greater risk, the "Daily
Herald" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Aerial and ground spraying started in Mozambique last Monday,
following the arrival of the chemical and, for as long as
resources are available, the programme will continue until the
problem is under control.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will benefit from this joint effort as it suffers the
most from locust invasions from Mozambique. Once the locusts are
controlled at their source in Mozambique, the country will not
have to spend huge sums of money on controlling them.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Plant Protection and Research Institute of
Zimbabwe Simon Sithole said yesterday that if the locusts were
eradicated at their source in Mozambique, then Zimbabwe, which
currently does not have any locust breeding places, would become
a locust-free country.

club has been suspended from the Asian Cup Winners Cup tournament,
the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The AFC said in a statement: "The suspension follows the
Al-Nassar team's decision to abandon the quarter-final match
against Al-Hilal of Saudi Arabia on November 1 in Riyadh."
</P>
<P>
Al-Hilal was leading 5-0 in the first half when Al-Nassar
abandoned the game seven minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Following the suspension, the return match against Al-Hilal on
Friday has been cancelled.
</P>
<P>
AFC secretary Peter Velappan described Al-Nassar' actions as a
serious case of indiscipline especially when the players, in
abandoning the match, questioned the referee's decision and tried
to attack him.
</P>
<P>
The AFC disciplinary panel will decide on the action to be
taken against the coach and players, he said.
</P>
<P>
With Al-Nassar's suspension, Al-Hilal will qualify for the next
stage of the tournament. The finals will be held on November
24-26 in Riyadh.

KAMPALA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 9,000 of Zairean
refugees including some soldiers have fled into southwestern
Uganda, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Citing the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) information, "the New Vision" newspaper of Uganda said

JOHANNESBURG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would
respond "very positively" to any request from the United Nations
for help in solving the refugee crisis in Zaire, President Nelson
Mandela said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
A local daily "the Citizen" today quoted the president as
saying that his government would respond very positively in

Mandela made the remarks at a dinner function in Johannesburg
in response to an appeal by his African counterparts for the UN
Security Council to send a neutral force quickly to eastern
Zaire, where about 1.2 million Hutu refugees are exposed to
famine and diseases.

<P>
Leaders of Kenya, Tanzania, Cameroun, Uganda, Rwanda, Zambia,
Ethiopia and Eritrea held a regional summit on Tuesday in Nairobi

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Angola may become one of the
largest export markets for Zambia in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) region.
</P>
<P>
The view is based on a market research conducted recently by
the Export Board of Zambia (EBZ), the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Angola imports almost everything from overseas sources such as
Portugal, Brazil and the United States, which are far off
compared with neighbouring Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The EBZ research also showed that a wide range of Zambian
products such as sugar, food staffs, seeds, garments and African
prints are on high demand in Angola.
</P>
<P>
It will be a good decision for Zambians to take a step into Angola
and test their products and eventually penetrate into that lucrative
market since demand is there, the report said.

<HEADLINE> China Probes Way to Tame Yellow River (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 6 (Xinhua) -- World wide attention is
focussed on the building of the Three Gorges Dam Project on the
mighty Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
But hundreds of kilometers away, trucks, bulldozers and modern
equipment are busily working along the banks of the Yellow River -
working on another key project aimed at helping to tame China's
second longest, but most harmful river.
</P>
<P>
This massive dam project is 40 kilometers northwest of Luoyang,
an ancient city in Henan Province, Central China.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi Water Control Project, which is costing billions
of yuan, is expected to see the Yellow River dammed next year.
</P>
<P>
"This is the the largest water and silt-control project in the
history of taming the Yellow River, and it will play an important
role in anti-flooding control, reducing silt and deposits, as well
as the menace of ice runs, in irrigation and power generation," an
official in charge of the project said.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi Water Control Project is an important part in
taming this river flowing across the country from west to the
east.
</P>
<P>
The world's muddiest watercourse, the Yellow River is
characterized by silting in its lower reaches, and changing its
course.
</P>
<P>
How to tame the river has been a hot topic for centuries.
</P>
<P>
Since 1949 when New China was founded, the Chinese Government
has organized scientific workers in water resources, agriculture,
forestry and geology, to make an overall survey of the river to
provide massive scientific data to help in the harnessing of the
river.
</P>
<P>
In 1960, water resources departments built the first reservoir,
the Sanmen Gorge Water control project. Because of the
shortcomings of the design, the project stored 1.4 billion tons of
silt and deposits within a year after going into operation,
causing the backwater to directly threaten Xi'an, capital of
Shaanxi Province.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Israeli Farm Attracting Visitors in China's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, which is known for its
Great Wall, Imperial Palace, Tiananmen Square, and other sites,
has something new of special interest, a cooperative farm project
that is a showcase of Israeli agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
Israeli drip irrigation and fruit- and flower-raising skills
are used in the farm in the Yongledian District near Beijing.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 Chinese government officials and agronomists
from around the country have visited the farm, whose deputy
director, Hong Daqi, said that "Almost all the country's provinces
and major cities have sent at least one vice governor or vice
mayor here."
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Premier Li Peng and then Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin signed a bilateral agreement for three Sino-Israeli
agricultural projects. The farm, which was one of them, was begun
in May 1995, with the Israeli Agricultural International
Technology Promotion Center providing 2.5 million US dollars worth
of equipment and technology, and China's Agricultural Ministry
International Cooperation Department responsible for the land and
labor.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli experts stay on the farm for administrative
purposes, getting help if needed from headquarters in Israel. "The
Israeli people are nice, hard-working and very clever," Hong said,
"and we have been working together in a friendly way, though
sometimes we have arguments about technical issues."
</P>
<P>
"Their techniques are really good and useful," Hong said,
giving an example of drip holes on Israeli trickle-irrigation
pipes being uniform in size and blockage-free even after long use.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides are satisfied with the smooth operation of the
project, which has had good results," Hong noted, pointing to the
230 staff members and 57 ha. of farmland, with their trees,
flowers, and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
With the Israeli technology, the model farm has had high
yields, with a tomato output of as many as 210 tons per ha., much
more than the 75-ton average in the rest of China. The trees are
expected to bear fruit in two or three years, and flowers and
vegetables are being sold in local markets.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese get the earnings and the Israelis get to
demonstrate their technological advancements, with the hope of
attracting customers from the rest of the country, so both sides
have made it, according to Hong. As many as a dozen provinces and
cities have introduced advanced farm technology from Isreal, after
their agronomists and decision-makers visited the farm.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. incumbent President
Bill Clinton won the presidential race Tuesday, becoming the first
Democratic president to be re-elected since Franklin Roosevelt
(1882-1945).
</P>
<P>
After being assured of a landslide victory, Clinton spoke to a
gathering of thousands of people in Little Rock, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Referring to their supporters, Clinton said, "They have
affirmed our cause and told us to go forward," according to media
reports.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told the crowd that voters have said it is time to "put
politics aside and get the job done."
</P>
<P>
He called on Congress to put aside party differences and work
together with him on the nation's problems.
</P>
<P>
"When we are divided, we defeat ourselves," Clinton said. "The
challenges we face, they are not Republican or Democratic
challenges, they are American challenges."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Republican candidate Bob Dole, in a speech to his
supporters in Washington D.C., said it hurts to lose an election,
but he claimed victory for the Republican Party in both chambers
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
Dole called Clinton his opponent, but not his enemy. Dole said
"I wish him well and I pledge my support."
</P>
<P>
Reform Party nominee Ross Perot, who got 19 percent of popular
votes in 1992, was a distant third everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Texas, Perot conceded failure but said, "We're
going to have to stand at the gate and keep the pressure on and we
will." He won only about 9 percent of the popular votes.
</P>
<P>
In the race for Congress, Republicans kept control of the
Senate, picking up open seats in Alabama, Arkansas and Nebraska.
The Democrats gained an open seat in Oregon and defeated the
incumbent in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
In the House of Representatives, Republicans would keep
control, although only by 10 seats, according to projections by
ABC News.
</P>
<P>
In the governors' contests, Democrats took the traditionally
Republican seat in New Hampshire, but the Republican Party took
the usually Democratic West Virginia governorship.

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A Delhi court today laid
charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating against former Prime
Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao in the 100,000-US-dollar Pathak case.
</P>
<P>
Rao attended the court here today on summons for the first time
in the cheating case after the court Tuesday rejected his plea for
exemption from personal appearance in the case.
</P>
<P>
Additional District and Sessions Judge Ajit Bharikoke ordered
the laying of charges against Rao and two other men -- godman
Chandraswamy and his secretary K.N. Mamaji. Rao and the two men
have pleaded not guilty and challenged the trial.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Rao's counsel R.K. Anand requested adjournment of the
case on the grounds that the Supreme Court order was being awaited
on the bail pleas by Chandraswamy and Mamaji. But the request was
rejected by the court.
</P>
<P>
In his earlier testament, Britain-based non-Indian resident
businessman L. Pathak said that he gave 100,000 US dollars in 1983
to Chandraswamy and his secretary on assurance by then External
Affairs Minister Rao to secure a contract to supply newsprint and
paper pulp to India.
</P>
<P>
But he never got the contract. Rao has denied that he had

<HEADLINE> US Offers Bridging Proposals on Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. has put forward
bridging proposals on breaking the deadlock in the stalled
Israeli-Palestinian talks on the Israeli troops' redeployment in
the West Bank town of Hebron, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is waiting for responses from both Israelis and
Palestinians before deciding whether it is worthwhile to send
back Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross, English daily
The Jerusalem Post quoted Israeli sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report did not go into details on what the proposals
are.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who was directly involved in the Hebron talks,
returned to Washington last week after failing to press the
two sides to clinch a deal. Earlier reports said Ross could
return to the region as early as today to continue his
mediation.
</P>
<P>
"Ross will only come back if the sides are close to
concluding a deal, but this has not happened yet," an
official said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Television Channel 1 Tuesday
night, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu mocked
Palestinian forecasts that, immediately after its elections, the
U.S. would place massive pressure on Israel to give in to
Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu voiced confidence that there would be no such
pressure. "It is just not going to happen," the hardline
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Some officials said the U.S. hoped to wrap up the Hebron
talks before next week's Cairo economic conference. This would
make it possible for Secretary of State Warren Christopher,
who is expected to attend the meeting, to witness the
signing that will give a boost to the otherwise dull
conference.
</P>
<P>
Israel insists it not agree to set an artificial deadline,
while blaming the Palestinians for the delay in signing the
Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Tuesday that the deal
could have been signed weeks ago if the Palestinians wanted to do
so. He acknowledged that there remained some points of difference
between the two sides, but expressed his hope that a deal could be
 concluded "in a very short time."
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
is to visit Cairo Friday at the invitation of his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa. Officials said Moussa wanted to brief
Levy on the results of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
visit to Syria earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Israel and Syria are becoming
increasingly tense recently due to the protracted deadlock in
peace negotiations and troop deployments on the border.
</P>
<P>
Israel is bracing for a military attack by Syria which is
believed to intend to use the military option to extract
concessions from Israel's hardline Likud government.
</P>
<P>
During Levy's meeting with Moussa, the Israeli-Palestinian
talks are also expected to be raised. Egypt has been prodding
Israel to clinch the Hebron deal with the Palestinians in
order to push forward the peace process.

DHAKA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 million people in the
northern and southern parts of Bangladesh are exposed to arsenic
contamination, the local press reported today, quoting Health

</P>
<P>
The minister, also chairman of the National Steering Committee

The report said 17 districts in the northern and southern parts
of the country have been affected by arsenic contamination and the
government has set up three expert-level committees to assess the

The government has planned to supply water purification systems
free of charge to middle- and lower-class rural people after
sealing the shallow tubewells found to be contaminated by arsenic.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has the capability to
receive the large delegations to participate in the 1998 Asian
Games in Thailand, a senior sports official said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Sports Association chief Sakchye Tapsuwan said
according to estimates, as many as 9,000 athletes will compete in
33 sports.
</P>
<P>
There will also be 3,000 officials at the games, making the
scale of the 1998 Asian Games larger than last games in Hiroshima
in 1994, Sakchye said.
</P>
<P>
But he said the organizaing committee was confident in
successfully hosting the biggest regional sports event.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) had reportedly expressed its
concern over Thailand's ability to stage such a large event, as
some of its major sports venues could only hold 10,000 people
each.
</P>
<P>
The OCA will hold meeting in Bangkok next month to discuss
issues related to the games.
</P>
<P>
Sakchye said it was not suitable now to cut the number of
sports, but athletes and officials could be reduced to 6,500 if
necessary.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari has pledged to honor his commitment to holding free, fair
general elections scheduled for February 3, 1997 in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I promise I will do my best to ensure holding of free and fair
elections in time," Leghari said in a radio and televized speech
to the nation late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
He said he had been advised to take certain measures including
holding a national census before the general elections to "restore
the normal functioning of the government."
</P>
<P>
He promised that the elections would be held in time, "Even if
other policy matters have to be delayed."
</P>
<P>
On the dissolution of the National Assembly on Tuesday, he
said, "I have taken this difficult decision within the
constitution to dissolve the National Assembly to save democracy
from subversion from within."
</P>
<P>
Leghari dissolved the assembly and dismissed the government of
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Repeating his charges against the former government, the
president said that during the past three years, the right to
privacy was not ensured, corruption became rampant, the national
economy was going in reverse gear, financial discipline was not
strictly enforced, lawlessness was a common sight, and rules and
regulations were not being followed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that caretaker Prime Minister Malik Miraj Khalid has
chosen a capable team of ministers although it is a small cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said that efforts would be made to end corruption,
lawlessness and mismanagement in the fabric of the society.
</P>
<P>
He said measures with far-reaching effects would be taken in a
selfless manner to put the nation on proper tracks.
</P>
<P>
"I do not promise the process of accountability and economic
reforms will be completed within 90 days, nor can I ensure the
steps we take in interim period will show immediate relief," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But "I will push hard for policy decisions that are
indisputably in the larger interest of the people of Pakistan,"
said Leghari.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement with the International Monetary Fund
would be implemented and the country's international commitments
would be honored.
</P>
<P>
He also said a continuity of foreign policy would be
maintained.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan would continue to lend moral and diplomatic support to
the Kashmir cause and to a broad-based solution to the Afghan
crisis acceptable to all factions in that country.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Pakistan's belief in good neighborly relations
and its resolve to hold meaningful talks with India.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Stock Exchange to Reduce Circuit Breaker to 5 pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE),
the main bourse of Bangladesh, is going to reduce the circuit
breaker from the existing 10 percent to five percent from November
9, DSE sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The new move, advised by the watchdog Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), is aimed at avoiding any scope of crash in the
fast growing and expanding capital market.
</P>
<P>
Under the new direction, both upward and downward price
movements of the listed stocks would be limited to five percent of
the previous day's closing rates.
</P>
<P>
The SEC also proposed to introduce a 15 percent circuit breaker
on the trading after a company's disclosure of some sensitive
issues such as dividend, bonus share, right share expansion or
joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the circuit breaker was exempted for three days for
such disclosures.
</P>
<P>
The DSE share price index showed a down-ward trend for three
days following the re-imposition of a 10 percent circuit breaker
last month. But the market resumed bullishness later on.
</P>
<P>
The DSE share price index has jumped to 3,648.75 points Tuesday
from merely 1,000 points five months ago.
</P>
<P>
The unusual bullish market aroused great concern of the SEC,
which has taken a series of measures to cool the price pressures
in the stock exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Residents Choose Best Cadres (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The move to choose the best cadres was initiated by an event in
1988, in which more than 500 cadres helped residents store
vegetables by day and transport coal at night, to ensure people to
pass the cold winter safe and sound.
</P>
<P>
Local residents were so moved by the cadres' action that they
suggested commending them publicly, and the first group of "ten
best cadres" were chosen the next spring.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jiaogong, manager of the District Coal Company, has been
chosen as one of the "ten best cadres" for five years, and he was
the most frequently elected cadre, who led his working staff to
work overtime to ensure to local residents the supply of enough
coal.
</P>
<P>
"The only qualification to be chosen as the best cadre is to
serve the people wholeheartedly, and make an outstanding
contribution to the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shi Jizhuang, deputy-director of the survey and research
department of the district government, said "With time passing,
the qualifications for the best cadre have developed into
multi-requirements, and it has also become a kind of democratic
supervision system".
</P>
<P>
"A ballot is a mirror from which a cadre's performance can be
evaluated, and we only cast ballots on those who have done a
satisfactory job," one local resident said, summing up the
sentiments of the community.
</P>
<P>
The yearly elections have lasted for eight years, and a local
insurance company even bought policies for the elected cadres.
</P>
<P>
"The common goal of our public servants and volunteers is to
serve the people," said Dong Chunfu, voted one of the best
cadres. Dong has helped organize a volunteer group of 50,000
members to offer community services.

<HEADLINE> Bodies of American Trekkers Brought to Kathmandu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Bodies of an American
trekking couple, which were found earlier along with the bodies of
their Nepali guides in west Nepal, were brought here Tuesday by a
helicopter .
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the American couple, Philip Fialkow, 62, and his
wife Helen, 61, were uncoverd Sunday by a team of local rescuers
at a site of 4,725-meter height after digging eight-meter-deep
snow.
</P>
<P>
The five bodies were found inside a tent located between two
mountains of over 5,000 meters in the area about 250 kms west of
Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
Probably the trekkers put their tent in the gorge to protect
themselves from the fierce snow storm that hit the area at that
time, said pilot Kisendra Shahi, who brought the bodies of the
Fialkows here.
</P>
<P>
They seemed to have died of suffocation when their tent was
buried by an avalanche coming down from the ridges of both the
mountains, he added.
</P>
<P>
The five trekkers were last seen on October 22 when Fialkow
sent his other 14 Nepali trekking guides back to ask for help.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place when Fialkow, dean of the medical
school of the University of Washington in Seattle, and his wife
were heading a 14-century-old monastery in the area, local reports
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Shahi, the snow storm that hit the area was very
unusual with local residents saying they had never seen so much
snowfall at that time of the year in their lifetime.

<HEADLINE> World Food Summit Expected to Adopt Two Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Two major documents of the World
Food Summit are ready for adoption at the November 13-17 meeting
of world leaders, a top official of the summit said here today.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state or government and ministers from about 200
nations are expected to approve the documents at the unprecedented
event, said Kay Killingsworth, secretary-general of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food
Summit Plan of Action are part of the United Nations' effort to
lay a foundation for "Food for All" in the world, she said.
</P>
<P>
The documents will be immediately effective after adoption and
will be distributed as Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO)
documents, Killingsworth told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The two documents, believed to be the most important among all
documents made available by the FAO since 1974, will serve as
guidelines for the U.N. specialized agency and all governments to
achieve food security, Killingsworth said.
</P>
<P>
Under the documents, every human being enjoys the right to have
access to safe and nutritious food; efforts are needed to reduce
the number of hungry mouths and to eradicate global hunger.
</P>
<P>
The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization is sponsoring
the November 13-17 summit at which some 100 heads of state or
government are expected for the final two days.
</P>
<P>
The summit, whose slogan is "Food for All," aims to call
attention to global hunger and find ways to distribute the world's
resources more evenly.
</P>
<P>
Although food production has jumped to match the rise in global
population since 1945, current grain shortages suggest a future
food crisis unless fish stocks are reserved, fertile land
protected and agricultural techniques improved. Some 800 million
people regularly go hungry, or one seventh of the world's
population, regularly go hungry, according to the FAO.
</P>
<P>
The FAO, established in Quebec, Canada, in October 1945, aims
to alleviate malnutrition and hunger, and serves as a
co-ordinating agency for developing programs in the whole range of
food and agriculture, including forestry and fisheries.

</P>
<P>
The two cadres met with violent deaths at the hands of
assassins recently.

<P>
The release said that there is reason to suppose that the
killings have been of a well-known pattern, by which the

<HEADLINE> Canadian Dollar Hits 13-month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian dollar jumped
nearly a third of a cent today, reaching a 13-month high and
giving the Bank of Canada room for another interest rate cut this
week.
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained 0.32 cents to close at 75.16 U.S. cents in heavy
buying by traders, foreign investors and Canadian exporters.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in five days that the dollar has surged
past the 75 U.S. cents level.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, it shot to 75.01 US cents and closed at 74.96
U.S. cents, up 0.24 U.S. cent from the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Since early September, the dollar has gained more than 2 U.S.
cents despite the fact that the central bank has cut the bank rate
three times in 25-basis-point increments.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts credit lower government deficits, a stable political
environment, virtually no inflation and a strong stock market for much
of the dollar's appreciation.
</P>
<P>
The dollar had been rising after dropping to about 70 U.S. cents
late in 1994. By early October 1995, it had climbed to just above 75
U.S. cents. It has averaged 73.17 U.S. cents over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
According to some economists, the dollar is currently
undervalued and could rise to 78 U.S. cents or even higher next
year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine MILF Rebels Blamed for Kidnappings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation
Front guerrillas were responsible for the new wave of kidnappings
in the Philippines' Mindanao island in recent weeks, Interior
Secretary Robert Barbers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a splinter group from the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF), was trying to use the abductions to strengthen its
position in the upcoming peace talks with the government, Barbers
said in a report to President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The secretary presented the report after an inspection trip to
Cotabato city in Mindanao island, which has seen at least 10
kidnappings last week. Chinese-Filipino businessmen in the city
had shut down their businesses for two days last week in a protest
against the kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
Barbers said police records showed that kidnapping cases in
Mindanao rose sharply right after MNLF leader Nur Misuari assumed
office as governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said police and local officials, who attended a joint
meeting on November 2, agreed that the kidnappings were
politically-motivated.
</P>
<P>
Barbers indicated that the MILF wanted to show that the
government could not depend solely on Misuari to maintain peace
and order in the Muslim areas.
</P>
<P>
"This might be a scenario being used by the MILF to gain
leverage in the peace talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which mainly operates in central Mindanao, is a new
Muslim separatist group established during the past two months by
some senior MNLF members opposing the peace deal signed on
September 2 by Misuari and Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The group, whose leaders claimed a membership of about 20,000,
replaced the MNLF as the largest anti-government force in the
country after the MNLF turned to peace.
</P>
<P>
The government agreed to hold separate peace talks with the
MILF after the new rebel group refused to accept the peace deal
reached between the MNLF and the Ramos administration.
</P>
<P>
According to Executive Secretary Ruben Torres, the exploratory
talks between the government and the MILF will start soon this
week.
</P>
<P>
In order to gain favorable position in the peace talks, the
government force captured three main MILF camps in Tipo-Tipo city
in Basilan province in western Mindanao in massive offensives last
week. The Philippine Army also launched clearing operations
against fleeing MILF rebels and planned to take the last MILF camp
in the city in the near future.
</P>
<P>
On its part, the MILF countered with a spate of kidnappings,
mostly targeting Chinese-Filipinos on the island, and ambushed
government troops. In the latest ambush staged Monday by the MILF
in Tipo-Tipo, seven soldiers were killed and 10 others seriously
wounded, an army report said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Appoints New Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam today appointed Yoo Chong-ha, senior presidential
secretary for foreign and national security affairs, to replace
Gong Ro-myung as foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Gong tendered his resignation on Tuesday to President Kim via
Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung on "health reasons."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ban Ki-moon, presidential secretary for protocol,
was named to succeed Yoo.
</P>
<P>
Yoo, 60, has served as senior presidential secretary for
foreign and national security affairs since 1994. Before that, he
was the South Korean Ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Yoo's career experiences also included vice foreign minister,
ambassador to the European Commission, Belgium and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He also served as deputy foreign minister for economic affairs
in 1985, minister in the South Korean Embassy in London and
director-general of the American Affairs Bureau of the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Ban, the newly-appointed senior presidential secretary for
foreign and national security affairs, became presidential
secretary for protocol since last April.
</P>
<P>
Ban, 52, served as deputy foreign minister for political
affairs before being picked up by President Kim last April.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Suh Dae-won said here on Tuesday
that Gong has been undergoing "a treatment for cataract and was
hospitalized for medical checkup due to an overwork during his
recent tour of European countries."
</P>
<P>
However, a local television report linked Gong's resignation
with conflicts with other foreign policy-makers over his "poor"
performance in several important foreign policy matters, while
some newspapers said that it was related with his failure to serve
his military service in full during the 1950-1953 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
Gong, 64, has served as foreign minister for one year and 10
months since December 1994.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Causes 40,000 Premature Deaths in India: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- There are over 40,000
premature annual deaths in India due to pollution, said a study by
the Center for Science and Environment (CSE) here today.
</P>
<P>
Another study puts the figure of annual deaths in New Delhi,
capital of India, at 7,500, Mumbai (Bombay) at 4,500 and 5,700 in
Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
Studies have also shown air pollution in most of the 23 Indian
cities (with a population of over one million) was found to exceed
the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. The Indian
auto industry spends less than one percent of its revenue on
research and development. And levels of even a known carcinogen
like benzene are not monitored in the country.
</P>
<P>
CSE Director Anil Agarwal suggested a commission should be set
up for controlling vehicular pollution and the Surface Transport
Ministry undertake studies. The automobile and petroleum industry
should not be allowed to sell products which pose a threat to
public health.

<HEADLINE> India to Withdraw Voluntary Depository Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
considering withdrawing the voluntary depository scheme (VDS)
introduced in the union budget for 1994-95, official sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The scheme was introduced to tap black money in circulation and
the assessees under the scheme were allowed to deposit 60 percent
of their unaccounted income receipts with the government and
retain the remaining 40 percent legally.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry now wanted to withdraw the scheme as it
felt that the scheme had outlived its utility, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the rationale behind the proposed move, the Finance
Ministry's Revenue Secretary N.K. Singh said Tuesday that the
government had taken several steps to deregulate the industrial
sector in the country. Since the very regime of regulations has
undergone change, there was little reason to believe that
additional black money was getting pumped into the system.
Therefore, the voluntary depository scheme could not be relevant
beyond a point.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Government Policies to Continue: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula
Horn promised today to tighten up supervision of the privatization
process following a scandal which rocked the party earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
He also told journalists that his government would stick to its
reform programs but would take steps to improve things that had
not been carried out successfully.
</P>
<P>
As a sign of confidence in the government's policies he said
the country had attracted more than 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign investment this year, more than any other eastern European
country.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Socialist Party has been under attack since
September when it was revealed that a lawyer earned a commission
of 800 million forint (5.3 million dollars) to help the government
privatize property.
</P>
<P>
Horn said the government had done everything possible to tackle
the problem and had held nothing back in its investigation of the
issue, he told journalists.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should learn from the incident and
enhance supervision of the country's privatization. But he
dismissed as sheer nonsense opposition claims of other
privatization-related scandals.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Privatization and State Holding Company (HPSHC)
has been accused of having illegally shifted the money into the
bank account of a lawyer named Marta Tocsik.
</P>
<P>
The opposition claimed the ruling Socialist Party was preparing
to use the money for its 1998 general election campaign and
demanded the government's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's privatization law, privatized state-run
companies should transfer some of their shares free to local
authorities. But local governments demanded more shares.
</P>
<P>
Hoping to solve the problem through negotiation, HPSHC employed
a female lawyer to negotiate on behalf of the company.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the lawyer and the HPSHC, she was to
take 10 percent of whatever she earned for the company in the
talks. That amounted to 800 million forints in a country where the
average wage is 50,000 forints (330 dollars) a month.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Government Further Reduces 1996 Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government has
further reduced its economic growth forecast for this year to
about six percent, as the country's economic growth in the
third-quarter slowed down to 3.2 percent, hitting the lowest
quarterly gain in about ten years.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth for 1997 is also expected to be between
five and seven percent, slightly lower than Singapore's
medium-term potential of six to eight percent, the Straits Times
reported today, citing Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as
saying last night.
</P>
<P>
The current downturn reflected a cyclical slowdown in external
demand rather than structural problems in the economy, Lee
observed at a presentation ceremony for the international trade
awards to Singapore and Singapore-based companies.
</P>
<P>
The latest growth forecast, which stood even lower than the
earlier 6.5 percent consensus prediction by economists, was the
government's third revision of its Gross Domestic Production (GDP)
forecast for this year. Its previous forecast was for growth of
seven to eight percent, half a percentage point lower than the
earlier 7.5 to 8.5 percent projection.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times report said the slowdown was caused by the
weak performance of manufacturing, particularly the electronics
sector and its related supporting industries. Electronics accounts
for 44 percent of Singapore's manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lee stressed that the country's "domestic
economic fundamentals remain sound," noting that Singapore's key
manufacturing capabilities had been strengthened over recent
years.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has already won 281 electoral votes, ensuring a second term of
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Republican challenger Bob Dole got 119 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
With more than a third of the vote counted, Clinton won 50
percent of the vote while Dole won 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
So far, Clinton has won 26 of the 50 U.S. states and Dole won
12, according to preliminary results.
</P>
<P>
A presidential candidate needs 270 of the 538 electoral votes
to be elected.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, 50, also became the first Democrat re-elected to the
presidency in 60 years -- since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944.
</P>
<P>
Newt Gingrich, the speaker of the U.S. House of
Representatives, today also won the re-election to a 10th term.
</P>
<P>
The voting on this Election Day Tuesday is actually 51 separate
elections in 50 states and the District of Columbia. The president
is not elected by the popular vote but indirectly by an electoral
college.
</P>
<P>
All the electoral votes of each state are assigned to the
candidate who gets the most popular votes in the state, with a
couple of exceptions.
</P>
<P>
Final results would depend on voting far into the night on
the U.S. west coast.
</P>
<P>
Voters today also voted to choose all the 435 seats of the
House of Representatives, one-third, or 34 seats of Senate, 11
governors and numerous state and local officers.

<P>
JAKARTA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is expected to have
40 million HIV/AIDS victims by the year 2000 if the country fails
to take effective measures to eradicate the disease, a senior
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Suyono Yahya, secretary of the Coordinating Minister for
People's Welfare, told a symposium here that the number of
HIV/AIDS cases in the country is increasing far more rapidly than
in the United States or Europe.
</P>
<P>
Yahya attributed the alarming number of HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus) and AIDS (acquired immune deficiency
syndrome) cases to a lack of awareness of the killer disease in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics from the Health Ministry showed that there
are at least reported 449 HIV/AIDs cases in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"The nation's future is bleak if efforts are not made to
educate the younger generation about the danger of AIDS," Yahya
said.

<HEADLINE> 7 Philippine Soldiers Killed in Clashes With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Seven soldiers were killed and
10 others seriously wounded Monday in an ambush staged by the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in western Mindanao, local press
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The ambuscade brought to 12 the number of soldiers killed and
34 wounded in operations launched late last Month by government
troops to clear MILF camps in Tipo-Tipo area.
</P>
<P>
The military estimated the toll on the side of the MILF, a
breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF), at 50 killed and many others wounded during recent
encounters.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Tipo-Tipo Mayor Joel Maturan as saying MILF
guerrillas led by commanders Kamsa Sapanton and Amir Mengkong
staged the ambush at about 3 p.m. in Tipo-Tipo, Basilan province
while soldiers of the 5th and 33rd Infantry Battalions were
pursuing fleeing rebels in Barangay Bakisung.
</P>
<P>
The rebels suffered minimal damage as they were firing from a
vantage position, Maturan said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the military's Southern Command confirmed the
ambush but gave no details, saying only that ongoing operations in
the area may be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
The ambush was in apparent retaliation for the Army's capture
of three main MILF camps in Tipo-Tipo in skirmishes last week.
</P>
<P>
The capture of the MILF camps has forced the rebels to flee to
forested areas, hinterlands and hidden crevices near seashore. Now
only one camp in the area is still in the hands of the MILF
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet known whether the ambush will derail the planned
exploratory talks between the government and the MILF, which
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres has said were to begin this week.
</P>
<P>
Torres said he would meet with MILF Chairman Hashinm Salamat
and vice chairman Ghadzali Jaafar at an undisclosed place in
Mindanao either on Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos has instructed Torres to work out a
ceasefire agreement with the MILF to pave the way for formal peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Philippine National Police's
Western Mindanao office said Tuesday that the recruitment of MNLF
members into the police force had begun on November 1 as
stipulated in a peace deal signed in September between the
government and the MNLF. The MILF is one of the several armed
rebel groups opposing the peace deal.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The growth of Thailand's retail
business is expected to slow down to 15 percent this year, after
several years of much greater expansion, the local press reported
today, quoting a leading businessman.
</P>
<P>
Krairit Boonyakiet, president of the Biofile Corp., said that
the sector grew by only eight percent in the first half of this
year. He added, however, that second-half sales are always
stronger because of year-end holiday spending.
</P>
<P>
Earlier projections had put the growth rate at 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's retail business grew by 30 percent last year and
22 percent in 1994.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Energy and transport sectors
of northeast China's Jilin Province have become the focus of
attention for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the province recently sent an
investment promotion delegation to the United States. The
delegation netted 17 contracts for investment in Jilin, including
nine for power projects, involving 1.27 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the contracts signed, foreign investment in
productive projects is on the rise, while the foreign investment
scale for some projects is also increasing.
</P>
<P>
Previously, direct investment from the U.S. in Jilin
concentrated on food processing, production of automobile
components, and real estate. Investments in the power and
petrochemical industries and transport facilities had been scarce.
</P>
<P>
The delegation signed contracts with foreign businesses in Los
Angeles and New York, for investment in the construction of basic
transport facilities, in addition to building several power plants
in the province.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the province has so far approved
the establishment of 4,000 foreign-backed enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Strong Growth Predicted for Indonesian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economy is poised
to experience a rebound next year, with electricity, gas and
water, construction and manufacturing expected to spearhead rapid
growth in 1997, according to a local economy advisory group,
Econit.
</P>
<P>
"Electricity, gas and water are expected to grow by 12.5
percent in 1997 boosted by the burgeoning demand for utilities,"
Econit said in its annual report released here last night.
</P>
<P>
"Provided that there is no political surprise, Indonesia will
book an economic growth of 7.5 percent in 1997," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is to hold general elections next year.
</P>
<P>
According to Econit, Indonesia will face a year of political
uncertainty next year, which will bear heavily on the country's
economic performance in the years to 2000.
</P>
<P>
The report said the construction sector is expected to register
a moderate growth of 11 percent in 1997, signaling an early
recovery in the property sector.
</P>
<P>
However, growth in the manufacturing sector will slow down to
around 10.8 percent, while the agricultural sector would remain
stagnant in 1997, with a slight growth of 1.4 percent, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
It said the country will book foreign direct investment of 4.8
billion US dollars next year, an increase of 20 percent from
1996's 4.1 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports are expected to grow by 13 percent in 1997, to be
boosted by rising oil prices and good performance of export
commodities, while imports would grow by 12 percent, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Rising exports and falling imports are expected to allow
Indonesia to record a trade surplus of 7.1 billion US dollars in
1997, up from 5.9 billion US dollars in 1996, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Plans Year-Long Sugar Processing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region is enjoying success as the country's leading
sugar producer.
</P>
<P>
For four consecutive years its sugar output has been the
highest throughout China. New plans have been announced for
year-round processing to give the sugar industry a major boost.
</P>
<P>
The region aims to lift its annual sugar production capacity to
more than three million tons by the turn of the century, compared
with the current two million tons, which accounts for one-third of
the country's total.
</P>
<P>
But the area aims to meet its extra target without the need to
build new all-purpose sugar refineries, or even to expand the
existing plants to develop the most important leading industry in
the locality.
</P>
<P>
The region intends to help its sugar refineries prolong their
seasonal production to a year-round operation, and to simplify
production processes of its old raw sugar refineries, according to
Qin Rifei, director of the Regional Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to transforming the old refineries, and
opening smaller branches to work alongside the big raw sugar
refineries, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
All the measures will lead to less investment in the sector,
compared with establishment of new all-purpose sugar refineries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The region is expected to refine five million tons of sugar a
year if the refineries add an extra three-to-four-months
to their production schedules.
</P>
<P>
The region will also attach greater importance to technology
upgrading, development of new products, as well as restructuring
product mix, improving the sector and increasing economic
returns.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier on Sino-British Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said here today that China and Britain should further promote
their economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet given in his honor by the China-Britain
Trade Group this evening, Li said that the Chinese government has
always attached great importance to developing its economic and
trade relations with the United Kingdom and made unremitting
efforts in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Since British Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine visited
China in May last year, the exchange of visits by senior officials
has increased and the political relations between the two
countries have also improved, paving the way for the further
development of bilateral trade and economic cooperation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier noted that the two-way trade volume in 1995
totalled 4.76 billion U.S. dollars, and it reached 3.4 billion
dollars in the first nine months of this year, an increase of 4.4
percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Up to June 1996, British businesses invested a total of 3
billion dollars in 1,673 projects in China, ranking first among
the 15 European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official expressed his conviction that China and
Britain would take more concrete measures to step up the
development of their bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
British businessmen are welcome to take part in the
competition and invest more in China, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua's Electoral Chief Target of Death Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Police have tightened security
around the president of Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council
(CSE) and her family in the wake of anonymous death threats
received since the October 20 general election, police confirmed
today.
</P>
<P>
Police say that disgruntled voters or parties who have
criticized vote-counting and claimed voting irregularities during
the election could be responsible for the telephone death threats
made to Rosa Marina Zelaya and her children.
</P>
<P>
A male caller phoned the CSE president's residence on November 2
and told her husband Jorge Samper that Zelaya's life would be
"terminated" in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Zelaya has been the target of much criticism from the
Sandinista National Liberation Front, one of the main parties
contesting the October elections for president and
parliament. They claimed that there were serious irregularities in
the preliminary and provisional results of the elections which
would have given victory to rival Arnoldo Aleman, the presidential
candidate for the Liberal Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Zelaya agreed to demands by the Sandinistas and 10 other
parties for a recount of the votes and the official results of the
election have not been announced.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A nicotine-free cigarette has
been developed in China to show that the country's biggest habit -
smoking - can be harmless.
</P>
<P>
Smokers can be refreshed by smoking the nicotine-free
cigarettes, without becoming addicted.
</P>
<P>
The new type of cigarettes, made of leaves and stems of dozens
of plants, looks no different from ordinary cigarettes. It
refreshes smokers by stimulating cortex cells of the brain with
fragrance in the raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Nicotine can cause lung, heart and cerebral diseases and is
an addictive drug.
</P>
<P>
The nicotine-free cigarettes, developed by Henan Agricultural
University and Zhengzhou Wantong Science and Technology Company in
central China's Henan province, can substitute traditional
cigarettes, and help people give up smoking.
</P>
<P>
Traditional cigarette-making equipment can be used to
produce the new cigarettes. The raw materials are plentiful and cheap.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Henan Provincial Science and Technology
Commission believed that the nicotine-free cigarettes would make
both economic and social returns.

CHANGSHA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese province has been
bombarded with profits - thanks to its air-raid shelters.
</P>
<P>
The shelters were built in the 1960s and 1970s to protect
Chinese people against possible foreign aerial attacks as part of
a wartime defense system.
</P>
<P>
Now the shelters are earning central China's Hunan Province
over 40 million yuan a year in profits.
</P>
<P>
Many original shelters are being transformed as underground
department stores, markets and recreation centers.
</P>
<P>
Some shelters are used for the growing of mushrooms and to
store fruit. Around 43 percent of the air-raid shelters are used
to store bananas, and to cultivate valuable medicinal herbs,
including gastrodia elata and glossy ganoderma.
</P>
<P>
The shelters provide ideal conditions, as they are warm in
winter and cool in summer.
</P>
<P>
The province generated an output value of 250 million yuan last
year, and a profit of 42 million yuan by using the shelters, said
a local official.

SHANGHAI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 unlicensed
dogs have been rounded up in Shanghai, China's largest city.
</P>
<P>
The city launched its dog catching drive several days ago, with
officials from various authorized departments heading onto city
streets and the countryside to capture unregistered dogs. The aim
is to stop illegal dog raising, and ensure the safety of residents.
</P>

Officials attribute the move to the increasing number of people
being bitten by dogs, mostly primary and middle school students.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 120,000 people were bitten by "man's best
friends" in recent years.
</P>

In the past three years, the city has stopped illegal raising
of 120,000 dogs, and tightened reins on more than 50,000 licensed
dogs in order to avoid rabies.
</P>
<P>
This year, the health department also checked 2,377 show dogs,
and treated or destroyed 692 dogs which had infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
The move against illegal raising has been warmly received by
local residents, and is expected to last until the end of the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Datang Telecommunications
Company has developed an advanced commercial telecom system, CN30,
to upgrade the country's public telephone networks.
</P>
<P>
Based the Shaanxi provincial capital of Xi'an, the company is
one of the country's leading telecommunications equipment
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The CN30 system, based on the SP30 switching machine, has a
designed exchange capacity of 400,000 lines, and can largely
improve the technological benchmark of public telephone networks,
without changing network system or other equipment, according to
"People's Posts and Telecommunications News."
</P>
<P>
The software of telephone networks can also be
upgraded by the CN30 system, without stopping normal operation.
</P>
<P>
So far, most of the country's public telephone systems are
technically outmoded, but upgrading is hindered by money
shortages. The CN30 system provides the domestic telephone
industry with a pragmatic solution, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The system has been used in Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province. It covers 12 exchange centers, and adds the
Centrex, ISDN (integrated service digital network) and corporation
telephone card functions to the city's telephone systems.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's first
satellite began sending information back from space today in spite
of functional breakdown of some instruments, the country's
National Commission on Space Activities (CONAE) said.
</P>
<P>
The first signals from the SAC-B satellite have been received,
which means that the satellite is working well, the CONAE said.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, put into orbit on Tuesday by a U.S. Pegasus
rocket from an air base in Virginia, the United States, was unable
to separate completely from the rocket during the third stage of
the launch. Several instruments were rendered useless due to the
defective launch.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, said a CONAE official, the solar panels which
generate energy for the satellite keep facing the sun and provide
the energy the on-board instruments need.
</P>
<P>
As programmed, the SAC-B is now orbiting at a height of 550
kilometers with a 37.9 degree tilt with respect to the Equator for
the purpose of studying solar radiations and other space emissions.
</P>
<P>
The 180-kilogram satellite was designed and built by Argentine
scientists with financing from the United States, Italy and
Brazil.

first-phase construction of Huanghua Port in Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study on the building of a new railway line from
Huanghua County, Hebei Province, to Shuoxian County in northern
Shanxi Province has also been approved by the Council.
</P>
<P>
It marks the start of the building of China's second energy

<HEADLINE> Austria to Provide $US500,000 in Aid for African Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Austrian government is to
give war-torn Zaire and Rwanda 5 million schillings (about 500,000
U.S. dollars) in relief aid to help refugees there.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said today he would
contact Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission, to
find the best channel for the money.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid Emma Bonino on
Sunday urged the international community to act quickly to help
refugees trapped in the warring central African countries "before
a humanitarian catastrophe turns into an international scandal".
</P>
<P>
Bonino also called for the urgent opening of safe supply routes
to channel emergency aid to nearly 1 million Hutu refugees in
eastern Zaire, with safe passage through both the Kivu Lake and
the Goma airport areas, both reportedly now controlled by Rwandan
forces who have been fighting Zairean government forces.
</P>
<P>
Bonino said about 800,000 people, more than half of them
children under 15, have sat down to die in an area between the
shores of Lake Kivu and the refugee camp of Mugunga, north of
Goma. They were without food, clean water and medical assistance
since international aid workers were forced to flee the conflict
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the Zairean army and Tutsi-led Rwandan troops
springs from the deadly rivalry between Tutsis and Hutus.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic conflict in neighboring Rwanda in 1994 left nearly 1
million dead and Zaire became the unhappy host to 1.1 million Hutu
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Now, ethnic Tutsi Banyamalenge rebels who settled in Zaire
generations ago are fighting to gain the Zairean citizenship
they've been denied. Zaire accuses Rwanda and Burundi, whose
armies and governments are dominated by minority Tutsis, of
backing the rebels.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Compulsory Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In nine underdeveloped province-level areas in northwest and
central areas almost two thirds of school-age children will soon
receive nine-year compulsory education, with even higher numbers
at school in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
It is part of a nationwide drive to increase the number of
children enjoying compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
The municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, together
with 1,025 counties nationwide, were surveyed during 1995 by the
State Education Commission (SEC) on compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
The group accounts for 36 percent of China's total school-age
children, a national work conference on the development of the
nine-year compulsory education program was told in Hefei, capital
city of east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The rate will increase to 45 percent by the end of this year,
and compulsory education will realize comprehensive coverage in
the six economically-developing provinces by 1997, and the 12
provinces in central China by 1999.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 65 percent of the school-age children will receive
compulsory education in nine developing provinces and ethnic
regions in northwest and southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Liu Bin, deputy-director of SEC, urged educational departments
at all levels to further promote compulsory education and put more
investment into the sector.
</P>
<P>
Educators who attended the conference exchanged their
experiences in compulsory education promotion, discussed new
issues, and mapped out a plan for future development.
</P>
<P>
School-age children are permitted to attend nearby schools free
of charge, Liu pointed out, adding that local primary and middle
schools should enroll students of different education
levels.

YINCHUAN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region in Northwest China has become China's largest base for
calcium cyanamide and bicyanamide production.
</P>
<P>
The annual output of tonscalcium cyanamide and bicyanamide, two
kinds of synergists for chemical fertilizers, reached 35,000 tons
and 5,000 tons, respectively, in the land-locked region.
</P>
<P>
The region has become China's sole exporter of tonscalcium
cyanmide, and its exports of bicyanamide accounted for one third
of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
These two chemical products sell well on the international
market because of large demand and their fine quality, according
to the local government.
</P>
<P>
The region has paid close attention to scientific research to
improve quality of the products. The nitrogen content in the
tonscalcium cyanmide is two percent higher than the same kind of
products in the country, while ammonia levels in the bicyanamide
is four percent higher.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Report Recommends Sweden Wait Before Joining EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A report commissioned by the
Swedish government recommended the country not join the European
Monetary Union (EMU) at its scheduled inception in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The report was quoted as saying by local press today that both
Sweden's state finance and its unemployment rate could worsen if
Sweden took part in the single currency mechanism at its early
stage.
</P>
<P>
"Our evaluation of both economic and political arguments is
that the factors that speak against Swedish participation in the
first round in 1999 are stronger than those that support it."
</P>
<P>
However, said the report, if unemployment comes down and the
state finance situation becomes more stable, the opinion regarding
the EMU membership will change "in a strongly positive manner".
</P>
<P>
Swedish Finance Minister Erik Asbrink believed that the report,
prepared by a special commission, could be an important
contribution toward the debate which both he and Prime Minister
Goeran Persson have called for before the decision on the EMU
membership is to be made in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish press recently reported that most Swedes oppose
joining the EMU, the preparation of which is currently underway by
the 15-nation European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Of 1,100 Swedes polled, 38 percent opposed membership whereas
26 percent supported it. The remaining 38 percent were still
undecided.

<HEADLINE> Engine Problem Causes Last Month's Plane Crash in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The fatal crash two weeks ago of
a U.S. commercial cargo plane in Ecuador was caused by an engine
problem, said the Civil Aviation Department today.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 707, owned by Million Air, a U.S.-based carrier,
"apparently suffered a loss of power in the NO. 3 motor 7 seconds
after takeoff," said the Ecuadoran government agency.
</P>
<P>
The NO. 3 motor of a Boeing 707 is known to be on the inner
right-hand side of the U.S.-made aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Million Air Boeing 707 crashed on October 22 into a
residential area in the city of Manta, about 250 kilometers
southwest of Quito on Ecuador's Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy killed the plane's crew of four and 20 others on
the ground, prompting the aviation authorities to suspend the
U.S. company's operations in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
A panel of experts assigned to investigate air accidents has
yet to submit an official report since some information from the
so-call black box containing flight data is still missing.
</P>
<P>
Following the accident, Ecuadoran President Abdala Bucaram
declared three days of national mourning and ordered all public
servants to donate one day's wages to help the victims.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Iceland Flooded by Melting Glacier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Large areas of southeast
Iceland are threatened with serious flooding after a huge
subglacial lake formed by an erupting volcano burst on Tuesday,
sending millions of gallons of water cascading over uninhabited
plains.
</P>
<P>
Flooding caused by the melting ice on Europe's largest glacier,
the Vatnajokul, has already damaged several bridges, roads and
buildings on the island, but with the area mostly uninhabited,
there have been no deaths or injuries, reports reaching here say.
</P>
<P>
Hydrologist Arni Snorrason, a scientist monitoring the
sub-glacier lake, was quoted by Agence France Presse as saying
that the volume of water pouring out of the estimated 9 billion
cubic meter lake was increasing at a pace never before seen.
</P>
<P>
The volume could reach a torrential 30,000 cubic meters per
second within the new few days, some experts claim.
</P>
<P>
The Vatnajokul glacier, some 250 kilometers east of the
Icelandic capital Reykjavik, has been melting since the volcano
underneath it erupted at the beginning of October, causing a
massive subglacial lake to form.
</P>
<P>
The glacier stretches over 8,300 square kilometers on the south
east of Iceland and is as deep as 1,000 meters in some parts.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Stocking Firms Mushrooming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- As the structural reform to
set up modern enterprises develops further, share-holding
enterprises and joint stock cooperative companies are popping up
in China's largest industrial city.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, from January to September,
Shanghai had established 8,760 share-holding enterprises and joint
stock cooperative enterprises -- an average of 32 a day.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 32,000 of the operations, which account for
11.8 percent of all state-owned enterprises in the city, a 37.9
percent increase over the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Of these firms, share-holding enterprises were numbered at more
than 22,000, up 54.9 percent from the end of 1995. Meanwhile, the
joint stock cooperative enterprises had also made headway, with a
total of 9,689, up 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experiences obtained from the reform in the past few years show
that the setting-up of joint stock cooperative firms has been an
effective way of reviving small state-owned enterprises, according
to some observers.
</P>
<P>
Presently, most of the joint stock cooperative enterprises
involved in the restructural experiments in Shanghai have been
successful.

<HEADLINE> China's First Chip Production Line Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WEIHAI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China's first line to produce
micro-chips for software disks has recently gone into operation in
a Sino-American joint venture in Weihai, in east China's Shandong
Province.
</P>
<P>
It means that China has become the third country in the world,
after the US and Japan, to produce the hi-tech chips.
</P>
<P>
The project, a joint effort between two local companies and a
firm from the United States, cost 8.1 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the past China imported chip production lines from foreign
countries, but failed to operate them because of the requirements
for higher technologies. So all the chips used in China have been
imported from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, set up in 1994, imported equipment and
technology from the US, to produce chips that reach the same
quality as international standards.
</P>
<P>
In China the joint venture is the only successful one of its
kind.

<HEADLINE> Students Become Taller, But Weaker: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Students in Sichuan, the most
populous province in China, are growing taller and putting on
weight, but their physiques have become weaker.
</P>
<P>
The results emerged from a survey conducted by Sichuan
provincial educational and public health departments among 75,000
students aging between seven and 22, in 14 cities and prefectures.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that compared with 1985, the average heights
of urban boy and girl students increased by 1.21 cm and 1.34 cm,
respectively. Their weight grew by 1.29 kilograms and 1.02
kilograms, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The height of rural students grew by 4.33 cm for boys and 3.42
cm for girls, and their weights by 2.08 kilograms for boys and
1.16 kilograms for girls.
</P>
<P>
The speed, explosive force and strength all increased markedly,
the survey says.
</P>
<P>
However, the test results of vital capacity and endurance among
students caused people to worry.
</P>
<P>
There are also increasing number of students who have poor
eyesight. Compared with 1985, the number of poor-sighted students
has increased by 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey reveals that 22.3 percent of primary school students
are poor-sighted, and for junior and senior middle school
students, the rates stand at 49.9 percent and 67.5 percent,
respectively. There are also 86.9 percent of college students who
have poor vision.
</P>
<P>
More serious, 92.6 percent of urban girl students are
poor-sighted.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed that one factor causing such a phenomenon is
students' heavy homework burden. They urged schools, families and
society to make concerted efforts to create a fine environment for
students to grow healthily.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Refugees in Zaire Should Go Home: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) said today that the
1.2 million Rwandan and Burundian refugees in eastern Zaire have
stayed in exile too long and should go home.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Vieira de Mello, assistant commissioner of UNHCR, today
held talks with Rwandan Vice President and Defense Minister Paul
Kagame in Kigali on the present refugee crisis in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted UNHCR spokesman in
Kigali, Paul Stromberg, as saying that de Mello "came out of the
talks with the conviction that the exile (of refugees) has lasted
long enough and the Rwandan refugees should return."
</P>
<P>
De Mello and Kagame also discussed ways to establish a human
corridor in east Zaire, which is now controlled by Rwanda-backed
Banyamulenge Tutsis, to rescue 1.2 Rwandan and Burundian refugees.
</P>
<P>
These refugees have been living without aid and protection
after the staff of international humanitarian groups withdrew last
Saturday from east Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that all things should be put into work to
repatriate the refugees on the basis of voluntariness.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the people have chosen to go home after the fightings
in east Zaire and the new exodus of the refugees. The return home
will be the best solution," said Stromberg.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR delegation left Kigali today for Nairobi, where a
summit of the Great Lakes region on Zairean crisis was held today.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders of the Great Lakes region attending the
summit called for the deployment of "a neutral force" in
cooperation with the Organization of African Unity, according to
reports reaching here.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Urge U.N. Peacekeeping in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- African leaders today urged
the United Nations Security Council to deploy a "neutral force"
in eastern Zaire for the protection of over one million Rwandan
and Burundi refugees there.
</P>
<P>
Safe havens should be established for the refugees, according
to the decision made by a one-day regional summit, convened here
on the latest crisis in the Great Lakes Region following Tutsi
rebels' capturing of Zaire's eastern regions bordering Rwanda,
Burundi and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here this evening, the summit,
initiated by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, also agreed that
an immediate ceasefire should be effected and strictly observed.
</P>
<P>
Attendants of the summit included Secretary-General of the
Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim, presidents
of Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, Zambia, Eritrea and
the foreign minister of Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
However, the absence of Zaire's Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo
at the summit undermined the regional efforts to seek a way out
of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, French President Jacques Chirac said in the
Mediterranean port of Marseille that the proposed multinational
peacekeeping force to create safe havens for refugees in eastern
Zaire could be replaced by an African force.
</P>
<P>
So far, the U.N. Security Council has not made a mandate to
such a force.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the
territorial integrity of Zaire in accordance with the OAU Charter
and called for an end to cross-border incursions.
</P>
<P>
They also directed thier foreign ministers to closely follow
up the decisions of the summit.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Army Chiefs Assess Liberia's Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Chiefs of staff from the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) today began a
two-day meeting in Monrovia, Capital of Liberia, on the latest
developments in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said top army officials will discuss the
aftermath of last week's foiled assassination of Charles Taylor,
leader of the country's largest faction, the National Patriotic
Front of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS Executive Secretary Edouard Benjamin warned the
warlords of the danger of breaking ceasefire following the
attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Taylor was attacked by unidentified gunmen when
he got near his office in Liberia's ruling Council of State.
Several of his bodyguards were killed with his aide-de-camp
wounded trying to protect Taylor, who escaped unharmed.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who is also a council member, said the gunmen were
firing from the direction of the office of George Boley, accusing
him of acting "the mastermind behind the assassination attempt."
</P>
<P>
But Boley, who is also a member of the council, denied
responsibility for the attack, adding that the incident was "not
related" to the clashes between his faction and Taylor's fighters
in southeast Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS peacekeeping force operating in liberia, the
ECOMOG, has begun investigations into the incident and has
arrested a number of persons, including militiamen, in connection
with Thursday's attack.
</P>
<P>
According to Major-General Victor Malu, commander of the
ECOMOG force, those arrested are mainly faction soldiers loyal to
Boley and Taylor's another rival General Roosevelt Johnson.

<HEADLINE> China Airs Out Views on Draft Code of Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Chen
Shiqiu today expressed different views on three points of the Code
of Crimes against Peace and Security of Mankind.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Sixth Committee of the U.N. General Assembly,
he said that the draft code on the whole reflects some of the
principles of the international law and includes some of the
serious international crimes widely recognized by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
However, there are some serious problems in the draft code that
cannot be ignored. Otherwise, they can affect the possibility of
the draft code of becoming an universally accepted international
legal instrument, he said.
</P>
<P>
First, the principle of Non Bis In Idem is a principle widely
recognized and applied in the criminal law system of states. The
exceptions regarding the application of this principle do not
reflect the true implication of this principle. Moreover, to
elaborate such provisions in the purview of international law will
inevitably give rise to controversy.
</P>
<P>
Second, as the International Law Commission and the Sixth
Committee have decided only the most serious crimes against the
peace and security of mankind be included in the draft code, the
crimes against the U.N. and the associated personnel, though more
and more grave, are in no way on par with those international
crimes included in the Draft. The inclusion of this crime in the
draft code will seriously upset the balance of the listed crimes
and renders it incomprehensible the exclusion of such relatively
serious crimes as the international terrorism and drug trafficking
etc.
</P>
<P>
Third, the legislative bodies should take into full account the
reasonable components of the draft code and the draft statute of
the international criminal court so as to achieve harmony and
consistency in the related principles and in the contents of the
two instruments.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Int'l Cooperation on Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese diplomat
called on Tuesday for international cooperation in the field of
population and development.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Second Committee (Economics), Wang Qun
recalled that in the past year, the Program of Action of the
International Conference on Population and Development is being
implemented at all levels.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that more efforts are needed to timely
transform objectives into reality, especially by enhancing
international cooperation and injecting fund.
</P>
<P>
"While it is necessary for national governments themselves to
work to implement the Program of Action, a favorable external
environment and adequate financial resources are indispensable to
the implementation of the Program of Action and to a comprehensive
solution to the problem of population and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that the fulfillment of the population
package by the year 2000 will still require 5.7 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of funds still stands out as the most prominent sticking
point in the implementation process," he said. "In this regard,
the international community, particularly the developed countries,
should honour their commitments to provide new and additional
resources for the implementation of the program of Action."
