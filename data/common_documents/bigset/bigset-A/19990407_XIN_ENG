<HEADLINE> Romania to Expand Danube Delta Woodland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Romania's River Danube Delta
research institute issued a project to replenish forests in the
Danube Delta, due to run until the year 2015, after winning
financial support from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 300 hectares of land by the Chilia branch and 400
hectares by the Sf. Gheorghe branch, two of the Danube's three
arms that make a vast wetland before they empty into the Black
Sea, will be afforested under the provisions of the program.
</P>
<P>
The first bout of this enterprise kicked off in 1998. Wood
plantation works are aimed to breathe fresh life into the
environment of the Delta region, by making up for vast swathes of
woodland lost to the irrigation, diking, draining and landscaping
fever over the course of the past decades, when heed for sensible
conservation practices was utterly missing.
</P>
<P>
The Natural Reservation of the Danube Delta encompasses 580,000
hectares, the equivalent of 2.5 percent of Romania's landmass, and
is the third in importance after the Amazon Delta and the Nile
Delta.
</P>
<P>
The Danube Delta area is home to hundreds of bird species and
it is the only sanctuary in the world which 176 of these species
can tolerate for nesting.
</P>
<P>
Rare birds like the red-collar duck, accounting for 90 percent
of the world population, the white egret, 71 percent, and the
Lilliputian cormorant, 61 percent, have found their home in the
Danube Delta area.
</P>
<P>
The waters of the Danube Delta accomodate numberless fishes, of
which some of industrial value, like carp, catfish, pike, and
migratory sturgeons.
</P>
<P>
In December 1990, the Natural Reservation of the River Danube
Delta was included by UNESCO into the world cultural heritage. The
non-refundable financial assistance project was signed with the
World Bank on August 24, 1994, and it is worth 4.5 million U.S.
dollars. It centers on the protection and development of the
ecosystem in this area.
</P>
<P>
The project also provides for the unfolding of a monitoring
program, due to take stock of the species living in the Danube
Delta, oversee the ecosystem and the hydrographic basin.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Tuesday agreed to extend U.N. observer mission on the
Iraq-Kuwait boder for another six months.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council reviewed the latest
report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the mission.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Council President Alain Dejammet of
France said the Council agreed to the routine extension without
any debate.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in his report that the U.S. and British airstrikes
against Iraq did not significantly affect the U.N. observer
mission during the period from September 24, 1998 to March 23,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The 1,311-strong U.N. mission has been monitoring the

<HEADLINE> WFP Appeals for Food Aid to Refugees in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World
Food Program (WFP) Tuesday called on donors to offer food aid to
beef up food stock for the refugees sheltered in western Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The program's country director Irene Lacy said here that during
the past two months, a shortage of funds has forced the United
Nations agency to use buffer stock in most camps to feed refugees.
</P>
<P>
There are some 350,000 refugees from the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Rwanda and Burundi in the camps in the Kigoma and Kagera
regions in northwestern Tanzania, which requires a total of 7,000
tons of food per month.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, said Lacy, WFP has a food stock for only six
weeks and additional quantities will be urgently needed to
maintain ration levels for recipients.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to receive announcements of additional pledges during
the coming weeks thus easing the pressure which currently exists,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Lacy explained that refugees in Tanzania were currently being
provided with a daily ration of maize or maize meal, pulses, oil,
a blended food and salt.
</P>
<P>
The United States Agency for International Development has so
far promised 4,500 tons of food worth 1.6 million U.S. dollars and
the first wagon containing food from Uganda arrived in Tanzania
Monday, she said.
</P>
<P>
Another shipment of food from South Africa is expected within
the next four to five weeks. However, the U.N. official noted
that food delivery during existing rainy seasons is very tough.
</P>
<P>
"Competing demands around the world make it very difficult for
donors to prioritize assistance," she said, adding that Tanzania
itself is also suffering an acute shortage of food for its
population.

<HEADLINE> Feature: NATO Bombing Shatters Milica's Dream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEKSINAC, Yugoslavia, April 6 (Xinhua) -- For 13-year-old
Milica, playing piano is part of daily life, but a NATO bomb on
Monday disrupted her tranquil life and shattered her music dream.
</P>
<P>
Her piano now lies on the second floor of her roofless
two-story house on the Vuk Karadic street, one of the busiest
residential quarters in this mining town some 200 kilometers south
of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Milica and her 19-year-old sister Jelena and 8-year-old Milan
were scavenging the rubbles for whatever was still usable. They
dug out books, Milica's award certificates and a Zenith camera.
</P>
<P>
When the bomb exploded near their house, Milica, Jelena and
Milan were staying with their parents in a village house nearby.
Their 70-year-old grandfather, Branko, was thrown out of his bed
in the second floor and landed on the ground. Their grandmother,
68, was crushed in the bathroom on the first floor.
</P>
<P>
The two old couple were seriously wounded and are now in an
intensive care unit in a hospital in neighboring Nis, Jelena said,
taking snapshots of what was remaining of her house.
</P>
<P>
The owners of the neighboring building, which was almost
totally demolished, 70-year-old Vlastimir, his wife Vukica and
their daughter Snezen, perished in the blast. Vlastimir's
15-year-old granddaughter Diane and 10-year-old Marko were
severely wounded.
</P>
<P>
The destruction was much worse in a 10,000 square meter
residential area several hundred meters away on the Dusana Trevnca
street, where a second NATO bomb landed.
</P>
<P>
About 11 apartments were reduced to rubbles. A patch of
blood-soaked ground could be seen amid such articles as a
children's tricycle, two umbrellas and one black shoe.
</P>
<P>
The owner of one flattened house picked up one vase and two
plastic glasses from the ruins, too distraught to tell her name
and what happened to her family.
</P>
<P>
Nearby, water could be heard leaking from that damaged pipes,
as if mourning the 12 innocent civilian victims of NATO bombing.
More than 30 were gravely wounded in the city of 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The strong explosion shattered the tiles and glasses of many
houses nearby. When a group of foreign reporters arrived on
Tuesday afternoon, residents were still cleaning the streets,
which were strewn with broken glasses, tiles, and window and door
frames.
</P>
<P>
A old man with a bandaged skull and stains of blood on his
shoulder could be seen staggering along.
</P>
<P>
"There was air-raid sirens before the bombing, but we had no
shelter to go," said 40- year-old fashion designer Zora Milykovic,
who was three months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
Stana Stojavic, a 62-year-old woman who witnessed the massacres
of Nazis soldiers during the Second World War, could not believe
what had happened Monday night.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't invade any country. Here are all old people,
children. They are all civilians. No military targets. Why did
NATO bomb us?
</P>
<P>
"Is killing innocent civilians democracy?" she asked.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Parliament Resumes After Recess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan National Assembly
resumed Tuesday after a four-month recess since Christmas with a
speech made by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
"Unemployment, hunger, malnutrition and the burden of
cost-sharing in schools and hospitals are some of the problems
that call for our urgent attention," said Moi.
</P>
<P>
Poor roads, inadequate supply of water, energy and
communication facilities also continue to hamper the efforts to
raise economic growth rates, the president added.
</P>
<P>
Moi also noted that the structural adjustment policies required
by the International Monetary Fund resulted in painful
consequences in a short term, increasing unemployment and
worsening the poverty situation.
</P>
<P>
With regard to poverty eradication, Moi said "a lasting
solution to the problem of poverty can only be achieved through
the realization of higher economic growth rate".
</P>
<P>
On anti-corruption, the president said the government had
established the Kenyan Anti-Corruption Authority to deal with
cases of corruption and urged the members of parliament to
support the anti-graft body.
</P>
<P>
Regarding security, Moi said the government had taken the
necessary actions to increase budgetary resources to strengthen
the security of the borders under a circumstance where insecurity
in the neighboring countries increase.
</P>
<P>
Moi also appealed to all Kenyans to cooperate and unite to
address the problems the country faces, such as the
constitutional review stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Moi's speech has drew mixed reactions from members of
parliament. Vice- President George Saitoti and Attorney General
S.A. Wako were confident that Moi's speech will guide the
government toward a success.
</P>
<P>
However, parliament members from opposition parties said they
could not see any concrete measures to solve the problems Kenya
faces through the speech.
</P>
<P>
This session of parliament is the last one in this millenium.
During the session, the government will table a number of bills
for discussion by the parliament. These will include the Traffic
Bill and the Medical Laboratory Technicians and Technologists
Bill, the Industrial Property Bill, the Tea Bill and the Kenya
Roads Board Bill.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan National Assembly is one-house parliament with 224
members. President Moi's ruling party Kenyan African National
Union (KANU) has 114 seats in current session.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- An Arab human rights group Tuesday
strongly deplored the inhumane practices by the Israeli authorities
against Arab people.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Organization for Human Rights said in a periodical
newsletter circulated here Tuesday that it had received
information about the deteriorating conditions of Lebanese
prisoners in Israel's Khayam prison, with many of them suffering
from serious illness.
</P>
<P>
The organization said that it has the names of 24 prisoners who
are in a serious condition. Some of them are under the age of 18,
it added.
</P>
<P>
The organization called on the international community to
pressure the Israeli government to stop torturing the Arabs while
urging the international public opinion to make efforts to seek
the release of the Lebanese prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state has jailed many Lebanese who fought against
its occupation in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> UK Scientists Develop Nutritive "Designer Egg" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in Scotland have
developed a new type of chicken egg that can help cut the risk of
a variety of diseases.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "designer egg", announced at the on-going
Edinburgh Science Festival, has raised levels of four important
chemicals including vitamin E, docosahexaenic fatty acid (DHA),
lutein and selenium.
</P>
<P>
Since early study has linked increased level of these chemicals
with a decreased risk of different diseases, the scientists, from
the Scottish Agricultural College, believed that the new "designer
egg" may help reduce the risk of heart disease and some cancers.
</P>
<P>
The researchers stressed that the nutritive quality of the
"designer egg" has been improved by enhancing the diet of laying
hens, a process which does not involve genetic modification.
</P>
<P>
The college is now seeking a commercial partner to bring the
egg to market, the researchers said.

<HEADLINE> Closed Palestinian Offices to Appeal Israeli Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian offices in East
Jerusalem shut down by Israel will appeal the closure orders to
Israel's High Court of Justice, the Voice of Palestine reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jawad Bulus, the lawyer appointed by the three Palestinian
offices, said the closure orders issued by Israeli government were
"political, not legal," the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police Sunday served closure orders on the Palestinian
News Agency, the Palestinian Prisoners Society and the Christian
Services Office, in East Jerusalem, claiming they have "close
cooperations" with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Israeli authorities forbid PNA organs and offices to operate in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The closure decision was made on March 29 at a meeting attended
by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon, Defense Minister Moshe Arens and Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani.
</P>
<P>
The PNA sharply criticized the decision last Thursday, terming
it "aggressive measures against Palestinian national institutions
in East Jerusalem" and "a challenge to international legitimacy."
</P>
<P>
Such decision was taken apparently to contain the Palestinian
political and diplomatic activities in the traditionally Arab East
Jerusalem, which Israel took in 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Israel regards Jerusalem as its sovereign capital, a claim
rejected by the Palestinians, who said the holy city, especially
East Jerusalem, is an occupied territory.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to become the capital of
their future independent state.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Map Should Not Be Changed: Talbott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott Tuesday stressed here that it was imperative
that the Europe's map and that of the Balkan region as well,
should not be changed.
</P>
<P>
The American official made the remark to the press after his
meeting with Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu. Talbott
completed on the same day the last leg of a tour in countries
neighbouring Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
NATO's actions do not aim to change Europe's or the region's
map, but to find a satisfactory and acceptable solution to the
conflict in Kosovo, Talbott stressed.
</P>
<P>
Talbott hailed Romania's decision to get involved in seeking
for a solution to the issues in the area, adding that Romania
stands for a sure security exporter. He also expressed admiration
and gratitude for Romania's having assumed the difficult task of
receiving refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that the American Government intended to
considerably increase the financial aid for Romania, announcing
that the bilateral assistance program was supplemented with six
million U.S. dollars, taking the total amount to 46.6 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Talbott believed that Romania was acting fairly, winning United
States' friendship. "The Romanian-U.S. strategic partnership has
gradually switched from an abstract concept to a specific re|ity,"
he said, promising that the NATO summit in Washington would
forcefully encourage the idea that Romania must become a partner
of the military bloc.

</P>
<P>
Ntaryamira was killed in a plane crash over Rwandan capital
Kigali on April 6, 1994 along with Rwandan Hutu president Juvenal

LOS ANGELES, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
said that with joint efforts of both sides, his current visit to
the United States would achieve positive results and help bring a
sound and stable Sino-U.S. relationship into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Los Angeles Tuesday morning, opening an eight-day
official visit to this country as guest of U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement upon arrival at the Los Angeles

premier said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the first stop of his visit, Zhu noted that
exchanges and cooperation between California, especially Los
Angeles, and China in the economic, trade, cultural, educational
and other fields have been very vigorous in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Ministers May Face Censure After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan ministers who have been
removed from their posts or moved to other positions for their
involvement in various scandals may still face censure by the
parliament, an official told Xinhua Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Kagole Kivumbi, public relations officer with the parliament,
said:"The parliament is still studying and debating the report by
the select committee and those ministers implicated in the valley
dam scandal may still be censured."
</P>
<P>
"In the latest cabinet reshuffle, some ministers were just
moved to other positions. The parliament is considering whether
what the president has done is enough or not," the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
In the surprise cabinet reshuffle Monday, Vice President
Specioza Kazibwe was removed from the post of Minister of
Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries which she had been
holding since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Of the two state ministers working under her, one is now in
charge of environment while the other remained state minister in
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the report by the select committee on
agriculture recommended that the three ministers be removed for
failing to supervise the valley dam project which caused a
colossal loss of 3.4 billion shillings (3.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Francis Babu, former state minister for primary education, was
discontinued from his Master Degree studies by the renowned
Makerere University recently for being short of the minimum
academic requirements. This scandal is also likely to make him
being censured by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
This time he was transferred to take care of energy and
minerals instead of being dropped out by the president.
</P>
<P>
If the parliament considers President Yoweri Museveni has not
done enough to clean the cabinet, members of parliament can
continue to press for censure against the above ministers.

CAIRO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Tuesday expressed welcome to the suspension
of U.N. sanctions on Libya.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said in a statement that Libya's handover of the
two suspects in the bombing a Pan Am jetliner for trial in the
Netherlands marks a final step towards ending a quandary.
</P>
<P>
Libya surrendered the two suspects on Monday to U.N.
representatives, who escorted them to a former U.S. military base
near the Hague, where they will be tried under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council announced Monday that the sanctions
imposed on Libya in 1992 was "automatically suspended" after U.N
Secretary General Kofi Annan informed it that the suspects had
arrived in the Netherlands.

The two Libyans were accused of blowing up the Pan Am flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, killing 270 people. The
U.S. and Britain pressed the U.N. Security Council to impose the
sanctions, including ban on flights to and from Libya.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid reiterated the league's support for Libya's stand
on getting guarantees for a fair trial of the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
Washington and London had demanded that the two Libyans be
tried either in the U.S. or Britain. But fearing that its citizens
would not get a fair trial, Libya refused the demand, insisting
that the two be tried in a third, neutral country.
</P>
<P>
The two Western allies later compromised to agree that the two
Libyans be tried in the Netherlands before a Scottish court. If
convicted, they will be imprisoned in Scotland under U.N.
supervision.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urged to Care Elders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Health Minister
Aaron Chiduo Tuesday urged the society to give more care to the
elders as the number of aged people in the country is increasing
fast.
</P>
<P>
"The society must pay special attention to a positive life
habit and give consideration to recommended nutritious food,
environmental sanitation and body cleanness," Chiduo told a press
conference here in the capital, adding that a healthy life style
is the corner-stone of longevity.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's World Health Day which falls on April
7 is " physical strength in the elderly brings difference in
living and makes you appreciate your elderly state," he said.
</P>
<P>
The theme goes together with the International Year for the
Aged which was inaugurated on October 1 last year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that there will be a total of 2.4 million
aged people in Tanzania in the year 2000, according to the 1988
national census.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged people to abandon bad customs in treating
the elders, for example, the rampant witch hunting practices in
several regions in which hundreds of innocent elderly people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
People's life expectancy has increased this century and as a
result the number of aged people has also increased in the world,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the World Health Organization show that 580
million aged people are in their sixties and the number is
expected to increase by 75 percent to one billion in 20 years.

ATHENS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas Tuesday expressed Athens' willingness to help the
neighboring Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) to cope
with the wave of refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Reppas said that Greece was fully
prepared to do so. He added that Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis had spoken with his FYROM counterpart Ljubco Georgievski
and said he would bring up Georgievski's concerns over the large
influx of refugees from Kosovo with all the international
organizations Greece participates in.
</P>

Reppas also said that the dispute between the two countries
over the former's name was "a separate issue" that was being dealt
with in the framework of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the Kosovo crisis might create better
understanding leading to a resolution of the name issue.
</P>
<P>
Greece has agreed to take in some 5,000 refugees from Kosovo
following a weekend announcement by Skopje that it could receive
no more refugees without guarantees and that the refugees would be
redirected to another country.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the refugee problem, Greece has decided to
establish refugee centers around the country and to give 2.5
billion U.S. dollars in aid to Albania, FYROM and Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Cut down Oil Outputs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Tuesday to cut
down its daily oil outputs according to the recent agreement of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on
reducing production ceiling to boost prices.
</P>
<P>
The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) said that Iran would
cut down by at least 10 percent in April and 12 percent in May
from its February's daily export volume, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC members agreed to cut their oil outputs by 2.1
million barrels per day (bpd) at the 107th ministerial meeting in
Vienna last month. According to the agreement, Iran's daily oil
output should be reduced from 3.925 million bpd to 3.35 million
bpd in April.
</P>
<P>
However, the NIOC did not mention the volume of Iran's daily
output and export volume in February. Some reports put Iran's
production at 3.6 million bpd and its export at 2.5 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
The NIOC also expressed hope that with the coordination between
the company and its clients, oil prices would undergo further
stability in the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The special envoy of Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi told Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Tuesday that his country is determined to reach a peace
deal with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Vice-Foreign Minister Tekeda Alemu said this to the
Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana in Harare after he had delivered to
Mugabe a special message from Meles.
</P>
<P>
The official said Ethiopia was adhering to the peace proposals
put forward by the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The message he presented to Mugabe dealt with expediting the
achievement of peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Alemu said Eritrea needed to show more commitment to the
achievement of peace instead of pretending because Ethiopia had
inflicted heavy damage on it.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was one of the leaders tasked by the OAU to find a
solution between the two Horn of Africa neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been fighting over the disputed border
issue since last May. Despite a lot of efforts, the international
community failed to reach a truce between them.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Receive First Kosovo Refugees Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN April 6 (Xinhua)--Germany is expected to receive first 600
Kosovo refugees Wednesday afternoon in the southern city of
Nuremberg, Bavaria's Ministry for Social Affairs announced Tuesday
in Munich.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday there will be a total 10,000 refugees arriving in
Germany, Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said in Bonn, adding
that the aged, the patients, and the help-needing children will be
given the priority of being flown from the crisis region by planes
of German forces.
</P>
<P>
About 2,240 of the ten thousand refugees will be at first sent
to the receive centers in the sate of North Rhine-Westphalia,
1,400 in Bavaria, 1,220 in Bade-Wurttemburg, with the remaining
sent to other German states.
</P>
<P>
Pro Asyl, an organization aiming at helping the Kosovo
refugees, has demanded Bonn admit more refugees than it has
promised, saying that Germany can and should receive at least
120,000 refugees, twice more than the German cabinet has decided
to receive.
</P>
<P>
Aiding the refugees in the spot is more emergent than recieving
them in Germany, Minister for Inen Affairs Otto Schilly argued
Tuesday in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
The German forces will strengthen its air transportation of aid
for refugees in Albania and Macedonia, Scharping said, quoting
that by now there are at least six flights per day from Germany to
the region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Ceasefire Offer by Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Tuesday
rejected a unilateral ceasefire offer by Yugoslavia in Kosovo and
President Bill Clinton reiterated the terms to end NATO's
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
"We've made very clear that any hollow, half measures will not
stop the bombing," said David Leavy, a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"NATO operations will continue until these conditions are met,"
said Leavy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Defense
Secretary William Cohen said the Yugoslav cease-fire offer is "not
only completely unacceptable but it's absurd."
</P>
<P>
Cohen also said he was flying to NATO headquarters in Belgium
Tuesday to consult with alliance military and political leaders.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic
announced Belgrade had called an imminent unilateral ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The United States insists Belgrade meet all of demands by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), including withdrawal of
Serb forces from Kosovo and allowing ethnic Albanian refugees to
return.
</P>
<P>
During a White House ceremony, Clinton said that NATO's
airstrikes will end if Belgrade withdraws its forces from Kosovo,
accepts terms of a peace accord and allows refugees to return.
</P>
<P>
"The United States would never choose force as anything other
than a last option," Clinton said when speaking of the crisis in
Kosovo briefly.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. (Slobodan) Milosevic could end it now by withdrawing his
military.... and paramilitary forces,... by accepting the
deployment of an international security force to protect not only
the Kosovar Albanians... but also the Serbian minority... and by
making it possible for all the refugees to return," Clinton added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Minister of Post,
Telephone and Telegram Issam Naaman and visiting senior
Palestinian official in charge of refugees affairs Abdel Rahman
held talks over Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two officials reached an agreement to
set up a joint committee to handle the livelihood of Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon in line with international human rights
standards, the official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 350,000 Palestinians are now living in 12 refugee camps
across Lebanon under the financial support by the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency.
</P>
<P>
They were forced to flee their homes since Israel declared an
independent state on May 14, 1948.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government, which has been kept alert about the
permanent settlement of these Palestinians in Lebanon, imposed
strict limits on their jobs in the country.
</P>
<P>
Rahman told a news conference after the talks that Palestine
categorically opposes the permanent settlement as the
U.N. Resolution 194 grants Palestinians the right to return home
and claim compensations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed thanks for the efforts made by the new Lebanese
regime of President Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss to
deal with the Palestinian affairs.
</P>
<P>
As soon as Lahoud came to power last November and set up the
new government led by Hoss in January, Lebanese security
authorities eased travel restrictions on Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
They were granted easier entry and departure from and to
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier's Interview with Canadian Publisher (9) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: I have a question on human rights. The United States has
announced that it will once again table a draft resolution
accusing China at this year's Human Rights Session. One year ago,
China signed UN human rights conventions. But in the year after
that, some pro-democracy activists were arrested So what has
really happened and why? Why is China afraid of freedom of the
press and freedom of speech?
</P>
<P>
A: Nothing has happened. In fact the human rights situation in
China has improved continuously. And none of us is afraid of the
freedom of the press or freedom of speech. In those aspects, we
face different situations, have different ideas and understandings,
which cannot be fully explained in a few words. Otherwise, there
is no need to have the channel of human rights talks between China
and Canada. Well, I am afraid that you would not be able to get
ready tonight for your news release tomorrow, if we go on like
this.
</P>
<P>
Q: With due respect, let me ask another question, a private one.
It seems that you have had a very hard childhood, because your
father and mother died very early. So what has been your most
important childhood memory? And has this memory later on played a
role in your own family life?
</P>
<P>
A: My father died before I was born. And my mother died when I
was 12. I relied on my own efforts to get education, and this
perhaps has nourished part of my personality. That is to say, I do
not think that there are insurmountable difficulties. Please
convey, through your newspaper, my sincere greetings to the people
and government leaders of Canada. I hope that my visit to Canada
will be successful, so as to give some impetus to the further
development of the friendly relations and cooperation between
China and Canada. We attach great importance to China-Canada
relations and our friendship with the Canadian people.

LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The British government on Tuesday
denounced as worthless the declaration of a truce by Yugoslav and
Serb officials.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street said it wanted to see a complete withdrawal of
Serb forces from Kosovo and Belgrade's agreement on an
international force.
</P>
<P>
This would oversee the return to their homes of the Kosovo
Albanians and other refugees displaced by the fightings.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said earlier that
Britain would "not fall for" a ceasefire offer made by Yugoslavia
unless all of NATO's demands were met.
</P>
<P>
"We won't fall for it. Our conditions are for suspending the
air campaign. Until those conditions are met, it will continue," a
Reuters report quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Britain has called for a complete withdrawal of Serb forces
from Kosovo and Belgrade's agreement to an international force
that would supervise the return of all refugees to their homes in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic confirmed on
Tuesday that Belgrade had called an imminent unilateral ceasefire
and he invited refugees from Kosovo to return home immediately.
</P>
<P>
Draskovic said in an interview with British Sky News from
Belgrade that all Serbian troops in Kosovo would return to their
barracks before the ceasefire came into force at 8 p.m. (1800
GMT).

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Tuesday voiced its support for the establishment of a
Post-conflict Peace Building Support Office in Guinea-Bissau
(UNOGBIS).
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council reviewed the report by
the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the latest situation in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution unanimously adopted, the Council said
UNOGBIS, which would be led by a representative of the
Secretary-General, aimed to provide the political framework and
leadership for harmonizing and integrating the activities of the
United Nations system in Guinea-Bissau during the transitional
period leading up to general election and to facilitate the
implementation of the Abuja Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Council reiterated that the primary responsibility for
achieving lasting peace in the country rested with the parties
concerned and strongly called upon them to implement fully all the
provisions of the Abuja Agreement and subsequent undertakings.
</P>
<P>
The Council urged the parties concerned promptly to agree on a
date for the holding of elections as soon as possible which were
all-inclusive, free and fair, and invite the United Nations and
others to consider providing any needed electoral assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Council demanded that all concerned respect strictly the
relevant provisions of international law, including international
humanitarian law and human rights law, to ensure safe and
unimpeded access by humanitarian organizations to those in need
and to ensure the protection and freedom of movement of United
Nations and international humanitarian personnel.
</P>
<P>
The Council requested the U.N. chief to keep it regularly
informed and to submit a report to it by June 30, 1999 and every
90 days thereafter on development in the country, the activities
of UNOGBIS and the implementation of the Abuja Agreement.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Signed 117 Deals on Oil Spare Parts: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has signed 117 contracts
valued at 120 million U.S. dollars in the current fifth phase of
the oil-for-food program to purchase oil spare parts, an Iraqi Oil
Ministry official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Planning and Studies Department at the
Oil Ministry Falih Hassan Marhoon told the Iraqi News Agency that
39 contracts worth 24 million dollars had been submitted to the
U.N. Sanctions Committee for ratification.
</P>
<P>
Only after the ratification by the U.N. Sanctions Committee can
the contracts be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Marhoon said more contracts will be signed in the current phase
with the allocated amount, which runs from last November to June.
</P>
<P>
The U.N., which slapped sanctions on Iraq following its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, in an oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to
export limited amount of oil every six months since November 1996
to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been allowed in the fourth and fifth phases to import
300 million dollars worth of oil spare parts to increase its oil
production and export capacity.
</P>
<P>
Marhoon said that most of the contracts signed in the current
phase had been concluded in the last six-month period, which
mainly include chemical, service and operational items badly
needed in Iraq's dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
But only 25 of the 750 contracts concluded in the fourth phase
have been implemented and spare parts worth no more than 15
million dollars have arrived in Iraq so far, said Marhoon.
</P>
<P>
Marhoon held the U.S. and Britain responsible for the delay of
ratifying the contracts Iraq concluded with world companies.

LUANDA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A strange disease had killed four
children in Angolan capital Luanda in four days up to last Friday,
according to a report released by the Angolan National Bureau of
Public Health.
</P>
<P>
The report available here Tuesday said that 102 cases were
reported in the capital and the the excrement samples of the sick
children have been sent to South Africa for stool examination so
as to find out the cause of the strange disease and its cure.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that children under the age of six years are
easy to be affected by the disease which causes muscle paralysis.
</P>
<P>
The four kids died from chest muscle paralysis, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan health authorities for the time being called such
disease "acute flaccid paralysis" and suspected that it was caused
by contaminated food and water.
</P>
<P>
Since late March, the hospitals in Luanda has received a lot of
sick children from the areas surrounding the capital city. The
kids seemed to have caught influenza. But several days after the
fever was gone, they could no longer stand or walk.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan health authorities have specially established a
medical committee to study the disease and its cure and asked all
the hospitals across the country to keep close watch at the
disease.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Hegemonism Under Pretext of Humanitarianism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The escalating military attacks
waged by the U.S.-led NATO against Yugoslavia have proven to be
nothing but hegemonism practiced under the pretext of
humanitarianism.
</P>
<P>
The targets of airstrikes have been expanded to factories,
schools, roads, airports and other civilian facilities over recent
days.
</P>
<P>
The air raids inflicted a disastrous loss of life and property
on the Yugoslav people, arousing strong indignation and
condemnation of all peace-loving people who uphold justice,
including those of NATO members.
</P>
<P>
However, NATO has repeatedly argued that the airstrikes aimed "
to prevent a humanitarian disaster" and "safeguard human rights."
</P>
<P>
Is NATO really "preventing a humanitarian disaster" or creating
a humanitarian disaster? Is it "safeguarding human rights" or
violating human rights? Facts speak louder:
</P>
<P>
According to statistics made by Yugoslavia, NATO flew more than
430 sorties, launched about 400 cruise missiles and employed
various advanced weapons including stealth bombers in the first
week alone since the air raids started. The power of the bombs
dropped on the land of Yugoslavia is double that of the atomic
bombs dropped by the United States in Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
A prominent American scholar wrote in USA Today on March 26
that the attacks against Yugoslavia are a brazen aggression,
because American troops are attacking a country that has not
attacked the U.S., nor the U.S. allies nor its neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
In an article in Romania's Adevarul on April 1, the author
wrote that the airstrikes against Yugoslavia by the U.S.-led NATO
are not for "human rights" and "peace" which they have flaunted so
much. Actually, the sole purpose of the strikes is nothing but to
unleash a war.
</P>
<P>
Since the death of countless civilians in Europe means nothing
serious to the U.S., NATO's pretexts for the attacks against
Yugoslavia are ridiculous and unreasonable, the author wrote.
</P>
<P>
After bombing military targets in Yugoslavia, NATO has switched
its targets to civilian facilities. Up to now, NATO has bombed
important bridges, railway lines, factories, schools and
government buildings in Yugoslavia. Even hospitals and heating
systems in Belgrade and scenic spots in Kosovo were not spared by
NATO air forces.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of houses were burnt and thousands of civilians
killed. Millions of people have to stay in air-raid shelters
without access to water, electricity and food.
</P>
<P>
NATO's airstrikes have inflicted an immediate loss of billions
of U.S. dollars to Yugoslavia. And indirect impacts, such
potential damage to ecological environment and the trauma of war,
are beyond calculation.
</P>
<P>
NATO claimed that its airstrikes on Yugoslavia aimed to prevent
an escalation of bloodshed and a mass exodus of refugees in Kosovo
and further to avert a "humanitarian disaster" in the heart of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, it was during NATO's bombardments that Serbian and
ethnic Albanian refugees in Kosovo were forced to leave their
homeland and pour into neighboring countries to flee the flames of
war.
</P>
<P>
The refugee wave is bringing pressure upon some countries such
as Albania and Macedonia, and is posing a serious threat to
security and stability of the whole Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it is NATO itself that created the "humanitarian
disaster" in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Even ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who has called for
NATO intervention in Kosovo, is now demanding NATO halt its
bombing of Yugoslavia, urging the Western military alliance to "
stop killings."
</P>
<P>
This indeed constitutes a great irony for NATO countries which
have all along been trumpeting about human rights.
</P>
<P>
Disguising themselves as the "champion of human rights," the
United States and other Western countries frequently attacked
other countries for alleged "human rights problems" or "inhumane
practices." However, the NATO military operations have threatened
the lives of 12 million Yugoslav people at the moment. Can this
be called a "humanitarian act"? Is this an act of defending human
rights?
</P>
<P>
According to German news reports, some veteran politicians from
Germany's former Green Party denounced the airstrikes of the U.S.-
led NATO as a "violation of human rights."
</P>
<P>
The media in some developing countries pointed out that it is
the U.S.-led NATO that is the number one violator of human rights
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Problems like the Kosovo crisis, which are part of internal
affairs of countries, also exist in some member countries of NATO.
But why does NATO turn a complete blind eye and deaf ear to those
facts and use its force to bully a small country like Yugoslavia?
The reason is that the U.S. and other Western countries have
always pursued double standards on human rights issues. Because
the Kosovo issue concerns U.S. strategic interests in Europe, the
U.S.-led NATO unleashed massive strikes against Yugoslavia under
the pretext of "human rights violations."
</P>
<P>
An article carried by the Finish "Capital Daily" on March 31
said the conflicts in Kosovo could not become an excuse for the U.
S. to bomb Yugoslavia. The move by the U.S. and its NATO allies
to circumvent the United Nations to launch attacks on a sovereign
country can only be viewed as an act of hegemonism. They have set
an abominable precedent in the history of international relations
to defy the U.N. Charter and universally accepted norms of
international law and bypass the U.N. Security Council to openly
use force and flagrantly interfere in the internal affairs of a
sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
At the turning of the century, peace and development are the
common aspirations of all peoples in the world. Power politics
and hegemonism have lost their markets. The U.S.-led NATO should
immediately stop its airstrikes against Yugoslavia and bring the
Kosovo issue back to the track of political resolution.

<HEADLINE> 42 Zimbabweans Killed During Easter Road Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 42 Zimbabweans were
killed and 381 others injured in road accidents during the Easter
holidays, police said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police Deputy Commissioner George Kundeya told a press
conference that the worst accident during the Easter holidays from
last Friday to Monday, occurred in Nyazura of east Zimbabwe where
a bus overturned, killing 11 people.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 31 people were killed while 352 others were injured
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Kundeya said most of the accidents were caused by drunken
driving, vehicle defects and speeding.
</P>
<P>
The police officer said that three people were arrested for
drunken driving Monday alone while 21 vehicles were impounded and
1,825 tickets were issued for traffic offenses.
</P>
<P>
"These figures are not acceptable and more stern measures will
continue to be implemented to reduce the carnage on our roads," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Police will continue to mount 24-hour road checks," he said,
adding that the accidents had shown motorists did not take heed of
police warnings which compelled every driver to exercise
responsibility on the road.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Ministerial Meeting of G8 on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia has called for an urgent
meeting of the foreign ministers of the so-called Group of Eight
to discuss the Yugoslavia crisis, said Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The complicated situation in Yugoslavia allows no time for low-
level meetings. There are more bombings, more tragedies and more
deaths in Yugoslavia every day, said Ivanov after a cabinet
meeting on the Yugoslavia issue.
</P>
<P>
G8 groups Russia, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United
States, Canada and Japan. The countries except Canada and Japan
comprise the Contact Group on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that Russia would come up with fresh peace
proposals.
</P>
<P>
The minister criticized Western media for defending NATO for
creating a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The exodus of more than 100,000 refugees from Kosovo occurred
after NATO launched air strikes on Yugoslavia on March 24, he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if it's possible for Russia to get into a military
confrontation with the West, particularly NATO, Ivanov stressed
that it's up to President Boris Yeltsin to decide a political or
military position.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has said that Russia would not get militarily involved
in the Yugoslavia crisis.

<HEADLINE> White Collar Crime in Germany Surging During 1990s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 6 (Xinhua)--The number of white collar crimes in
German companies has been rising steeply during the 1990s, a
financial publication reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than half of all German firms are now affected by white
collar misdeeds such as embezzlement, fraud and misappropriation,
the magazine "Die Bank" published by the Cologne-based Federation
of German Banks said.
</P>
<P>
In 1991 there were 435,000 cases of white collar crime
registered by the police, with a total damage of about 4 billion
marks (2.2 billion U.S. dollars). The numbers had reached 780,000
and 12.6 billion respectively in year 1997.
</P>
<P>
The white collar crimes probably increased further in the last
year, the magazine indicated.
</P>
<P>
The magazine quoted a study of Germany's 1,000 largest firms in
year 1997 by an auditing company that 61 per cent of them reported
being victims of white collar crimes during the proceeding 5
years.
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds of the companies said that internal
misdeeds had aroused serious problems, while 84 per cent planned
to strengthen internal controls.
</P>
<P>
The data showed that 45 per cent of the crimes were committed
by company employees, 38 per cent were by persons outside a
company, the remaining were by a combination of the two groups.
</P>
<P>
Many companies believed there were two factors behind the rise
of white collar crimes. One is the increasing complexity of
business transaction procedure, and another is more complicated
corporate structure, which is often the result of mergers or
takeovers.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Secondary Schools To Teach Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Education, Sport and
Culture Minister Gabriel Machinga said Tuesday that about 18
secondary schools in the country will teach human rights in the
next semester.
</P>
<P>
The schools would teach the subject on a pilot project before
it is implemented in all schools by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
"We have two options, either to teach the subject separately or
 integrate it in related subjects like history," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks when opening a four-day
Sub-Regional Trainers' Workshop on Human Rights and Democracy
Education which started in Harare Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is being attended by education officers and heads
of curriculum development units from Namibia, Mozambique and
Zimbabwe and representatives of some non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Regional Advisor of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Melania Rukanda
said that the workshop would come up with plans for the training
of teachers in pilot projects in the participating countries.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that if young people are taught to respect others
and themselves, we will have peace in our region which is
essential for development," said Rukanda.
</P>
<P>
"Elements of human rights are there in the curricula of most
southern African countries but there is no deliberate policy to
teach human rights as a subject," he said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop follows two others which were held in Namibia last
November and in Mozambique in March this year.

<HEADLINE> Two Ministers of India's Ruling BJP Ally Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Two ministers of the All-India
Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), a major ally of the
ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), submitted their resignations
to Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Thambi Durai, minister of law and surface transport, and M. R.
Janarthanan, minister of state for finance, ruled out any
rapprochement between the AIADMK and the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Their resignation followed an AIADMK ultimatum to the
government Sunday demanding removal of Defense Minister George
Fernandes and reinstatement of Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat as Navy
chief who was dismissed earlier.
</P>
<P>
BJP refused its demand, saying that it was ready to face AIADMK
withdrawal threat and confident to win a majority in the
parliament which will resume its session Thursday next week.
</P>
<P>
AIADMK holds 18 seats in the parliament and a withdrawal of
support to the BJP would put the coalition government to a serious
test of winning a majority in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Kasoulides: Cyprus Concerned Over Developments in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Cyprus Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides on Tuesday expressed Nicosia's concern over
developments in Kosovo, stressing that military operations did not
help resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with his Greek counterpart George
Papandreou, Kasoulides said that the Cypriot people were concerned
about Kosovo since they were witnesses to developments and
conflicts which bring destabilization and of course human
suffering.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus attached great importance to the territorial integrity
of states, international law and the role of the United Nations
Security Council, he said, adding that military operations by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) did not help settle the
Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the possibility of developments in Kosovo
having adverse repercussions for the Cyprus problem, the minister
said that Cyprus was indeed concerned.
</P>
<P>
Part of this concern had to do with the role of the United
Nations Security Council and the inviolability of borders, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides did not rule out an awaited U.S. initiative on the
Cyprus problem being put off if the Kosovo crisis continued with
the same intensity.
</P>
<P>
He said that international moves were expected on the Cyprus
problem following national elections in Turkey, and within this
framework, he would request a meeting in the summer, under U.N.
auspices, between Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides, who arrived here Tuesday, talked with Papandreou on
issues of Kosovo, developments in the Balkans, the Cyprus problem
and Nicosia's entry into the European Union (EU).

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reiterates Terms Ending NATO Airstrike on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Tuesday that NATO's airstrikes will end if Belgrade withdraws
its forces from Kosovo, accepts terms of a peace accord and allows
refugees to return.
</P>
<P>
The terms were laid out by Clinton when making the remarks
during a ceremony in the White House.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic
announced Belgrade had called an imminent unilateral ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The United States insists Belgrade meet all of demands by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), including withdrawal of
Serb forces from Kosovo and allowing ethnic Albanian refugees to
return.
</P>
<P>
"The United States would never choose force as anything other
than a last option," Clinton said when speaking of the crisis in
Kosovo briefly.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. (Slobodan) Milosevic could end it now by withdrawing his
military.... and paramilitary forces,... by accepting the
deployment of an international security force to protect not only
the Kosovar Albanians... but also the Serbian minority... and by
making it possible for all the refugees to return," Clinton added.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Genocide Suspect Still Held in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania said Tuesday that
Bernard Ntuyahaga, a Rwandan army officer accused of murdering 10
Belgian peace-keepers during the 1994 Rwanda genocide, is still in
detention waiting for legal judgement.
</P>
<P>
"Ntuyahaga is still in the hands of (the Tanzanian)
government," one official with the Ministry of Justice and
Constitutional Affairs, told reporters at his office in Dar es
Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The official, who declined to be named, said that the
government is following procedures to hand over Ntuyahaga's case
to the Resident Magistrate's Court since the man is an illegal
citizen in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The officer refused to say which country Tanzania prefers to
expel Ntuyahaga to, noting that the government will follow the
court ruling. He did not reveal when the case will be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Both Rwanda and Belgium have demanded that the suspect be
extradited to them after the United Nations court in the northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha, the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda (ICTR), dropped all charges against him and released him in
Dar es Salaam last month.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga was previously accused of ordering the murder of
Rwanda's former prime minister and the 10 Belgian soldiers
deployed to protect her at the start of 1994 genocide in which
more than 500,000 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga, 47, entered Tanzania and surrendered himself to the
ICTR in July of 1998. The tribunal was established by the U.N.
Security Council in November of 1994 to bring the architects of
the Rwanda genocide to justice.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs,
Bakari Mwapachu, said last week that Tanzania might charge
Ntuyahaga with violating its immigration laws but had not decided
whether to extradite him or not.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Rampant in Southern, Central Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Rampant cholera has killed
hundreds of people in southern and central regions of Somalia
recently, local officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The district commissioner of Qoryoley town, Ali Hussein Aliyow
Ibrow said that more than 110 people have died of cholera in the
past few days alone in the town and its surrounding villages, some
70 kilometers south of capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The other neighboring regions of Middle Jubba and Bay are not
any better.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the town of Jilib indicate that 30 people have
died from the disease in the past two weeks while over 200 others
are now in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Abdurahman Hajji Ahmed Waldirch, one traditional leader of the
town told reporters in Mogadishu Tuesday morning that the victims
are mainly the elderly people and children.
</P>
<P>
Likewise , the disease is affecting people in the central
region of Galgudud, hitting the districts of Adado and Galhareri.
</P>
<P>
Two people were reported to have died in Adado town and more
than 30 others are now in critical condition, while in Galhareri
district, three people have been killed and more than 40 others
are still in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The health authorities said the disease spread so fast that it
 immediately got out of control since it broke out in late March.
</P>
<P>
The absence of chlorine for purifying drinking water and the
anti-dehydration solution and poor sanitation were attributed to
the fast spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The disease which is said to break out at the end of every year
has early this year claimed the lives of more than 300 people in
Gedo and Bay regions where a high influx of war- and
drought-displaced people had gathered.

<HEADLINE> Food Prices Hike up in Lusaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Food prices increased by about 30
percent in the Zambian capital of Lusaka between January 1998 and
January 1999, according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
The monthly survey by the Economic and Social Development
Research project of the Jesuit Centre for Theological Reflection
shows that the monthly food basket for a family of six has
steadily been rising from 186, 950 kwacha (about 70 U.S. dollars)
in January of 1998 to 240,920 kwacha (about 100 dollars) in
January this year.
</P>
<P>
Alex Muyebe of the center said in a statement released here
Tuesday that the monthly cost of food for the family of six
reached 252,000 Kwacha last month.
</P>
<P>
The cost does not includes other payment for essential
commodities such as water, electricity, housing, education and
health, says the survey.
</P>
<P>
Muyebe said the center supports President Frederick Chiluba's
assurance that civil servants will not be getting less than
200,000 kwacha beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
He said the salaries of the civil servants should be increased
to 250, 000 kwacha to match with the hiking food prices.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the base rate for beginning pay (pay as
you earn) should be over 250,000 kwacha in order to ease the tax
burden on the poor.
</P>
<P>
Last month Chiluba promised to narrow wage gap between those
ordinary civil servants and those in management.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said next year the government will look at how it can
motivate those in income who are paid peanuts.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia a hospital nurse's monthly salary stands at about
100,000 kwacha.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Three former Rwandan

were arrested Tuesday in Cameroon, a United Nations court
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Jerome Blcamumpaka, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prosper
 Mugiraneza, former Minister Responsible for Civil Service and
Justin Mugenzi, former Minister of Commerce, were arrested in and

</P>
<P>
"The (ICTR) prosecutor, Justice Louise Arbour, expressed her
gratitude to the government of Cameroon for its assistance and
cooperation in this matter,!1 the statement added.
</P>
<P>
"These arrests bring to 38 the number of persons detained under
the authority of the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Established on November 8, 1994 by the U.N. Security Council,
the ICTR has the mandate to try persons suspected to be

<HEADLINE> China, Turkey to Further Develop Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China and Turkey on Tuesday agreed
to further develop bilateral ties in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during talks between Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel and visiting Chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress of China Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that Turkey attaches great importance to
developing friendly ties with China, which is playing an important
role in the world.
</P>
<P>
Terming the development of bilateral ties as smooth, the
Turkish president said there had been no obstacles or problems
whatsoever between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the principle of non-interference in other countries'
internal affairs, the Turkish government is opposed to any
anti-China separatist activities and other terrorist activities
targeting China, Demirel said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was fully aware that this was a sensitive issue to the
feelings of the Chinese people and promised to handle the issue
properly, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Demirel also pointed out that what a small number of
anti-China separatists did never represented the policies of the
Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
Turkey highly appreciates the correct policies of the Chinese
government on minority ethnic groups, particularly those on
helping the Xinjiang Uigur Autonomous Region develop its economy
and raise the living standards of the people there, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the two countries will further promote
cooperation in such areas as trade and economy, culture and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Demirel's evaluation on bilateral ties, the top Chinese
legislator said there was no fundamental conflict of interests
between China and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"What we have are merely friendship, understanding and
cooperation," Li said, adding that China highly appreciates the
correct stance of the Turkish government on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
"President Demirel once again made it clear that the Turkish
government is opposed to all forms of anti-China separatist
activities and violent terrorist activities in Turkey," Li said,
this "fully demonstrated the wise policy of the Turkish
leadership."
</P>
<P>
China believes that the mutual understanding and trust on
matters of major principle importance forms the basis on which
China and Turkey can develop their all-around cooperative
relations.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived in Turkey Friday on a five-day official visit as
part of a six-nation Euro-Asian tour. Li had visited Greece and
will continue the trip to Syria, Pakistan, Bangladesh and
Thailand.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Hails Sudanese Government Ceasefire Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N.
Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Sergio Vieira de
Mello, Tuesday welcomed Monday's announcement by Sudanese
President Omar Hassan Al-Bashir on his government decision to
declare a comprehensive ceasefire in all the states of southern
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"As the Secretary-General Special Envoy for Humanitarian
Assistance for the Sudan, Ambassador Tom Vraalsen is about to
undertake a mission to the region. I hope that the (rebel)
Sudanese People's Liberation Movement will use this opportunity to
reach a comprehensive ceasefire throughout southern Sudan," de
Mello said.
</P>
<P>
A cessation of hostilities would allow the U.N.-led Operation
Lifeline Sudan (OLS) to maximize its efforts to address the
humanitarian needs of civilians affected by the ongoing civil war,
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"I call on the international community to contribute generously
to the 1999 U.N. Inter-Agency Consolidated Appeal to Sudan through
which relief organizations aim at assisting some 2.3 million," de
Mello said.
</P>
<P>
The government-sanctioned comprehensive ceasefire will be
effective on April 15, when the partial ceasefire expires.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army have agreed to three-month ceasefire in Bahr el-Ghazal since
October last year. International aid agencies and foreign
governments have called upon both warring sides to stop fighting to
allow food and medicine to the famine-struck province.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.9 million people have died in fighting and famine
since 1983, when the predominantly African southerners, of
Christian and animist faiths, began to fight for autonomy from the
Muslim North.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday continued the discussion on whether or not to have a draft
resolution or some other form of response to reflect the latest
developments concerning Libya.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press conference that the
latest developments include the Libyan handover of two Lockerbie
suspects for a trial before a Scottish court in the Netherlands, a
U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Such developments also include the suspension of the sanctions
against Libya, he said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the committee which monitors the sanctions
against Libya is expected to issue a note verbale to States and
organizations restating that the sanctions have been suspended,
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The president of the U.N. Security Council, Alain Dejammet of
France, Monday announced the suspension of the sanctions imposed
on Libya after the two suspects accused of the December 1988
bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, had arrived
in the Netherlands for a trial before the Scottish court.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the reports, Dejammet said that the
conditions set forth in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1192 for
"the immediate suspension" of sanctions "have been fulfilled."
</P>
<P>
"These measures (sanctions) have been therefore effectively
suspended," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council stated its readiness to suspend these
measures with a view to lifting them" in accordance with relevant
U.N. resolutions, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council express their deep satisfaction at
this development," the statement said. "They are grateful to the
Secretary-General as well as all the Governments that have
contributed to it."
</P>
<P>
With the letter from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to the
Council president reporting the arrival of the two suspects in the
Netherlands, the Security Council can automatically suspend the
sanctions imposed on Libya in 1992 and tightened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
After 90 days, the Security Council can vote to lift the
sanctions, which include bans on air travel, weapons sales and
types of oil equipment.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of the Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie killed a
total of 270 people.
</P>
<P>
London and Washington last August dropped their insistence that
the two suspects stand trial in either of the country, and Libya
accepted the offer to have the two tried before a Scottish court
in the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Retrieve Antiques Smuggled to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will retrieve within a few
days 27 ancient Egyptian artifacts smuggled to Jordan, an official
in charge of Egypt's antiquities said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The artifacts were seized last November at Jordan's Aqaba
seaport when smugglers were trying to take them into the kingdom
inside a lorry, Gaballah Ali Gaballah, Secretary General of
Egypt's Supreme Antiquities Council was quoted by Egypt's Middle
East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The precious items date back to the Ptolemaic times from about
367 to 246 BC, said the official without giving further details.
</P>
<P>
He said that to retrieve valuable antiques is part of the plan
of the Culture Ministry to restore Egypt's arts treasures stolen
and smuggled to foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
He cited the return in March of a number of rare artifacts
which had been smuggled to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Contacts between Egyptian and Jordanian officials are under way
on returning the smuggled items, Ali Gaballah said, adding that
the Jordanian side has pledged to send them back intact and punish
the culprits.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Develop Faster, Heat-Tolerant Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Professor James Kolodzey and
his colleagues at the University of Delaware in Newark, Delaware,
say they have successfully developed new semiconductor chips,
faster and more heat-tolerant than current silicon chips.
</P>
<P>
The new chips using an alloy of materials might replace silicon
in cellular phones and other electronic devices, the Wall Street
Journal reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Kolodzey and his team found that a silicon carbide
alloy, consisting of silicon, carbon and germanium materials
similar to those in sand paper, could transmit electrical signals
at higher speeds than silicon and also withstand high
temperatures. The current computer chips cannot withstand high
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
The new chips based on the materials could be used in
high-temperature applications such as jet engines and car engines
as well as in ordinary cellular phones, said the professor.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Economic Indicators Rise Again in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Conference Board said
Tuesday that the Index of Leading Economic Indicators climbed 0.2
percent, for a fifth straight month, in February.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the Index, a key economic barometer, signals that
the U.S. economy will continue to thrive in coming months.
</P>
<P>
Four of the 10 indicators that make up the index were positive,
including higher consumer expectations and lower first-time claims
for unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Economists said this is good news for investors and good for
the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Index is designed to forecast economic activity six to nine
months in advance.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a private research group, also reported
that the coincident indicators, which measure current activity,
rose 0.3 percent and the lagging index, which measures the
economy's past performance, climbed 0.2 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
It said that the three index components show a healthy economy
and an economic expansion that will continue through at least late
1999.
</P>
<P>
The leading indicators are calculated from a base of 100, set
in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Send Relief to Kosovars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has decided to send relief to
Kosovo ethnic Albanian refugees, sources of the Egyptian Red
Crescent Society said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the humanitarian aid will be flown Wednesday
to the refugees, who have been pouring into neighboring Albania
and Macedonia since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
began its air-strikes against Serb targets on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the relief goods include 5.4 tonnes of
medicines, 1,500 boxes of milk powder, 500 boxes of canned
foodstuffs and 1,000 blankets, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Serb-led Yugoslav government and the ethnic
Albanians in the province of Kosovo intensified early last year
after the Albanians sought independence from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
NATO began bombing Serb targets after Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic refused to sign a peace agreement, which
requires Belgrade to grant autonomy to the ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo and allow NATO to deploy peace-keeping forces in the
province.

<HEADLINE> Italy Sticks to NATO's Hard Line on Yugoslavia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian government stuck firmly to
NATO's hard line on Yugoslavia's Easter truce in the southern
province of Kosovo, saying Tuesday evening that the move fell far
short of what was needed to call off bombings.
</P>
<P>
NATO said Tuesday evening that the unilateral truce declared by
Yugoslavia at 8:00 pm of April 6 was not enough to halt air
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said at the same time
that "I shall hold the view of our allies, and Belgrade's
temporary truce appears insufficient to start a peaceful
resolution of the conflict."
</P>
<P>
He called on Belgrade to go further, following its first step
with "weightier and more significant commitments including
acceptance of an international presence in Kosovo to protect
returning refugees."
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said NATO needed to see these things happening before
it could launch a peace initiative, adding that the announcement
of a truce is step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Party of Italian Communists and the
Greens both said the truce was a chink of light offering a chance
for diplomacy to come to the fore. Both parties urged D'Alema to
make sure the chance was not wasted.
</P>
<P>
"Once again the U.S. is trying to impose its line," said the
Italian Communists' leader Armando Cossutta, "this is a positive
signal that mustn't be thrown away."
</P>
<P>
The Italian government's tough stance was mirrored in other
European capitals, with similar statements coming from France,
Germany, and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Beefs up Efforts Against Corruption by Feng Jian, Wang Shangzhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni,
in a surprise move late Monday night, axed several ministers in
the latest major cabinet reshuffle, marking the government's
intensifying efforts against rampant corruption among senior
government officials.
</P>
<P>
The last-minute decision to drop the long-serving ministers was
made in response to mounting pressure from the parliament and an
indignant outcry from the general public for the government to
stem corruption among the ruling elite.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Specioza Kazibwe, who was dropped from the
agricultural portfolio, was the most eye-catching because she has
been accused by a parliamentary select committee of failing to
supervise the famous valley dam project which caused the
government to lose 3.4 billion shillings (3.4 million U.S.
dollars) and is likely to face censure from parliament this week.
</P>
<P>
Sam Kutesa, former state minister in charge of planning and
investment, was kicked out this time because he was recently
censured by the parliament on charges of influence peddling and
abuse of office in the country's privatization process.
</P>
<P>
It had been widely believed that President Museveni will
stretch@out a helping hand to this struggling minister because
their wives are sisters. But this intimacy with the First Family
did not save the sinking minister.
</P>
<P>
Tom Butime, former minister of internal affairs, was moved to
chair the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness and Refugees.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here observed that his transfer implies Museveni's
dissatisfaction with the security situation in the country and
anger at the revealed corruption among top police bosses.
</P>
<P>
The Bwindi massacre, in which eight foreign tourists were
killed in a national park in western Uganda in early March,
triggered widening local and international concerns about security
in this land-locked country where tourism industry is still young.
</P>
<P>
This incident caused many foreign tourists to cancel their
plans to Uganda. A big U.S. business delegation rescinded their
decision to participate in an international trade fair here due to
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, former Inspector General of Police John Odomel was
forced to resign following an investigation report which
discovered that his own companies were doing business with the
police through illegal means.
</P>
<P>
More recently, Chris Bakiiza, director of Criminal
Investigation Department, is being probed for bribery, corruption
and negligence of duty and is very likely to be removed.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the government is unflinching efforts against
corruption.
</P>
<P>
But this reshuffle is not the end of the fight. The parliament
is still working to curb corruption among ministers and other
senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Considering this cabinet reshuffle not enough to check
corruption in the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and
Fisheries, the parliament was still debating the report by the
select committee Tuesday afternoon and considering what to do
next.
</P>
<P>
Many members of parliament hold that two of the state ministers
who were mentioned in the report and should be dropped are still
ministers: one is still in the ministry while the other
transferred to another portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they think this reshuffle is by no means fatal to
corruption in the ministry. So they decided to continue debating
the report and to censure the ministers if evidence suffices.
</P>
<P>
Whether the parliament will censure the two ministers or not,
one thing is for sure. That is, they will continue on the crusade
against corruption.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says It Will House Kosovo Refugees at Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced on
Tuesday that it will temporarily house 20,000 Kosovo refugees away
from the U.S. mainland at its naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
It would take several days before the refugees will begin being
transported from the Balkans to the site in Cuba, said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the base was chosen because of its ability to
house a large number of people quickly.
</P>
<P>
"This action is intended... in combination with our NATO
allies, to assist front-line states such as Macedonia in dealing
with the tremendous burden they have incurred in recent days with
the flow of refugees out of Kosovo," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"This facility will be temporary, as we fully intend the
Kosovars will ultimately return to their homes and the operation
will only transport people voluntarily," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kosovo refugees who are already in the United States
but lacking valid immigration status will be allowed to remain
under a temporary protected status, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department would extend the cutoff date for
eligibility to cover Kosovo refugees in the United States as of
this month, as opposed to the current cutoff of June 1998, he
added.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Botswana has granted asylum
to a further 1,116 Namibian secessionists, who fled to Botswana
between October and December last year, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced in a statement on Tuesday by the
president's office, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen leaders of the group were granted asylum in February
and political observers predict that the remaining 1,000 are in
line for similar treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government has claimed the refugees were part of a
group seeking the secession of the Caprivi Strip.
</P>
<P>
The decision to grant asylum was made during a meeting between
the ministers of home affairs of Botswana and Namibia and a U.N.
representative.
</P>
<P>
Botswana still believes that voluntary repatriation is the best
solution, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Botswana is continuing its relentless
efforts to convince the Namibians remaining in Botswana that
voluntary repatriation remains the most durable solution."

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia's Peace Proposal Rejected by NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) Tuesday formally refused to accept
Yugoslavia's peace proposal as the NATO chief said the cease-fire
offer "is clearly insufficient."
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said in a statement that
the unilateral cease-fire proposed by the Yugoslav and Serbian
governments did not meet NATO's demand. "Before a cease-fire can
be considered, President Milosevic must meet the demands
established by the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO head said the current military action against
Yugoslavia is in support of the political aims of the
international community: a peaceful multi-ethnic democratic Kosovo
in which all its people live in security.
</P>
<P>
"These aims can be achieved by the return of all refugees and
therefore the deployment of an international security presence,
the withdrawal of Serb military, police and paramilitary forces,
and putting into place of a political framework for Kosovo on the
basis of the Rambouillet Accords," Solana said in conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Yugoslav government declared a unilateral
cease-fire in Kosovo starting at 8 p.m. local time in observance
of the Orthodox Easter holiday. Yugoslavia's offers include a
unilateral cease-fire, early peace talks and arrangement of
refugees' return. However, the United States, leader of NATO,
immediately rejected the proposal and vowed to continue attacks
against Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok Bank Plc, Thailand's
biggest commercial bank, has boosted its capital adequacy ratio
above the central bank's requirement by raising 46 billion baht
(1.2 billion U.S. dollars) from the market.
</P>
<P>
Bank President Chartsiri Sophonpanitch said Wednesday that the
bank's tier-1 capital adequacy ratio was raised to 13.7 percent,
more than three times above the central bank's minimum
requirement.
</P>
<P>
He said the money was raised through the issue of Capital
Augmented Preference Securities (CAPS).
</P>
<P>
The CAPS subscriptions included 6 percent from foreign
investors and 70 percent from individuals, with the balance being
held by provident funds and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
The news pushed up shares of Bangkok Bank by 2.8 percent to
55.5 baht (1.5 dollars) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Money raised through the issue would cover non-performing loans
(NPLs) and meet the government's tough new provisioning rules.
Thai banking and finance sectors have NPLs estimated at 2.73
trillion baht (73 billion dollars), more than 45 percent of total
loans.
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely pleased with the positive response to the
issue... which demonstrates the broad level of confidence Thai
investors continue to have in the bank," Chartsiri said.
</P>
<P>
"Many investors recognize the financial stability and long-term
prospects of Bangkok Bank and view CAPS as a chance to be part of
our expanding business as we work through the recession and
towards a brighter future," he said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Holds Consultations on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council is scheduled to hold consultations Wednesday morning in a
bid to forge its new policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, sharply divided after the U.S.-led air
strikes against Iraq last December, will first be briefed by Celso
Amorim, the chairman of the three panels on Iraq established
according to a January 30 note by the Council.
</P>
<P>
The three panels have presented their reports on the
assessments on Iraq's disarmament, humanitarian situation and
returning of Kuwait's property to the Security Council, which will
be the basis for the Council to form its new policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The first panel, on disarmament and current and future ongoing
monitoring and verification issues, recommended that intrusive
inspections under a monitoring program be needed to resume in
Iraq. It also called for a renovated or restructured U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM), now responsible for dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The second panel, on humanitarian situation, recommended
improvement and some alterations to the U.N. humanitarian
program, which allows Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil to
provide humanitarian aid for its people. It also suggested the
Council consider authorizing foreign investment to improve Iraq's
export abilities.
</P>
<P>
The third panel, on prisoners of war and Kuwaiti property,
concluded that Iraq had not provided sufficient explanations about
missing Kuwaitis or cooperated enough in returning looted
property.
</P>
<P>
It is widely seen here that Iraq will most likely reject any
proposals for renewed U.N. relations that does not include lifting
of the sanctions, which has been in the place since its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.

HONG KONG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Customs officers
seized about 17 million sticks of counterfeit cigarettes worth 9.3
million HK dollars (1.2 million U.S. dollars) last Thursday, a
spokesman for the Customs and Excise Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Acting on information, officers of the Intellectual Property
Investigation Bureau took prompt action and intercepted at a Kwai
Chung container terminal two containers shipped from Manila, the
Philippines, via Singapore, and made the seizure.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent investigations led to the arrest of two men and a
Singaporean woman, aged from 29 to 52.
</P>
<P>
The seized cigarettes were destined for Taiwan, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Customs officers have this year seized 35 million sticks of
counterfeit cigarettes worth more than 19 million HK dollars (2.44
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Last year, the officers seized 13 million sticks of fake
cigarettes worth 7.3 million HK dollars (940,000 U.S. dollars). In
addition, the officers last year also seized counterfeit products,
including clothing and watches, worth 52 million HK dollars (6.67
million U.S. dollars), and arrested 760 suspects.
</P>
<P>
According to the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, anyone found in
possession of false trade descriptions goods for business or
commercial purpose, is liable to prosecution, and the maximum
penalty for the offense is a fine of 500,000 HK dollars (64,100 U.
S. dollars) and five years' imprisonment upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
"Customs would continue enforcement actions against all
counterfeiting and piracy activities in an effort to protect the
good image of Hong Kong," the spokesman said.

NICOSIA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides said Wednesday that the government will provide every
assistance to House Speaker Spyros Kyprianou in his mission to
Yugoslavia to seek the release of three American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides wished Kyprianou "success," hoping the speaker will
"return with the three American soldiers," who were captured by
Serb forces last week near Macedonian-Yugoslav border.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were part of the troops dispatched by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as potential peacekeeping
troops to Kosovo once Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
accepts a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been bombing Serb targets since March 24 with a
claimed aim of stopping Milosevic from killing
independence-seeking ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides clarified that the Cypriot government was not asked
to make the effort and it was a personal initiative of Kyprianou.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said earlier that he will be going to Belgrade
Wednesday afternoon to meet Milosevic and conclude an arrangement
for the release of the three U.S. prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou revealed that he will "bring them back to Cyprus and
will give them to the American authorities."
</P>
<P>
He said the Cypriot government will "not get involved in
negotiations for a political solution" and that the involvement
is based only "on humanitarian grounds."
</P>
<P>
However, he said if Milosevic asks Cyprus to become involved
in a political settlement, "then I shall see how we can handle
it and we can discuss."

<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A company to develop China's
second largest copper mine in China was set up here today in the
country's northwestern Xinjiang Uyger Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The mine, located in Ashele in northern Xinjiang, is planned to
produce 23,000 tons of copper and more than 10,000 tons of zinc a
year with a life circle of 35 years.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhonghui, chairman of the Ashele Copper Corporation Ltd.,
said this copper mine will help ease the country's copper shortage.
</P>
<P>
China now imports a large amount of copper annually, and has
discovered only two major copper mines in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The Ashele copper mine was discovered in 1984, with total
copper deposits of 1.08 million tons. The other newly discovered
copper mine is in Zijinshan in east China's Fujian Province. The
largest copper mine in China is in Dexing in Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
China took ten years to survey and prepare the establishment of
the Ashele copper mine, and investment for the first phase of
development amounts to 870 million yuan. The first phase includes
ore-selecting projects, and copper refineries will be built on the
site of the mine after the ore-selecting projects become
profitable.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Arrangement for Lockerbie Handover Kept Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
operation to arrangement the transfer of the two Lockerbie
suspects for a trial before a Scottish court in the Netherlands
"was intricate, complex and above all secret, "New York Times," a
widely-circulated newspaper in the United States, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"No one except Hans Corell, the chief legal counsel for the
United Nations -- not even Secretary-General Kofi Annan -- knew
the details surrounding the logistics for the surrender of the two
Libyan suspects charged with planting the bomb that downed Pan Am
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland," a bylined story, carried by
the New York-based newspaper, said.
</P>
<P>
Last October and November, United Nations lawyers led by Corell
and a Libyan legal team led by Kamel Hassan Maghur, the former
Libyan foreign minister, met quietly at the United Nations over
several weeks to "clarify" the many thorny questions: Who would be
authorized to defend the Libyans in a Scottish court of law in the
Netherlands? Would the suspects be considered "passengers" or
"prisoners" on the flight from Libya?
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to work with the technicians and another to get
a political decision," Annan said. "And we needed a political
decision, which is why I went to work."
</P>
<P>
In early December last year, Annan flew to Libyan for a meeting
with Libyan leader Muammar el-Gaddfai, but he failed to persuade
Tripoli into surrendering the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Saudi Arabia later joined the United Nations
in the diplomatic mediation to smooth the way for the transfer.
</P>
<P>
The president of the U.N. Security Council, Alain Dejammet of
France, Monday announced the suspension of sanctions imposed on
Libya after Annan formally reported that the two suspects had
arrived in the Netherlands for the trial.

<P>
-- Institutional rules and regulations would be simplified for
boosting the private sector and foreign investment by removing
bottlenecks in this regard;
</P>
<P>

transport and communication infrastructure. Special incentives for
small and cottage industries would be given;

<P>
-- Development of service sectors as well as local
sub-contracting industries;
</P>
<P>

providing financial and technical assistance for agro-based
industries;
</P>
<P>

these people are allowed to return to their homes in peace. Those
are the terms that must be obeyed for this (air) campaign to cease,

TIRANA -- The Albanian parliament on Wednesday passed a law
allowing NATO to deploy 24 Apache Helicopters in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government on Tuesday approved the draft law at an
urgent session and submitted it to the parliament for approval in
response to a NATO demand for deploying the heavily armed
helicopters in Albania as soon as possible. The law has taken
immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
After two weeks of bombing by high-flying jets, which failed to
get significant fruits, NATO decided to introduce Apache
helicopter gunships to the campaign of airstrikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Apaches, flown with a crew of two, are armed with 16 Hellfire
missiles designed to knock out tanks and armored vehicles. The
press here said such a move was aimed at making preparations for
possible invasion of NATO ground troops into Yugoslavia. (Albania-

<HEADLINE> HK's Foreign Currency Assets Lower in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The official foreign currency
assets of Hong Kong amounted to 89.5 billion U.S. dollars at the
end of March, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
This is 0.3 billion U.S. dollars less than the 89.8 billion U.S.
dollars at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The small decrease in foreign currency assets can mainly be
attributed to reversal in the note issuing activities in March
after the Chinese New Year holidays in February this year, said
the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong remains the world's fourth largest holder of foreign
currency reserves after Japan (222.5 billion U.S. dollars at the
end of March), the Chinese mainland (146.0 billion U.S. dollars at
the end of February) and Taiwan (93.0 billion U.S. dollars at the
end of March).
</P>
<P>
The total foreign currency assets of 89.5 billion U.S. dollars
represent over seven times the currency circulation or about 40
percent of Hong Kong dollar M3, one of the highest ratios in the
world, the HKMA said.

<HEADLINE> New Strain of Influenza A Virus Discovered in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A new strain of influenza A
virus (H9N2) has been discovered from two patients by the Virus
Unit of the Hong Kong Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
The two patients are girls aged one and four who recovered
fully from influenza-like illnesses last month.
</P>
<P>
A typical influenza virus was picked up from their clinical
specimens of throat secretion by the enhanced influenza
surveillance system set up to monitor the avian flu situation in
Hong Kong since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Results available today confirmed that the virus was influenza
A (H9N2).
</P>
<P>
The specimens were sent to the World Health Organization (WHO)
Influenza Collaborating Reference Laboratories in the United
Kingdom and the United States for further identification.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time H9N2 virus, an avian influenza virus,
is isolated from humans in Hong Kong," Deputy Director of Health
Dr. Paul Saw said Wednesday at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
This virus is sensitive to the drugs amantadine and remantadine,
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, influenza A (H9N2) has been isolated from
duck and chicken for many years.
</P>
<P>
"Detailed investigations are underway to find out how the
patients contracted the virus," Saw said.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health's special investigation team on avian
influenza will work closely with local and overseas experts to
assess the global health impact of this new discovery and its mode
of transmission, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the experience gained in the control of the avian flu
outbreak in late 1997, the department would be better equipped to
coordinate efforts from international health authorities and local
experts to monitor and control the situation, he said.

BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Wen Jiabao
has called on the local people to quickly put out the forest fire
in north China's Shanxi province and safeguard people's lives.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23 people were killed while fighting the fire and 22,
000 hectares of forest are threatened by the fire which broke out
near the city of Fenyang on Saturday.
</P>

He asked the State Forestry Administration to issue an urgent
circular to all local authorities in the country on Tuesday,
instructing them to pay greater attention to preventing forest
fires, and urged people to take all possible measures to
extinguish the Fenyang fire quickly and prevent any reoccurrence.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds forced fire-fighters to cease operations on the
northern side of the burning area today, but people are bringing
the fire under control on the southern and eastern sides.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people are currently at work attempting to put
out the flames. The State Forestry Administration has called in
over 200 forest police from neighboring Inner Mongolia to assist
with the fire-fighting today.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Unveils New Industrial Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government Wednesday
announced its new industrial policy which pledges equal treatment
to both domestic and foreign investors while undertaking ventures.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the salient features of the five-year industrial
policy which was approved by the cabinet Monday, Commerce and
Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed said that no difference would be
made between domestic and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The policy adopted the strategy of simplification of relevant
rules and regulations for creating a conducive and productive
private sector that would play the pivotal role in
industrialization and investment in the country, Ahmed told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
"All the regulatory obstacles will be removed for attracting
more domestic and foreign direct investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government would play the role of facilitator instead of
regulator to encourage foreign and local investment, according to
the minister.
</P>
<P>
Priority would be attached to setting up small and medium
industries and creating scope for massive employment
opportunities, including those for women in labor-intensive
sectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
The new industrial policy, identifying 16 thrust sectors, would
come into force as soon as the relevant laws have been passed,
said Ahmed. The sectors include agro-based industries, artificial
flower production, computer and software and information
technology, electronics, frozen food, floriculture, gift items,
infrastructure, jute goods, jewelry and diamond, leather, oil and
gas, sericulture and silk industries, stuffed toys, textiles and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
The tax holiday for the industries would range from five to
seven years according to their location.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that top priority would be attached to the
implementation of the policy which, with the passage of time,
would be reviewed to suit the changing scenario.
</P>
<P>
For the successful implementation of the policy, the minister
sought unstinted support and cooperation from all, particularly
from the opposition political parties. "There might be differences
of opinion but there should be consensus on some points of common
national interest," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new industrial policy, the country's
industrial sector would be able to contribute to 25 percent of the
gross domestic product in the next 10 years, instead of the
current 10 percent, and would employ some 20 percent of the
country's manpower during the same period.

<HEADLINE> China Patches Loopholes in Investment Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Finance has asked
local authorities to strengthen fund management and the
supervision of infrastructure construction projects in order to
stamp out waste and the diversion of treasury money.
</P>
<P>
In a circular released today, the Ministry of Finance pointed
out that there are "non-ignorable problems" in these areas.
</P>
<P>
China increased investment in infrastructure facilities by 100
billion yuan by issuing additional treasury bonds in the latter
half of last year, inflating the budget deficit to over 150
billion yuan this year from less than 100 billion yuan last year
in order to stimulate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry noted that spending on many construction
projects greatly exceeds their budget due to inadequate pre-
project study, that other projects fail to conclude on schedule
due to lack of supplementary funds, and that funds for still other
projects are diverted or wasted because of poor financial
management.
</P>
<P>
"If these problems are not resolved and corrected immediately,
they will severely affect the efficiency of investment in
infrastructure construction, damage the results of the pro-active
financial policy, and produce great losses and waste of funds,"
the circular said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance asks leaders of local governments to
take direct responsibility for ensuring efficient fund use in
these projects.
</P>
<P>
It requires that local authorities not provide treasury funds
for projects that lack supplementary funds. It also states that
the central government will reduce funding for local construction
projects if local governments fail to provide adequate
supplementary funds.
</P>
<P>
It further requires that relevant authorities stamp out the
diversion and waste of treasury funds.
</P>
<P>
The circular warns that persons responsible for waste and
diversion of treasury funds and other severe violations will be
punished and may even face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
Since most of the money the central government assigns for
infrastructure construction projects is raised through the
issuance of treasury bonds, the Ministry of Finance also requires
local governments to make practical plans to guarantee repayment.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out earlier this year that using
bond money to fund these construction projects will enhance
economic growth and increase the growth potential of the economy.
</P>
<P>
He also asked that the money be used for careful planning and
the guaranteeing of engineering quality, while fund diversion and
the waste of treasury funds be eliminated.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The third dispatch of food will be
sent to refugee camps at Kaputa in Northern Province of Zambia
Thursday, bringing the total of relief food to 362 tons since
March 17, a senior official of the World Food Program said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bai Bojang, WFP Deputy Country Director in Zambia, said that
food aid needs to be quickly mobilized and delivered to the
northern border area in order to feed a growing number of refugees
crossing over from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The latest figures indicate that at least 20,000 refugees have
crossed from the DRC into the district of Kaputa since March 5,
with more expected to arrive as a result of continual heavy
fighting between the DRC government troops and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
A recent WFP mission to Kaputa area verified that the flow of
people has not abated, with the number reaching Kaputa as many as
500 people.
</P>
<P>
"At this rate, we could easily see another 15,000 people
arriving within a month," said Techeste Zergaber, WFP Country
Director in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has been able to borrow food from other programs to
feed the refugees, but those supplies are rapidly becoming
exhausted, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We will soon be launching an appeal to donors to help us
respond to this latest crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
The nutritional condition of the refugees is currently not
cause for concern, said Zergaber, apart from some emaciation due
to the long distances travelled. It was recommended, however,
that a nutritional survey be quickly undertaken to identify any
special needs of women and children, who form at least 60 percent
of the population and are typically the most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
Some cases of measles have also been reported, and outbreaks of
malaria, diarrhoea and cholera are feared as the area is
mosquito-infested and clean water supplies are problematic, he
said.

<HEADLINE> EDS-UPDATE Yugoslavia Agrees to Free Captured U.S. Marines: Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas confirmed Wednesday that Yugoslavia has agreed to release
the three U.S. marines captured last week near the border of
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Reppas said that acting Cyprus
President Spyros Kyprianou, invited by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, will go to Belgrade to take back the U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government will help the soldiers leave Belgrade, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources here said that the three Americans would
first be sent to the Cypriot capital of Nicosia possibly later
Wednesday, where the Cyprus government would hand them over to the
U.S. embassy there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reppas renewed Greece's calls for a political
solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as
well as the European Union, Greece refused to participate in
NATO's military actions against Yugoslavia. And Athens has
repeated that it could mediate between Belgrade and NATO for a
peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis.

<HEADLINE> Inter-clan Fighting Kills 11 in C. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 people were killed
and more than 15 others were wounded in an inter-clan fighting
between the Badi Addeh and Jareer communities in Somalia's central
Hiran region Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses who fled the fighting told Xinhua Wednesday that
nearly 200 men from both sides and armed with assault rifles,
rocket propelled grenades and hand bombs were involved in the
clashes outside the second largest district of Bulo Burto, 240
kilometers north of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The opposing militiamen launched attack and counter-attack
operations on three villages inhabited by the two clansmen, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources said that the three villages of Dabayodleh,
 Samatarow and Aqab were erased and burnt down to ashes as each
side had staged successive attacks on those villages in their
attempt of clearing the area from the opponent clansmen.
</P>
<P>
Two of the burnt villages belonged to the Badi Addeh clansmen
while the third belonged to the Jareer men.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting between the two sides is said to
have related to a dispute over the contract in repairing a water
well in the village of Dabayodleh.
</P>
<P>
Two week ago, six men from the Badi Addeh clan were killed by
the Jareer clansmen in relation to the contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
A local aid agency, ADRA, has been digging and repairing water
wells for the local communities in the region where water
scarcity has been claiming both human and livestock lives during
the prolonged drought in the region.
</P>
<P>
Efforts were made by the traditional leaders to contain the
hostility which is draining up the resources of the region since
it coincided with the time of the cultivation even though the
rains did not fall as expected.

<HEADLINE> EU Mideast Envoy Visits Lebanon on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Middle East
Envoy Miguel Moratinos arrived here Wednesday for talks with
Lebanese leaders on the stalled peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, who came from Syria by land, is due to meet with
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, Prime Minister Salim Hoss and
House Speaker Nabih Berri on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Lebanese border town of Masnaa, the
envoy reiterated the role the EU will play to help achieve a
comprehensive and just peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Syria, Lebanon and Israel have been
non-existent since the hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu came to power in June, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a swath of land in south Lebanon where it
set up a self-styled security zone in 1985 with the claimed aim of
protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
It refuses to return the Golan Heights it captured from Syria
during the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Moratinos will also discuss
preparations for the upcoming Euro-Mediterranean forum, which will
be held at foreign ministerial level this month in Stuttgart,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The forum will address the cooperation between 15 EU member
states and 12 countries along the southern and eastern
Mediterranean coast in the fields of economy, culture, security
and politics.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon will send a senior official to participate in the
session.

<HEADLINE> Big Powers Work on Adaptation of Rambouillet Accord: France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said on Wednesday that big powers are working on the
adaptation of the Rambouillet peace plan for Kosovo, because of
the mass exodus of Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"At one moment or another, we should implement a political
solution, which has been blocked stubbornly for months by (
Yugoslav) President Milosevic," Vedrine told Radio Info.
</P>
<P>
While rejecting a ceasefire proposal by Yugoslavia on Tuesday,
NATO insists that Belgrade accept a five-point plan, including the
return of refugees, the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces, the signing
of the Rambouillet agreement, and the deployment of a NATO force
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"There is a work on this political solution: On the basis of
the agreements of Rambouillet, what should be adapted? What
should be kept? What form should the international security on
the ground take?" said the French foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He again described the truce proposal for the Orthodox Easter
by Belgrade as "absolutely insufficient."
</P>
<P>
"The diplomatic efforts aim to seek a political solution, when
we are back in this field. But for the moment, unfortunately,
there is no sign of any kind from the authorities of Belgrade, and
it is for this the military operations will continue," said
Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Group of Eight (G8) most industrialized
nations, the Contact Group on former Yugoslavia, and the foreign
ministers of NATO will have consultations on adapting the
Rambouillet peace plans, which was named after the French chateau
50 kilometers southwest of Paris where the talks on Kosovo were
held in February.
</P>
<P>
"In France, we think that the Security Council at this moment
should also play a key role," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Rambouillet peace plan, adopted by the Kosovo Albanians but
rejected by the Serbs, calls for substantial autonomy in Kosovo
and the deployment of NATO troops there.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian met here today with his Mexican counterpart Enrique
Cervantes Aguirre.
</P>
<P>
Chi happily reviewed his trip to Mexico last month, and
expressed his thanks again to Cervantes for the hospitality he was
accorded by Cervantes and the Mexican army.
</P>
<P>
Though of different social systems, Chi said, China and Mexico
share many common views and interests, and therefore should
support each other to further promote friendship and cooperation
at all levels and in all fields between the two nations and the
two armies.
</P>
<P>
On the international situation, Chi, who is also vice chairman
of the Central Military Commission and a state councilor, said
that the Chinese government strongly urges NATO to immediately
stop air strikes against Yugoslavia. The international community
and relevant parties in Yugoslavia concerned should work together
to ease the situation and restore peace in the region as soon as
possible, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cervantes voiced the hope that his visit will lend impetus to
the development of bilateral army relations.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government stands by China in opposing hegemonism
and power politics, he said, adding that Mexico insists on solving
the Kosovo crisis through political means.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Chi held a welcoming ceremony for the
Mexican guests who will also visit several military barracks here.
They also are scheduled to visit Xi'an, Hangzhou, and Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> EU Dissatisfied With WTO Panel Decision Over Banana Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union reserves the
right of appeal while carefully studying a WTO panel report which
the United States said was in the latter's favor in their so-
called banana dispute, said an EU trade representative.
</P>
<P>
"We will carefully study both the arbitrator's report and the
two panel reports and of course meanwhile reserve our right of
appeal," said Leon Brittan, Vice President of the EU, in a
statement received here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "we will naturally abide by the rules
applicable in the case of such decisions, as we have consistently
said we would."
</P>
<P>
On April 6, the panel, set up by the World Trade Organization (
WTO) to review the EU's banana import regime, found that the EU
trade policy had caused 191.4 million U.S. dollars in lost U.S.
exports on goods and services on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
said she hoped the EU would change its banana import regime to
make it WTO consistent rather than accept the 100 percent import
duties.
</P>
<P>
"As before, we are prepared to work with the EU on a new banana
regime that meets the requirements of the WTO and allows banana
producing countries in the Caribbean to continue to export bananas,
" Barshefsky said.

BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing
released a statement today on the occasion of the 50th World
Health Day calling on all of society to provide fair and equal
living opportunities for the elderly.
</P>

<P>
He said that China has a long history of respecting and loving
the elderly, and the Communist Party and the government have
always paid attention to issues affecting elderly people.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Oil and Natural Gas
Corporation announced today that the municipality will receive
natural gas supplies from the Pinghu Oil Field in the East China
Sea beginning tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
A daily supply of 300,000 cubic meters of natural gas will be
offered by the oil field to Shanghai in the short term, and the
scale will be upgraded to 1.2 million cubic meters by the end of
this year, the company said.
</P>
<P>
However, the natural gas will not be available to Shanghai
citizens until the end of this month as the gas company in
Shanghai still has some preparatory work to do, said local
officials.
</P>
<P>
The 240-square-kilometer oil field, the first of its kind ever
found in the East China Sea, has total gas reserves of 10.8
billion cubic meters. About 20 square kilometers of the oil field
has undergone first-stage exploration.
</P>
<P>
The wide use of natural gas will promote the adjustment of
Shanghai's energy structure, which will be conducive to the
improvement of the air quality in the city, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Second-seed Rafter Ousted in First Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- the Second-seeded Patrick Rafter
suffered a frist-round clash when the Australian was upset by
German Bernd Karbacher in the 350,000 U.S. dollar Hong Kong Open
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Karbacher rallied strongly to win the first-set game 6-7 (4-7),
7-6 (7-1), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, the two-time defending U.S. Open champion, struggled to
find his feet on the hardcourt. The world No. 5 blamed his loss on
poor serving.
</P>
<P>
After trading tie-breaks in the first two sets, Karbacher
turned on the pressure in the decisive third set as Rafter slumped.
The German, ranked 117 in the world, broke Rafter twice to romp to
victory.
</P>
<P>
Cedric Pioline of France was another casualty among seeded
players as the fourth seed was beaten 2-6, 6-1, 6-4 by Italy's
Laurence Tieleman in the first round.
</P>
<P>
World No. 4 Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands survived a
shaky start before moving in to the second round with a 6-4, 6-4
victory over Japan's No. 1 and world No. 10 Takao Suzuki.
</P>
<P>
American Andre Agassi hardly broke a sweat as he rushed to a 6-
2, 6-2 victory over Italy's Gianluca Pozzi.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Krajicek too admitted Wednesday that he had problems
getting accustomed to the faster surface in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch survived five break points in his first set against
Suzuki. One break of service in each set was all it took for
Krajicek to enter the second round, where he will meet defending
champion Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel in Predicament Over Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Knesset (parliament)
is scheduled to discuss the Kosovo crisis next week as asked by
the Meretz Party leader Yossi Sarid. It remains uncertain whether
the Knesset would adopt a clear-cut resulotion supporting the
NATO's action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has refrained from giving explicit
support to the NATO's actions though the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization has launched its airstrikes aganist Yugoslavia for
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Only after sustained criticism by the press of the Israeli
ambiguity over the Kosovo crisis did Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and his office voiced condemnation of massacres by the
Serbs or any other group.
</P>
<P>
But Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has repeatedly aired his
objection to the NATO air riads, warning Israel could be the next
target some day in the future if Israel supports NATO's action.
</P>
<P>
Several days ago, the Meretz party leader blamed the government
for neither condemning the "genocide" of the Kosovo Albanians
committed by the Yugoslav government, nor openly supporting NATO's
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
Sarid called for a special Knesset session to discuss the
Kosovo crisis so that Israel can adopt a clear-cut attitude toward
the Kosovo issue. He also urged the government to accept some of
the Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sarid crticized Sharon's remarks against the NATO
airstrikes, saying Sharon's attitude can only jeopardize Israel's
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, now in the United States, is reportedly to meet
U.S. Secretary of State Madelaine Albright soon and explain to
her what the Israeli side is thinking about the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
But as victims of the deadliest genocide in the 20th century,
Jews here in Israel do feel a special moral resonance in
astrocities committed against ethinic minorities in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the current crisis in Kosovo is regarded with
ambivalence among the Israelis, some of whom are deeply uneasy
with the NATO bombing campaign against the Yugoslav Serbs.
</P>
<P>
History-minded Israelis know that the Serbs stood up against
the Nazis and eventually beated them back during the World War II,
at great cost in blood. But the Kosovoar Albanians, by contrast,
joined a German division toward the end of the War.
</P>
<P>
And to some Israelis, such as Sharon, the plight of the
Kosovoar Albanians bears enough resemblance to that of the
Palestinians, or Israel's own million-strong Arab minority.
</P>
<P>
Like Israeli Arabs, the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are a
Muslim minority in a sovereign state. Like the Palestinians, they
aspire to create an independent state on land they regard as
their birthright.
</P>
<P>
What a resolution the Knesset will adopt remains to be seen.

<HEADLINE> Prospects for Future Sino-Syrian Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The prospects for the future
development of trade and economic cooperation between China and
Syria are bright, and China is willing to further strengthen the
cooperative relations betwee the two countries, China's top
legislator Li Peng said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here Tuesday evening on a three-day official
visit, made the statement during his talks with Syrian Prime
Minister Mahmoud Zouebi.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (parliament) of China, highly evaluated the
development of the bilateral ties since the two countries
established diplomatic relations in 1956.
</P>
<P>
The friendly relations of cooperation between China and Syria
have been developing steadily, featuring ever expanding bilateral
cooperation in the political, economic, science and technological,
and cultural fields, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also said there is still untapped potentials for the two
countries to further promote their coopearation in the economic
and trade area. In 1998, bilateral trade amounted to 175 million
U.S. dollars, up by 15.3 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
China is the largest developing nation in the world, while
Syria is an important country in the Middle East. So, it is in the
fundamental interests of the two peoples to strengthen and further
develop the Sino-Syrian cooperation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
It would also be conducive to strengthen the unity and
cooperation among the developing countries around the world, he
added.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to bring the momentum of further developing
bilateral cooperation into the 21st century on the basis of mutual
respect, equality and mutual benefit, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that China has always been supporting the
just cause and demands of the Arab nations, including Syria, the
Middle East peace process, and all the efforts by the
international community to push forward the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Zouebi warmly welcomed Li, who, he said, is an old friend from
a friendly country. The Prime Minister also expressed his
gratitude for China's all-along support to the Syrian and all the
Arab peoples in their cause for peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He said Syria would also like to see China play a bigger role
in the world affairs.
</P>
<P>
On the country's economic development, Zouebi said Syria is
now undertaking the policy of opening up in the area of economic
and trade development and welcome foreign businessmen to invest in
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises who would like to invest in Syria are
especially welcomed, he said, promising that the government would
provide business-friendly conditions for the investors.
</P>
<P>
Syria is the third leg of Li's six-nation tour across Europe
and Asia, which has already taken him to Greece and Turkey, and
will further bring him to Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Thailand.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen here
today met a delegation from the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese General
Association led by Ku Suen Fai.
</P>
<P>
Qian told them that their association has played an important
role in guaranteeing the smooth return of Hong Kong to the
motherland and maintaining the region's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central government has always attached
importance to the role of overseas Chinese, who are patriotic and
have deep feelings for the motherland. They have played a special
role in pushing forward the motherland's economic development,
supporting the disaster relief work and promoting the
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that the situation after the return of Hong
Kong has proved the success of the implementation of the principle
of "one country, two systems". Cross straits exchanges have
increased in recent years, which indicates a general trend towards
the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He added that the principles of "peaceful reunification" and "
one country, two systems" are also feasible in resolving the
Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed the hope that the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong
will make efforts to further expand cross straits exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He also exchanged opinions on foreign affairs and issues
concerning overseas Chinese with members of the delegation, and
answered their questions.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Overseas Chinese General Association, founded in
December 1993, is an influential patriotic social organization in
the region, with more than 800 members and five member
organizations.

LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin

Milosevic must allow Kosovo people to return under international

</P>
<P>
"We are not in direct negotiation with Belgrade, but Belgrade
knows perfectly well what our minimum conditions are for those
negotiations. They withdraw their troops and they allow an

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans' Life Expectancy Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Health Minister Yeo
Cheow Tong said Wednesday that the average Singaporean's life
expectancy at birth is 77 years and the government is making
efforts to help people lead independent and meaningful lives
through a combination of individual efforts and community action.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally to mark the World Health Day, which falls
on April 7, Minister for Health and Minister for the Environment
Yeo said "for a man who has already reached the age of 60, he can
expect to survive for nearly 20 more years, and for a woman
another 22 years."
</P>
<P>
"My ministry's national health campaigns encourage people of
all ages to avoid smoking, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly
and maintain a healthy weight," he said. "Observing these habits
will reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer and stroke and help
Singaporeans enter their golden years in good health."
</P>
<P>
Quoting the national health survey made in 1998, Yeo said that
the proportion of adults who smoked regularly declined from 18
percent in 1992 to 15 percent in 1998, while the proportion of
adults with high blood pressure rose from 22 percent to 27
percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that the prevalence of obesity and
diabetes remained unchanged, at 6 percent and 9 percent
respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These results show that our health promotion activities had
some impact with regard to smoking and exercise. However, it was
not adequate to change dietary practices, especially with
increased affluence of the population," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the fact that the World Health Organization (WHO)
has chosen for World Health Day 1999 the theme "Active Aging Makes
The Difference", Yeo said the principle of active aging is to
encourage people of all ages to take steps to ensure greater
health and well being in their later years for themselves and
their communities.
</P>
<P>
"WHO's message is particularly relevant to Singapore as we are
one of the fastest aging countries in the world," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Supply More Food to Refugees in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The third dispatch of food will be
sent to refugee camps at Kaputa in Northern Province of Zambia
Thursday, bringing the total of relief food to 362 tons since
March 17, a senior official of the World Food Program said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bai Bojang, WFP Deputy Country Director in Zambia, said that
food aid needs to be quickly mobilized and delivered to the
northern border area in order to feed a growing number of refugees
crossing over from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The latest figures indicate that at least 20,000 refugees have
crossed from the DRC into the district of Kaputa since March 5,
with more expected to arrive as a result of continual heavy
fighting between the DRC government troops and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
A recent WFP mission to Kaputa area verified that the flow of
people has not abated, with the number reaching Kaputa as many as
500 people.
</P>
<P>
"At this rate, we could easily see another 15,000 people
arriving within a month," said Techeste Zergaber, WFP Country
Director in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has been able to borrow food from other programs to
feed the refugees, but those supplies are rapidly becoming
exhausted, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We will soon be launching an appeal to donors to help us
respond to this latest crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
The nutritional condition of the refugees is currently not
cause for concern, said Zergaber, apart from some emaciation due
to the long distances travelled. It was recommended, how percent
of the population and are typically the most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
Some cases of measles have also been reported, and outbreaks of
malaria, diarrhoea and cholera are feared as the area is
mosquito-infested and clean water supplies are problematic, he
said.

<HEADLINE> BT, SmarTone Announce Strategic Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- British Telecommunications (BT)
announced Wednesday that it is forming an alliance with Hong
Kong's SmarTone telecommunication Holdings Limited (SmarTone)
through a direct equity purchase of 20 percent of the enlarged
share capital on a fully diluted basis.
</P>
<P>
This was made possible through the issuance of 120,782,250 new
shares in SmarTone, a leading provider of digital mobile
communication services in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The move by BT, one of the largest telecommunication companies
in the world, represents a 3 billion-HK dollar (384.6 million U.S.
dollars) investment in SmarTone at a price of 25 HK dollars (3.2 U.
S. dollars) per share. The strategic alliance will make BT
SmarTone's second largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the alliance at a press conference at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center, Hubert Ng, chief executive
officer of SmarTone, said that BT's commitment to SmarTone
demonstrates its confidence in the group's prospects, and equally
important, the future outlook of the telecommunications industry
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Also at the press conference, Richard Slogrove, managing
director of BT Asia Pacific, said that SmarTone's experience,
operational capabilities and managerial assets are not only well
suited to the growth of the Hong Kong market, but may also assist
BT in expanding into the China market as well as opportunities
arise.

have been in his 40s, near one of the bus garage's maintenance
bays. Policy have not released the contents of the gunman's

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Supervision Of Construction Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua)-- China is strengthening supervision
of infrastructure-construction project management in the wake of
serious illegal fund appropriation and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance issued a circular recently urging all
local governments and concerned departments to take direct
responsibility to ensure the sound management of construction
projects.
</P>
<P>
The circular pointed out several problems related to
construction projects that must not be neglected, noting that some
projects were improperly planned while others were begun with
insufficient funding.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, construction project budgets were frequently
changed, causing a dilution of funds and huge waste, it said.
</P>
<P>
The circular was released after a much-publicized project
involving the collapse of a bridge in Chongqing City in southwest
China. On January 4, the bridge collapsed in Qijiang County,
killing 40 people and injuring 14 others, and resulting in direct
economic loss of over six million yuan. The bridge was built amid
serious bribery, dereliction of duty, and mismanagement, and the
case ended with the death sentence on a leading county official
and 13 others sentenced to prison terms of three to 13 years.
</P>
<P>
The circular stresses that local government and department
leaders take particular care of infrastructure construction
projects, from approval to completion.
</P>
<P>
The circular also demands that builders appear in the role of
legal persons and registered companies, so that direct
responsibility for financial and accounting management can be
pinpointed.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A local court in southwest China's
Sichuan Province Tuesday sentenced five farmers for killing a
giant panda and selling its skin.
</P>
<P>
They will serve one to five years in prison and pay fines of 1,
000 to 2,000 yuan, according to the ruling of the People's Court
of Qingyang District in the city of Chengdu, the provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
In April 1997, Yuan Rugang and Yang Tianbin killed a giant
panda in Qingchuan County. Yuan later sold the skin to Tian
Zhongmu and Jiu Shengqiang, from Jiangyou County. Tian and Jiu
then had their friend Wang Xiuguang take the skin to Chengdu where
Wang was caught red-handed by local police.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 giant pandas live in the Tangjiahe Giant Panda Nature
Reserve in Qingchuan County.
</P>

Giant pandas are found only in China, where there are only
about 1,000 of the endangered animals left in the wild.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Overhaul Immigration System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the heart of the proposed policy is a reliance on market
forces to determine which skills are needed in South Africa. The
current system is based on maximum government control over
foreigners, the Business Day newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A product of a specialist task team's year of study, it
recommends scrapping the discredited Immigration Selection Board
in favor of " objective criteria" administered by a regulatory
agency to be known as the Immigration Service.
</P>
<P>
This is intended to enable businesses to recruit foreign
workers on condition that they pay predetermined sums into a skill
training fund for South African workers.
</P>
<P>
Linked to this is a proposal for the government not to
interfere in determining how many foreigners, or what skills, are
needed in the labor market. Market forces will determine that.
</P>
<P>
The new immigration scheme will lead to a radical reduction in
the number of illegal immigrants found in workplaces. It is
estimated that there are five million illegal immigrants in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration Service will be empowered to negotiate
corporate visas, which are to be given to domestic companies for a
specified number of foreign workers on the basis of skill needs
and administered by the companies themselves.
</P>
<P>
Visitors from countries specified in the regulations will not
be required to obtain visas beforehand if they provide proof at
the port of entry of a return air ticket or other prescribed
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Those entering across South Africa's land borders must possess
visas or travel documents issued by a South African diplomatic
mission. Alternatively, at all points of entry, people may enter
on the basis of a credit card procedure.

SINGAPORE, April 7 (Xinhua)-- Share prices remained bullish on
Singapore Stock Market Wednesday as heavy trading fueled momentum
for a third day.
</P>

They said that as foreign investors remain bullish, liquidity
continued to pour into the market for the third consecutive day.

<P>
At the expiration of the ultimatum issued to the management of
Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited, the Ijaws Tuesday actualized
their threat to make oil operations difficult for all oil
companies operating in the region.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers said that the communities Tuesday seized five
barges, four tug boats and one sea truck belong to some of oil
companies in Delta State.
</P>
<P>
The communities are allegedly impacted by the January 12, 1998
Idoho platform oil spillage and are demanding a two billion naira
(about 22 million U.S. dollars) compensation from the American oil
firm.
</P>
<P>
Addressing newsmen Tuesday in Warri, capital of Delta State,
the coordinating secretary of the Association of Mobil Spill
Affected Communities, Ijawkeme Adam, said that the seizure of the
barges and tug boats was tip of the ice-berg as it was just the
first stage of their planned action in the area.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if the management of Mobil still remains adamant
to their plight, they would have no option than to take over all
the oil installations in the area.
</P>
<P>
The coordinating secretary pointed out that the communities
resorted to the militant approach because some officials of Mobil
were frustrating all attempts to dialog over the matter.

<HEADLINE> Weapon Cleaning up Operation Begins in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government
started a weapon clean-up operation Wednesday, aiming at reducing
crimes and kidnappings and ensuring social security during the
Khmer New Year.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide disarmament is expected to last for three months. A
special mixed commission headed by Phnom Penh First Deputy
Governor Chea Sophara has been set up to crack down on people
carrying weapons and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
During the operation, Police and Military Police will be
deployed at Phnom Penh's main streets and some entrances to the
city to search for weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian government Friday took some tough measures to
improve the country's public security, such as cleaning up the
city's weapons, canceling all existing gun licenses, closing
shooting ranges, banning security officials from carrying weapons
when off-duty, and stopping unregulated sale of uniforms.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Interior said that the rifles
held by companies, hotels, night clubs and restaurants are now
illegal.
If Private companies want to use security guards with long guns,
they can hire the police to do so.
</P>
<P>
According to Royal Cambodia Armed Forces (RCAF) General Meas
Sophea, legally licensed guns will be deemed illegal and
confiscated after their present licenses expire.
</P>
<P>
A partial survey of the city revealed that 10,130 guns were
held by residents, only 2,482 of which were legally owned.
</P>
<P>
Public order was still very poor in Cambodia in recent months.
Robberies, kidnapping, murders and other serious crimes were
rampant which not only severely affected people's normal life, but
also hindered foreign investment and the development of tourism.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges Balanced Growth for Mekong Subregion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan opened a major development meeting here on Wednesday
calling for balanced growth in politics, social welfare and the
environment other than a singled-minded pursuit of unsubstainable
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote address at the Symposium on the
Comprehensive Development of the Greater Mekong Subregion, Surin
said that if the countries in the region followed the examples of
Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, where economic policy was
pursued to the exclusion of everything else, they will have
problems ahead.
</P>
<P>
"Social and human resources development must keep pace with
economic progress to make development sustainable," Surin noted.
</P>
<P>
He pinpointed single-minded pursuit of unsubstainable growth as
a major cause of the current economic turmoil in Asia, warning
that Mekong region governments must invest heavily in their people
or risk future crises.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister blamed the economic crisis in Asia on the
fact that many of the countries affected lacked adequate human
resources and were extremely dependent on external funds,
technology and markets for their economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Other areas where progress needs to be made in the Greater
Mekong Subregion countries include improvement of infrastructure,
revision of rules governing cross-border trade, better human
resources development and greater involvement of the private
sector in economic development.
</P>
<P>
The two-day symposium, being held at the United Nations
Conference Center in Bangkok, is organized by the U.N. Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in cooperation with
the Asian Development Bank and the governments of Thailand and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Greater Mekong Subregion includes Thailand, Myanmar, Laos,
Cambodia and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> WFP Announces Emergency Food Aid to 640,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
announced on Wednesday that it will provide emergency food aid to
640,000 drought- stricken pastoralists in the Somali region of
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Hansen, head of the relief unit of WFP Ethiopia, told
press here that pastoralists in the Somali region have been
migrating in search of water for themselves and their animals.
</P>
<P>
He noted that grazing conditions are much worse then normal for
this time of year and drinking water is in short supply, adding a
lack of rainfall during the two previous rainy seasons has only
exacerbated the drought conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to WFP Ethiopia, WFP has reallocated a total of 8,000
tons of food from Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa and Jijiga for the relief
effort and the Ethiopian government's relief institution is moving
the food locally to distribute sites throughout the Somali region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other United Nations' agencies and non-governmental
organizations are helping supply water in the Somali region.
</P>
<P>
"The overall situation is aggravated by a livestock ban from
the region to the Gulf states," Hansen said, adding that "Saudi
Arabia banned livestock imports from Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia,
Eritrea, Djibouti and Kenya in February 1998 because of fears
that an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever could spread."
</P>
<P>
He said, "livestock prices have decreased significantly while
grain prices are increasing."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Has Busy Day in Los Angeles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji,
who arrived here Tuesday morning, met local leaders and public
figures before and after a luncheon hosted in his honor by Los
Angeles mayor Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
Among some 300 guests present were Los Angeles County Chairman
of the Board of Supervisors Don Knabe, U.S. ambassador to China
James Saser, former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher,
congressmen and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the Chinese premier, Riordan said it is an honor for
Los Angeles to be chosen as the first stop of Zhu's official visit
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Greater Los Angeles, he said, is an area in the United States
with the largest Chinese population and very close ties with China.
He hoped that these ties will grow extensively in the next century
and exchanges and cooperation between the United States and China
further expand.
</P>
<P>
In response, Premier Zhu said California and Los Angeles have
been playing an important role in Sino-U.S. trade and economic
relations.
</P>
<P>
He expected the mutually beneficial cooperation and friendly
exchanges between China and Los Angeles and California to
constantly develop, in pace with further improvements of the
relations between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Before the luncheon, Zhu met separately with Riordan, Knabe and
Governor of California Gray Davis at Century Plaza Hotel, where he
is staying.
</P>
<P>
Telling the guest that he will soon visit China as head of a
delegation, Davis expressed the hope that relations between China
and the United States would improve.
</P>
<P>
Other guests Zhu met with also shared the view that contacts
and exchange of visits at high levels are all the more necessary
when difficulties arise in bilateral relations. They said they
were especially glad that Premier Zhu will talk with President
Bill Clinton during his visit.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, Zhu attended a grand banquet in his honor
hosted by the Chinese community of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to nearly 1,000 people at the banquet, a
representative of the host organizations described Zhu's visit as
a great event in Sino-U.S. relations, following the exchange of
visits by the heads of state of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the audience, Zhu said the purpose of his visit is
to further implement the mutual understanding reached by the heads
of state of the two countries during their exchange of visits and
to overcome obstruction and promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
With mutual efforts of both sides and support of the two
peoples, this aim can surely be reached, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu briefed the audience about the latest developments of
China's economy and reform.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, Zhu met representatives from Chinese
companies operating in Los Angeles, Chinese students studying in
California and staff members at the Chinese consulate general in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's wife Lao An, State Councilor Wu Yi, State Councilor and
Secretary-General of the State Council Wang Zhongyu and Zhu's
other entourage also attended the events on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Urges Rebels to Keep Word on Hostages Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Wednesday urged the rebel National Democratic Front (NDF) to match
their statements on the release of the five abducted officers with
concrete action.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in an interview that the rebels have made too many
statements in the past on the date of hostages' release, but have
yet to keep their word.
</P>
<P>
"The NDF earlier promised to release the hostages last March
29, but they did not keep their word," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now they are promising again. We cannot believe them anymore
until they actually release the hostages," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the Philippine National Police
expected the release of abducted police inspector Roberto Bernal
in the next 72 hours from last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NDF has also announced it will release four other military
officers, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the government has kept its part of the bargain to
ensure the safety of the hostages by ordering the withdrawal of
military troops in areas where the release is likely to take
place.
</P>
<P>
The five military and police officers were abducted by the
rebels during the past two months.
</P>
<P>
On March 22, Estrada ordered the suspension of offensive
military operations as a confidence-building measure to facilitate
the release of the five officers.

<HEADLINE> Feature: A Cornered Tiger Who Still Fights (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guobao's task was to paint artwork on the outside of an empty
eggshell, a very popular handicraft then. And when a Japanese
customer asked for a painted egg featuring a Buddha plus a
Buddhist scripture with 240 Chinese characters, few of Guobao's
factory colleagues dared to accept such a daunting job.
</P>
<P>
But he accepted without a second thought and worked out a
special technical way of ensuring that the characters would be
even and equal in size on such a small item. Thanks to his
developing this particular painting skill he was able to turn out
a dozen painted eggs a day.
</P>
<P>
And while an ordinary egg earned him 0.18 yuan each, his
scripture eggs earned four times as much each, a huge sum in those
days.
</P>
<P>
So for 13 years, Guobao, working from his bed and on his
stomach, happily painted eggs for the factory, and as a result of
hard-working spirit and considerable talent, was cited as a model
worker. His deeds were publicized by local newspapers, television
and radio.
</P>
<P>
Instead of becoming a burden, as he had feared, Guobao became
the financial pillar of the family. Apart from himself, he was
able to support his housewife mother and also paid for the
schooling of his younger brother and three sisters.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, as the demand for painted eggs declined, undeterred
Guobao changed to name-card printing, then a lucrative business.
Out of his savings he bought a special machine and launched the
Mingyuan Name-card Printing House. He even learned simple English
so that he could handle bilingual cards and adopted a new motto:
Flexibility, Perfection and Credibility. His business flourished.
He had to employ several hands in busy times to cope with
increasing orders.
</P>
<P>
Now, in the time of difficulty, he is still grateful to his
family for sticking by him and encouraging him. He still lives
with his now 76-year-old mother and the family of his married
brother, while his three devoted sisters often visit to help him,
with their husbands, when he is too ill to work.
</P>
<P>
And Guobao is loud in praise of his assistant and housemaid Xie
Qixiang who has worked for him since 1992. The 28 year-old from
Sichuan Province has proved to be a dedicated supporter and never
complains herself even when her monthly salary of 400 yuan is
delayed because Guobao can't afford it.
</P>
<P>
Such encouragement has made Guobao determined to make his
business boom again. "I'm determined never to become a burden to
anyone. I'm sure once I'm able to acquire modern equipment my
skills and hard work will see the business take off," said Guobao
confidently.

<HEADLINE> Aussie Economy Likely to Exceed 3.25 Pct Growth  Forecast: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian economy was likely
to exceed the Australian federal government's growth forecast of
3.25 percent in the current financial year but a period of slower
growth is at hand, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd (CBA)
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, CBA strategist Michael Blythe said that at the moment
"any significant slowing in overall activity looks unlikely before
mid year."
</P>
<P>
According to economic outlook published by CBA, one of the four
biggest banks in the country, economic growth in the current
financial year ending on June 30, 1999, would reach around 4.0
percent and step down to 2.75 percent in the upcoming financial
year.
</P>
<P>
The latest national accounts showed growth running at a 4.7-
percent pace over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Asian economic crisis, the Australian economy has
been performing quite well over the past year as one of the
fastest growing economies in the industrialized world as a result
of robust domestic demand and diversification of its export
markets other than Asia.
</P>
<P>
"But there is also now some clear evidence to support our
contention that a period of slower growth is at hand," Blythe
said.
</P>
<P>
He said one pointer to slower growth was the gap opening up
between production and income in the economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The drop in Australia's terms of trade caused by a rise in
import prices represented a significant reduction in the
purchasing power of households and businesses.
</P>
<P>
"So while output may have risen by 4.7 percent during 1998, the
purchasing power of the income generated by that production - or
gross domestic income - rose by only 3.6 percent," Blythe said.
</P>
<P>
"Slower income growth is typically ultimately reflected in
lower spending levels.
</P>
<P>
Blythe noted the success Australian exporters achieved by
diverting to markets other than Asia over the past year but said
the feat would be difficult to repeat over next year.
</P>
<P>
"The pace of economic activity in Europe has slowed and some
step down in the U.S. growth rate from its current rapid pace is
also likely," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are already some signs that exports to the U.S. and
Europe are weakening," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the upside, however, were positive signs emanating from some
Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
"At the very least, the rate of deterioration in these
economies is likely to slow this year," he said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Acrobatics School Established </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Acrobatics School, the
first of its kind in this capital city, was recently established
at the training center for the China Acrobatics Troupe.
</P>
<P>
Though China is well-known for its acrobatics, the country
previously had no school for professional training, and the common
practice was to employ experienced acrobats to teach apprentices
or to train novice acrobats at local art schools.
</P>
<P>
The newly built school covers an area of 38,000 square meters
and has advanced teaching facility. It is authorized to enroll 200
students from both domestic and overseas primary and middle
schools.
</P>
<P>
The school will offer specialties including acrobatics, magic,
and circus performances, and students will receive seven years of
systematic training along with general knowledge courses.
</P>
<P>
Lin Jian, head of the China Acrobatics Troupe, is acting as the
president of the school which already has enrolled its first 100
students, 20 of whom are from Russia.

<HEADLINE> Estrada: Reprieve to Convicts Aims to Ensure Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Wednesday the 90-day reprieve he has granted to three death
row convicts would give him time to review their plea for
executive clemency and ensure justice.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he needs time to look into the various aspects of
the case that may provide the grounds to commute the death
sentences of Dante Piandong, Jesus Morallos, and Archie Bulan.
</P>
<P>
"I am studying the case thoroughly so we can give justice to
all concerned, including the victim's family," he said in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
Estrada Tuesday granted a 90-day reprieve to the three men
convicted of killing a police officer in a robbery four years ago.
</P>
<P>
He announced the delay on the eve of the scheduled executions,
which would be the second in the Philippines in 23 years.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Estrada also said he would not hesitate
to send convicted rapists and drug pushers to the lethal injection
chamber.
</P>
<P>
He said the 90-day reprieve he granted to the three robbers is
not a precedent that will be followed for other death row
convicts, stressing that this move is not a sign that his
administration has softened its stand towards criminals.
</P>
<P>
"The criminals I am really mad at are rapists and drug
pushers," he said. "These kinds of criminals deserve no mercy,
especially drug pushers who destroy the future of our youth," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Economy Expected to Grow in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The macro economic strategy adopted
by Zambian government in this year's budget is expected to yield
positive results especially with the restoration of balance of
payment support (BOP), Zambian local newspapers reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Barclays Bank of Zambia acting managing
director Andy Fair as saying in Lusaka Tuesday that the continued
inflow of International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other financiers
for BOP will act as strong boosters to stabilize macro economic
indicators.
</P>
<P>
While launching the Barclays Budget Digest 1999, Fair said the
economy was likely to stabilize with a more stable exchange rate
which would lead to a drop in inflation.
</P>
<P>
Fair said the reduction of inflation and interest rates were
critical to the prospect of economic growth during 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Digest indicates that the expected positive movements in
the regional and world economic environments might also play a
major part in hoisting Zambia's economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the reduction of inflation to a single-digit level by
the end of medium term strategy 1999 to 2001 and the strengthening
of the country's external financial position were achievable as
long as global economic environment continued to impact positively
on the Zambia's economy.

<HEADLINE> EU Invites Tanzania to Meet Over Fish Imports Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
invited Tanzania to a meeting in Brussels next week to review a
fish trade ban imposed in late March.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Tanzanian Ministry of Natural Resources
and Tourism, and Chairman of the Lake Victoria Fish Processors
Association, Harko Bhagat, among others, will attend the meeting,
a local newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting will find out the best measures to address the
problem," the First Secretary of the EU delegation in Tanzania,
Ranieri Sabatuchi, told The Guardian here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On March 30, EU announced a total ban on fresh and frozen fish
imports from Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, following reports that
Uganda and Kenya recently restricted the sales of poisoned fish
from Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
Unscrupulous fishermen in the world's second largest freshwater
lake, which borders the three east African countries, have long
been blamed for using insecticides or explosives, to catch Nile
Perch and other fish, posing threats to health.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism, Zakia
Meghji, however, has said pollution of fish products in the lake
area on her country's side has been controlled after the defense
force, the police and her ministry launched a joint operation
against the illegal fishing practices.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania is confident that its fish is fit for human
consumption. We are ready for further tests by the European
Union," she said.
</P>
<P>
This is a second time for the EU to impose a ban on fish
imports from east African countries in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
In January last year, the EU froze imports of fresh fish
fillets from the three countries following an outbreak of cholera
in east Africa. The ban, which caused the three countries millions
of U.S. dollars of loss in exports, were not lifted until six
months later.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania earns some 85.6 million U.S. dollars from the fish
industry along the lake, providing 4,000 jobs.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe To Sell Ivory for First Time In 8 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will for the first time
sell its experimental 20-ton quota of raw elephant tusks to Japan
next Tuesday following the lifting of the eight-year ban on ivory
trade in June 1997, the daily Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ban was lifted at the 10th Convention of the Parties to the
 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
which was held in Harare in June, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The experimental trade will also take place in Botswana, which
will sell about 25.3 tons and Namibia which will dispose of its
13.8-ton stockpile Friday. The move will help the three southern
African countries generate more revenue for elephant conservation,
and improve the lives of people living alongside elephants.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters in Harare Tuesday, Zimbabwe's Minister of
Mines, Environment and Tourism Simon Moyo said as part of the
CITES conditions for the resumption of the sale of ivory, Zimbabwe
declared 33.4 tons of raw ivory.
</P>
<P>
Of that total, 20 tons were to be sold to Japan, 8.8 tons were
for the donor buy-out declaration, while 4.6 tons were for local
sales.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe had met all the stringent conditions set by
CITES as recorded by its verification team at the 41st Standing
Committee Meeting of February this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision by the CITES to transfer the African
elephant from Appendix one to Appendix two, which allows for
restricted trade in elephant products, ushered in a new chapter in
the sustainable use and development of wildlife resources.
</P>
<P>
The country has an elephant population of about 70,000, almost
double its carrying capacity.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Sends Relief Aid to Kosovo Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Wednesday sent 34 tonnes of
relief aid to refugees fleeing the war-torn Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The relief aid, which was flown to the Albanian capital of
Tirana, included 5.4 tonnes of medicines, 1,500 boxes of milk
powder, 500 boxes of canned foodstuffs and 1,000 blankets, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The aid was sent to Kosovars under an instruction of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak as a contribution of the Egyptian
government.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Kosovars have poured into Albania and
Mecedonia after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization launched
missile and air strikes against Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
NATO's attacks are aimed at forcing Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to sign a peace agreement, which requires Belgrade to
grant autonomy to the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and allow NATO to
deploy peacekeeping forces there.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Revolutionary Court Closes Moderate Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian revolutionary court on
Wednesday ordered the moderate Persian-language daily Zan (Women)
be closed until further notice.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Tehran revolutionary court Gholamhussein Rahbarpour
told the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) that the paper was
banned for publishing a letter of Farah Diba, the ousted Iranian
queen, on April 3 and a caricature making fun of "blood money" on
April 6.
</P>
<P>
Rahbarpour said the mere publication of Farah's message
on the new Iranian year (March 21) was a "blatant anti-revolutionary
act" and publicity for the "vicious" (monarchical) regime, which
was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
He also said publishing a caricature to ridicule blood money
-- money paid to the family of a murdered person as compensation
by the murderer, which is one of the main judicial and religious
principles of Islam, is considered as a direct insult.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said Faezeh Hashemi, managing director of the daily and
daughter of former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, has been
summoned twice in a week by the hard-line conservative
revolutionary court to give explanations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi told the editorial staff of the newspaper on Tuesday
night that she assumes responsibility for publishing the paper and
the caricature and that she has reasons for publishing each of
them.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the daily Zan was ordered to suspend publishing
for two weeks for violating relevant laws, but the daily rejected
the charges.
</P>
<P>
Faezeh Hashemi is a famous Iranian activist for women rights
and has close relations with the moderate party of Constructive
Executives of Iran headed by former Tehran mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi, who was sentenced to two-year imprisonment on graft
charges.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Zoo Puts Animals On Diet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese zoo has successfully
slimmed down a number of its obese animals by "persuading" them to
adopt a partially vegetarian diet.
</P>
<P>
In the past four months about a dozen tubby beasts, including
tigers, lions and leopards, in Hefei Zoo, in this capital of east
China's Anhui province, have been on a weight-watchers diet.
</P>
<P>
Although 80 percent of their food is meat, zookeepers
supplemented it with 20 percent of vegetables, which normally
carnivores won't eat.
</P>
<P>
"Obesity in captive animals is a problem facing zoos worldwide
because of the lack of exercise animals linked to a rich diet
mainly of meat," according Wu Zhi'an, head of Heifei's City Zoo's
general management section.
</P>
<P>
A real worry for zookeepers and anthropologists is that as a
result of this situation there are increasing numbers of animals
in captivity in declining health and there are also breeding
problems.
</P>
<P>
Hefei City Zoo has about 60 carnivorous animals, and now plans
to gradually introduce this diet for all of them.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Not Healthy Enough: Chinese Health Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Medical experts said that although
more and more Chinese are living longer, the elderly are now faced
with under-developed medical services which may greatly threaten
their health.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy in China now averages 70 years, but only 32.7
percent of the elderly men and 38.5 percent of the aged women are
healthy, according to the latest statistics provided by the Health
Ministry at a symposium today marking the World Health Day.
</P>
<P>
According to these statistics, high blood pressure, coronary
heart disease, diabetes, stroke, cancer, dementia in the elderly,
and osteoporosis are the major threats to elderly Chinese.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many old people suffer from blindness,
deafness and some movement-dysfunctional diseases. Other
statistics indicate that more than half of the disabled in China
are the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Health departments in all localities should go all out to
improve medical service and provide appropriate medical insurance
for old people, Vice Health Minister Wang Longde said.
</P>
<P>
China has the largest elderly population in the world, with 120
million people over 60 years of age, and nine million 80 years old
or more.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the number of elderly Chinese will reach
more than 400 million by the middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization has called for better health care
for the aging population, especially on this World Health Day
whose theme is "active aging."
</P>
<P>
The organization urges all of society and all families of the
world to care more about their elders.
</P>
<P>
Chinese health organizations plan to publicize health education
and opportunities for free medical services for the aging.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hedge Funds Expand Investments in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign hedge funds, encouraged by
signs of economic recovery in Thailand, are making a steady
comeback in the hope of good returns in the next three or four
years, business sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hedge funds are entering Thailand with their investment sizes
ranging from 700-800 million to 1 billion U.S. dollars, Suvarn
Valaisathien, an expert on business law, said.
</P>
<P>
He told a recent economic seminar that the funds are believed
to allocate about 50-60 million dollars for each acquisition.
</P>
<P>
Such foreign capital inflows are being witnessed for
investments both in the capital market and direct investment,
especially after the government announced a series of measures to
boost the embattled economy, according to Prasarn Trairatvorakul,
deputy secretary-general of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind the movement," he said in response to a question
on what happens if the funds stay in the country for only three to
four years.
</P>
<P>
It has been a common practice by hedge funds to flood any
crisis-stricken country to take advantage of cheap assets but flee
after making gains.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign investors have acquired stakes in local
companies. For instance, Holderbank of Switzerland has a majority
stake in Siam City Cement Plc while Jalaprathan Cement Plc
recently welcomed Cement Francais as a major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
Golden Land Property Development Plc also sold its new shares
to Quantum Fund of George Soros and Big C Supercenter Plc becomes
the latest local corporation to sell shares to Giant International
BV and Casino Guichard Pirrachor SA.
</P>
<P>
Many Thais regard foreign hedge funds as one of the factors
that led to the financial crisis as the funds try every means to
make profits at the sacrifices of others.
</P>
<P>
The sources attribute hedge funds' participation in Thailand to
cheap investment -- around 50 percent from peak prices in
1995-1997 -- with expected higher returns in the future. The
annual average returns is expected to stay at 30-40 percent. As
money-making funds, these investors will sell all stakes after
receiving attractive returns.
</P>
<P>
Vichai Punpocha, country manager of Dresdner Bank AG, said the
hedge funds, like other investors, could encounter investment
risks but it would be worth their while if the assets are
relatively cheap.
</P>
<P>
But it seems many hedge funds are nowadays speculating less on
foreign exchanges after they got their fingers badly burnt
following the crises in Russia and Brazil. They are allocating
more resources for longer-term investment purposes and Thailand is
one of the countries attracting such investment, market sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Many sectors in Thailand appeal to the funds. Hospitals are
very interesting to foreign investors, so are hotel and tourism
businesses, said the sources, who refused to be identified.
</P>
<P>
The types of investment could vary. Some are pure speculators
or venture capital companies, while others could hope to be
strategic partners.
</P>
<P>
These funds are seeking to gain stakes, via the rights issue
purchase, to acquire any company whose debt restructuring is now
under way and whose prospects are bright.
</P>
<P>
Corporate debt restructuring is expected to speed up
significantly thanks to the hedge funds' investment expansion,
some business sources maintained.
</P>
<P>
"But these funds are unlikely to take management control," one
source said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the hedge funds, which are under-regulated since their
major investment areas are overseas, are formed in the United
States where financiers are highly familiar with sophisticated
investment techniques. Many are managed by well-known financial
wizards such as Baton Biggs of Tiger Fund and George Soros of
Quantum Fund. Many financial companies, such as Goldman Saches and
Lehman Brothers, are also involved.

statistics released by the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
While presenting the budget for 1999-2000 just five weeks ago,
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha had estimated the government's
fiscal deficit for 1998-99 at 1,037.37 billion rupees
(approximately 24.7 billion U.S. dollars), or 6.5 percent of the
GDP.
</P>
<P>
Due to shortfall in revenue collection by over 50 billion
rupees (some 1.19 billion dollars) and capital receipts from the
disinvestment of the government's shares in the public sector
undertakings by around 30 billion rupees (714 million U.S.
dollars), the fiscal deficit from April 1, 1998, to March 31,
1999, is likely to touch 7 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Despite a substantial growth in the revenue collections last
month, the Finance Ministry said, it could not achieve its revised
estimate which had already scaled down to 1,443.28 billion rupees
(34.36 billion dollars) from the budget figure of 1,533.18 billion
rupees (36.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In its latest figures, the ministry estimated the total revenue
collection at 1,373.4 billion rupees (32.7 billion dollars), a
shortfall of around 70 billion rupees (1.66 billion dollars) to
meet the target.
</P>
<P>
However, a finance ministry spokesman said that this was only a
provisional figure and the ministry was confident of covering
another 20 billion rupees (476 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Using Overseas Funds for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural production in Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest China had enjoyed sustainable
and fast growth thanks to the use of overseas funds over the past
16 years.
</P>
<P>
By early this year, Xinjiang had used 49.48 million U.S.
dollars in overseas loans to help develop agriculture in addition
to overseas grants of 8.14 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang began using overseas funds to develop agriculture in
1983.
</P>
<P>
Now six farming technology spreading centers and seed stations
have been set up with the implementation of the first phase of the
World Bank-financed agricultural irrigation project in the Tarim
basin over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the project which involves 150 million
dollars is under way. Water control facilities, agricultural and
environmental projects will be built in 22 counties and cities in
southern Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the European Union (EU) has given free aid to
Xinjiang totaling 4.5 million dollars to help raise agricultural
output. The EU has also offered technical know-how, instrument and
training services for Chinese technicians.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Welcomes Suspension of U.N. Sanctions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government welcomed a
U.N. decision to lift sanctions on Libya following the hand-over
of two suspects of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, Jordan Times
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib described the
hand-over as a positive step taken by Libya to cooperate with the
world community to solve the case of Lockerbie bombing, which
triggered sanctions by the United Nations on Libya in 1992, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans were believed to be responsible for the bombing
of a Pan American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 which
killed 270 people. The United States and Britain had demanded that
Libya hand over the two for trial before a group of Scottish judges
in the Netherlands under Scottish laws.
</P>
<P>
Khatib said the Jordanian government was looking forward to
seeing a formal and complete ending of sanctions on Libya
following the hand-over of the two suspects.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Condemns Israeli Expulsion of Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
has strongly condemned Israel's "barbaric" practices against
Lebanese civilians expelled by Israeli forces from their homes in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's systematic barbaric practices violate international
conventions and the most basic human rights on a daily basis," the
Daily Star Wednesday quoted Lahoud as saying.
</P>
<P>
The practices are also a flagrant violation of the 1996
agreement between the Jewish state and Lebanese guerrillas group
Hezbollah which stipulates no targeting of civilians in their
confrontations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was brokered by the United States in April, 1996
to end a 16-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon in which nearly 200
Lebanese, mostly civilians, were killed.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Israeli forces expelled 25 Lebanese residents from
their village of Shebaa in the eastern sector of the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The expulsion came in response to Monday's desertion by four
militiamen of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
Most of the deported are relatives of the four defectors who
reportedly sneaked out of Shebaa through the hills at dawn and
turned themselves in to the Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Israeli forces arrested a number of SLA
officers from Haasbaya district, about 10 kilometers north of
Shebaa, and took them to the Israeli forces' south Lebanon command
in Marjayoun for interrogation over the desertion.
</P>
<P>
There are currently nearly 2,500 SLA members, who are helping
Israeli forces patrol its occupied border zone in south Lebanon
and handling the security affairs in Jezzine, a predominantly
Christian town facing the zone.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen were considered as traitors in Lebanon and its
commander Antonie Lahd has been sentenced to death in absentia by
a Lebanese military court.
</P>
<P>
Amid mounting speculation that Israeli forces may conduct a
unilateral partial withdrawal from south Lebanon, the SLA's morale
is sinking and more members are defecting to the Lebanese
government in a bid to escape a reprisals afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli occupation forces and its ally SLA out of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Feature: A Cornered Tiger Who Still Fights (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- For over three decades, paraplegic
Liu Guobao has been forced to lie flat on his stomach unable to
take even short steps or sit upright in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
Yet from his bed, from where he eats, sleeps and works, in his
simply furnished home, he has also been running for many years a
once booming printing business despite his handicap.
</P>
<P>
Because of his meticulous efforts and high standards, the
Mingyuan (meaning: bright prospect for tomorrow) Name-card
Printing House which he launched in 1985, has won him recognition
far and wide. Among his clients are senior-ranking government
officials, famous local artists, foreign diplomats and both
Chinese and foreign business people. On two occasions he was
selected as a model self-employed entrepreneur in Beijing's Xuanwu
District where he lives and works.
</P>
<P>
But now, after years of struggling to make a living rather than
be a burden on his family, more misfortune is piling on the
heavily-built shoulders of Guobao, as he battles to compete with
modern printing technology such as laser composing and offset
printing.
</P>
<P>
At 49 years of age Liu Guobao has found that his outdated
letterpress printing technique has been replaced by computer aided
equipment which he simply cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
According to him, orders have fallen sharply and his monthly
turnover has been reduced to a few hundred yuan from its heyday of
over 4,000 yuan (482 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Even his old printing blocks need to be replaced but nobody
makes them anymore. He had saved hard to buy new equipment and
even gave up his 30-year-long smoking habit, one of his few
pleasures, but again disaster struck when in 1997 he caught
pyelitis and cystitis, as a result of his condition. He had to use
all his savings for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
A fighter to the end Guobao has pleaded for bank loans but no
avail, since he has no collateral to back up his request.
</P>
<P>
However, Mr. Liu is determined to try and overcome these
problems and he is encouraged by a calligraphy artwork which hangs
on the wall of his home which features four bold and vigorous
Chinese characters which in English mean: "A Cornered Tiger Who
Still Fights."
</P>
<P>
It is actually dedicated to Liu Guobao personally, who was born
in the year of the Tiger in 1950, and presented to him by renowned
Beijing calligrapher Bo Tao in praise of his courageous struggle
for survival in the face of almost impossible odds.
</P>
<P>
This is now Guobao's motto although he admits, despite always
putting on a happy face, that he does feel uncertain about his
future unless he can find someone or some organization to help him
reestablish his business.
</P>
<P>
He never complains about his condition and has such a passion
for work that his friends and family are convinced he would have
become a hugely successful businessman if not for his disability.
</P>
<P>
His story really is one of tremendous courage in the face of
adversity, just as Bo Tao has indicated.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Oil Firms Review Petroleum Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The retail prices of petroleum
products in Kenya are set to go up following the price increase
announced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Corporation (Adnoc), the main
supplier of oil to the African country, according to local
industry sources here.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Adnoc had pegged March's crude oil price at
12. 75 U.S. dollars per barrel, an increase of nearly 25 percent
over February' s 10.25 dollars, the East African Standard
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Executives of oil marketing firms in Nairobi said the retail
prices of petroleum products would be adjusted upward to a hike
of 2.5 dollars from the Adnoc oil supplier.
</P>
<P>
They said the oil firms had gone back to the drawing boards to
compute margins of pump price increment based on the hike of cost
for crude oil, Kenyan shilling and dollar exchange rate and cost
of transport among other factors.
</P>
<P>
The pump price increment is expected to trigger a wave of
inflationary pressure as the cost of transport constitutes a
large proportion of the final cost of oil products, the sources
noted.
</P>
<P>
To bolster crude prices to higher levels, members of the
Organization of

Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reduced production by 1.7
million barrels per day and 400,000 barrels for no members,
effective last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director J. Segman of the Kenol/Kobil, a major oil
firm in Kenya, said last week a hike of one shilling to 1.5
shillings per liter is expected soon, and other firms said it was
inevitable due to international market trend.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that the increased cost of crude oil will be
passed on to consumers, in order to ensure continued supply of oil
products.

<P>
Born into an ordinary worker's family in Beijing Liu Guobao is
the eldest of five children and as a young man was a bright
student full of ideals and ambitions. He dreamed of becoming a
soldier to defend his motherland or a sportsman determined to win
for his country.
</P>
<P>
But fate played its part when at only 15 years of age his young
dreams were shattered. On January 6, 1965 he was taking part in a
physical training class in Beijing's No 41 Middle School when he
suddenly felt a severe pain in his spine. He was diagnosed with
myelitis. In desperation his parents took him to a dozen hospitals
in the capital but was told by all the medical experts that he
would never stand upright again.
</P>
<P>
The news made Liu Guobao desperate and the though that he would
become a burden on his already financially strained family, and
the society in general, almost drove him to madness. Secretly he
began to collect sleeping pills, planning to commit suicide. But
as he reflected on his loving parents and family and how they
would be heart-broken at such an act, he soon abandoned this
notion.
</P>
<P>
At this time, China was pitched into the devastating "Cultural
Revolution" and even normal children were deprived of an education,
schools were closed down and books burnt.
</P>
<P>
This was when Guobao had his first stroke of luck when his
younger brother brought him dozens of famous Chinese and foreign
books which he had rescued from a burning pit in a nearby school.
The family could never have afforded to buy them in normal times
and they helped young Guobao become an avid reader. The books, he
says, gave him the courage to fight for his survival the best way
he could.
</P>
<P>
Then in 1968 his father, the family's only bread winner, died
of sudden illness. From that time on Guobao, as the eldest son,
vowed to learn enough skills to support the family. His
determination and will power impressed the famous Chinese figure
painter Zhao Shizhen and his colleague Aisin Giorro Shu Heng, the
well-known landscape painter, and they took on the then 23-year-
old Guobao as a student in May 1973.
</P>
<P>
By that time his physical condition had deteriorated and he
wasn't able to use a wheelchair. In order to learn how to paint he
had to first learn to lie flat on his stomach which was very
difficult and often made him feel sick. But he persevered and his
mother tucked in a large cushion to help relieve the stress on his
stomach.
</P>
<P>
For hours and hours Guobao practiced his painting skills, often
refusing meals. On one occasion while painting a difficult
traditional figure, at the request of his teachers, he carried on
for 24 hours without a break, which was another indication of his
determination to succeed.
</P>
<P>
His efforts paid off and on June 10, 1973, he was offered a
temporary job by a local arts and crafts factory and from that day
on gave up his government disability allowance. This, he declares,
was his second birthday.

<HEADLINE> China Tightening Urban Trash Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China plans to increase the urban
garbage treatment capacity and to make an effort to hold the
amount of urban trash to 180 million tons by next year, according
to Zhu Guangyao, the deputy-director of the State Environmental
Protection Administration.
</P>
<P>
Daily urban garbage treatment capacity will be increased to 170,
000 tons, or 50 percent of the total. The treatment is expected to
be environmentally-friendly. Zhu told a recent symposium that the
amount of urban garbage in China has increased rapidly in the past
decade, but treatment has been hampered by a lack of funds,
mismanagement, and backward techniques.
</P>
<P>
Zhu has asked government departments to encourage enterprises
to develop treatment technology and facilities with preferential
policies and funds.
</P>
<P>
China had 666 cities in 1997. They produce 440 kilograms of
garbage per capita each year and random disposal methods have
caused large amounts of land to be wasted and have caused serious
air, river, lake, and ground water pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
Trash dumps on 500 million square meters of land currently
encircle more than 200 Chinese cities, according to an earlier
report by Science Times.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Armed Forces Pledges to Prevent Clash in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Commander of the Indonesian
National Armed Forces (TNI), Gen. Wiranto, has ordered security
personnel to prevent East Timor from inter-group clashing.
</P>
<P>
TNI and the Police Department will take strict measures to
restore law enforcement as well as human rights and public order
in East Timor, Wiranto said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pro-independence groups of the Timorese Struggle Council (CNRT)
and its military wing Timor Leste National Armed Forces
(Falintil), led by jailed Alexander Xanana Gusmao, has declared
war against the Indonesian government and TNI, who have allegedly
been arming pro-integrationist group.
</P>
<P>
Xanana on Monday abruptly abandoned his ceasefire and told East
Timorese to take up arms against Indonesian rule following a clash
in East Timor Liquica district over the weekend during which 17
pro-independence supporters were reportedly killed and two
pro-integrationist East Timorese were stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
Twelve houses were damaged and burned in the clashes in
Liquica, about 38 kilometers west of East Timor's capital of Dili,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Xanana said he will revoke his call to arms only if the United
Nations send its peace-keeping forces to disarm the militia in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975,
it became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the U.N. never
recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, the Indonesian government announced that it is
ready to release East Timor if the alternative to provide wider
autonomy is refused by people in the region and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has suggested that the U.N.-sponsored
direct balloting to determine if the East Timor wants autonomy or
independence should be held in July this year.

<HEADLINE> Churches Built by Germans to Reopen in Qingdao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A Protestant church and a Catholic
church, both built here by Germans early this century, are
scheduled to reopen to tourists here on May 1.
</P>
<P>
The churches, located downtown in the coastal city of Qingdao
in east China's Shandong Province, have been closed for repairs
since March 1.
</P>
<P>
The renovation project will cost some 4.19 million yuan, and
major repairs include interior decoration, replacement of a number
of statues, installation of new windows, as well as the
restoration of other facilities.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time repairs have been made on the churches
since 1949. The first was in 1980, before they were reopened after
being shut down for a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao became an open port at the end of the last century when
a great many foreigners from the United States, Germany, Britain
and other countries came to live in the city, and the two churches
were specially built for them.

<HEADLINE> Experts Suggest Eggs and Milk Better for Breakfast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Many Chinese schoolchildren are
suffering from malnutrition according to the results of a recent
survey which indicated they have an unbalanced diet.
</P>
<P>
Chinese nutritionists now believe that eggs and milk are the
better and more suitable food for everyday breakfast, Guangming
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
A nutritious breakfast provides sufficient energy and fulfils
parts of people's basic daily calorific needs, according to Liu
Liren, a nutritionist from east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the improved living standards of Chinese
residents many neglect breakfast, which nutritionists says is the
most important meal of the day.
</P>
<P>
Calcium-rich milk and eggs are very easy to absorb, the
nutritionists believe.
</P>
<P>
City residents need only spend one yuan (12 U.S. cents) on a
bottle of milk and six yuan for a kilogram of eggs, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
It seems that most Chinese people eat porridge every morning
and pickles, which lack calorie and nutritious elements, it said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the China milk industry association indicated
that each Chinese person drinks 6.6 kilograms of milk on average
every year, a very tiny amount compared to the world per capita of
102 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Experts warned, however, that some people in inland provinces
favor alcohol much more than milk.

<P>
NICOSIA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides said Tuesday night both Greece and Cyprus are concerned
over developments in Yugoslavia and underline the need to insist
on the inviolability of borders.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his return from Athens where he met his Greek
counterpart George Papandreou and Alternate Foreign Minister,
Yiannos Kranidiotis, Kasoulides said he is concerned over the
possibility of creating a precedent in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cyprus News Agency (CNA), Kasoulides has
pointed out that neither the bombings nor the brutalities
carried out against the people of Yugoslavia, especially the
Albanians, will help the situation in the area.
</P>
<P>
He said a political and diplomatic solution should be reached
within the boundaries of Yugoslavia, just as any solution to the
Cyprus issue should be within the island's shores.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said Cyprus relies on the U.N. Charter,
U.N. resolutions and international law, "which are now under
trial in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia, which started on March
24, are causing both military and civilian ccasualties. The
western alliance hoped the air strikes could force Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to agree to a peace deal with
separatist ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the
population in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Kosovo refugee crisis worsened as more ethnic
Albanians streamed into neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM Denies Application for GCC membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Raouf
Rawabdeh Tuesday night denied reports that his country has applied
to join the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to strengthen ties
with the oil-rich Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Jordan TV, Rawabdeh said the issue was
neither discussed nor on the agenda during Jordanian King Abdullah
Bin Hussein's just-concluded three-day visit to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The London-based newspaper Al Quds Al Arabi said in its Monday
edition that King Abdullah will officially inform Saudi officials
of Jordan's desire to join the GCC later this year.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted senior Arab sources as saying Saudi
Arabia has initially agreed to Jordan's request.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, which was founded in 1981 to boost regional
cooperation, now groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain
and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah wrapped up his three-day visit to Saudi Arabia
Tuesday night, and Rawabdeh has termed the monarch's talks with
Saudi leaders as "highly successful."
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia was the largest donor to Jordan prior to the 1990
Gulf crisis triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but Riyadh
suspended its annual economic aid of some 200 million dollars
after Jordan was found to be siding with Iraq during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's visit to Riyadh was part of his effort to rally
support in the Arab world for the stagnant economy of his desert
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
A busy diplomatic agenda in April will also take the Jordanian
ruler to Syria, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and other
countries to discuss bilateral ties and regional issues.

<HEADLINE> Urbanization Expanding in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China expects to have a total
urban population of 630 million and an urbanization rate of 45
percent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Vigorous local economic growth has led to the emergence of city
groups nationwide, according to Chen Xiaoli, director of Urban and
Rural Development Planning Department under the Ministry of
Construction.
</P>
<P>
Chen added that most city groups are concentrated in the
Yangtze and Pearl river deltas, as well as on the Liaodong
Peninsula and in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that China has so far established 666
cities, including 32 cities with populations of over one million
each. Forty-three cities have populations ranging from 500,000 to
one million, 192 medium-sized cities with a population of 200,000
to 500,000 and 399 small cities with less than 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that rapid urbanization has to a certain degree
improved the uneven distribution of cities between eastern and
western China. The former region accounts for 44 percent and the
latter 19 percent of the total number of cities.
</P>
<P>
The official mentioned the fact that because even more cities
are under development in the vast western region this will help to
improve economic development nationwide.

<HEADLINE> EDS: Update with Political analysts hke040723 --  Sri Lanka's Ruling Party Wins All Five Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Ruling People's
Alliance (PA) Wednesday has won all five provincial councils
unexpectedly in the bitterly contested elections that were seen as
a test of popularity for the government and the president.
</P>
<P>
The Elections Commissioner announced that the PA scored victory
in Tuesday's voting in the provinces of Western, Central, North
Central, Uva and Sabaragamuwa, winning 46.25 percent votes or 120
seats plus 10 bonus seats out of 273 seats.
</P>
<P>
The results showed that the main opposition United National
Party (UNP) had given the PA a tough fight in most voting
districts.
</P>
<P>
The UNP got 43.48 percent votes or 112 seats.
</P>
<P>
The third largest party People's Liberation Front gained 5.46
percent votes or 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here had predicted the PA would won two or
three provinces but never expected an overall victory.
</P>
<P>
The surprise victory will probably encourage the government of
President Chandrika Kumaratunga to put forward presidential and
parliamentary elections due next year, they said.
</P>
<P>
Election officials said some 69 percent of the estimated 7.1
million voters had cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
At least two people was killed in poll-related violence on
Tuesday as the private Center for Monitoring Election Violence
reported several incidents of assaults, intimidation and electoral
malpractice towards the end of voting.
</P>
<P>
The government deployed 35,000 policemen to guard polling
booths and ensure security at counting centers where 60,000
officials were engaged in counting.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The air passenger market recorded
another month of moderate growth for the Association of
Asia-Pacific Airlines (AAPA) members in November 1998, the
Philippines News Agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
AAPA was quoted as saying that it was the third consecutive
month that air passenger traffic had increased and reflected an
improving business climate.
</P>
<P>
Revenue passenger kilometers grew 3.0 percent and passengers
carried rose 2.3 percent during the period, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the results of the financially-troubled Philippine
Airlines, the consolidated AAPA results for November showed a more
robust traffic growth of 6.1 percent and a 5.1 percent rise in
passengers carried, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
With a few exceptions, the effects of the Asian financial
crisis appear to have bottomed out for most of the AAPA members,
it said.
</P>
<P>
As a summary, improved passenger traffic for three successive
months appears to support the observation that the travel industry
in the region is on the mend, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Cement Exports May Reach 11 Mln Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia saw over a 450 percent
increase in its cement exports in 1998 and this trend is likely to
continue this year as most local cement producers have shifted
their focus to overseas markets, the Jakarta Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to data from the Ministry of Trade and Industry,
cement exports rose to 4.5 million tons in 1998 from 800,000 tons
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
This year, cement exports are projected to increase to some 11
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Cement exports could exceed 11 million tons this year because
of an increase in orders received by local producers, said Peter
Sampe, a senior official at the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Poor transportation and loading facilities have been the most
common problems hampering producers' ability to meet overseas
orders, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the country's total cement production dropped to 22.3
million tons from 27.5 million tons the previous year due to a
sharp decline in demand for the commodity on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Last year's total cement production was only about 55 percent
of the industry's production capacity.
</P>
<P>
Peter said production was expected to increase to 33.2 million
tons this year to meet the projected rise in demand from both
overseas and local markets.
</P>
<P>
About 11 million tons of the projected cement output would be
exported while the remainder would be sold domestically, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian cement currently is sold for between 22 and 24 U.S.
dollars per ton in bulk, he said, adding that the price is
expected to rise to 26 U.S. dollars per ton in bulk in the second
quarter.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Re-negotiate Military Presence in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress is planning
to re-negotiate with the new Panamanian government on establishing
a permanent presence at the U.S. military base in the country
after the year 2000, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Bush, a legislator of the ruling Democratic
Revolutionary Party (DRP), was quoted by the press as saying the
negotiations are being encouraged because of the possibility of a
lack of cooperation after the May 2 elections by the Panamanian
government in the fight against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the drugs which flow into the United States
reportedly come from Columbia and go through the Panamanian
province of Colon on the Atlantic coast, which has caused concern
and encouraged the U.S. to seek re-negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian parliament has warned that it may be necessary
to form an elite military group to halt the flow of drugs, or else
there could be a change in the local situation that could be
dangerous to Panamanian society."
</P>
<P>
According to the treaties Torrijos-Kater signed in 1977, the
United States must withdraw their troops before the year 2000 and
return the canal to Panama.
</P>
<P>
The two countries previously negotiated the formation of a "
multinational anti-drug center," (MAC) to continue the fight
against drug-trafficking after the withdrawal of the U.S. troops
from the canal.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, which lasted almost two years, failed last
year because of differing opinions on the role of the MAC.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States has asked for an opportunity to re-
negotiate on the permanent presence of U.S. military bases in
Panama after the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Natural Chinese Sturgeon Spawning Ground Found in Hubei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A natural spawning ground of Chinese
sturgeon on the Yangtze River has calmed fears that the damming of
the river's upper reaches could harm the breeding of the rare fish.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sturgeon is considered a living fossil that is a
survival from the age of dinosaurs. It is on the verge of
extinction and has been given special State protection.
</P>
<P>
The rare fish spawns by swimming upstream and the damming of
the river's Gazhouba section was thought to have block the
spawning route.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yong, the head of a Chinese Sturgeon Research Center in
Hubei Province, says that the natural breeding ground was found
downstream near the dam, where the flow is gentle and temperatures
fluctuate little. A 200-km. section on the middle reaches near the
spawning spot has good conditions for breeding and many fish
species that were thought to inhabit only the upper reaches could
adapt easily adapt to life there, Liu says.
</P>
<P>
The government of the city of Yichang has increased protection
for the breeding ground and introduced a ban on fishing here and
the Hubei research center has hatched 3.9 million of the fish to
add to the river over the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Introduces Tax Relief Measure for Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar Ministry of Finance and
Revenue has introduced a fresh measure of tax relief to cope with
the increasing number of sale of properties developed by the
country's housing and municipal authorities.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at drawing more buyers for the land, buildings,
warehouses and apartments developed by the Department of Human
Settlement and Housing Development (DHSHD), the Yangon City
Development Committee and construction entrepreneurs, developers
are being advised to fix five percent more than the price for the
properties, while buyers shall not be subject to scrutiny over the
money paid for the properties.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the Myanmar Business News, published by the
Myanmar Chamber of Commerce and Industry, quoted a recent
notification of the ministry as saying that buyers, on their part,
are to transfer the five percent extra charge to the township
Internal Revenue Department concerned within a month after
transactions are carried out.
</P>
<P>
Previously, buyers are subject to scrutiny over the source of
their income as required by Myanmar's tax laws, having to pay due
tax for the amount for which they cannot declare the source.
</P>
<P>
The new measure introduced has affected removal of the worry of
the buyers, the Business News said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Myanmar government has been implementing
schemes of housing, land-plot development and slum area upgrading
in cooperation with the private construction enterprises in order
to ensure town and city development and also to raise the living
standard of the people.
</P>
<P>
In 1997-98 fiscal year, 318,846 land plots in 16 townships,
including five newly-established ones in Yangon where industrial
zones lie, have been developed by the DHSHD, registering an
increase of 8,831 plots as compared to 310,015 plots in the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian House Ratifies Anti-Discrimination Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House of
Representatives (DPR) has passed a bill on the ratification of the
1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Racial Discrimination.
</P>
<P>
In a plenary session here on Tuesday, the House of
Representatives unanimously endorsed the bill on the ratification
of the convention for President B.J. Habibie to sign into a new
law.
</P>
<P>
The ratification requires the government to, among other
things, scrap all its racial discriminatory policies, which mostly
target Chinese-Indonesian rather than descents of other migrant
groups, the Jakarta Post said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The four House factions, through their respective spokesmen,
agreed that racism must be stamped out.
</P>
<P>
While supporting the anti-racism law, the Indonesian Democratic
Party faction called on the government to revoke a 1967
presidential decree on the Religion, Beliefs and Customs of the
Chinese, because it tends to muzzle the traditions of the nation's
ethnic Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Chinese have repeatedly complained about rampant
discriminatory practices that systematically treat them as
second-class citizens. Their identity cards bear special codes,
and careers in the military and bureaucracy are virtually closed
to them.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Golkar Party faction Karsidi said human
rights are basic rights possessed by human beings, irrespective of
ethnicity or skin color, and universal in nature.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces spokesman Isnawan advised the government to
revoke any law that oppose the international convention as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Hadimulyo of the United Development Party said the enactment of
the convention is part of Indonesia's effort to enforce and uphold
human rights which had so far been ignored.
</P>
<P>
All four factions of the House were all united in hoping that
the ratification would lay the foundation for promotion of
equality for all.
</P>
<P>
To follow up on its implementation, Minister of Justice Muladi
said a team would soon be assigned to evaluate all laws that might
be affected by the ratification.
</P>
<P>
All existing laws that went against the ratified convention
would be abolished and new ones would be made accordingly, Muladi
said in his statement welcoming the ratification.

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 lakes in one county
of northwest China's Qinghai Province that is located at the
source of the Yellow River have dried up because of the
deteriorating environment and lack of rain.
</P>
<P>
The water level of other lakes in the area has dropped 2 to 3
meters on average, according to the county government and
ecologists are calling for immediate measures to protect the
environment at the source of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Mado County covers a 25,000-sq.km. area and originally had 4,
077 lakes that were more than a sq.km., but some of the smaller
ones that used to dot the grassland and river valleys have dried
up and the water level in 2 of the largest have reportedly dropped
more than 3 m. and in the 253-sq.km. Heihai it is down 3 m. and
its shoreline has shrunk 30 m.
</P>
<P>
About 1.6 million ha. of grasslands, or 70 percent of the
county's total, has deteriorated as well, affecting the local
animal husbandry, which once gave the county's herdsmen the
highest per capita income in the country.

Qinghai's section of the Yellow River is 1,694 km. long and its
annual average outflow accounts for half the river's total. But
the river's water in the province has decreased 23 percent since
the late 1980s, according to Lu Houyu, a member of the Qinghai
Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, who has just finished a study of the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The river has been drying up more frequently in certain
sections and for longer periods than when it was reported along
the lower reaches in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has a program to plant more trees at
the sources of the Yellow and Yangtze rivers to increase the water
storage of the soil and the Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Youth League, the State Forestry Administration, and the
China Youth Development Foundation have sponsored a "Protecting
Mother Rivers" project.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say that there is still a long way to go
before the ecology at the source of the rivers can be restored and
restoring the lakes that have dried up in Mado County is very
difficult, they say.

that is believed to have been built during the Warring States
period (475-221 B.C.) has been discovered in Yulin Prefecture in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>

This shows that the section was built by the state of Qin, one
of the small states of the Warring States period, and not by the

The Great Wall starts at Zhenbeitai in the northern part of the
prefecture and runs in a northeasterly direction to Guizi, about 3
km. east of Yulin.
</P>
<P>
It runs parallel to a section of the Wall that is believed to
have been built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) at a distance
of 400 m.

</P>
<P>
The September meeting discussed the enhancement of intra-ASEAN
trade and investment, activities of the ASEAN CCI and effective
communications with each national chamber among others.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was also reached at the meeting that members'
annual contribution fees of 1998-99 could be settled in the
respective ASEAN currency based on the current monetary exchange
rate in view of the then economic downturn as well as to reduce
reliance on the U.S. dollar.

The MCCI plays a key role in bringing about foreign investment
in Myanmar. Up to the end of 1998, five ASEAN member countries --
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand --
injected in Myanmar 3.7 billion U.S. dollars in 146 projects,
accounting for 52.3 percent of the 7.08-billion-dollar total
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's trade with the five member countries totaled 1.94
billion dollars in 1998, accounting for 49 percent of the
country's total foreign trade volume in the year, according to a
latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the MCCI is cooperating with companies based in
ASEAN member countries to implement an ASEAN Industrial
Cooperation Scheme, aimed at improving industries in the Southeast
Asia region.

In addition to two ASEAN member countries of Singapore and
Thailand, the MCCI, a member also of the Paris-based

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Elite Force Members Jailed for Abductions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's military court Tuesday
sentenced 11 Army's Special Force (Kopassus) soldiers between one
year and 22 months in jail for abducting nine political activists
when former president Soeharto was in power, local leading
newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The panel of judges, presided over by Col. Susanto, said that
defendants were guilty of "collectively depriving freedom" of the
activists.
</P>
<P>
The judges sentenced the highest-ranking defendant Maj. Bambang
Kristiono to 22 months imprisonment and fired him from the Armed
Forces (ABRI).
</P>
<P>
Susanto said the defendants, who had been involved in a number
of military operations in the country's trouble spots of Aceh,
Irian Jaya and East Timor, had tarnished the image of ABRI and
Kopassus in particular.
</P>
<P>
The defendants have been arrested since mid-July 1998 and
placed under house arrest since March 16 following the end of
their maximum detention period.
</P>
<P>
Bambang had told the military court that he had established a
"Rose Team" within Kopassus in July 1997 to arrest "radical
activists" who he said were trying to sabotage the General Session
of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) in March last year.
</P>
<P>
However, one of nine former abduction victims, Pius
Lustrilanang, said he had not believed in the trial since it
started, "because (former president) Soeharto and top military
officers who are the most responsible parties for the abductions
are not brought to court."
</P>
<P>
The nine were among 23 activists who were abducted by
unidentified men since April 1997. They reported torture but this
was not mentioned in the trial.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen other are still listed missing. The association of
relatives of missing persons said Monday that they will continue
to seek the truth of their missing members.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the abductions, the defendants were under the
command of Soeharto's son-in-law Prabowo Subianto.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo was discharged from the military last year while two
other senior Kopassus officers were also released from active duty
for their alleged involvement in the abductions.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Violent Clashes Continue in Some Areas of Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- More violence shook the Maluku
town of Tual and the West Kalimantan town of Singkawang in
Indonesia on Tuesday, claiming at least five lives, the Jakarta
Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Warring groups in Tual, some 540 kilometers southeast of the
Maluku provincial capital of Ambon, continued their clashes.
</P>
<P>
Aka Roroa, a member of the riot monitoring post at Al Huria
Mosque in Tual, said four people died of gunshot wounds after
police opened fire on a group of Muslim youths attempting to
attack a Christian neighborhood. Another 17 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Paulus Wadaubun died on Monday night of stab wounds
to his stomach suffered during a clash on Thursday last week.
</P>
<P>
The latest fatalities bring the death toll in Maluku in the
last few days to over 55.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Muslims and Christians erupted in Tual
following the discovery of graffiti defaming Islam in Wearhir on
March 28. The violence broke out just as Maluku was beginning to
recover from sectarian clashes which killed nearly 200 people in
Ambon.
</P>
<P>
There were no signs of business or social activities in Tual as
of Tuesday, Roroa said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in West Kalimantan's Sambas regency, renewed ethnic
violence pitting Malays and Dayaks against Madurese resumed in the
early hours of Monday, after over a week of calm.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported in the violence which erupted in
the village of We Sungai Bulan, Singkawang.
</P>
<P>
The violence reportedly involved hundreds of villagers from the
districts of Selkau, Tebas and Pemangkat who attacked Madurese
taking refuge in Singkawang. Over a dozen houses were burned
during the attack.
</P>
<P>
According to West Kalimantan Police Chief Col. Chaerul Rasyidi,
the attackers apparently were attempting to expel the Madurese
from the regency, which saw more than 200 people killed during the
recent unrest.
</P>
<P>
The police had detained 56 people suspected of being involved
in the clash, Chaerul was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.

<HEADLINE> Technology Helping Customs Officers In Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers in the city of
Zhuhai in south China's Guangdong Province have been using high-
tech devices in their crackdown on land and sea smuggling, today's
overseas edition of the People's Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech system has so far helped thwart more than 330
cases of smuggling by ship, valued at more than 177 million yuan (
21 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Customs officers in the city's Gongbei district first developed
a computerized anti-smuggling system using telecommunications
equipment, radar-tracking, and other electronic devices to improve
the means of telecommunications and shorten the amount of time
needed to confirm suspected targets.
</P>
<P>
To uncover smugglers from among the endless line of motor
vehicles and containers crossing the border at Gongbei, Customs
officers use large electronic scales. One customs officer found a
cardboard box that was especially heavy and discovered 75,000
pirated discs inside when he examined it.
</P>
<P>
Customs officers have also developed a mathematical model for
picking out smugglers from the line of people passing through with
the analytical help of the computerized system. It also means that
ordinary passengers can avoid unnecessary checks.
</P>
<P>
The system helped customs officers discover more than 150 cases
of smuggling in the past year while reducing the number of
officers needed from 57 to 21.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Direct Investment Drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment approved
by the Indonesian government in the first quarter of this year
plunged almost 90 percent to 560 million U.S. dollars from 5.1
billion dollars during the same period last year, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
Licensed foreign investment projects fell to 187 from 304 from
January to March 15, Antara News Agency Wednesday quoted State
Minister of Investment Hamzah Haz as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, only 36 domestic investment projects had been
approved during the said period of 1999, a decline of 64.4 percent
compared to 91 projects in 1998, said the minister Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, in terms of value, Hamzah said, the domestic
investment projects increased by 217 percent to 53.7 billion
rupiah (6.1 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"But, not all the approved projects have been realized by their
investors," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report from the investors, the
realization of their projects have been very slow, reaching only
35 percent as the result of lack of money, decline in natural
resources, low worker skills, lack of technology, and marketing
problems.
</P>
<P>
"However, although the realization of foreign and domestic
investment had been low, their contribution to the growth of
non-oil and gas exports has been quite significant," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that in the current prolonged economic
crisis, many companies have stopped operating, while others went
on realizing their projects.

<HEADLINE> City Sculptures Carve out Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Excited is the right word to
describe Wang Jinghui and Chen Shengzheng in the light of their
animated discussions on the national urban sculpture designs
exhibition "Hope of the New Century", China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to see so many ingenious designs," said Chen,
a professor at the Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
He was one of the main forces in the creation of the group of
sculptures in front of Beijing Agricultural Exhibition Hall. These
sculptures won the Best Design Prize in China's first urban
sculpture design contest in 1987, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Wang, chief planner at the China Urban Planning and Design
Institute, said he was "inspired" to find China's urban sculpture
designs had progressed so well over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
"The exhibition contains the very latest gems of urban
sculptures from all over the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The five-day exhibition, which closed yesterday in Beijing,
boasted more than 120 models of urban sculptures, large sculptures
intended to be placed outdoors. The selection was whittled down
from over 700 submissions, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the development of urban sculpture in China, Chen
divided this century into two halves - the country's once-splendid
art of urban sculpture was on the decline before 1949, while it
has been on the upswing since then.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (16) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Following is Part 16 of a question
and answer series of the ABCs of the Basic Law of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Why can the MSAR use its own regional flag and regional emblem?
</P>
<P>
Display and use of the regional flag and regional emblem by
MSAR is provided in Article 10 of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
This article highlights the high degree of autonomy enjoyed by
the MSAR and facilitates its conduct of external exchanges.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 13 and Chapter 7 of the Basic Law, the
MSAR may, with the authorization of the Central People's
Government, conduct its own extensive external affairs in
accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the MSAR may, on its own, using the name "Macao,
China", maintain and develop relations and conclude and implement
agreements with foreign states and regions and relevant
international organizations in appropriate fields, including those
in the economic, trade, financial, monetary, shipping,
communications, tourism, culture, science and technology, and
sport sectors.
</P>
<P>
Using the name " Macao, China", it may participate in
international organizations and conferences not limited to states.
It may set up official or semi-official economic and trade offices
in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Without its regional flag and regional emblem, the MSAR will be
inconvenienced in conducting the above external activities.
</P>
<P>
The regional flag of the MSAR is a green flag with five stars,
lotus flower, bridge and sea-water. The five stars symbolize
national unification and the fact that Macao is an inalienable
part of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Lotus flower is a popular local flower in Macao. In the old
days, Macao was also known as the "land of the lotus" and "lotus
stem." Its three petals represent the Macao Peninsula, Taipa
Island and Coloane Island. The whole lotus flower symbolizes the
prosperity of the future Macao. The bridge and sea water below the
lotus flower reflect the natural conditions of Macao, and the
green flag symbolizes the thriving land of China including Macao.
</P>
<P>
The regional emblem of the MSAR is composed of five stars,
lotus, bridge and sea water encircled by the words "Macao Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China" in
Chinese and "MACAO" in Portuguese. This shows that both Chinese
and Portuguese are official languages in Macao.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (15) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Following is Part 15 of a question
and answer series of the ABCs of the Basic Law of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
What kinds of laws are now in force in Macao?
</P>
<P>
There are two kinds of laws currently in force in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The first are Portuguese laws, including those enacted in
Portugal whose legal force extends to Macao and Portuguese laws
enacted specially for Macao.
</P>
<P>
The second kind is local, which are mainly laws, decrees,
administrative regulations and other acts introduced by the local
legislature and other competent organs in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The laws, decrees, administrative regulations and other acts
previously in force in Macao referred to in Article 8 of the Basic
Law cover only the local laws in Macao which are still in force on
December 19, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese laws enacted by competent Portuguese bodies,
whether those which are extended to cover Macao or those enacted
specifically for Macao, will no longer be deemed as the laws
previously in force in Macao with the resumption of exercise of
sovereignty over Macao by the Chinese Government as from the date
of the establishment of the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
These Portuguese laws shall not be maintained unless they have
been converted into local laws in Macao through proper
localization procedures before the above date.
</P>
<P>
However, in the case of citing the Portuguese laws by the local
Macao laws, a flexible approach may be adopted, as has been done
in the case of Hong Kong. The principle to be observed in this
regard is that such citation must not infringe upon China's
sovereignty and does not contravene the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
It should be pointed out that the maintenance of the laws
previously in force in Macao is not unconditional. According to
Article 8 of the Basic Law, for the laws previously in force in
Macao to be maintained, they shall not contravene the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
For instance, laws which are colonial in nature and infringe
upon China's sovereignty and which are clearly inconsistent with
the Basic Law in terms of the relationship between the central
government and the MSAR shall not be maintained.
</P>
<P>
These laws are subject to amendment by the legislature or other
relevant bodies of the MSAR in accordance with legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
With Macao's return to China, the legislature or other relevant
organs of the MSAR are bound to make due amendments to some
obsolete laws previously in force in Macao. Such obsolete laws
shall not be maintained.

<HEADLINE> Archaeological Discoveries in North China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered a large number of ancient tombs and bronze articles,
dating back to the Spring and Autumn period (770-476 B.C.) and the
Warring States period (475-221 B.C.), in Houma City in Shanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The discovery will provide valuable clues for archaeological
research into the Jin State, an ancient kingdom of the Spring and
Autumn periods with Houma as its capital.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 300 tombs and 500 pits used in ancient
ceremonies have been unearthed in a construction area of the city
since early last year. Over 500 historical relics including bronze,
pottery and jade articles have been excavated from the tombs.
</P>
<P>
Among the relics, the most rare is a pressurized bronze cooking
vessel that even contains some food from the ancient time.
</P>
<P>
Archaeological prospecting technology proves that there are a
total of 3,000 ancient tombs and 1,000 pits still buried in the
area.

<HEADLINE> Short Persons Association Walks Tall in Jilin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to help short students
get rid of any inferiority complexes and take part in campus
activities, physical education teacher Chi Hua, himself a short
person, has set up a special association to tackle the problem
</P>
<P>
"We should always keep in mind that we are equal with others no
matter what size we may," said 43 year old Chi, who is chairman
of the "Short Persons Association" in the Changchun University of
Science and Technology, in northeast China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
Tao Xiaohong, the college's shortest student, said that the
association has helped build up her confidence and to face any
problems with ease.
</P>
<P>
"The society has been very popular among short college students
ever since its establishment last December and I am really glad to
see that the club has helped its members get rid of an unnecessary
psychological burden," said Chi.
</P>
<P>
The members often play basketball with other college teams and
although they often lose, their performances often win them
applause and respect. "They are really great," a number of their
opponents commented.
</P>
<P>
"Most people in the south or China are short compared with
northerners. As a result we are not able to join in a lot of
competitive sports. We feel very depressed at this," added Chi.
</P>
<P>
"However, the association has provided us with opportunities
to show our potential," said Zhao Suoping, who is a short
southerner from Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
Height is the only requirement for membership. Anyone shorter
than 166 centimeters can apply and so far there are more than 100
members, with an average height of 163 centimeters.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Car Sales Doubled in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANIERO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Car sales in Brazil reached
70,000 units in March, a rate which is almost double that of
February last year (36,000), said a source representing Car Sales
Association in Brazil on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the sales increase was due to discount prices
within the sector, and also due to the stability of the local
currency,real, against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers always take advantage of discounts, the time is
right for people with money" said Mario Braga, director of the
association.
</P>
<P>
However, the National Association of Car Manufacturers forecast
that total car sales in 1999 would fall by ten percent in
comparison with last year.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly 1999 will be more difficult than last year, but it
is supposed that businesses may recuperate in the second half of
the year" said Braga.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the total car production in Brazil was 1.6 million
units, a 20 prcent drop in comparison with more than 2 million in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Mummies Dating 5 Centuries Ago Found in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A group of archeologists have
discovered three well-preserved Inca mummies high in the Andes
Mountains inside Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The three, relics of an Inca sacrificial ritual more than 500
years ago, were found beneath 1.5 meters of rock and earth on a
burial platform atop Argentina's Mount Llullaillaco about 6,739-
meter high above the sea level, according to a communique of the
Argentine Culture and Education Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of two girls and a boy may have been frozen since
being placed there, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Archeologist Johan Reinhard said in a statement that CT scans
on the mummies showed all internal organs intact and blood
appeared to still be present in the heart and lungs, as if the
three had died only recently.
</P>
<P>
No cause of death was immediately evident, he said.
</P>
<P>
The expedition was formed by Argentine, Peruvian and U.S.
archeologists. The started their work a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said the burial platform held offerings to the
Inca gods, including 36 gold, silver and shell statues, ornate
textiles, moccasins and pottery.
</P>
<P>
The Inca empire once stretched 4,000 kilometers from the
present day Colombia to central Chile. It collapsed in 1532 with
the Spanish conquest.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's Salta Province has announced the discovery as a
cultural heritage.

PARIS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Olympique Marseille were held 0-0 by
the visiting Bologna of Italy in their UEFA Cup semifinal first
leg match on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Italians, who were a mere Serie C side four years ago and
qualified through the Intertoto Cup, was too consistent
defensively for an lackluster Marseille who seemed too rarely
capable of making their way towards goal.
</P>
<P>
Bologna had several chances to score, especially in the opening
minutes when midfielder Davide Fontolan forced Marseille
goalkeeper Stephane Porato into a dramatic save.
</P>
<P>
Marseille came very close to open the scoring in the 74th
minute when Fabrizio Ravanelli volleyed a cross by Robert Pires
from close range narrowly wide.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will play their second leg in Italy in two weeks.

FUZHOU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian Province
brought down the natural population growth rate to 5.3 per 1,000
last year, touching the lowest point in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Fujian had witnessed one of the fastest population growths
among China's provinces with its population increasing to 32
million from eleven million in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth momentum has slowed down as the "One Child"
family planning policy has been more effectively carried out in
recent years. Fujian recorded 379,500 new births last year with a
net annual population growth of 170,000 people, which represents
the province's lowest record, since the founding of the New China
in 1949.

WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Tuesday
outlined NATO's new mission two weeks before its 50th anniversary,
saying the Kosovo operation presages the new non-territorial
missions the alliance will conduct next century.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based
think tank, Albright said NATO will retain its core mission in the
21st century, but it must also undertake out-of-area missions like
those in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said NATO leaders are ready to approve the
concept of non-territorial missions at their Washington summit,
which will be held in two weeks when leaders of 19 NATO countries
meet to chart their future course.
</P>
<P>
But the allies have still not agreed on how that concept will
reflect the connection between NATO and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
There is broad agreement NATO should obtain a U.N. mandate
before undertaking a mission outside its traditional area and
there must be flexibility for those instances when obtaining that
mandate is not possible, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Kosovo, she called NATO's airstrikes against
Yugoslavia a test for the Western alliance "before the new century

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hails WTO Ruling on Banana Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Tuesday
hailed a ruling by the World Trade Organization (WTO) which
cleared the way for the U.S. government to impose 100 percent
tariffs on nearly 200 million U.S. dollars worth of imports from
the European Union (EU) in retaliation to EU's banana import
regime.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that the WTO arbitrators concur with our
position that the EU banana regime is WTO-inconsistent and
continues to damage the U.S. economy," U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the amount subject to punitive tariffs under the WTO
ruling was significantly less than the 520 million dollars
originally sought by the United States. The tariffs would be
effective retroactively to March 3.
</P>
<P>
The dispute, which pitted major U.S. fruit distributors against
their European rivals, contributed to a deterioration in U.S.-
European trade relations, which were also strained by an argument
over beef treated with growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
The United States put importers on notice last month that they
may be liable to pay punitive duties on some EU products should
the WTO rule in Washington's favor. The decision to effectively
impose duties ahead of the WTO arbitration panel's decision caused
an uproar in EU countries.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing, U.S. special trade negotiator Peter Scher called
the decision a "major victory" and said it could set an important
precedent for disputes with Europe over hormone treated beef and
with Canada over magazines.

</P>
<P>
The quarterfinal originally was scheduled for Zagreb, Crotia.
The matches were moved to Raleign, and that allowed King to have
Seles join Lindsay Davenport, Chanda Rubin and Lisa Raymond for
the matches from April 17 to 18.
</P>
<P>
The International Tennis Federation's Fed Cup committee said it
considered neutral sites for the series, then decided on the
United States for the Croatia match.
</P>
<P>
Seles played in the 1998 Fed Cup semifinals against Spain and
was a member of the 1996 Fed Cup championship team.

<P>
MANILA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Philippine newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Slower growth in food prices caused inflation in the
Philippines to fall sharply to 8.7 percent in March compared to a
year earlier, with economists saying they now expect the inflation
rate will remain at single-digit levels over the rest of 1999.
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine government is underspending and this may hurt
efforts to perk up the economy, the International Monetary Fund
said in its reports.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- The Central Bank of the Philippines is set to approve
another cut in the level of reserve requirements on banks' deposit
liabilities due to the downward trend in inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Philippine President Joseph Estrada Tuesday granted a 90-day
reprieve to three men convicted of killing a police officer in a
robbery four years ago. Estrada announced the delay on the eve of
the scheduled executions, which would be the second in the
Philippines in 23 years.

<HEADLINE> Labor Talks Could Effect WNBA Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- WNBA teams are facing a
possible similar labor dispute as Minnesota and Orlando added four
players each today, causing labor negotiations threatening the
start of the season scheduled for June 10.
</P>
<P>
The league has set a Saturday deadline for reaching a contract
agreement with its players. Without one, the WNBA could order a
lockout, the same way the NBA did in July.
</P>
<P>
That labor dispute delayed the start of the NBA season until
February 5, cost players an estimated $400 million in salaries,
and reduced the schedule from 82 games to 50.
</P>
<P>
WNBA players, who are represented by the NBA Players
Association, are seeking increases from the league's $15,000
minimum salary to $45,000, a share of revenue from the sale of
team merchandise, retirement benefits and the right to challenge
disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
A union official said the league has offered $20,000 minimum,
while the union has lowered its demand from $60,000 to $45,000.
The sides agree they are about $2 million apart.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of PNG People Fled, Fearing Quake-related </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of people in the
northern coastal town of Lae in Papua New Guinea's (PNG) Morobe
province have fled their homes on the beach after two strong
earthquakes hit the area and raised fears of a tsunami.
</P>
<P>
There has been no reports of injuries or damage, the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) said in a report released earlier
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The wire service quoted local police as reporting people
panicked when an earthquake was felt about 7.30pm Tuesday night
and another smaller one followed around 9.30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
A rumor spread that Lae would be hit by a tsunami similar to
the one that devastated an area of PNG's north-west coast near
Aitape in July last year, killing thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
"Somebody went around and started telling everybody that we're
expecting something similar to Aitape," the duty officer at the
Lae police station, Sergeant Major Pauline Siaguru, told AAP.
</P>
<P>
Frightened residents left their homes in the settlements along
the beach and moved inland.
</P>
<P>
Siaguru said police had managed to convince most people to
return home after telling them that there would not be a tsunami.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is back to normal now," Siaguru said.
</P>
<P>
Siaguru said the first earthquake was strong enough to shake
items "off the shelf" at the police station.
</P>
<P>
No details are available yet on the size of the earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
PNG has experienced several earthquakes in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night an earthquake measuring 7.4 on the Richter
scale shook the island of New Britain, 250 km north of the
capital, Port Moresby.

CANBERRA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian will now accept, feed and shelter 4,000 Kosovar
Albanian refugees for at least three months after a cabinet
reversal Tuesday in the face of fierce criticism.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>

premier state New South Wales Tuesday dumped two of its ministers,

<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The first snapshot of teenage heroin abusers in Australia's
second richest state Victoria, some as young as 14, has found that
most are already dealing to support their habit and, for some of
them, selling heroin is their main source of income.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia has privately told the United States it is deeply
concerned over the NATO air war against Yugoslavia, but has
pledged to maintain its public support for the war in the
interests of alliance unity.

<HEADLINE> Finland to Offer More Aid to Kosovar Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Finland's Diplomatic and Security
Policies Commission Tuesday convened an emergency meeting on the
Kosovo situation and decided to increase aid to the Kosovar
refugees.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the government said that recent days saw
the refugee situation worsen. Some neighboring countries were no
longer able to stand the growing human tide.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Finland was prepared to further
increase aid to the refugees on the basis of the earlier provision
of eight million Finnish marks (1.37 million U.S. dollars). The
government is also working on the dispatch of medical teams from
the Finnish Red Cross organizations to the main refugee areas, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Finland was also ready to accept a small number of about 50
refugees in extremely poor health, according to Prime Minister
Paavo Lipponen.
</P>
<P>
As the flood of refugees has increased, Finnish citizens have
been generous in their donations. So far, the Red Cross has
collected up to one million Finnish marks (171,100 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross and some other relief agencies have transported a
variety of relief goods including tents, clothing, medicine and
sanitary goods to the disaster areas.

CARACAS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices in Venezuela rose 8.7
percent Monday from last week due to cuts in production, an Energy

</P>
<P>
Alvaro Silva Caldero, general director of the ministry, said
the rise of oil prices should be attributed to the production
reduction agreement reached between the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and independent producers
last month.

Oil prices rose from 12.32 dollars a barrel last week to 13.40
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Cracks down on Relics-Related Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region has
launched a large-scale crack down on relics-related crimes and
international relics smugglers.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has urged police to solve a number of
major relices-related cases as soon as possible, together with
customs offices, judicial departments and religious affairs
departments.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, since 1994, 120 relics-related
cases took place in Tibet, with 541 pieces of ancient Tibetan
relics lost. So far, 70 of the cases have been solved and 314
pieces of the relics returned.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, criminal activities like theft, robbery,
smuggling and trafficking of ancient relics have been on the rise
in this southwest China autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays in the Tibet Autonomous Region, tourists are visiting
local lamaseries and other ancient places much more frequently
than any others.
</P>
<P>
However, equipped with mini-cameras, these special "pilgrims"
stealthily take pictures of the valuables and then publish
shopping directories, in the forms of books and discs distributed
through underground channels, or via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Some local officials in charge of the matter attribute the
growth in relics-related crimes to the increasingly rising prices
of Tibetan relics on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Money has driven local traffickers, some of whom are connected
with foreign smugglers, to try every means to steal valuable
Tibetan relics.
</P>
<P>
The rising relics-related criminal activities have drawn
concern from local authorities. The regional government has
decided to punish relics-related criminals severely according to
law.
</P>
<P>
The local police and customs departments held a special
exhibition in an effort to create public awareness among local
people about the importance of protecting Tibetan relics and to
combat criminals.

<HEADLINE> Gore Calls Primakov on Kosovo Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Vice President Al Gore Tuesday
asked Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to use his influence
to urge Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept NATO's
demands on how to end the NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
A Gore aide said the two leaders talked for about 40 minutes
through telephone and their conversation was "candid and
businesslike."
</P>
<P>
NATO's demands are that Milosevic withdraw Serb forces from
their sovereign territory of Kosovo Province, which has already
been rejected by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Primakov went to Belgrade in the opening days of the war to
meet Milosevic, who agreed to a partial withdrawal of Serb forces
from Kosovo on the condition that NATO stop bombing. But the
allies rejected the plan.
</P>
<P>
David Leavy, spokesman for the White House National Security
Council, said that if Milosevic agreed to NATO demands, then a
scenario could be envisioned where "other non-NATO countries could
participate" in the so-called peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Primakov agreed to stay in contact. It was not clear
when Gore would be meeting Primakov as part of their joint
U.S.-Russian commission to work on long-term problems. Primakov
was coming to Washington for a meeting of the commission when he
turned back in protest at NATO's bombing campaign.

<HEADLINE> FIFA President Stands for Biennial World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- President of Federation of
International Football Association (FIFA) Sepp Blatter Tuesday
said that a biennial World Cup would offer a lot of opportunities
to many football federations to host soccer's most-prestigious
competition.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a crowded press conference here, the FIFA president
who arrived in Nigeria on April 2 said that he had definitely not
changed his mind about the idea which, he said, was good for the
game.
</P>
<P>
"The biennial World Cup will mean more contacts in
international football competitions, more possibilities for
countries in Africa and Asia to host the game," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Blatter who is in Nigeria for the on-going 10th World Youth
Championship tagged Nigeria '99 from April 3 to 24 pointed out "it
will be possible for the hosting of the World Cup to turn around
the global more often."
</P>
<P>
Under the present arrangement of four-yearly staging of the
competition, he added, it would take 24 years to get back to the
same continent, using the six continents of the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the present critics of a biennial World Cup were
mainly the clubs in Europe who were always reluctant to release
players for their national teams.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA president observed that an arrangement could be worked
out to have a unified international football calender, which would
have specific periods to play and a certain period set aside for
national teams.
</P>
<P>
"I am still for the two yearly World Cup because it would be
good for the game, especially in this jet age," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Blatter is scheduled to leave Tuesday night the West african
country for the FIFA headquarters in Zurich and will return to
Nigeria when the current game enters the semifinal and final
stages.

<HEADLINE> Fowler Fined by Liverpool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- England striker Robbie Fowler was
fined and given a formal warning by his Liverpool club on Tuesday
over his controversial "cocaine" goal celebrations in Saturday's
match against Everton.
</P>
<P>
After scoring a 15th minute penalty, Fowler twice knelt down
and sniffed the white goal-line in a simulated display of drug-
taking in response to chants by Everton supporters about an
alleged drug habit.
</P>
<P>
Foster, already facing an English F.A hearing on Friday over a
misconduct charge following a clash with Chelsea defender and
England teammate Graeme Le Saux in February, was further charged
by the F.A on Tuesday over the Anfield incident.
</P>
<P>
He was ordered to appear before a Liverpool board meeting and
told of his fine, believed to be two weeks' wages.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool chairman David Moores said: "The club deeply regret
what happened on the field and made it very clear that they would
not allow any player or other persons to damage the club's
reputation without taking a firm response.
</P>
<P>
"The club, however, recognise that for far too long Robbie has
been the subject of totally unjustified allegations and rumours
about drugs and other personal matters which can only be described
as a pack of lies.
</P>
<P>
"There was also the long period during which he feared that his
career might be over as the result of an extremely serious injury.
</P>
<P>
"The club now regard the matter as closed and have accepted the
player's assurances that he will not give any further grounds for
complaint."
</P>
<P>
Fowler publicly apologised for his behaviour on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He issued a statement saying: "I would like to apologise
unequivocally for my first goal celebration.
</P>
<P>
"Despite my actions being taken in the heat of the moment I
realise that they have caused great offence."
</P>
<P>
Fowler got into trouble in the league match with Chelsea when
he bent over and pointed to his backside in an attempt to cast a
'gay' slur on the heterosexual Le Saux.
</P>
<P>
Le Saux was also charged with misconduct after video pictures
showed the Chelsea player elbowing Fowler in the face.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Actuarial Cooperation Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Another seven Chinese graduate
students have become internationally recognized actuaries.
</P>
<P>
They were awarded the qualification certificate by the master's
program co-sponsored by the British Institute of Actuaries, Eagle
Star Insurance Company and China's Central University of Finance
and Economics.
</P>
<P>
The program, launched in 1993, is the first in China to train
international licensed actuaries. So far, 36 students have gained
the actuarial qualification certificate, and eight have received
their financial and investment certificate.
</P>
<P>
Developing the actuarial system and training actuaries are seen
as the key to a mature insurance sector in China, especially as
the country's Insurance Law acknowledges the role of actuaries.
It stipulates insurers operating in China should hire at least one
actuary recognized by the government's financial administration,
and have an actuarial reporting system.
</P>
<P>
Actuaries are versatile, with a knowledge of mathematics,
statistics, economics, investment and insurance. The UK's
government actuary Chris Daykin said the students in the China-
British program have made "remarkable" achievements, and their
passing rate is far higher than the international average.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to need at least 5,000 actuaries in the
coming decade. Some overseas insurance companies and international
institutions are co-sponsoring with Chinese universities related
programs and have set up examination centers.
</P>
<P>
A joint program between Fudan University and the American
International Group Inc. produced China's first actuary that is
recognized by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, the
insurance industry watchdog.
</P>
<P>
Eagle Star is the first European insurance company to have a
presence in China. It set up a Beijing representative office in
1992, and has two more in Shanghai and Guangzhou.

<HEADLINE> Albright Outlines NATO's New Mission Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Tuesday outlined NATO's new mission two weeks before its
50th anniversary, saying the Kosovo operation presages the new
non-territorial missions the alliance will conduct next century.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based
think tank, Albright said NATO will retain its core mission in the
21st century, but it must also undertake out-of-area missions like
those in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, they will be rare but -- as is now the case --
there may be more than one ongoing at any given time. They may be
conducted jointly with partners or other non-allied nations. And
by definition, they will involve operations outside alliance
territory, with all the logistical complications that entail," she
said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said NATO leaders are ready to approve the
concept of non-territorial missions at their Washington summit,
which will be held in two weeks when leaders of 19 NATO countries
meet to chart their future course.
</P>
<P>
But the allies have still not agreed on how that concept will
reflect the connection between NATO and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
There is broad agreement NATO should obtain a U.N. mandate
before undertaking a mission outside its traditional area and
there must be flexibility for those instances when obtaining that
mandate is not possible, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Kosovo, Albright said: "Our explicit goal should
be to transform the Balkans from the continent's primary source of
instability into an important part of the European mainstream."
</P>
<P>
And she called NATO's airstrikes against Yugoslavia a test for
the Western alliance "before the new century even begins."
</P>
<P>
Albright spoke before Belgrade announced a unilateral
cease-fire in Kosovo, which however was rejected by the United
States and its allies. And Albright asserted that Washington would
be "prepared for an extended conflict."

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Beats Blackburn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua)-- Arsenal kept their premier league
title hopes alive when they defeated Blackburn Rovers to move
within one point of Manchester United in the English Premier
League on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Bergkamp scored the goal that mattered in the 42nd
minute with a rebound off his own free kick, and though he missed
a second half penalty, the reigning champions had all they needed
to keep the pressure on United even though they have played one
game more.
</P>
<P>
United are on 64 points with Arsenal on 63, four clear of third
placed Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
Blackburn defended resolutely for most of the first half until
they conceded the vital free kick. Bergkamp's effort was poor and
struck the wall at knee-level, but the rebound came back to him
and he made no mistake with a left-foot shot that beat John Filan
into the far corner.
</P>
<P>
In the 83rd minute after he was pulled down in the box by Keith
Gillespie, Bergkamp had a chance to make it 2-0 but Filan dived
low to his left to make the save.
</P>
<P>
The defeat left Blackburn mired in the relegation zone, one
position above the third-from-bottom club only on goal difference.
</P>
<P>
Two players got march orders in the match with Martin Keown in
the 69th minute for a second bookable offence and Gillespie for
his foul on Bergkamp that led to the missed penalty.
</P>
<P>
In the other premier league game, Leicester scored twice in the
last 30 minutes to salvage a 2-2 draw with former leaders Aston
Villa, who have now gone 11 games without a victory.
</P>
<P>
Villa looked likely to come out of their slump when they took a
2-0 lead early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hendrie had given them an 80-second lead and Julian Joachim
made it 2-0 right after the break.
</P>
<P>
But Leicester delighted their home fans with a spirited
recovery which was rewarded when Robbie Savage in the 62nd minute

<HEADLINE> PFA Suggest New Fine Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Professional Footballers
Association (PFA) proposed on Tuesday a new scheme of fines for
players for disciplinary offences from next season.
</P>
<P>
Players could lose some of their wages for picking up eight
bookings and there may be stiffer penalties for red cards.
</P>
<P>
However, PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor stressed the maximum
penalty would be two weeks' salary.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to be even-handed," he said. "Players have
commitments which is why the measures would only come in after
eight games."
