Mexican parties reach breakthrough on bank bailout plan

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A months-long stalemate over a dlrs 60
billion bank bailout plan ended late Friday as leaders of two
leading political parties announced agreement.
	   The agreement appears to overcome a conflict that had thrown
uncertainty over Mexico's economy. But the future of Central Bank
Gov. Guillermo Ortiz _ whose resignation had been demanded by the
opposition _ remained unclear.
	   The two parties jointly have more than enough votes to assure
the measure's passage. Mexico's stock market had rallied Friday on
rumors that an agreement was near.
	   The conservative National Action Party announced the government
party had accepted its proposal to replace the current bank deposit
protection fund known as Fobaproa with a new Savings Protection
Institute.
	   That institute would assume most of the roughly dlrs 60 billion
in overdue loans held by Fobaproa, but apparently would exclude
loans found to be illegal in an audit now underway.
	   National Action officials said the agreement would bar Ortiz
from any role in the new institute. They accuse Ortiz of violating
the law in the bank bailout that followed Mexico's 1995 financial
crash.
	   Since the central bank governor is supposed to be among the
administrators of the new institute, that would imply Ortiz's
resignation.
	   But Congressman Angel Aceves Saucedo of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party insisted to reporters that
``there will be no resignation of Guillermo Ortiz.''
	   It was unclear how that dispute was being resolved.
	   Details of the agreement remained unclear late Friday.
	   State-backed Fobaproa had absorbed tens of billions of dollars
in bad loans from Mexico's banks in the wake of the 1995 financial
crash that sent interest rates soaring and caused many debtors to
default.
	   Officials said the action was necessary to save the banking
system.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo's government has proposed absorbing
Fobaproa's liabilities into the national debt.
	   Opposition parties charged that officials violated Mexico's
constitution by pledging public backing for the loans without
congressional approval. The government insisted its action was
legal.
	   National Action said its proposal would create greater
incentives for banks to recoup the bad loans.
	   The National Action proposal called for banks that were bailed
out by Fobaproa to exchange their bad debt for special bonds with a
10-year maturity date.
	   The banks would then try to collect on bad loans to pay their
bonds. If they were unable to recover all, the government would pay
the difference, and would become a minority shareholder.
	   Mexico's other main opposition party, the leftist Democratic
Revolution Party, boycotted Friday's talks and denounced the
agreement.

	   In Chicago, Glenn Healy, back in the NHL after his recall this
week from the minors, made 28 saves to lead the Toronto Maple Leafs
over the Chicago Blackhawks.
	   Healy, who had been recalled from the Chicago Wolves of the IHL,
was called up only because backup goaltender Felix Potvin had
walked out on the team because they had been having trouble trading
him.
	   Todd Warriner, Alyn McCauley and Mats Sundin scored as the Maple
Leafs extended their unbeaten streak at the United Center to seven
games (6-0-1). Doug Gilmour and Daniel Cleary scored for Chicago.
 &UR; Stars 3, Canadiens 2
	   In Dallas, Jamie Langenbrunner's tiebreaking goal with 2:49 to
play led the Dallas Stars over the struggling Montreal Canadiens.
	   Goals by Benoit Brunet and Jonas Hoglund over a 16-second span
late in the second period had lifted the Canadiens into a 2-2 tie.
But with overtime looming late in the third, Mike Modano worked the
puck free to Langenbrunner, who skated in front of the net and beat
Montreal goalie Jose Theodore for his fifth goal.
	   The Canadiens are winless in their last eight road games (0-7-1)
and are 2-11-1 in their last 14 overall.

Police arrest two suspects in murder of 19 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ State police say they have arrested two men
suspected of taking part in the Sept. 17 massacre of 19 people near
Ensenada in the northern border state of Baja California.
	   State Attorney Gen. Marco Antonio de la Fuente told the
government's Notimex news agency that Mario Miranda Raglan and
Sergio Lopez Martinez were arrested in Ensenada while riding in a
car with California license plates.
	   He said they were also accused of involvement in the kidnap and
murder of two men in the state.
	   Eighteen members of Fermin Castro's extended family were roused
from their beds Sept. 17 by gunmen who lined them up against a wall
in the small community of El Sauzal, south of Ensenada, and opened
fire with heavy caliber automatic weapons.
	   Castro himself died two weeks later.
	   Police said the killings were apparently related to drug
trafficking.
	   At least 14 other people had been arrested earlier, but it was
not clear Friday how many of those were still being held.

Kwan easily wins technical program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to Alex Zhulin sted Yevgeny Platov in 24th graf,
picks up 25th graf pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Michelle Kwan and Alexei Yagudin, world
champions on the Olympic-eligible level, are closing in on the same
crown for the professionals.
	   With the International Skating Union sanctioning the World
Professional Figure Skating Championships this year, both Kwan and
Yagudin _ who won their other world titles in Minneapolis in April
_ have taken advantage. Each of them dropped a perfect 6.0 on the
competition Friday night.
	   Kwan calmly and almost routinely skated a stylish technical
program. That peacefulness was missing during the Olympics, in
which she skated tentatively in the long program and finished
second to Tara Lipinski.
	   This time, Kwan hit everything with flair as she debuted her new
free skate, to ``Lamento d'Ariane.'' The two-time world champion on
the Olympic-eligible level plans to use the same routine in the
nationals in two months.
	   ``I felt more relaxed than I usually do,'' the 18-year-old Kwan
said. ``Last year, I'd probably have done two internationals and a
couple of pro-ams and been exhausted. But now I feel ready for
nationals. I'm not worried and tense and stressed out.''
	   Russia's Yagudin, who received his 6.0 from the Russian judge,
won the men's technical program by hitting seven triples, including
two triple axels.
	   ``This is an important competition for me, but it is not so
serious as the Grand Prix and the worlds and Europeans,'' said
Yagudin, who plans to skate at the Russian championships and at
worlds. ``It's OK. I'm happy.''
	   He edged five-time U.S. champion Todd Eldredge, allowed to
reskate the second half of his routine after a cuff link fell off
his costume and landed in his way.
	   Eldredge, who fell on a triple lutz, got to redo the jump and
landed it perfectly.
	   ``The referee asked if I wanted to start before or after the
lutz,'' he said with a smile. ``I said, `Let me think about it.' ''
	   Rudy Galindo was third, followed by Kurt Browning, winner of
this event the last three years.
	   Facing the toughest field she will encounter this season, Kwan
swept the seven-judge panel. Of course, none of the other
competitors came close to the seven triple jumps she nailed, or to
the flair she put into the performance, worth half the total score.
	   ``Tonight was a very important night for us,'' coach Frank
Carroll said. ``She did seven triples _ yea, team! _ and whether it
was slow or not, I'll take it.''
	   Kwan's 6.0 from the Canadian judge was a surprise.
	   ``You get a perfect score and you wonder, `Where do I go from
here?''' she said. ``Everyone says, `Don't change a thing.' But I
have to change.
	   ``I have to appreciate it now and start all over.''
	   Nicole Bobek, who has had to start all over after her 17th-place
disaster at Nagano, also looked sharp in edging Japan's Yuka Sato
for second heading into Saturday night's artistic program. Back
training with Richard Callaghan, who oversaw her climb to the 1995
national title, Bobek nailed a beautiful triple lutz to begin her
rousing routine, to music from the film ``Zorro.''
	   ``Basically, I'm looking at every competition as a step up,''
Bobek said. ``We're working hard. I don't feel as nervous.''
	   It was a rough night for the two Olympic champions in the field.
Oksana Baiul, the 1994 winner, finished fifth, and Katarina Witt
(1984-88) was sixth and last. Two-time Olympic bronze medalist Lu
Chen of China was fourth.
	   ``I'm embarrassed,'' Witt said. ``I skated very poorly.''
	   The top three men all skated well. But Yagudin's far more
difficult program earned him the top spot.
	   ``Last year, I skated good, but not good enough to win
everything,'' said Yagudin, who has been unbeatable this season.
``My artistry was not so good as it is now.''
	   Five-time U.S. ice dance champions Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod
Swallow were a surprising first after the rhythm dance. It's rare
when Americans wind up ahead of Russian dancers in any competition,
let alone the world pros.
	   But they edged Maya Usova and Yevgeny Platov, and Pasha Grischuk
and Alex Zhulin. Grischuk partnered with Platov to win the last two
Olympics, while Usova and Zhulin, who once were married, also were
Olympians.

Mexican, Bolivian leaders indirectly criticize action against
</HEADLINE>
Pinochet &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with quotes from Zedillo, details of
agreements, award to Banzer. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The presidents of Mexico and Bolivia on
Friday denounced the application of one nation's laws inside
another _ indirectly referring to Spain's attempts to try former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   The statement came in a joint declaration issued after a day of
official meetings by Bolivia's Hugo Banzer, whose own past as a
military dictator has caused controversy here.
	   Banzer held private talks with Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo, with Mexican senators and with Mexican and Bolivian
businessmen on Friday, though he avoided comment to the press.
	   In the joint statement, the two presidents ``rejected the
unilateral and extraterritorial application of laws,'' saying that
``injures the legal equality of states, sovereignty and the
principle of non-intervention in internal affairs.''
	   Latin American nations have rallied behind Chile's complaints
about Britain's decision this week to allow extradition proceedings
against Pinochet to continue. He is wanted in Spain on charges of
torture, genocide and kidnapping stemming from his 1973-1983
military dictatorship of Chile.
	   At a Friday night banquet for Banzer, Zedillo said the two
countries share ``similar values. We are determined to ensure that
our friendship is strengthened with a view to the future.''
	   He said that Banzer, ``with lucid, responsible and congruent
policies is leading the Bolivian economy toward firm and lasting
growth.''
	   Banzer also ran into controversy here. Mexico's largest leftist
party, Democratic Revolution, issued a statement this week saying
he should be prosecuted for genocide for killings during his
1971-78 military government.
	   Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leader of Democratic
Revolution, refused to give Banzer the keys to the city.
	   In a television interview on Friday, Mexican Foreign Secretary
Rosario Greene criticized those actions, calling them ``a great
discourtesy'' to an elected leader.
	   Banzer, who insists he is now a proven democrat, won Bolivia's
presidential election in 1997.
	   The two presidents said in their joint statement that
``democracy is indispensable for stability, peace and
development.''
	   They also signed agreements on fighting drug trafficking and on
cooperation in economic and technical matters.
	   Mexico awarded Banzer its highest award for foreigners, the
Order of the Aztec Eagle.

China, Ukraine sign trade deals, smooth over Taiwan spat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China will buy Ukrainian generators for its giant
Three Gorges Dam project, Ukraine's foreign minister said Saturday,
indicating the two countries have settled a dispute about his
government's contacts with Taiwan.
	   The two sides also signed a deal to collaborate on upgrading
Chinese airliners and discussed cooperation in farming and other
areas, said Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk. He would not provide
details about the deals.
	   ``The two parties agreed that the philosophy should be a
combination of the considerable financial and economic potential of
China with the no less considerable scientific and technical
potential of Ukraine,'' Tarasyuk said at a news conference in the
middle of a five-day visit.
	   Tarasyuk affirmed Ukraine's support for the ``one China''
principle, which recognizes Taiwan as a province of the mainland.
	   Beijing protested angrily in 1996 when then-Premier Lien Chan of
Taiwan visited Ukraine. Beijing insists the island, ruled by the
rival Nationalist government, has no right to conduct foreign
relations.
	   ``We continue to conduct trade cooperation with Taiwan. But this
kind of cooperation has no official content,'' Tarasyuk said.
	   The foreign minister also emphasized Ukraine's interest in trade
with China, but hinted at possible frictions over trade barriers.
	   Ukraine's trade with China in 1997 amounted to dlrs 1.25
billion, but has fallen by 30 percent so far this year, Tarasyuk
said. He blamed growing Chinese trade barriers to imports of
Ukrainian fertilizer and other goods, but did not say whether the
two sides had discussed the issue.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Prime Minister plans to announce a new fund
this week designed to help members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations fight drugs, terrorism and pollution, a local report
said Saturday.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will unveil the 500 million yen
(4.26 million dollars) initiative in a policy speech he is
scheduled to give Wednesday in Vietnam, the Kyodo News agency
reported, citing unnamed government sources.
	   Japanese foreign ministry officials were unavailable for
immediate comment on the report.
	   Obuchi will visit Hanoi during a summit meeting of ASEAN leaders
on Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   ASEAN includes Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines,
Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos. Japan, South Korea
and China also will attend the summit as ``dialogue partners.''
	   While in Vietnam, the Japanese leader was also expected to flesh
out two larger financial assistance packages for nations hit
hardest by the Asian financial crisis, one which earmarks dlrs 30
billion in direct aid.
	   The other program, worth roughly 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.53
billion), will provide credit to Japanese joint ventures located in
Southeast Asia.

For two Asian women athletes, countdown to fame or oblivion starts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For two famed Asian women athletes _
P.T. Usha of India and Susantika Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka _ the
countdown to fame or oblivion starts with Asian Games' track events
beginning Sunday.
	   If Usha, mother of a 6-year-old son, wins even a bronze in her
favorite 400 meters, the 33-year-old athlete will retire from
international competition with added glory. Her name will be
enshrined in India's book of athletic legends, which is very thin
for a nation of 980 million people. No Indian has ever won an
Olympics medal in track and field.
	   If Jayasinghe, 23, wins at either 100 or 200 meters, it will
bring resurrection in her sport and lift her image in Sri Lanka, a
nation of 18.5 million people off India's southern coast.
	   Jayasinghe, the youngest of five daughters who grew up on the
rubber plantations of central Sri Lanka, is considered outrageously
frank.
	   When she returned home after the 1997 World Track Championships
at Athens with a silver ahead of Jamaican runner Merlene Ottey, she
made the war-scarred nation proud. She was given money and a
three-bedroom flat in Colombo, and was honored by President
Chandrika Kumaratunga, a woman.
	   But the good times did not last long. She raised a storm by
accusing unnamed Sri Lankan sports officials of sexual harassment.
	   Then she had to undergo an out-of-competition drug test, which
turned out positive for a banned substance.
	   She told The Associated Press that she feared her urine sample
had been tampered with. She said it was part of an effort to defame
her and end her career in retaliation for her accusations.
	   ``I am really working hard to win a medal in Bangkok and I will
prove I don't cheat anyone,'' she says.
	   Still, a medal here will not end the drug issue.
	   Track and field's world governing body, the International
Amateur Athletic Federation, referred her doping case to
arbitration after a Sri Lankan panel cleared her by a 2-1 verdict.
Jayasinghe says she only took a drug to control her menstrual
cycle.
	   If the next ruling goes against Jayasinghe, any medal she wins
at Bangkok will be taken away.
	   For India's Usha, a medal of any color means a lot.
	   ``It looks like Usha is carrying the entire burden of India,''
said Sabita Nagpal, an Indian resident in Bangkok and an avid
follower of Indian performance at the games.
	   Usha has come the closest of any Indian to winning an Olympic
track medal, missing bronze by 0.01 seconds in the 400-meter
hurdles at the 1984 games.
	   She won silver at 100 and 200 meters in the 1982 Asian Games in
New Delhi, and one year later, she won gold in the 400 in the Asian
championships in Kuwait and a silver in the 200.
	   In July, the Indian railroad official surprised everyone by
coming out of eight years of athletic retirement to run in the
Asian Track Championships in Fukuoka, Japan.
	   She was third in the 200 meters and, on the same day, anchored
India's victorious 4 x 100-meter relay. Usha also anchored India's
silver medal team in the 4 x 400.
	   On the difficult road back, preliminary heats start Sunday for
both Usha and Jayasinghe.

	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ As rescue workers combed through
the wreckage of a Thai Airways jetliner early Saturday searching
for survivors and the bodies of victims, police said they expect
the final death toll from the crash to total 101 people.
	   Thailand's Transport and Communications Minister, Suthep
Thaugsuban, said that of the 146 on board, 87 people were confirmed
dead and 45 had survived. Suthep's sister, Siriwan, was among the
victims killed in the crash.
	   The remaining 14 people were still missing, but police said they
doubted any more survivors would be found.
	   Burned and bruised corpses were lined up on the floor of the
passenger terminal at Surat Thani airport, and police said they
were having difficulty identifying some of the dead.
	   At the scene of the crash in a muddy swamp, workers using
specially-designed equipment cut through what remained of the jet's
fuselage to extract the remaining bodies and anyone who might still
be alive inside.
	   Battling a heavy rainstorm, Thai Airways Flight TG261, an Airbus
A310-200, plunged into the swamp at around 6:45 p.m. on Friday
after bursting into flames about three miles (five kilometers) from
the airport.
	   It was the third attempt by the jetliner to land at Surat Thani,
a fishing port and travel hub for vacation resorts located 330
miles (530 kilometers) southwest of Bangkok.
	   Police said the black box, or flight recorder, had been
recovered early Saturday.
	   The passengers were mostly Thais. Of the 25 foreigners on board,
11 had survived. Three of the foreigners, all Japanese, were
confirmed dead and the rest were still missing, police said.
	   Thawat Wichaidit, 58, a member of Parliament from Surat Thani,
also died.
	   Many of the dead were believed to have drowned in the waist-high
swamp water while trapped in the wreckage.
	   Some 200 rescue workers and volunteers from nearby villagers
struggled to pull bodies from the burnt, twisted metal of the
wrecked plane. The rescue operation was scaled back early Saturday
due to dark, rainy conditions but began again in full force at
daybreak.
	   ``I pulled out about 20 dead bodies,'' said Pornsak Jaratrae,
23, who rushed to the scene from his village when he heard there
was a crash.
	   ``We had to dive into the freezing water to find bodies. It was
so difficult, I never did anything like that before,'' a soaked and
shivering Pornsak said.
	   He said volunteers initially were turned back from the site
until equipment arrived for dousing flames from the still-burning
aircraft.
	   Police said at least five children _ four boys and a girl _ were
among the hospitalized survivors.
	   Ambulances were unable to reach the crash site, leaving
four-wheel-drive vehicles to navigate the mud. Still, officials
said the water that has hampered rescuers may have cushioned the
aircraft's impact.
	   Flight attendant Akradej Pudemha said that as the plane shook
violently on its third attempt to land, some passengers began to
panic.
	   ``People started screaming. I told them to calm down, but some
were out of control. They wouldn't stay in their seats. They were
thrown around by the shaking of the plane and luggage was flying
everywhere,'' he said.
	   A gardener living nearby, Sophon Sapkong, 42, said he heard a
loud noise, came out of his home and saw ``the airplane try to go
up high. Then I saw a light, bright like the sunset, about four
stories off the ground, then a fireball falling.''
	   The airline released a passenger list that indicated most of the
132 passengers were Thais, but there were also several Western and
Japanese names. The list did not include the passengers'
nationalities. The remaining 14 people were crew members.
	   Airbus announced from its headquarters in Toulouse, France, that
it would send five specialists to assist Thai authorities in their
investigation.
	   Airbus said the plane was delivered in April 1986 and had
accumulated 23,000 flight hours.

Singapore's senior statesman urges reforms after Indonesian

elections

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Warning that a political and economic collapse
in Indonesia would hurt the entire region, Singapore's elder
statesman Lee Kuan Yew has said the neighboring country can avoid
disintegration by pursuing reforms after popular elections.
	   ``I think the first thing to do now is to get some form of
popular government elected that has the support of the people and
carry out the tough reforms that are necessary,'' replied Lee to a
caller's question late Friday during a live interview on CNN
International.
	   ``The biggest country in the region is of course Indonesia,'' he
said. ``So if it collapses, and does not recover after the
elections, then I think the whole region will suffer, not just
Singapore, but Malaysia, Brunei, and even beyond to the Philippines
and Thailand and beyond.''
	   Foreign investors, who tend to view the region as a whole, will
be frightened away from Southeast Asia if Indonesia unravels,
warned Lee.
	   Southeast Asia's largest country has suffered from dire
political, social and economic disruption since the start of a
regional crisis in July of 1997.
	   Millions of Indonesians have fallen below the poverty line,
thousands have been killed in ethnic and religious unrest, and the
country's political future remains uncertain.
	   Amid frequent public protests against corruption and the current
political system, an interim government led by President B.J.
Habibie has promised general elections in July next year.
	   ``I think, in the circumstances, that's a practical solution to
establish legitimacy and some form of representative government,''
said Lee of the promised elections.

ASEAN foreign ministers gather to discuss Asian crisis

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Southeast Asian economic ministers have
told their nation's senior officials to go back to the drawing
board and devise bolder measures to help the region's economies
recover from the worst crisis in a half-century, a spokesman said
Saturday.
	   The senior officials met in Hanoi earlier in the week to fine
tune a joint declaration and a plan of action to be submitted for
approval next week at a summit meeting of leaders from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   ``The officials did not come up with enough bold measures,''
Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul told reporters as
ASEAN member economic and foreign ministers met separately
Saturday.
	   The ministers ``want to send a clear message that ASEAN is
facing the challenge'' of the economic crisis and ``will be more
integrated with the world economy,'' he said.
	   The proposals focus on acceleration of measures that ASEAN has
been talking about for more than a year: liberalization of trade,
investment and services.
	   The discussions among economic ministers took place
simultaneously with a meeting by ASEAN foreign ministers, who
failed to reach a consensus at a four-hour dinner Friday night on
whether to immediately approve Cambodia's application for
membership.
	   Both groups were scheduled to meet for seven hours Saturday.
	   Officials clearly were trying to steer the spotlight back to the
economic issues that head the agenda for meetings leading up to the
summit Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   ``The main challenge facing this meeting is addressing the
financial and economic problems, the measures for economic recovery
and cushioning the impact on vulnerable members of society,''
Association of Southeast Asian Nations Secretary-general Rodolfo
Severino said.
	   The question of Cambodia's membership had dominated the talks so
far.
	   Despite heavy lobbying by host Vietnam and other countries, the
foreign ministers were unable to reach a consensus for a unanimous
decision on the issue.
	   Cambodia had been scheduled to join ASEAN in 1997, but political
turmoil led to its application being put on hold until a stable
government was in place.
	   An agreement between two major Cambodian political factions was
reached late last month, and the country was given back its seat at
the United Nations earlier this week.
	   However, some countries were holding out, warning that the ASEAN
summit meeting should not be seen as an artificial deadline.
Despite the lack of consensus among ministers, officials said there
still was a chance that the leaders could decide to admit Cambodia.
	   Also Saturday, Severino said he has seen no opposition to
ASEAN's proclaimed free-market philosophy and no trend toward
protectionism which needs to be combated.
	   ``Closing the economies to one another at this stage would be
self-defeating,'' Severino said. ``That is not the direction that
ASEAN is going. It's going toward faster economic integration and
maintaining openness of the economies.''
	   He said the primary challenge is to address the economic
problems and measures for economic recovery while ``cushioning the
impact on vulnerable members of society.''
	   One goal is to encourage equitable development to prevent ASEAN
from becoming a two-tiered group of less-developed and rapidly
industrializing nations. But the region's economies already range
from powerhouses like Singapore to some of the world's poorest
countries.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Russian poultry workers lock alleged thieves in freezer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian poultry factory workers were arrested for
locking seven colleagues in a meat freezer after accusing them of
stealing 6 tons of chicken legs, a news agency reported.
	   Four security officials at the Novosibirsk Poultry Plant first
questioned the seven workers, then beat them with a bat, then
locked them in the freezer, police were quoted by the ITAR-Tass
news agency Friday as saying.
	   ITAR-Tass said the theft allegations were unfounded.
	   Police in Novosibirsk, a city about 1,750 miles east of Moscow,
freed the frozen workers and detained four security officials.
	   The report did not say when the incident occurred or how long
the workers were in the freezer, or what happened to the 6 tons of
chicken.

Malaysian court needs more time to rule on former No. 2 leader's
</HEADLINE>
bail

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A hearing on an appeal for bail
from Malaysia's jailed former No. 2 leader was delayed on Saturday
after a court said it needed up to two more weeks to make a
decision.
	   ``We will reserve judgment and give our answer in a week or
two,'' said Lamin Yunus, who presided over the Malaysian appellate
court's three-member bench.
	   Ex-Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's bail application
already has been turned down once by a lower court and an appeal of
that decision failed. Trial Judge Augustine Paul said Anwar's
lawyers were not able to prove that their client would not tamper
with witnesses if released on bail.
	   The ousted deputy premier faces trial on 10 charges of abuse of
power and sexual misconduct. He denies all the charges, calling
them part of a political vendetta orchestrated by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
	   On Saturday, lawyers from both sides presented highly technical
arguments for more than two hours on whether the appellate court
had the right to hear the bail case.
	   An earlier ruling made by the Court of Appeal said that not all
appellate cases must be heard by the court. A decision by the three
judges not to hear Anwar's case could potentially thwart any
further attempts to free him on bail.
	   On Saturday, Anwar merely shrugged his shoulders at the end of
the proceedings.
	   ``Fortunately, I wasn't too optimistic,'' he said, hugging his
14-year-old daughter, Nurul Nuha.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, who has attended every session of
his corruption trial in High Court over the past five weeks, was
not present at Saturday's hearing.
	   Anwar, 51, was arrested Sept. 20 under a special security law
only hours after organizing a mammoth rally in the capital city of
Kuala Lumpur. During that protest, he called for sweeping
government reforms and Mahathir's resignation.
	   Mahathir sacked Anwar on Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and
finance minister after deciding his one time protege was morally
unfit to lead the Southeast Asian country.

Boult takes third-round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealander Elliot Boult took a
one-stroke lead after three rounds of the New Zealand Open golf
tournament Saturday, shooting a 3-under 69 at the Formosa Auckland
Country Club.
	   Boult is at 4-under 212 for the tournament, a stroke ahead of
overnight leader Rodney Pampling, who battled the conditions to get
to par for the day but then dropped a stroke on the last for 73.
	   With him is fellow Australian Nick O'Hern, who carded a 72.
	   Two strokes back at 1-under for the tournament were Kiwi Grant
Moorhead. who set a course record with seven-under 65, Australian
Russell Swanson, who fired 67, and his compatriot Peter Lonard with
a 68.
	   Michael Campbell hung in for a 73 and fellow Kiwi Matthew Lane
stayed with them to complete the five players at 1-under.
	   Boult, 32, said he felt comfortable on the course.
	   ``From tee to green I played real solid, but then because the
wind stays the same I'm starting to know this course,'' he said.
``I haven't played that much here but I feel really comfortable on
this course.''
	   Philip Tataurangi, who finished the day 1-over for the
tournament with a 75 Saturday, was involved in some dramatic
moments on the 14th.
	   His ball rolled from the edge of the bunker when he appeared to
take his stance for the shot.
	   He stepped back to reappraise the situation but after some
discussion was penalized a stroke by rules official Fred Henderson,
who got him to play out of the bunker.
	   Tataurangi was judged guilty of having already addressed the
ball, although his group member Campbell argued with officials in
his favor. Tataurangi slipped back to even-par for the tournament.
	   Bob Charles, the 62-year-old veteran, shot 68 to finish the day
2 over. (djp)

Kidnapped French hostage released in Caucasus

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A French aid worker kidnapped in southern Russia
last January has been freed and is expected to arrive in Moscow
Saturday, a news agency reported.
	   Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the UNHCR's office in North
Ossetia, near breakaway Chechnya, was seized by three masked gunmen
in his apartment in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz on Jan. 29.
	   The Interfax news agency, quoting Vladikavkaz security forces,
said Cochetel had been freed and would be flown to Moscow. It said
details of his release were not known.
	   Earlier this week, the heads of the four foreign hostages were
found in Chechnya after a government rescue attempt apparently went
wrong. Chechen security forces are still searching for the men's
bodies.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen
Oct. 3 in the Chechen capital, Grozny.
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are
mostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held
captive.

Report: Three killed in mass brawl on Indonesian resort island of
</HEADLINE>
Bali

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Three people were killed and two
others were reported missing after a massive brawl between
residents from two villages on the tourist island of Bali in
Indonesia, local media said Saturday.
	   At least 17 people were injured during the fight in the island's
Buleleng district, state-run Antara news agency reported. Five cars
were burned and 25 houses damaged in the brawl, it said.
	   Bali is located about 945 kilometers (590 miles) east of the
capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
	   The daily Kompas reported Saturday that the fight broke out
early on the previous day when seven people visiting a friend in
another village were beaten up by a mob consisting of hundreds of
village residents.
	   Two of the seven were beaten to death while two others were
still missing as of late Friday, the newspaper said.
	   In a revenge, residents of the town from which the seven victims
hailed captured the head of the other village and beat him to
death, the report said.
	   Antara quoted the chief of the local police department, Lt. Col.
Nasser Amir, as saying four people suspected of inciting the
violence were being interrogated.
	   Hundreds of security personnel went dispatched to restore order
to the area, it said.
	   Social turmoil has increased in Indonesia since the Southeast
Asian country was hit hard by a regional financial crisis last
year. Tensions have mounted amid mass unemployment, food shortages
and fears of political instability.

Organizers battle huge crowds at Asian Games soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Ticketless soccer fans scaled fences
and hurled bottles at police, and one person was slightly hurt, as
huge crowds descended Saturday on a Bangkok stadium for a charged
Asian Games match between Qatar and host Thailand, organizers said.
	   Officials fearful of trouble urged people to watch the match on
television at home after 80,000-strong crowds converged on the
60,000-seat Rajamangala National Stadium, said Torpong Sewarmra, a
spokesman for Asian Games organizers.
	   Some people threw plastic bottles of water at police; others
tried clambering over stadium fences and were repelled by police,
he said.
	   Thailand was looking for a win or draw in the second-round match
to advance to the soccer competition's knockout quarterfinals,
which start Monday.
	   Fighting erupted when Qatar and Thailand met last month in a
``friendly'' match ahead of the Asian Games. The match was
suspended after players from both sides punched, kicked and
body-slammed each other for several minutes, and several players on
both teams suffered slight injuries. Fans joined the melee,
throwing debris from the sidelines.
	   For Saturday's re-match, people began lining up for tickets at 5
a.m. The tickets went on sale three hours later and all 60,000
seats were sold out within two hours, leaving an estimated 20,000
people ticketless, Torpong said.
	   Police used loudspeakers to appeal for people to go home.
	   ``Police are trying not to use force but trying to negotiate
first,'' he said. ``Police aren't worried because Thai people are
very friendly and everyone understands there is a limit on seats.''
	   He said a giant television screen had been set up outside the
stadium for people to watch the match. The crowds were swollen by
people arriving for a sepak takraw match between Thailand and
Malaysia in a nearby arena, he added.
	   One person was slightly hurt in the jostling but did not require
hospital treatment, he said.

At Asian Games, smoking is all the rage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Cigarette smoking, taboo at sports
events in Europe and the United States, rages on at the Asian
version of the Olympics _ the Asian Games.
	   Coaches, managers, journalists and even athletes are seen
smoking at swimming pool side, snooker games and boxing rings, and
at cafes, disregarding Thai laws that bar smoking in any building.
	   Flight attendants on the national carrier Thai Airways make
announcements before landing in Bangkok warning visitors not to
smoke in buildings.
	   But at the non-smoking sporting arenas, smokers eagerly watch to
see if anyone has lit a cigarette. Once someone starts, others join
in.
	   Thailand is one of the few countries where cigarette packs carry
an extra warning stating that smoking can harm sex life.
	   All cigarette packs must carry the labels: ``Smoking causes
impotence'' and ``Smoking causes aging.''
	   The decision was taken in November after the National Committee
for the Control of Tobacco Use cited research by the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in New York, which showed that smoking
reduces blood flow to the male sexual organ.
	   Multinational tobacco companies are marketing aggressively in
Asia, looking to the region's vast young population to offset a
loss of business in the West.

Japan prods major bank to request government take-over

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. said Saturday that
financial authorities had asked it to request a government takeover
of its operations, effectively becoming the second major bank to
collapse in two months.
	   The Financial Supervisory Agency delivered an ultimatum to
Nippon Credit's president, Shigeoki Togo, after determining the
bank was insolvent due to its massive burden of bad loans, said a
bank spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   NCB would be only the second bank in Japan to be put under state
control since World War II. The government nationalized the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. on Oct. 23.
	   After meeting financial authorities at the Prime Minister's
Office, NCB head Togo called an emergency board meeting to discuss
the government's request.
	   But a government official said the bank would be nationalized
Sunday regardless of the board's decision, Kyodo News agency
reported.
	   The move was widely expected after merger talks collapsed
between NCB and suitor Chuo Trust and Banking Co.
	   Nippon Credit has 2,000 employees and the bank was one of the
fifty largest in the world, according to a 1997 ranking by Fortune
magazine. NCB has assets totaling 12.34 trillion yen (dlrs 106
billion), but some 3.2 trillion yen (dlrs 27 billion) of its loans
were at risk of being unpaid, according to Kyodo.
	   Like many other Japanese lenders, NCB's bad loans mounted after
the collapse of inflated real estate and stock prices early this
decade.
	   Nippon Credit is one of three of Japan's so-called long-term
credit banks. These banks financed the rebuilding of Japanese
industry following World War II by providing companies long-term,
low-cost loans. But deregulation has allowed more companies to
raise money directly from financial markets and the banks have
failed to find a new role.
	   The government has stepped in to aid NCB before. Last April,
finance officials asked a group of financial institutions and the
central bank to contribute to a fund to bailout the lender.

	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ As rescue workers combed through
the wreckage of a Thai Airways jetliner Saturday searching for
survivors and the bodies of victims, police said they expect the
final death toll from the crash to total 101 people.
	   Thailand's Transport and Communications Minister, Suthep
Thaugsuban, said that of the 146 on board, 87 people were confirmed
dead and 45 had survived. Suthep's sister, Siriwan, was among the
victims killed in the crash.
	   The remaining 14 people were still missing, but police said they
doubted any more survivors would be found.
	   Burned and bruised corpses were lined up on the floor of the
passenger terminal at Surat Thani airport, and police said they
were having difficulty identifying some of the dead.
	   At the scene of the crash in a muddy swamp, workers using
specially-designed equipment cut through what remained of the jet's
fuselage to extract bodies and anyone who might still be alive
inside.
	   Battling a heavy rainstorm, Thai Airways Flight TG261, an Airbus
A310-200, plunged into the swamp at around 6:45 p.m. on Friday
after bursting into flames.
	   Earlier reports said it crashed about five kilometers (three
miles) from the airport, but the airline later gave the distance as
about 700 meters (765 yards) from the air strip.
	   It was the third attempt by the jetliner to land at Surat Thani,
a fishing port and travel hub for vacation resorts located 330
miles (530 kilometers) southwest of Bangkok.
	   Police said the black box, or flight recorder, had been
recovered early Saturday.
	   ``We don't know yet. It's very difficult to guess, we cannot
guess, it has to be investigated,'' said Thai Airways President
Thamnoon Wanglee when asked about the cause of the crash.
	   The passengers were mostly Thais. Of the 25 foreigners on board,
11 had survived, including three Japanese. Three of the foreigners,
including one Japanese citizen, were confirmed dead and the rest
were still missing, police said.
	   Thawat Wichaidit, 58, a member of Parliament from Surat Thani,
also died.
	   Many of the dead were believed to have drowned in the waist-high
swamp water while trapped in the wreckage.
	   Some 200 rescue workers and volunteers from nearby villagers
struggled to pull bodies from the burnt, twisted metal of the
wrecked plane. The rescue operation was scaled back early Saturday
due to dark, rainy conditions but began again in full force at
daybreak.
	   ``I pulled out about 20 dead bodies,'' said Pornsak Jaratrae,
23, who rushed to the scene from his village when he heard there
was a crash.
	   ``We had to dive into the freezing water to find bodies. It was
so difficult, I never did anything like that before,'' a soaked and
shivering Pornsak said.
	   He said volunteers initially were turned back from the site
until equipment arrived for dousing flames from the still-burning
aircraft.
	   Police said at least five children _ four boys and a girl _ were
among the hospitalized survivors.
	   Ambulances were unable to reach the crash site, leaving
four-wheel-drive vehicles to navigate the mud. Still, officials
said the water that has hampered rescuers may have cushioned the
aircraft's impact.
	   Flight attendant Akradej Pudemha said that as the plane shook
violently on its third attempt to land, some passengers began to
panic.
	   ``People started screaming. I told them to calm down, but some
were out of control. They wouldn't stay in their seats. They were
thrown around by the shaking of the plane and luggage was flying
everywhere,'' he said.
	   ``I don't remember hitting the ground, just people screaming and
being in half a plane,'' said Lucinda Rhodes, an Australian
survivor, from a hospital bed. ``The aircraft split lengthwise
because there was another whole bit of it about 20 meters (yards)
away but we were in a tree.''
	   Lying in a nearby bed, Australian Melanie McNamee said her
friend Lucinda saved her life.
	   ``She was dragging me along because I could barely walk because
I'd fractured three ribs and also a fracture in my spine,'' she
said. ``We were running through all these swamps just trying to get
away from the airplane before it blew up.''
	   A gardener living near the crash site, Sophon Sapkong, 42, said
he heard a loud noise, came out of his home and saw ``the airplane
try to go up high. Then I saw a light, bright like the sunset,
about four stories off the ground, then a fireball falling.''
	   The airline released a passenger list that indicated most of the
132 passengers were Thais, but there were also several Western and
Japanese names. The list did not include the passengers'
nationalities. The remaining 14 people were crew members.
	   Airbus announced from its headquarters in Toulouse, France, that
it would send five specialists to assist Thai authorities in their
investigation.
	   Airbus said the plane was delivered in April 1986 and had
accumulated 23,000 flight hours.

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Heavy fog delayed the start of the third
day's play in the second cricket test between Pakistan and Zimbabwe
here on Saturday.
	   Pakistan was due to resume its first innings at the overnight
total of 184 for five, but early morning fog didn't allow a single
ball to be bowled before lunch. The play will likely begin after
lunch when umpires Darrell Hair and Mian Aslam make an inspection
at 12:40 p.m.(0600 gmt).
	   Captain Moin Khan was unbeaten on 18 while Yousaf Youhanna was
not out on 30 when play was stopped due to bad light Friday
evening, 35 minutes before schedule. Zimbabwe made 183 in its first
innings.

Palestinian radicals meet to oppose charter's amendment

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hard-line Arabs opposed to Palestinian
peace deals with Israel open a conference here Saturday to counter
mainstream Palestinian moves to amend a charter that calls for
Israel's destruction.
	   More than 300 delegates are registered to attend the meeting
called by 10 Damascus-based radical groups, the largest gathering
of Palestinian opposition leaders in years.
	   The delegates, assembling at the Youth City sports complex in
the Syrian capital of Damascus, were expected to reaffirm their
allegiance to an un-altered Palestinian National Charter.
	   A meeting of the Palestinian National Council, or parliament, is
scheduled to meet on Monday to nullify those parts of the charter
that deny Israel's right to exist.
	   The amendment is in line with the Wye River accord signed in
October by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The PNC meeting in Gaza City is
expected to be attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   ``No one can amend the (Palestinian) charter before Palestinian
rights are fully met,'' Maher Taher, spokesman for the radical,
Syrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, told
The Associated Press Friday.
	   But in a hint that the group could recognize the state of Israel
in the future, Taher added: ``If Israel wants to live peacefully
with Palestinians, we can find solutions for that.''
	   The two-day Damascus conference will be chaired by Khaled
al-Fahoum, a former chairman of the PNC.
	   Among the participants are leaders who figure high on Israel's
list of persons wanted for violence.
	   They include Ahmed Jibril of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, George Habash of the PFLP,
Nayef Hawatmeh of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, and Ramadan Abdullah Shallah of Islamic Jihad.
	   Among the other militant groups expected at the conference are
Fateh Uprising and Hamas, which carried out a series of suicide
bombings in Israel in recent years.
	   Delegates were also expected from Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Europe
and North America.

More than 150 kilograms of cocaine found hidden in aircraft tire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Authorities in Hong Kong seized 156 kilograms
(343 pounds) of high-grade cocaine found hidden in an aircraft
tire, customs officers said Saturday.
	   The drugs, worth U.S. dlrs 23 million, were found when customs
officers inspected a cargo aircraft undergoing maintenance, customs
chief Chan Hon-kit told reporters.
	   Authorities were alerted when they noticed a spare tire ``of
extraordinary weight'' apparently left idle with other cargo items.
Over 140 plastic-wrapped slabs of cocaine were found inside the
tire, Chan said.
	   No arrests have been made, and the case is still under
investigation, Chan added.
	   Chan said the drugs were not intended for the local market since
there was little demand for cocaine in Hong Kong. He did not give
details if the drugs were meant for other countries.
	   The cargo plane had stopped at various cities in Europe, North
and South America before flying into Hong Kong for maintenance, a
government statement said.
	   Hong Kong authorities have cracked down heavily on production
and distribution of illicit drugs, forcing drug syndicates run by
triads _ or Chinese gangs _ to smuggle increasing amounts of the
finished product.
	   In October, authorities seized more than 170 kilograms (375
pounds) of high-grade matamphetamine hydrochloride _ or ``ice'' _
and heroin in a waterfront raid, the largest haul ever in Hong
Kong.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Under lavish crystal chandeliers, Hong Kong's
socialites glitter with jade and diamonds as they nibble at caviar.
Their smiles and outfits grace the society pages and details of
their lives _ love affairs, health and bank accounts _ are the talk
of the town.
	   But behind the veil of glamour, Hong Kong's super-rich as well
as its merely rich are learning to mind their dollars and cents as
the territory's economy slides deeper into recession, thanks to the
Asian financial crisis.
	   ``People are watching what they spend _ even the rich and
famous,'' said Allan Zeman, chairman of Lan Kwai Fong Holdings,
which controls properties in Hong Kong's trendy Lan Kwai Fong
neighborhood. ``Times are tougher in Asia right now and I think
people are conscious about it.''
	   Socialite and event organizer Henry Lee's calendar is a
testimony to the cutbacks.
	   Last year between September and the Chinese New Year in late
January, he attended three or four functions every week. This year:
three so far.
	   Lee said event organizers are finding it harder to sell tables,
even though prices have fallen.
	   ``The economic situation is getting worse, and the clients want
to use a smaller budget to get the same publicity,'' said Lee,
director of Top Pacific Communications.
	   Last year, many companies would spend up to dlrs 250,000 to
entertain dozens of affluent socialites at fancy hotels and aboard
luxurious yachts.
	   This year, many opt for cheaper alternatives, such as fashion
shows and product launch parties at high-end cafes and retail
outlets, Lee said.
	   Top fashion houses are suffering as the rich affluent scale
back.
	   Luxury retailer Dicksons Concepts, the parent of Ralph Lauren
and Escada in Hong Kong, reported its first loss of dlrs 37 million
for the six months to Sept. 30, compared with a profit of dlrs 25
million in the same period last year.
	   Joyce Boutique Holdings Ltd., a retail empire running stores of
Prada, Miu Miu, Giorgio Armani, Jil Sander and Dolce and Gabbana,
had to close several outlets in the region after reporting hefty
losses.
	   ``Before, some people would come in and buy four or five gowns
at a time, and pick just one to wear before the ball. Now, they
would come in right before the ball and just pick one,'' said Windy
Chan, a saleswoman at Dolce and Gabbana.
	   An average ball gown there costs dlrs 6,400, five times the
median monthly income in Hong Kong.
	   Chan said Hong Kong's ``Tai Tais,'' or wives of the super-rich,
would buy everything from handbags and shoes to stockings to match
their gowns a year ago.
	   ``Now, they would buy the gown here, then go somewhere else to
find cheaper accessories to match,'' she said.
	   Ong Chin-huat, social editor at the South China Morning Post,
said some socialites are even seen wearing clothes from the last
season _ quite a faux pas.
	   ``They can never be photographed wearing the same clothes
twice,'' said Yolanda Choy, the local spokeswoman for Christian
Dior and one of Hong Kong's most photographed celebrities.
	   Second-hand clothing shops are doing brisk business.
	   But people are far from giving up on glamour. The affluent are
still buying, and the champagne still flows _ although Dom Perignon
may be replaced by the cheaper-but-still-elegant Mumm Cordon Rouge.
	   Perhaps the socialites have a little something to be thankful
for this season _ lower prices thanks to different designs.
	   A Christian Dior gown costs dlrs 5,128, about half of its price
in the summer, because expensive silk, silver threats and more
elaborate trimmings are out. Simplicity is in.
	   Ong predicted that the party would go on despite the recession.
	   ``Recession never hits the super-rich,'' he said. ``Maybe they
have a few of the zeros knocked off their bank accounts. But
there's still a lot of zeros left.''

First Presidents Cup trophy awaits International team

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ No, this Presidents Cup isn't a war.
The United States is hardly even putting up a fight.
	   With another stunning 18th-hole birdie and perfection from one
of its least-known players, the International team all but clinched
its first Presidents Cup on Saturday at Royal Melbourne Golf Club.
	   At the end of a day in which the wind switched to the south and
dropped afternoon temperatures, the one constant was the remarkable
_ the Americans might call it unbelievable _ play of the
International team.
	   After winning 4 1-2 of a possible five points in the morning
alternate-shot matches, including one on a 50-foot chip-in for
birdie on the 18th hole by Australian Craig Parry, the
International team held off any U.S. hopes for a comeback to build
a lead that is virtually insurmountable.
	   The International team is up 14 1-2 to 5 1-2 and needs to win
only two of the 12 singles matches Sunday.
	   ``We haven't got it yet, but we're looking good,'' said Greg
Norman, 3-0-1 in four matches with fellow Aussie Steve Elkington.
	   The United States, needing to mount some semblance of a charge
in the afternoon best-ball matches, watched its hopes fall apart on
the closing holes.
	   Norman, the man most responsible for moving the matches out of
the United
	   States after two appearances at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club
in Virginia, made a 15-foot birdie putt on the 14th hole to give
himself and Elkington the lead over Fred Couples and Davis Love
III.
	   They closed out the final match at 2-up when Norman knocked down
the flag
	   at the 17th and the Americans, typical of their entire day,
couldn't make a birdie putt.
	   Tiger Woods and John Huston made a spirited comeback from 4-down
after six holes and 2-down with three holes to play when Woods made
birdie putts of 4 and 30 feet.
	   But Ernie Els won the match 1-up with a 12-foot birdie putt on
the 18th, and Huston's 10-footer to halve never had a chance.
	   ``I'm very disappointed,'' Woods said. ``They are just doing the
right things at the right time. It's frustrating. I don't know what
else we could have done. This is what match play is all about.''
	   But who would have figured this?
	   David Duval, the leading money-winner on the U.S. PGA Tour and
perhaps the most dominant player in the world, is 0-3-1, while
Shigeki Maruyama of Japan hasn't lost yet.
	   Maruyama, paired with Joe Ozaki in a best-ball match against
Duval and Mickelson, closed out the match with three straight
birdies for a 3 and 2 victory.
	   Japan's mighty mite also came up big in the morning, holing a
35-foot birdie putt to bring the alternate-shot match even against
Woods and Couples,
	   then watching with delight as Parry, his partner, pulled off
another last-hole shocker.
	   One day after Frank Nobilo's thunderous 40-foot birdie putt on
the 18th green gave the International team a jump start, Parry
found himself in about the same position, needing to get up and
down to halve the match.
	   Instead, he rammed in the 50-foot chip for a 1-up victory that
swung the tide in the International's favor.
	   ``It's unbelievable what they did,'' Couples said. ``The
35-footer on 17,
	   and then 18 was just plain goofy.''
	   And yet, the International team was doing it all day _ Norman's
chip-in for birdie from 75 feet on the third hole of the best-ball
match after Couples hit it stiff for a shoo-in birdie; and Nobilo
with two more putts over 30 feet and two shorter ones that helped
he and Greg Turner beat Love and Justin Leonard in the morning
alternate-shot match.
	   ``They're playing great golf _ holing all their shots,
up-and-downs everywhere, and making so many birdie runs that it's
hard to stop them,'' Woods said.
	   Both captains, Jack Nicklaus and Peter Thomson, had said
throughout the week that these matches would not turn into the
war-like mentality that has marked the Ryder Cup over the past 10
years.
	   No need to worry about that.
	   After two days and 20 matches, this is what the United States _
described
	   by Thomson in opening ceremonies as the ``greatest collection of
players in the world'' _ has to show for it: four matches won
outright, and a futile search for an answer. (df/djp)

Chimpanzee's plight may spark tourist boycott of Thailand

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Despite being far from his African
home, Ola the chimpanzee led something of a magical childhood.
	   He performed on stage in a Stockholm production of August
Strindberg's ``Gustav III,'' was the subject of a children's book
and lived as a family member with a Swedish couple.
	   Now, however, the conditions at the Thai safari park where the
12-year-old is now being held have become the focus of souring
relations between Sweden and Thailand and could end in a Swedish
tourist boycott of the Southeast Asian country.
	   Last week, Louise Tillberg, Stephen Karlsen and two Swedish
television journalists came to Safari World in Bangkok, where Ola
has lived since 1995, to film him for a documentary.
	   Instead, according to the Swedes, a dozen armed security guards
threw them out, while more surrounded Ola's cage so they couldn't
take his picture.
	   A fuming zoo official, with security guards behind him, screamed
at the Swedes to turn over their videotape, they said.
	   ``They were really angry and threatening. It was scary. I know I
had the shakes for a while afterwards,'' said cameraman Masse
Soderstrom.
	   Safari World said it had denied the Swedes in advance permission
to film, so they should not have come.
	   ``Right away they started taking pictures for some bad
purpose,'' said Pin Kewpaisal, Safari World's owner. ``They are
liars who want to tarnish my reputation.''
	   Swedish animal rights activists say Ola is being mistreated at
Safari World, a privately-owned wildlife park popular with
families.
	   They say that Ola, who was free to roam in an open-air enclosure
in a Swedish zoo, has been kept with three female chimps in a
cramped, 14-square-meter (150-square-foot) cage at Safari World for
three years in an attempt to force them to breed.
	   So far, they haven't.
	   If Safari World won't send Ola to a reserve for chimpanzees in
Zambia, the Swedish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals says it will launch a tourism boycott and ask its 60,000
members across Scandinavia to picket travel offices that promote
Thailand.
	   Pin insists Ola is not being abused. Concerned about the
country's image, Thailand's Foreign Ministry has investigated and
agrees the chimpanzee is being handled well _ though that
conclusion contradicts the general findings of the expert the
ministry contracted.
	   ``If he's not being mistreated, then why are they so afraid to
let us take pictures of him?'' Tillberg asks.
	   Tillberg and Karlsen are not animal rights activists. They are,
in their words, Ola's godparents. Tillberg is a painter. Karlsen is
an actor, and one-year-old Ola lived with the couple when he
performed in ``Gustav III.''
	   ``It was an unforgettable year. Ola became like one of our
children,'' Karlsen said.
	   In 1995, they heard that Olands Zoo, which owned Ola, was going
to sell him. They pleaded with the owner to send Ola to Chimfunshi
Wildlife Orphanage in Zambia, but he refused.
	   Then they read in the newspapers that Ola had been sold. The zoo
owner wouldn't reveal to whom, Karlsen said. Finally, this year
they learned he was at Safari World, and in May they came to visit.
	   ``He recognized us immediately,'' Tillberg said. ``But after the
initial joy, it was clear he was miserable. You could see it in his
eyes. He was begging, grabbing our hands as if to say, `Help me.'
His face was pale, sickly.''
	   The Swedish Embassy began lobbying for Ola's release. Karlsen
and Tillberg spoke to the media about his plight, news of which
mobilized animal rights activists.
	   Thailand's Foreign Ministry asked Roger Lohanan of the Thailand
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to investigate.
	   Safari World insists Ola is frequently allowed to roam in a
spacious enclosure.
	   Lohanan, who said Safari World isn't intentionally mistreating
the chimpanzees, said that isn't true.
	   ``Ola has been kept in the breeding cage the entire time,'' he
said, adding that for Ola, who has experienced more freedom, ``it's
cruel.''
	   Swedish activists want to buy Ola back, but Pin won't sell. He
wants another male in exchange for breeding, and the Foreign
Ministry is urging the Swedes to find him one.
	   The activists, however, say they won't subject another
chimpanzee to Safari World's conditions.
	   ``It's heartbreaking,'' Karlsen said. ``If they don't find a
solution soon then the activists will begin their boycott, and I
don't know where this will end.''

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Tropical storm Faith headed for
Vietnam Saturday after battering the central Philippines, leaving
at least five people dead and forcing the evacuation nearly 10,000,
disaster officials said.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said three people drowned at
sea in Antique and Aklan provinces while two were crushed by a
falling tree in Iloilo province.
	   Seven people were still missing, he said.
	   Nearly 10,000 people stayed in government shelters at the height
of the storm, but many have returned to repair their damaged homes,
officials said.
	   The storm caused flash floods, uprooted trees and electrical
posts and left a wide swath in the central Philippines without
electricity.
	   At noon (0400 GMT), Faith was about 400 kilometers (250 miles)
west northwest of Puerto Princesa, the country's westernmost
province. It was packing sustained winds of 120 kilometers (75
miles) per hour and gusts of up to 150 kilometers (94 miles) as it
moves west southwest at 24 kilometers (15 miles) per hour towards
Vietnam, the Manila weather bureau said.

Palestinian radicals meet to oppose charter's amendment

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hard-line Arabs opposed to Palestinian
peace deals with Israel open a conference here Saturday to counter
mainstream Palestinian moves to amend a charter that calls for
Israel's destruction.
	   More than 300 delegates are registered to attend the meeting
called by 10 Damascus-based radical groups, the largest gathering
of Palestinian opposition leaders in years.
	   The delegates, assembling at the Youth City sports complex in
the Syrian capital of Damascus, were expected to reaffirm their
allegiance to an unaltered Palestinian National Charter.
	   A meeting of the Palestinian National Council, or parliament, is
scheduled to meet on Monday to nullify those parts of the charter
that deny Israel's right to exist.
	   The amendment is in line with the Wye River accord signed in
October by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The PNC meeting in Gaza City is
expected to be attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   ``No one can amend the (Palestinian) charter before Palestinian
rights are fully met,'' Maher Taher, spokesman for the radical,
Syrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, told
The Associated Press Friday.
	   But in a hint that the group could recognize the state of Israel
in the future, Taher added: ``If Israel wants to live peacefully
with Palestinians, we can find solutions for that.''
	   The two-day Damascus conference will be chaired by Khaled
al-Fahoum, a former chairman of the PNC.
	   Among the participants are leaders who figure high on Israel's
list of persons wanted for violence.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Zarak Jehan twice came from one game
down Saturday to beat fellow Pakistani Amjad Khan, the Pakistan
Open champion, for the men's squash gold medal at the Asian Games.
	   Malaysia's Nicol David, the top seed, beat Hong Kong's Chiu
Wing-yin 9-3, 9-1, 9-6 for the women's gold.
	   Jehan won 1-9, 9-0, 6-9, 9-7, 9-3 against the 18-year-old Khan.
	   Last month, Khan came out of obscurity to win the Pakistan Open,
beating sixth seed Graham Ryding of Canada 15-8, 11-15, 15-9,
13-15, 15-8 in the final. Khan is the nephew of former world No. 1
Jansher Khan, who had elected not to defend his Pakistan Open title
this year.
	   Jehan's gold was Pakistan's second of these games.
	   Bronze medals went to Hong Kong's Abdul-Fahim Khan, who lost to
Amjad Khan in the semifinals, and Malaysia's Low Ewe-loong, who
lost to Jehan.
	   With her victory, David gave Malaysia its third gold here. Hong
Kong gained its first silver, to go with four bronzes.
	   Women's bronzes went to two Singaporeans _ Lee Li-ling, who lost
to Chiu in the semifinals, and Mah Li-lian, who lost to David.

England replies with 160 for three to Australia's 391

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Two contentious decisions plunged
England into
	   early trouble in the third cricket test against Australia at the
Adelaide Oval on Saturday.
	   After Justin Langer's unbeaten 179 had propped Australia to 391
all out, England, from a shaky 84 for three, recovered to 160
without further loss at stumps on the second day.
	   After opener Mark Butcher was adjudged leg before wicket by
Australian umpire Steve Davis, an England batting revival was
cruelly cut short when Mike Atherton (41) was given out by
television umpire Paul Angley.
	   Atherton edged leg spinner Stuart MacGill and skipper Mark
Taylor claimed the catch at slip. As the ball appeared to be caught
on the half volley, the two umpires Davis and Steve Bucknor
referred it to Angley.
	   After just two inconclusive replays, Angley signalled Atherton
out to end a blossoming 65-run stand with Nasser Hussain unbeaten
on 58.
	   Television replays remained inconclusive as to whether Taylor
just managed to get his finger underneath the dropping ball.
	   ``I told the umpire that I wasn't sure, and I left it to the
third umpire,'' Taylor said.
	   Later Saturday, England lodged an official complaint over the
incident with the International Cricket Council match referee John
Reid of New Zealand.
	   And, in a statement issued by manager Graham Gooch, said that it
is in no way a complaint against Taylor or the sportsmanship of the
Australian team, but ``the manner in which the decision was made in
a short space of time.''
	   Five balls later Alec Stewart's tour nightmare continued _ he
was dismissed for naught, caught at bat/pad. His scores in the
series have been 8, 3, 38, 0, and 0.
	   It was his fifth duck on tour as captain.
	   But Hussain, joined by Mark Ramprakash, 45 not out, boldly
resurrected the sagging innings with an unfinished 76-run stand in
80 minutes.
	   The fourth-wicket pair batted admirably on a dusty and turning
pitch against MacGill and the off spin of Colin Miller and Mark
Waugh.
	   Utility bowler Miller claimed the first wicket, trapping Butcher
for six.
	   But the day belonged to Langer, the nuggety left hander who
occupied the crease for over eight hours to rescue Australia from
batting mediocrity.
	   Apart from Langer's hundred, the other major contributors were
Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh, who made 59 apiece.
	   Ricky Ponting, the talented right-hander, put his long-term test
career on line with yet another failure, scoring just five in 32
minutes.
	   With the series at its half way stage, Ponting is yet to make a
substantial contribution from the vital No. 6 once occupied by
Waugh.
	   England bowled outstandingly with the second new ball claiming
five wickets in the pre-lunch session.
	   Headley, on a test recall, was the pick of the England with
4-97. Gough, who has seven catches dropped off him in the series
finished, with 3-103 and deservingly claimed Glenn McGrath's wicket
to end the Australian innings.
	   Off spinner Peter Such took 3-99 in 38 overs. (djp)

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to CORRECT slug &QL; 
 &UR; Maple Leafs 3, Blackhawks 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Chicago, Glenn Healy, back in the NHL after his recall this
week from the minors, made 28 saves to lead the Toronto Maple Leafs
over the Chicago Blackhawks.
	   Healy, who had been recalled from the Chicago Wolves of the IHL,
was called up only because backup goaltender Felix Potvin had
walked out on the team because they had been having trouble trading
him.
	   Todd Warriner, Alyn McCauley and Mats Sundin scored as the Maple
Leafs extended their unbeaten streak at the United Center to seven
games (6-0-1). Doug Gilmour and Daniel Cleary scored for Chicago.
 &UR; Stars 3, Canadiens 2
	   In Dallas, Jamie Langenbrunner's tiebreaking goal with 2:49 to
play led the Dallas Stars over the struggling Montreal Canadiens.
	   Goals by Benoit Brunet and Jonas Hoglund over a 16-second span
late in the second period had lifted the Canadiens into a 2-2 tie.
But with overtime looming late in the third, Mike Modano worked the
puck free to Langenbrunner, who skated in front of the net and beat
Montreal goalie Jose Theodore for his fifth goal.
	   The Canadiens are winless in their last eight road games (0-7-1)
and are 2-11-1 in their last 14 overall.

Little-known Japanese goes four for four in Presidents Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Relatively unknown outside his home
country, Japan's Shigeki Maruyama is the only player to have played
matches in all four rounds of the Presidents Cup and won them all.
	   In contrast are Americans Jim Furyk, No. 3 on the U.S. PGA Tour
list, and U.S. Tour No. 10 John Huston, who have both played three
out of four rounds and won none of the matches.
	   None of the Americans have an unblemished record.
	   The best is Fred Couples, who has played on the Presidents Cup
team three times. After four matches, he is 2-2.
	   All the other Americans have either had only one win, or, at
best, one win and halve.
	   Four of the International team _ Australians Greg Norman, Steve
Elkington and Stuart Appleby and Fiji's Vijay Singh _ have three
wins from four starts.
	   With almost no English, Maruyama said the success of the two
Japanese players could be explained by their desire to show the
world that Japanese golf is of world standard.
	   Asked if he and Ozaki have magic putters, the almost-always
smiling Maruyama said emphatically: ``Yes.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TALKING NO PROBLEM: The language barrier proved to be no barrier
at all for Maruyama and his Australian foursomes partner Craig
Parry.
	   Despite neither speaking much of the other's language,
Melbourne-born Parry was able to give his partner some local tips
about the hot northerly wind that started blowing at Royal
Melbourne on Friday.
	   Observing that the Americans had started choosing wrong clubs
for the wind, local expert Parry started having a quiet word into
Maruyama's ear.
	   `I hit it were Mr. Parry told me to hit it,'' Maruyama said. The
result was a 3-2 victory over Lee Janzen and Scott Hoch, so good
International team
	   captain Peter Thomsom paired them again Saturday.
	   That day the pupil gave the teacher a lesson after Parry
overplayed a shot out of the rough on the par-4 4th, chipping the
ball over the green and rolling it 30 feet down.
	   Maruyama, who has eight Japanese PGA Tour victories and who
rarely takes more than one practice swing per shot, sent it
straight back up the hill to strike the flag pole. But the ball
didn't drop in and the hole was halved.
	   At the 17th, Maruyama sank a 35-foot birdie putt to square the
match against Fred Couples and Tiger Woods.
	   At the 18th, needing to get up and down to halve the
alternate-shot match, Parry rammed home a 50-foot birdie chip.
	   Of Woods and Couples, Parry said: ``It's nice to have those
scalps.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BLISTERING CONDITIONS: Walking the more than six kilometers it
takes to go round Royal Melbourne's 18 holes is taking its toll,
and not just on Presidents Cup competitors.
	   American Tiger Woods' girlfriend Joanna Jagoda abandoned the
team uniform
	   of sneakers in favor of sandals to watch Woods' foursomes match
on the second day of play Saturday, revealing heavy dressings on
the back of both heels from blisters.
	   No such problems for Barbara Nicklaus who consoled Jagoda on the
seventh hole from the comfort of team captain's Jack Nicklaus' golf
cart.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   EYE ON THE BALL: Australian Greg Norman forgot to yell ``fore''
before throwing the ball he had just retrieved from the cup to Joe
Grillo, caddy for
	   his countryman and foursomes partner Steve Elkington.
	   Grillo wasn't looking and caught the ball full in the eye, after
Norman made par and halved the 16th hole during the pair's
foursomes match Friday against Jim Furyk and John Huston.
	   Grillo doubled up with pain and took some time to recover,
holding up the
	   match.
	   Elkington told some impatient onlookers to ``give the guy a
break.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``Actually we all had a bad meal Thursday
night. We're all sick. Nobody feels good, that's the reason we are
losing.''
	   ``I wish,'' Justin Leonard explaining why the U.S. is losing the
Presidents Cup. (rs/djp)

	   In Anaheim, California, Marty McInnis scored a power-play goal
3:46 into the game and Anaheim goaltender Guy Hebert made that
stand as the Mighty Ducks beat the Washington Capitals.
	   Hebert stopped 31 shots while recording his third shutout of the
season and 19th of his career.
	   McInnis knocked in a rebound after Washington goalie Olaf Kolzig
blocked Paul Kariya's 55-foot backhander. The goal came while
defenseman Mark Tinordi was serving a penalty for holding Kariya.

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Southeast Asian economic ministers have
told senior officials to go back to the drawing board and devise
stronger measures to help the region recover from its economic
crisis, a spokesman said Saturday.
	   ``The officials did not come up with enough bold measures,''
Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul told reporters as
ASEAN economic ministers and foreign ministers met separately
Saturday.
	   Senior ASEAN officials started meeting here earlier in the week
to hammer out a joint declaration and a plan of action to be
submitted for approval by leaders of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations at their summit, which starts next week.
	   Kobsak said the ministers are pressing for stronger measures
because the countries ``want to send a clear message that ASEAN is
facing the challenge'' of the economic crisis.
	   The ministers also want to speed up the pace of reform. In an
effort to shore up investor confidence, some moves on trade and
investment would ``be effective almost immediately,'' Thai Deputy
Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said.
	   ``Overall, we're now moving faster with our game plan,'' he
said. ``That's a positive result of the crisis. Before the crisis,
this would have not been possible.''
	   One measure would be to hasten implementation of an ASEAN Free
Trade Area by moving the timetable for eliminating some trade
tariffs a year earlier to 2002.
	   ``For some countries, this is really going to be bold,''
Indonesian Senior Economics Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Saturday afternoon
that he and his counterparts had finished work on the plan of
action and were doing ``a few updatings'' on the final declaration.
	   Asked what was the key ingredient in the plan of action, Alatas
said: ``There we elaborate on ASEAN's vision for 2020 with a very
complete plan of action for the next six years.''
	   He said Malaysia's controversial capital controls, which have
curtailed access to the economy for foreign investors and currency
traders, were discussed.
	   ``We are of the view that each country has the right to
determine for itself what the best policies are in order to get out
of the crisis,'' Alatas said.
	   ``The situation is not the same in each country. What pertains
in Malaysia does not necessarily pertain in Indonesia and vice
versa. We leave it for each country to decide.''
	   One goal is to encourage equitable development to prevent ASEAN
from becoming a two-tiered group of less-developed and rapidly
industrializing nations. But the region's economies already range
from powerhouses like Singapore to some of the world's poorest
countries.
	   The foreign ministers failed to reach a consensus at a four-hour
dinner Friday night on whether to admit Cambodia into ASEAN now, an
issue that had threatened to overshadow the economic moves.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Thailand wins Asian Games gold in sepak takraw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand racked up another Asian Games
gold Saturday with a convincing victory over Myanmar in the women's
team competition of sepak takraw, sparking frenzied celebrations by
the home crowd.
	   One delighted member of the Thai team grabbed her young son from
the stands for a victory lap of the arena. The crowd, which had
been growing noisier with each point, erupted with screaming and
cheering as the team clinched gold by winning the second set 15-5,
15-9 for an unassailable 2-0 lead in the best-of-three set final.
	   Thailand won the first set 15-6, 15-13 and was ahead early in
the third set too.
	   It was Thailand's eight gold overall at these games.
	   China and Vietnam, the semifinal losers, got bronze. Sepak
takraw is akin to volleyball, with players using their feet to kick
a rattan ball back and forth across a net.
	   Cheering, flag-waving and kazoo-playing erupted from the crowd
every time Thailand scored, and spectators joined in the wave.
	   The Thai team and spectators fed off each other, with players
gesturing to the crowd to make more noise.
	   The men's team from Myanmar, which was on the sidelines watching
and had been quite boisterous at the start, grew quieter and
quieter as their women's team edged nearer to defeat.
	   Thailand was to play Malaysia later for the men's gold.

Report: Kin of massacre victims forced in marriage to keep
</HEADLINE>
compensation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An 18-year-old girl was forced into
marrying the eight-year-old brother of her husband who was
massacred in a caste conflict so that the compensation money would
stay within the family, a newsweekly reported.
	   Punia Devi told The Week magazine that her inlaws forced her
into marrying Dhaman Chaudhury recently so that they did not have
to part with the 200,000 rupees (dlrs 4,700) she got from the
government for the deaths of her husband and two children.
	   Police have not acted so far on the reports of the forced
marriage, according to the magazine, which will hit the stands
Sunday. An advance copy of the article was given to The Associated
Press.
	   One year ago, a militia supporting upper-caste landowners gunned
down 58 villagers backing a leftist underground movement of mostly
farm hands and poor low-caste people.
	   Caste conflicts are frequent in India, where a large number of
low-caste people have no education or do not get help from
government officials as readily as those belonging to upper castes.
	   A year after the massacre at Lakshmanpur Bathe village in Bihar,
the most lawless state in India, residents say at least two such
forced marriages have been recorded there.
	   Widows frequently are forced to marry the brothers of their dead
husband in many rural areas of India, mostly to ensure that the
wealth remains within the family. In some communities, brothers
share one wife so that the fortunes do not get split up. Although
such practices are illegal, police rarely act on them because they
have social sanction.

Noted Muslim opposition leader urges elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A prominent Muslim opposition leader
urged President B.J. Habibie on Saturday to hold presidential
elections next fall as originally promised.
	   During nearly two hours of talks with the Indonesian president,
Abdurrahman Wahid, the leader of the country's largest Muslim
organization, Nahdlatul Ulama, expressed his opposition to
Habibie's plan to postpone the election to December 1999.
	   ``I proposed to the president that ... the new elected president
would take the oath of office on Nov. 10'' of 1999, Wahid said
after the meeting at Habibie's residence in central Jakarta.
	   President Habibie responded positively to the proposal but said
it would have to be decided by the People's Consultative Assembly,
the nation's highest constitutional body, said Wahid.
	   Habibie and lawmakers agreed last week to hold elections on June
7 for the Parliament, whose members would make up the People's
Consultative Assembly, along with some presidential appointees.
	   Wahid, popularly known as Gus Dur, had also earlier suggested
the need to hold a public dialogue about solving Indonesia's
current economic crisis. Habibie has already rejected the proposal,
arguing it was difficult to pick up the participants who really
represent the national interest.
	   State Secretary Akbar Tanjung, who accompanied Habibie during
Saturday's meeting, said the president welcomed such a dialogue but
saw no need to be institutionalized.
	   ``The dialogue can be held wherever, including through mass
media,'' said Tanjung. ``This morning's meeting was already a
dialogue and it is unnecessary to be institutionalized.''
	   Wahid's 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama has set up its own
political party, which many believe will be a strong contender for
next year's Parliament elections.

Rebellious governor gains popular backing to run as president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ James Soong, the powerful but rebellious
Taiwan provincial governor, is viewed by the public as the
politician most likely to win the 2000 presidential election,
according to a public opinion poll Saturday.
	   The poll appeared to reaffirm analysts' predictions that the
ruling Nationalist Party could see its unity crumble as members
pick a candidate to succeed President Lee Teng-hui.
	   Soong, who has openly challenged Nationalist leaders for trying
to sack him, would be the only Nationalist who could beat the
popular ex-Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian in the race, according to
the Gallup Poll survey.
	   Chen lost in his re-election bid last week but is widely
expected to become the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's
presidential candidate.
	   Soong could win 55.4 percent of the popular vote against Chen's
23.7 percent, the survey said.
	   Vice President Lien Chan, the front-runner for the ruling
party's nomination, could win 25 percent against Chen's 43.8
percent, it said.
	   Even President Lee could lose if he runs again as the survey
showed he would win 32.4 percent against Chen's 35.4.
	   The poll of 1,129 Taiwanese has a margin of error of 2.98
percent, it said.
	   Soong will step down as governor this month as the provincial
government will be eliminated because many of its functions overlap
those of the central government. After the Nationalists fled
mainland China in 1949, they retained the provincial government to
maintain the appearance of ruling all China.
	   Soong became the first popularly elected governor four years ago
and has criticized the streamlining plan as a plot to sack him.
	   While many voters consider Vice President Lien aloof, Soong has
won grassroots support by tending quickly to voters' problems and
spending freely on roads, bridges and water works.
	   After Lee became president in 1988, Soong had helped him build
up his power base. But the two have become alienated as Lee picked
Lien, another native Taiwanese like himself, as his successor
against Soong, who was born in the mainland Chinese province of
Hunan.
	   The Gallup poll also showed Premier Vincent Siew has an approval
rating of 60.3 percent, against Lee's 56.4 percent and Lien's 34
percent.

EU leaders urge Iraq to comply with UN inspectors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders on Saturday
criticized Iraq for obstructing U.N. weapons inspectors and urged
leaders in Baghdad to let them to their job.
	   A draft concluding statement on the last day of a European Union
summit in Vienna condemned ``Iraq's failure once again to meet
fully its commitments to cooperate'' with inspectors empowered by
the Security Council to search for chemical, biological and other
forbidden weapons.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear programs and long-range missiles.
Until then, the U.N. Security Council will not lift an oil embargo
and other sanctions it imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   The inspectors resumed work last month following a nearly
three-month hiatus after Iraq banned them from visiting any new
suspected weapons sites. Iraq backed down on Nov. 14 and pledged
full cooperation as the United States and Britain were preparing to
launch military strikes.
	   The United States has said the disputes over the inspections
could lead it to attack Iraq without warning.
	   The draft urged Iraq to permit the U.N. inspectors to conduct a
``comprehensive review'' of suspected weapons and storage sites.

Pakistan police nab suspected killer of US drug agency official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A key suspect in the murder of an
official of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, as well as dozens of
other killings in Karachi, has been arrested, police said Saturday.
	   Saulat Mirza, an activist of the ethnic Muttahida Qami Movement
(MQM), was arrested at the airport on his arrival from Bangkok on
Thursday, Farooq Ameen Qureshi, Karachi police chief told The
Associated Press.
	   Mirza allegedly confessed to the murder of Shahnawaz Toor, a
Pakistani national, who worked for the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Agency, said Mirza.
	   Toor, a retired Pakistan army major was shot to death in 1995 in
central Karachi.
	   Mirza also has been charged in connection with several other
killings, including the deaths of security officials and senior
government officials, said Qureshi.
	   But the MQM denied the charges against Mirza accusing the
authorities of fabricating them.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government blames the MQM, a
former ally, for most of the bloodletting in Karachi where more
than 1,000 people have been killed in political, sectarian and
ethnic violence so far this year.

EU leaders deplore lack of commitment to negotiations in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - Leaders of the 15 European Union nations
on Saturday deplored the lack of commitment to the negotiation
process by both ethnic Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo.
	   In the draft communique at their year-end summit, the EU leaders
urged the Yugoslav government of President Slobodan Milosevic and
the leadership of the ethnic Albanians to show flexibility and
reaffirmed the Union's determination to support the political
process.
	   Hundreds of people died, mostly civilians and hundreds of
thousands were driven from their homes during seven months of
fighting in Kosovo, a poor southern province of Serbia, the
dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation.
	   American mediator Christopher Hill is trying to draft a
political settlement that would give extended autonomy to the
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants. Neither the Americans nor the Europeans support
demands by the ethnic Albanians for independence because of fears
that could only be achieved through prolonged conflict.
	   The EU said as soon as a political agreement is reached it would
assist in the reconstruction of Kosovo through a donors'
conference.
	   ``Convinced that democracy in (Yugoslavia) is crucial for peace
and stability in the Balkans, the European Council condemns the
crackdown on independent media and reiterates the EU's insistence
on democratic reform and free media,'' the statement added.

Thailand wins Asian Games gold in sepak takraw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final score; CORRECTS terminology to regu, sted
set, throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand racked up another Asian Games
gold Saturday with a convincing victory over Myanmar in the women's
team competition of sepak takraw, sparking frenzied celebrations by
the home crowd.
	   One delighted member of the Thai team grabbed her young son from
the stands for a victory lap of the arena. The crowd, which had
been growing noisier with each point, erupted with screaming and
cheering as the team clinched gold by winning the second regu for
an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the best-of-three regu final.
	   The final score for the three regus was 15-6, 15-13; 15-5, 15-9;
15-2, 15-4.
	   It was Thailand's eighth gold overall at these games.
	   China and Vietnam, the semifinal losers, got bronze. Sepak
takraw is akin to volleyball, with players using their feet to kick
a rattan ball back and forth across a net.
	   Cheering, flag-waving and kazoo-playing erupted from the crowd
every time Thailand scored, and spectators joined in the wave.
	   The Thai team and spectators fed off each other, with players
gesturing to the crowd to make more noise.
	   The men's team from Myanmar, which was on the sidelines watching
and had been quite boisterous at the start, grew quieter and
quieter as their women's team edged nearer to defeat.
	   Thailand was to play Malaysia later for the men's gold.

Malaysia's governing party meets amid political storm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ For the first time since Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad set off a political storm by sacking his
deputy, the governing party is meeting to attend to serious
housekeeping problems and a sagging image.
	   Sunday's meeting of national delegates of the United Malays
National Organization has a formal agenda of amending rules for its
internal elections, but the gathering is likely to be dominated by
issues of succession and the party's eroding popularity.
	   ``Much gossiping in the corridors may well center on the
developments concerning the vacant deputy president's post,'' said
an editorial in Saturday's edition of the government-backed New
Straits Times.
	   Ahead of the meeting, party leaders called on younger cadres to
demonstrate support for the man who is facing his first serious
challenge in an unbroken 17-year-rule.
	   ``UMNO youth should never ever go against the party
leadership,'' party vice president Najib Tun Razak said in a speech
on Saturday.
	   The party has not had a deputy leader since Mahathir threw Anwar
Ibrahim out of the deputy prime minister's office on Sept. 2 and
ordered the party to expel him the next day.
	   The absence of a successor to the 72-year-old leader, who has
been in poor health in recent weeks, has added to the uncertainty
caused by Malaysia's economic problems.
	   Anwar's arrest on Sept. 20 angered many Malaysians, who were
further outraged when the former protege of Mahathir showed up in
court for his arraignment with bruises and a black eye from a
police beating.
	   Tens of thousands have demonstrated in the normally-placid
Southeast Asian nation's capital to demand Anwar's release.
	   The Anwar episode continues to haunt the party at a time when
Mahathir has been trying to focus the government's energy on
combating Malaysia's worst recession in a decade.
	   While many influential party leaders were jailed for varying
periods for openly supporting Anwar's call for more liberal
politics, hundreds from among the rank and file have reportedly
deserted the party and shifted to an opposition Islamic
fundamentalist group.
	   The UMNO meeting comes three days after Anwar's supporters
formally launched a group to campaign for political reform and
social justice. Azizah Ismail, the jailed politician's wife, who
set herself up as its leader, said her first task would be to end
what she called Mahathir's one-man rule.

EU leaders stuck on finance reform but say enlargement not in
</HEADLINE>
jeopardy
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with draft statement, start of 2nd day of talks
 &UR; With AP Photos
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union nations remained at an
impasse Saturday over the EU's future financing but insisted that
won't slow plans to open the door to a dozen newcomers in the years
ahead.
	   Wrapping up a two-day summit, the 15 EU leaders were to issue a
statement declaring ``the overall enlargement process ... well
underway.''
	   In the draft text, they promised to resolve the money dispute by
next March and urged one another to impose as much budget austerity
at the EU level as they do at home.
	   The EU's biggest ever expansion involves letting Cyprus, 10
Eastern European nations and Malta into the club in the next
decade. Negotiations began this fall, but the EU governments have
gotten stuck in a dispute over money.
	   Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark
insist on a spending freeze, keeping outlays at 85 billion European
currency units (about dlrs 100 billion) in the 2000-2006 period.
	   But Spain and other southerners fear they will lose EU funds to
poorer newcomers and argue outlays must at least rise in line with
economic growth, adding some dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by
2006.
	   In their draft text, the leaders pledged to craft ``an
appropriate financial framework'' to make enlargement possible.
``This must be done in a spirit of solidarity while ensuring
similar budgetary rigor at the level of the union as applied at the
national level.''
	   The draft text stressed the money fight must not be seen as
backtracking on enlargement itself. On the contrary, the leaders
urged the EU executive Commission and their foreign ministers ``to
maintain the momentum'' of intensive enlargement talks.
	   The leaders carefully avoided giving any entry dates so as to
keep candidates working apace on their economic and political
reforms to meet EU membership requirements.
	   On another issue, the leaders did better by agreeing to pursue
ways of how Europe can craft a credible defense arm without always
relying on the United States.
	   France and Britain _ Western Europe's only nuclear powers _
issued a joint statement this month saying the EU must be able to
act on its own with a ``credible military force'' within the
framework of NATO.
	   Complicating the money dispute is that Germany and other
northerners complain they already pay too much. German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, whose country still pays for absorbing East
Germany, made it clear Europe's enlargement problems are not going
to be solved with a German checkbook.
	   In a related issue, Prime Minister Tony Blair said he will not
give up an annual rebate Britain has been getting since 1984 for
its net payments. ``It shouldn't be negotiated away because it is
justified. Otherwise, Britain would be paying a quite
disproportionate and unfair amount into the European Union,'' he
said
	   Britain's net payment to the EU is some dlrs 8 billion, half of
which is refunded.
	   Eighty percent of the EU's budget goes to farm subsidies and aid
for poor regions. Taking on half a dozen poor East European
countries and millions of uneconomical farmers would break the
budget unless serious reforms are undertaken.
	   The leaders set a March deadline to sort out budget reform.
	   ``All around the table realized the historic need to come to a
deal,'' said Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok. ``If this bogs down
you'll see a serious crisis situation, and that you cannot do to
people whose expectations of Europe we have raised.''

Cambodian refugees in Thailand celebrate surrender of Khmer Rouge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ About 15,000 Cambodian refugees held a
celebration at their refugee camp in Thailand after learning of the
surrender of the last Khmer Rouge fighting force, The Nation
newspaper reported on Saturday.
	   The Maoist guerrillas decision to end their decades-long war
against the government in Phnom Penh meant the refugees would
probably be able to return home by January, the paper said.
	   Most were forced into Thailand because of fighting between
government troops and the guerrillas. The Khmer Rouge were
responsible for the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians when
they ruled the country from 1975-79.
	   The jovial celebration included religious services conducted by
30 Buddhist monks, the paper said.

Panel: Pilot unjustly banned for singing `Flintstones' theme
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Fred and Wilma and the gang would
be proud.
	   A Dutch pilot and flight school instructor was unjustly barred
from an airport in the northern Netherlands for continually singing
the theme to ``The Flintstones'' over his radio, an appeals board
ruled Friday.
	   Wim de Nijs, better known in Holland as Capt. Flintstone, had
taken his case to the Dutch Council of State after the airport in
the northern city of Groningen had forbidden him from taking off or
landing there from March 1996 to July 1997.
	   Last year, De Nijs was briefly jailed by authorities who said he
tied up a frequency used by air traffic controllers when he
bellowed out the theme song to the popular cartoon series _
``Flintstones, meet the Flintstones, they're a modern stone-age
family'' _ in English for 20 minutes at a time.
	   The Council of State conceded the need to keep the airways safe,
but said the ban was too harsh because it made it difficult for De
Nijs, who operated a flight school at the airport, to make a
living.
	   A defiant De Nijs, meanwhile, has painted a new slogan on the
side of his small plane: ``Yabba-Dabba-Do Airlines.''

Gunmen kill 20 Muslim settlers in northeastern India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ Suspected separatist militants gunned down
20 Muslim settlers and seriously wounded five others Saturday in
the dense jungles of a northeastern state wracked by secessionist
violence, police said.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the early morning
attack in Panijaan village in Assam state. But Mrinal Baruah, the
top official of the state Interior Ministry, blamed guerrillas of
the outlawed Democratic Front of Bodoland, which wants to carve out
a separate nation for Bodo tribals.
	   Gunmen sprayed bullets with automatic rifles at the group of
Muslims who had trekked into the forest for a community feast, said
officials at the Kokhrajhar police control room.
	   The area is about 250 kilometers (155 miles) west of Gauhati,
the biggest city in Assam and is heavily wooded. Police took nearly
four hours to reach the spot.
	   The militants, who consist of Hindus and Christians want only
ethnic Bodos in the area. Since 1993, they have attacked Muslims
who settled from neighboring Bangladesh. Hundreds of thousands of
Muslims fled Bangladesh _formerly East Pakistan _ during the 1971
independence war and settled in India.
	   In the first major attack on the settlers, in 1993, the rebels
gunned down some 400 people. Bodos complain of discrimination by
the federal government in allocation of scarce resources to the
northeastern states.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Ticketless soccer fans scaled fences
and hurled bottles at police, and one person was slightly hurt, as
huge crowds descended Saturday on a Bangkok stadium for a charged
Asian Games match between Qatar and host Thailand, organizers said.
	   Officials fearful of trouble urged people to watch the match on
television at home after 80,000-strong crowds converged on the
60,000-seat Rajamangala National Stadium, said Torpong Sewarmra, a
spokesman for Asian Games organizers.
	   A sea of people pressed toward the sports complex.
	   Some people threw plastic bottles of water at police; others
tried clambering over stadium fences and were repelled by police,
he said. One man used a loudhailer to shout curses at police. He
was not arrested.
	   People also threw bottles, cans and shoes that members of the
crowd lost in the crush at a ticketing booth that shut down at 8
a.m., having sold out, said Nop Beaugot, who traveled 30 kilometers
(18 miles) by bus to see the match.
	   She said police came out to calm the crowd but did not make any
arrests.
	   Despite having reached the stadium at 4:30 a.m., she said she
was unable to get a ticket, even though ``there were just a few
individuals in front of me.''
	   ``I'm very upset at the organizers. They did not take the time
to explain to us why the tickets sold out so quickly,'' she said.
	   She scaled a fence to get into the sports complex, but could not
get into the stadium itself.
	   Anticipating a large crowd, police brought in an extra 1,000
police and security staff for the match, organizers said.
	   Thailand was looking for a win or draw in the second-round match
to advance to the soccer competition's knockout quarterfinals,
which start Monday.
	   Fighting erupted when Qatar and Thailand met last month in a
``friendly'' match ahead of the Asian Games. The match was
suspended after players from both sides punched, kicked and
body-slammed each other for several minutes, and several players on
both teams suffered slight injuries. Fans joined the melee,
throwing debris from the sidelines.
	   For Saturday's re-match, people began lining up for tickets at 5
a.m. The tickets went on sale three hours later and all 60,000
seats were sold out within two hours, leaving an estimated 20,000
people ticketless, Torpong said.
	   By 3 p.m., as a first match was starting between Kazakstan and
Lebanon, several thousand people were still milling around outside.
	   Police checked bags and tickets thoroughly, and used
loudspeakers to appeal for people to go home.
	   ``Police are trying not to use force but trying to negotiate
first,'' Torpong said. ``Police aren't worried because Thai people
are very friendly and everyone understands there is a limit on
seats.''
	   He said a giant television screen had been set up outside the
stadium for people to watch the match. The crowds were swollen by
people arriving for a sepak takraw match between Thailand and
Malaysia in a nearby arena, he added.
	   One person was slightly hurt in the jostling but did not require
hospital treatment, he said.

North Korea readies second satellite launch, EU delegation says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ North Korean has a second satellite ready to
launch, a member of a European Union delegation said Saturday after
making an official visit to North Korea.
	   North Korean officials, however, did not say whether they had
plans to launch the satellite soon, said Glyn Ford of Britain, one
of three European Parliament members who were returning from a trip
to the reclusive communist country.
	   North Korea fired a three-stage rocket on Aug. 31 that flew over
Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean. North Korea said the rocket
launched a satellite. Japanese officials, however, said no evidence
exists that a satellite was launched and have criticized the firing
as a military test.
	   Ford said his delegation proposed that North Korea allow a third
party to inspect an underground facility that is suspected of being
a construction complex for nuclear weapons.
	   The United States has demanded that North Korea allow
inspections. North Korea claims the facility is for civilian use
and has said it will allow a one-time inspection only if the United
States pays dlrs 300 million for having made ``false'' inspections.
The United States has refused.
	   Ford said North Korean officials said a third party could
inspect the site, but the compensation would still be required.
	   William Perry, the newly appointed U.S. government policy
coordinator on North Korea, visited South Korea, Japan and China
this week to ask for suggestions in dealing with the North.
	   U.S. and North Korean officials were expected to resume meetings
on Monday in Washington on the terms of an inspection.

Iraq marks second anniversary of Odai's escape from death

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Two years ago this day, two men approached
a sports car in the wealthy Mansour district of Baghdad and raked
it with machine gun fire.
	   Amid the panic and confusion in the streets the assailants
escaped, unaware that their victim, Odai Hussein, had survived,
although with grievous injuries. Odai, President Saddam Hussein's
eldest son and then his heir apparent, was shot about 10 times and
remained in hospital for six months before appearing in public.
	   To mark the second anniversary of his narrow escape, Iraq is
holding day-long, nationwide celebrations Saturday.
	   The biggest festivities will be held in Baghdad, especially on
the street intersection where on Dec. 12, 1996 a bloodied Odai had
lain slumped in his car, only 500 meters (yards) from an
intelligence headquarters.
	   A huge tent has been set up at the site where Iraqi singers will
perform later Saturday.
	   Earlier in the day, members of the Journalists Association,
which Odai heads, unveiled a statue of Saddam and slaughtered two
sheep in a traditional Arab form of celebration.
	   Odai, 34, has regained his health but still walks with the help
of a cane, a reminder of the bullets that had shattered his leg.
	   Prior to the assassination attempt, Odai held considerable power
in Iraq. He is known to be a close confidant of his father and had
previously run the trade and information ministries. He owns and
runs the influential Babil newspaper and Youth television, the most
popular TV station in Iraq.
	   He is also a patron saint of local sports, heading the Iraqi
Olympic Committee and the national soccer federation _ positions
which gained him popularity among many Iraqis.
	   Separate festivities are being held Saturday by students, sports
associations and the Saddam Commandos organization, founded by
Odai.
	   Last year, about 500 journalists prayed while holding hands as
butchers slaughtered 33 sheep _ one for every year of Odai's life _
at the shrine of Ali in Najaf, 180 kilometers (113 miles) south of
Baghdad.
	   Most Iraqi newspapers, which usually praise every government
move, wished Odai a long life.
	   Babil published a full page glorifying article, embellished with
a poem by a local writer, Ra'ad Bander, and a photograph of Odai
kissing his father's hand.
	   The poem said Odai is:
	   ``Saddam's sword, who ignored
	   the dangers, sticking in his bones,
	   Carrying on the tasks, all alone.

Yeltsin cautions against constitutional changes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin Saturday said the
five-year-old constitution has provided stability for Russia and he
warned against making any changes that would return the country to
its communist past.
	   In a radio speech marking Constitution Day, Yeltsin said any
changes to the constitution should be introduced with great care.
	   ``Those feeling nostalgia for the old order have launched a
discussion in favor of replacing the present constitution,''
Yeltsin said. ``They are calling for vesting parliament with all
possible powers. They are effectively proposing that the country
revert to being a republic of Soviets.''
	   Yeltsin said he was absolutely opposed to replacing the
constitution. ``I think this would be deadly for the country,'' he
said.
	   ``Russia, an immense country, must have powerful supreme
authorities,'' Yeltsin said in the pre-recorded address. ``Without
such authorities we will not be able to deal with the acute
problems Russia is facing.''
	   In the five years since the document was approved, ``the
constitution has more than once helped the country to remain
stable,'' Yeltsin said. ``We have overcome this year's difficult
political crises only because we have adhered to our fundamental
law clearly and consistently.''
	   After the speech was aired, Yeltsin hosted a Kremlin reception
marking Constitution Day in his third public appearance since
Monday.
	   The president was scheduled to return later to his Rus country
residence, 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Moscow, where he has
been recuperating after his release Wednesday from the hospital
where he spent two weeks being treated for pneumonia, the Kremlin
press service said.
	   Yeltsin has spent little time at the Kremlin in recent months
because of various illnesses, but his spokesman said his schedule
will expand as his health improves.
	   Next week, Yeltsin is expected to meet with visiting Swiss and
Belarusian presidents, spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said at a news
conference on Friday.

Fans overwhelm soccer stadium; Pakistan and Malaysia win squash

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thousands of soccer fans considered
themselves losers at the Asian Games Saturday, unable to get
tickets to watch the home team try to reach the quarterfinals. Some
reacted with bottle throwing or fence-climbing attempts.
	   And that was hours before the home team from Thailand went out
to play Qatar, hoping to gain the quarterfinals. Police urged
ticketless Thais to go home and watch the game on television.
	   Thai fans already had something to cheer for in the Southeast
Asian sport of sepak takraw _ a no-hands version of volleyball
involving some highly athletic kicking of a small rattan ball. Thai
players beat neighboring Myanmar 15-6, 15-13; 15-5, 15-9; 15-2,
15-4 for the women's team gold medal, and were to face Malaysia
later Saturday for the men's gold.
	   Pakistan's Zarak Jehan beat compatriot Amjad Khan, the
18-year-old Pakistan Open champion, 1-9, 9-0, 6-9, 9-7, 9-3 for the
gold medal in squash, making its Asian Games debut.
	   Malaysia's Nicol David, the top seed, beat Hong Kong's Chiu
Wing-yin 9-3, 9-1, 9-6 for the women's gold in the sport, one of
the few in these games where China has not won a medal.
	   China, meanwhile, picked up five quick golds Saturday, boosting
its total to 66 midway through the sixth full day of competition.
Japan had 23, South Korea 20 and Kazakstan 11. Thailand and Taiwan
each had eight.
	   China beat South Korea for the men's team gold in table tennis,
and swept all four of the day's gold medals in shooting. Kazakstan
took three of the four silvers.
	   But for an estimated 80,000 Thais, attention was focused on
trying to get into the 60,000-seat Rajamangala National Stadium for
Thailand's soccer game against Qatar.
	   One person was slightly hurt in the jostling but did not require
hospital treatment, said Torpong Sewarmra, a spokesman for Asian
Games organizers.
	   A sea of people pressed toward the surrounding sports complex.
	   Some people threw plastic bottles of water at police; others
tried clambering over stadium fences and were repelled by police,
he said.
	   People also threw bottles, cans and shoes that members of the
crowd lost in the crush at a ticketing booth that shut down at 8
a.m., having sold out, said Nop Beaugot, who traveled 30 kilometers
(18 miles) by bus to see the match.
	   She said police came out to calm the crowd but did not make any
arrests.
	   Despite having reached the stadium at 4:30 a.m., she said she
was unable to get a ticket, even though ``there were just a few
individuals in front of me.''
	   On the shooting range, China's Shan Hong beat Kazakstan's Olga
Dovgun 672.8 to 670.0 for the gold medal in women's individual
sport rifle competition. China also won the team event, 1,715 to
1,702 over Thailand.
	   In women's sport pistol shooting, China's Cai Yeqing was the
individual champion, beating Kazakstan's Yuliya Bondareva 685.3 to
683.8. Cai and her Chinese teammates scored a total of 1,743 to
Kazakstan's 1,729 in the competition for the team gold.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ In what appears to be the second collapse of a
major Japanese bank in less than two months, Nippon Credit Bank
Ltd. said financial authorities asked it Saturday to formally
request the government to take over its operations.
	   The Financial Supervisory Agency delivered an effective
ultimatum to Nippon Credit's president, Shigeoki Togo, after
determining that the bank was insolvent due to a massive burden of
bad loans, said a bank spokesman who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   NCB would be only the second bank in Japan to be placed under
state control since World War II. The government nationalized the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. on Oct. 23.
	   Like many other Japanese lenders, NCB's bad loans mounted after
the collapse of inflated real estate prices and stock values in the
early 1990s.
	   After meeting financial authorities at the Prime Minister's
Office, Togo called an emergency board meeting to discuss the
government's request.
	   Kyodo News agency reported that top officials of the bank have
agreed to accept the government request and become nationalized.
The NCB spokesman refused to confirm the report, saying the bank
plans to respond by around noon Sunday.
	   But a government official told reporters that the bank will be
nationalized Sunday regardless of the board's decision, Kyodo News
agency reported.
	   The move was widely expected after merger talks collapsed
between NCB and suitor Chuo Trust and Banking Co.
	   Nippon Credit has 2,000 employees and the bank was one of the
fifty largest in the world, according to a 1997 ranking by Fortune
magazine. NCB has assets totaling 12.34 trillion yen (dlrs 106
billion), but some 3.2 trillion yen (dlrs 27 billion) of its loans
were at risk of being unpaid, according to Kyodo.
	   Nippon Credit is one of three of Japan's so-called long-term
credit banks. These banks financed the rebuilding of Japanese
industry following World War II by providing companies long-term,
low-cost loans. But deregulation has allowed more companies to
raise money directly from financial markets and the banks have
failed to find a new role.
	   The government has stepped in to aid NCB before. Last April,
finance officials asked a group of financial institutions and the
central bank to contribute to a fund to bailout the lender.

Yokoyama takes two-stroke lead after third round in Okinawa Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ONNASON, Japan (AP) _ Akihito Yokoyama shot a 3-under 68 in the
third round Saturday to grab a two-stroke lead in the season-ending
80 million-yen (dlrs 680,000) Okinawa Open.
	   Hoping to end the season with his first victory in the Japan PGA
tour, Yokoyama sank four birdies against one bogey over the
6,359-yard, par-71 Daikyo Country Club course, bringing his 54-hole
total to 9-under 204.
	   Hidemichi Tanaka, winner of the Japan Open, carded five birdies
against three bogeys for a 69 for a lone second place at 7-under
206.
	   American David Ishii, who had led the first two rounds, shot a
1-over 72. Opening the round with a bogey on the first hole, Ishii
added three more bogeys against three birdies.
	   Ishii, seeking his first victory in four years, was tied for
third place at 6-under 207 with Nobumitsu Yuhara, who had a 68
Saturday.
	   Taiwan's Hsieh Chin-sheng shot a 70 for a three-round total of
210 to share 10th place with Eduardo Herrera of Colombia, Frankie
Minoza of the Philippines and Richard Backwell of Australia.
	   Hererra also had a 70, and Minoza and Backwell shot a 71 and a
72 respectively.
	   The winner will collect 14.4 million yen (dlrs 123,000).

Thailand wants to bid for Summer Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asian Games host Thailand has announced
its desire to stage a Summer Olympics following a pat on the back
from International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio
Samaranch.
	   ``We feel we are capable to host the Olympic Games,'' Pitak
Intrawityanunt, a government minister, told reporters. ``How soon
and how far away that might be will be decided on how it
develops.''
	   Bangkok now is busy with the Asian Games, featuring 6,000
athletes from 41 nations. The previous Summer Olympics, in Atlanta
in 1996, had 11,000 athletes from 197 countries.
	   Bangkok has struggled with facilities and organization at the
Asian Games. While the venues are new, most are without finishing
touches such as paved parking lots, and areas such as the results
service are clearly well short of Olympic standard _ even Atlanta's
Olympic standard.
	   Pitak would not say which year Thailand might target but an
official from the country's Olympic committee joked that 2016 would
be best.
	   Olympic Council of Asia president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah said
Asia should win the right to the 2008 Games. Osaka, Japan, a city
from China and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, have indicated an interest
in becoming the Asian candidate. Al-Sabah said a bid from Bangkok
would be welcomed.

Clinton comes to a land where few lives left untouched by conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos JRL113 &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On a street newly littered with the debris of
battle _ stones, spent tear gas canisters, charred remnants of
half-burned tires _ a sodden Palestinian flag flaps in a fitful
rain-laden wind outside a house in mourning.
	   Inside, to the tinny recorded wail of Koranic verses, neighbors
and relatives of the dead man _ a 21-year-old university student
felled on the roof of his own home by an Israeli soldier's
rubber-coated bullet _ sipped tiny cups of coffee left unsweetened
to symbolize the bitter occasion. Some smoked, a few spoke quietly
among themselves, but most simply sat in reflective silence.
	   Among those in attendance on this day, the first of the
traditional three days of family mourning, was Saeb Erekat, the
chief peace negotiator for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
The dead youth, Nasr Erekat, was a cousin of his.
	   Erekat stayed for a time, sitting amid clan elders in Arab
headdresses and teen-age nephews in American-style athletic shoes,
then slipped away for a meeting in connection with President
Clinton's visit beginning this weekend.
	   ``It's been very difficult,'' he said later, asked about
carrying on his negotiating duties at such a time. ``I have a great
sense of sorrow and sadness, a feeling of such loss. I hope God
will enable me to use my grief to strengthen my determination for
peace.''
	   The scene at the Erekat home, in the Arab village of Abu Dis on
Jerusalem's eastern outskirts, drives home a central truth about
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: on both sides of the divide, the
political is also deeply personal.
	   And that inescapability goes to the heart of the quarrel's
intractability.
	   In the glare of world attention, it is easy to forget that there
are fewer people living in Israel and the Palestinian lands
combined than there are in New York City. In the small and jostling
confines of what few here choose to call the Holy Land, the
conflict touches all. Everyone has a stake in it.
	   Israelis fret daily over soldier sons on dangerous patrol in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, or shudder when they pass a sidewalk cafe
once ripped by an Islamic militant's suicide bomb.
	   Palestinian families struggle to keep alive the memories of
fathers and brothers languishing in Israeli prisons, and chafe
under the checkpoints and gunsights of Israeli troops.
	   On both sides, the youngest soak up fear and anger along with
their ABCs. And elders' memories of half a century past still rise
to trouble the collective sleep: the shadow of the Holocaust for
Israelis, the trauma of exile and dispossession for the
Palestinians.
	   Against this backdrop, amid a landscape little changed since
biblical times, terrible Old Testament themes _ lamentation and
retribution, the smiting of enemies and the sharpening of swords _
spring to life once again in any day's headlines.
	   Now comes Clinton, this most American of presidents, one who has
made Middle East peacemaking a kind of personal crusade, in hopes
of halting what has become one of the century's most protracted
blood feuds.
	   Clinton is no stranger to these particular hatreds. Three years
ago, in another winter season, he came here to bury Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, gunned down by a nationalist Jew who could not abide
the terms of a Mideast agreement that called _ just as this latest
accord does _ for Israel to cede West Bank land in exchange for
peace with the Palestinians.
	   On the occasion of this visit _ first intended to celebrate the
Wye River accords signed seven weeks ago in Washington, now meant
to salvage them _ all three of the principals are embattled.
	   Clinton is under an impeachment cloud; Arafat is buffeted by
furious Palestinian street protests and his own failing health, and
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government is hanging
by a thread.
	   The days leading up to Clinton's visit have been divisive ones,
contriving somehow to simultaneously tap into both sides' greatest
fears.
	   In the West Bank's worst spasm of violence in months, Israelis
watched windows of Israeli-plated cars shatter from stones thrown
by angry youths, saw TV footage of a cringing Israeli soldier _ now
facing court martial _ being beaten bloody by a Palestinian mob,
heard Palestinian officials' exhortations for a new intefadeh, or
uprising.
	   Palestinians, for their part, listened in anger as Netanyahu
announced the suspension of an upcoming Israeli troop pullback in
the West Bank and tried vainly to halt Israeli bulldozers expanding
Jewish settlements on land they claim as their own.
	   Both sides _ to Palestinians' satisfaction, and Israel's dismay
_ came to see the visit as an implicit acknowledgement of
Palestinian statehood aspirations, despite increasingly desperate
American efforts to avoid casting it in that light.
	   Clinton's foray to the Gaza Strip, which is already under
Palestinian rule, will be the first by a sitting American
president. Palestinians intend to play on that symbolism for all it
is worth, greeting him with the strains of their once-banned
national anthem.
	   In the mourning house in Abu Dis, though, the friends and
relatives of Nasr Erekat had little to say about politics and
statehood. They talked about Nasr instead.
	   Amr Erekat, 27, recalled his disbelief as he cradled his dying
cousin in his arms. His 14-year-old brother Taher spoke haltingly
of the big brother he had looked up to. His childhood friend, Samir
Abdel Salam, remembered wishing he had stuck to his studies as
diligently as Nasr had.
	   Saeb Erekat, the peace negotiator, could find neither lesson nor
logic to his young cousin's death.
	   ``It's senseless, this rhythm of bloodshed,'' he said. ``At
these difficult times, you pray for one thing, for both sides: no
more of it.''

China beats South Korea in team table tennis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China rallied from an opening match
loss by Olympic champion Liu Guoliang to beat archrival South Korea
3-1 in the final of the Asian Games men's table tennis Saturday.
	   Paced by veteran Kong Linghui and rookie Wang Liqin, China's men
made it a sweep of the team titles again.
	   China's men and women have routinely dominated the team events
at world competitions and the Asian Games, although South Korea has
always been a menace to the Chinese, staging stunning upsets in
both events at the 1986 Asian Games at home in Seoul.
	   In singles and doubles, China has won 14 of the last 15 world or
Olympic titles since 1995.
	   It seemed South Korea was ready to spring another surprise when
Kim Taek-soo upset Liu in the opening match. Liu had routinely won
the opening game, 21-14, and appeared on his way to victory then
Kim won the next two games, 21-14, 21-15.
	   However veteran Kong, the 1995 world champion and silver
medalist in the 1996 Olympics behind Liu, came back to defeat Oh
Sang-Eun 23-21, 19-21, 21-16.
	   Kong finally solved Oh's game in the third set, when he started
to serve better.
	   ``Oh's returns on my serves were poor and it cost him too
much,'' Kong said.
	   Wang Liqin, a newcomer to the Chinese team, came on to beat Lee
Chul-Seung 21-14, 15-21, 21-8. A 19-year-old former national junior
champion, Wang is regarded as a future star after upsetting a
former world champion at his first world championships last year in
England.
	   Kong returned to face Kim and beat him 21-17, 21-18. The South
Korean had the early lead in both games. Then Kong started to win
the long rallies, putting the South Korean on the defensive and
forcing errors.
	   Kong took the lead at 14-13 in the first game and held it the
rest of the way.
	   At 18-all in the second game, a long exchange put Kong ahead and
then he took the final two points, springing up in victory on the
match point when Kim could not handle a return that curved into his
body.
	   China's coach Cai Zhehua was not surprised at the victory.
	   ``We prepared very carefully for this match since the South
Koreans are tenacious and aggressive,'' Cai said. ``However, we
have never lost confidence. Just as I said before the final, China
is a sure bet for the team title. ''
	   The Chinese women, playing without superstar and multi-world
champion Deng Yaping, won their team title Friday. The doubles and
mixed competitions start Sunday, with the singles beginning Monday.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ In what appears to be the second collapse of a
major Japanese bank in less than two months, Nippon Credit Bank
Ltd. said financial authorities asked it Saturday to formally
request the government to take over its operations.
	   The Financial Supervisory Agency delivered what effectively was
an ultimatum to Nippon Credit's president, Shigeoki Togo, after
determining that the bank was insolvent due to a massive burden of
bad loans, said a bank spokesman who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   NCB would be only the second bank in Japan to be placed under
state control since World War II. The government nationalized the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. on Oct. 23.
	   Like many other Japanese lenders, NCB's bad loans mounted after
the collapse of inflated real estate prices and stock values in the
early 1990s.
	   After meeting financial authorities at the Prime Minister's
Office, Togo called an emergency board meeting to discuss the
government's request.
	   Kyodo News agency reported that top officials of the bank have
agreed to accept the government request and become nationalized.
The NCB spokesman refused to confirm the report, saying the bank
plans to respond by around noon Sunday.
	   But a government official told reporters that the bank will be
nationalized Sunday regardless of the board's decision, Kyodo News
agency reported.
	   The move was widely expected after merger talks collapsed
between NCB and suitor Chuo Trust and Banking Co.
	   Nippon Credit has 2,000 employees and the bank was one of the

Five people die when earthquake rocks Afghan capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Residents of this war-weary capital
leapt from their beds and ran from their homes early Saturday as a
moderate intensity earthquake shook the city, killing five people
and wounding seven others.
	   The earthquake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.4, was
centered about 150 kilometers (90 miles) north of Kabul in the
rugged Hindu Kush mountain range, said Malik Salauddin, deputy
director of the Pakistan Meteorological Center in neighboring
Pakistan.
	   The earthquake struck shortly before 1 a.m. local time as
residents slept. But eyewitnesses said that throughout the city
people woke from their sleep and left their homes.
	   In the area known as Jaday Maiwand five people, including four
children, died when the ramshackled hotel in which they were
staying collapsed, said a relative of the children, Shah Mohammed.
	   Four of the seven wounded also were relatives of Mohammed.
	   There were no other immediate reports of casualties.
	   The capital has been shaken by five separate tremors in the past
one week say residents.
	   As well there were no immediate reports of damage in northern
Afghanistan, which often is hardest hit by the tremors. In May more
than 5,000 people were killed when an earthquake in northern
Afghanistan unleashed massive mud slides and flooding that wiped
out entire villages.
	   But a spokesman for the anti-Taliban alliance, which controls
much of northern Takhar and Badakshan provinces, some 300
kilometers (180 miles) north of Kabul, said commanders in the area
contacted by radio said there were no damages.

EU leaders deplore recent violence in West Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - European Union leaders on Saturday
deplored recurring violence in the West Bank as well as Israel's
setting of new conditions for its continued troop withdrawal from
the territories.
	   In a draft statement at the end of their two-day year-end
summit, the 15 EU leaders called on both Palestinians and Israelis
to show restraint.
	   ``While noting the progress made to date by both sides in
implementing the (Wye River) Memorandum, the European Council
deplores the recent violence, mutual recrimination and the setting
of new conditions which threaten to unravel the fragile peace
progress since Wye,'' the leaders said.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began backing off from
the Wye agreement almost as soon as he got home from signing it in
the United States in October, making new demands on Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat before the Israeli government would move ahead
with further withdrawals.
	   ``The European Council calls on the parties to show restraint
and to implement fully, in time and in good faith, the remaining
provisions and thereby contribute to the rebuilding of the
confidence essential to the compeletion of the peace process.''
	   The EU is the largest collective donor to the Palestinians.

Wattana's humiliation may continue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Former world match-play snooker
champion James Wattana may put his battered psyche in the spotlight
again Sunday after deciding to join Thailand in the team
competition at the Asian Games.
	   Wattana, a former world No. 3-ranked player who has spent a
decade as a snooker pro, was expected to win three golds for the
hosts at the games.
	   Instead, it has been a soap opera story, full of tears, breakups
and reunions. The tears followed a humiliating defeat early in the
singles competition. The breakup came when his team missed out on a
medal in the doubles and he told reporters he was playing too badly
to continue at the games.
	   But a few hours after deciding he would quit the team, Wattana
seemingly reconsidered, and unless he changes his mind again he
should line up in the team's event.
	   The games were expected to be a triumph for Wattana, who rose
near the summit of his sport before tumbling down the rankings over
the past year.
	   His inability to stand the pressure of pleasing his fans has
been surprising, not least to himself.
	   Wattana and his mother gave tearful news conferences after he
lost his singles match 5-1 to Hong Kong's Chan Kwok-ming and he was
near tears again after he and partner Chuchart Trairatanapradit
lost the bronze medal game.
	   ``The pressure has been unbelievable, the worst I have ever
felt,'' Wattana said after losing the doubles. ``I have no
confidence in my game, I cannot pot a thing, I just don't know
what's wrong.''
	   Wattana said he would withdraw from the teams competition but
then reversed his decision, making himself available.
	   Thailand's team manager Thirachai Vuthitham had not declared his
starting team Saturday.

Ethiopian Somali refugees return home after 21 years

	   MOIYALE, Ethiopia (AP) _ Nasteha Noor Kadiye climbed from a
truck down a ladder, poked the dusty ground with her right toes,
then firmly set foot on her homeland for the first time in 21
years.
	   ``I am extremely happy to be home after a long absence as a
refugee,'' Kadiye said with a shy smile. After a pensive pause she
added, ``However, I don't know what waits me as I go about looking
for relatives.''
	   Kadiye still had another 350 kilometers (220 miles) to travel to
her home village of Negele, in southern Ethiopia. She had lived in
exile from the age of 12 in 1977, and will have covered 1,530
kilometers (950 miles), mostly on foot, by the time she gets home.
	   Kadiye was among 45 ethnic Somali refugee men, women and
children the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees recently
repatriated to Ethiopia, at their request, from a camp in Dadaab,
Kenya.
	   Peter Kessler, a UNHCR spokesman, said the repatriation was not
a response to President Daniel arap Moi's recent threats to expel
refugees, whom he accuses of being responsible for crimes in the
East African nation.
	   Kadiye's group was flown 400 kilometers (250 miles) northwest to
the Kenyan border town of Moyale, then loaded in trucks for the
journey to Moiyale, Ethiopia.
	   During the one-hour flight, most of the children giggled. The
adults were apprehensive.
	   From a clear sky, Kadiye stared at the rugged landscape she had
traversed _ from Ethiopia to Somalia to Kenya _ to escape violence.
	   Ironically, she decided to return home partly because her life
was once again at risk.
	   ``There is too much insecurity here,'' Kadiye said before
boarding the plane.
	   Armed banditry is rampant in northern Kenya. The situation is so
bad that UNHCR established a police station in Dadaab, and even
provided officers with vehicles and walkie-talkies.
	   Refugee women were raped when they went to collect firewood, and
UNHCR had to hire a contractor to provide firewood. Aid workers
must be escorted by police from their compounds to the three
refugee camps around Dadaab.
	   The repatriation began Nov. 16 and UNHCR planned to send at
least 2,000 refugees home before the start of the Ramadan, the
Muslim holy month, Dec. 22. The other 2,500 will follow in January.
	   The Ethiopians fled for the first time during the 1977 war
between Ethiopia and Somalia, most of them crossing the Ogaden
desert to Somalia.
	   ``We could not flee to other parts of Ethiopia because we were
Ethiopian Somalis,'' said Ali Hirsi Ashkir, a refugee in Dadaab
waiting repatriation. ``Ethiopian soldiers were targeting us.''
	   They settled in camps at Luq, a Somali town near where the
borders of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia meet.
	   Kadiye married a Somali man, moved to a nearby village and bore
five children.
	   Early in 1991, a coalition of Somali rebels ousted the late
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, and the country disintegrated into
fiefdoms protected by clan militiamen.
	   ``Some gunmen attacked our village, and we fled into the bush,''
Kadiye said. ``When we thought they had gone we returned, and found
they were still there.''
	   In the ensuing fire fight, Kadiye's husband and son were killed.
She and four surviving children fled to Kenya, eventually reaching
Dadaab.
	   At the peak of the influx in 1992, there were 420,000 refugees
in camps around Dadaab, mostly from Somalia. At the moment only
110,000 remain, including 5,000 Ethiopians.
	   Collins Asare, UNHCR chief in Dadaab, said all of the Ethiopian
Somalis want to go home.
	   ``Their leaders approached us and said they wanted to go home,''
Asare said.
	   The Ethiopian Embassy in Nairobi sent two officials to ascertain
that they are genuine citizens.
	   The refugees must be flown to Moyale, Kenya, before crossing the
border to Moiyale because the roads on the Kenyan side are
unusable.
	   ``It is expensive,'' Asare said. ``But in the long run, the
international community will not have to spend money on these
people.''
	   Each refugee _ man, woman and child _ receives dlrs 20 in cash
once airborne. Their U.N. ration cards are taken away. Once in
Ethiopia, each receives another dlrs 20 in the local currency and
food for 90 days. Then, they are on their own.
	   But they are happy to go home.
	   ``We have heard there is a new government at home and there is
peace. That is why we are going,'' Ashkir said.

Rightwing activists in underwear protest film on lesbian love
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Rightwing Hindu nationalists opposed to a
film on lesbian love showed up only in their underwear Saturday at
the house of a leading film actor who has petitioned the Supreme
Court against disruption by the protesters.
	   Some 80 Shiv Sena members shouted slogans against actor Dilip
Kumar at his house in Bombay, India's film capital. Kumar has
criticized the Shiv Sena for attacking movie theaters in Bombay,
New Delhi and Calcutta that showed ``Fire,'' the first Indian movie
to deal specifically with lesbian love.
	   Fire won 14 international awards for its portrayal of a
relationship between two women living in the same house. But
members of the Shiv Sena _ considered one of the most radical and
violent political groups in India _ said lesbianism is against what
it describes as Indian culture.
	   In recent weeks, Sena members have torn down posters and forced
movie theaters to stop showing the film. Sena activists have often
used violence to enforce their brand of Hinduism or to silence
people critical of their leader, Bal Thackeray.
	   ``Dilip Kumar, the leader of the naked! We support you in your
fight for nudity!'' the protesters chanted in front of his house.
	   ``We went in our underwear because that's the language he will
understand,'' said Sena lawmaker Shrikanth Sarmalkar. The actor was
not available for comment.
	   Last week, Kumar joined other film personalities in petitioning
the Supreme Court to ensure that the film can be shown without
disruption by Sena activists. Following the attacks on the movie
theaters, the federal government which is controlled by a Sena
ally, sent back the film to the censors for review.

Panel: Pilot unjustly banned for singing `Flintstones' theme
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Fred and Wilma and the gang would
be proud.
	   A Dutch pilot and flight school instructor was unjustly barred
from an airport in the northern Netherlands for continually singing
the theme to ``The Flintstones'' over his radio, an appeals board
ruled Friday.
	   Wim de Nijs, better known in Holland as Capt. Flintstone, had
taken his case to the Dutch Council of State after the airport in
the northern city of Groningen had forbidden him from taking off or
landing there from March 1996 to July 1997.
	   Last year, De Nijs was briefly jailed by authorities who said he
tied up a frequency used by air traffic controllers when he
bellowed out the theme song to the popular cartoon series _
``Flintstones, meet the Flintstones, they're a modern stone-age
family'' _ in English for 20 minutes at a time.
	   The Council of State conceded the need to keep the airways safe,
but said the ban was too harsh because it made it difficult for De
Nijs, who operated a flight school at the airport, to make a
living.
	   A defiant De Nijs, meanwhile, has painted a new slogan on the
side of his small plane: ``Yabba-Dabba-Do Airlines.''

Protest against Thai power plants may flare again this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai protest leaders said thousands of
anti-pollution demonstrators will block roads again this week if
the government breaks its promise to scrap three planned power
plants, local papers reported on Saturday.
	   ``We will see how well he keeps his word,'' protest leader
Theerawut Jaewsakul was quoted by The Nation as saying about a
government official who made the pledge.
	   At least 65 people were injured during two days of violent
clashes between 3,000 policemen and 5,000 villagers opposed to the
building of three coal-fired power plants in Prachuab Khiri Khan,
230 kilometers (145 miles) southwest of Bangkok.
	   The villagers say the plants, one of which will use lignite, or
brown coal, will pollute their environment and damage their health.
	   The protesters dispersed Thursday evening after Deputy Interior
Minister Pinij Charusombat signed an agreement promising the
government would stop the projects.
	   Prime Minister's Office Minister Savit Bhotiwihok told The
Nation, however, that Pinij had no right to make such a promise and
should not have let the mob pressure him into doing so.
	   Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart said because previous
governments had signed legally binding contracts with foreign
investors to build the plants, the government's only choice to was
to have the protesters accept the plants through better public
relations, according to the paper.
	   Japanese, Finnish and American companies are part of consortia
building the plants, and they have said they expect the government
to honor its commitments.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has pleaded with the villagers to
refrain from blocking roads or demonstrating until after his
Cabinet takes up the matter on Tuesday.

Hopes rise of reprieve for Europe's duty-free shopping
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With EU-Summit
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders worked on a
compromise Saturday over granting a reprieve for duty-free shopping
that lets millions of travelers snap up liquor, tobacco and other
bargains.
	   Over dinner Friday at the EU's year-end summit, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, backed by his German and French counterparts,
campaigned to save duty-free sales for travel within the EU _ at
least for now.
	   The summit prepared to issue a statement calling for a study
into ``the possibility of a limited extension'' of duty-free sales
in ports, airports, ferries and planes in the 15-nation EU.
	   The aim would be to study the economic implications, including
job losses, that an end to duty-free shopping would entail.
	   France sought a five-year stay of execution. Britain sought one
of ``several years,'' officials said.
	   But Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok _ speaking for an opposing camp
that also included Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Italy _ rejected a
reprieve or said it must not last longer than a few months.
	   EU governments voted unanimously in 1991 to abolish tax-free
shopping in June 1999, claiming it was incompatible with an union
of 15 nations that has no more internal borders.
	   A decision to overturn the 1991 extension for duty-free must
also be unanimous. ``We must stick with the decision'' to end
tax-free shopping, Kok told reporters.
	   The debate briefly pushed weighty issues like defense and reform
of the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget to the back of the summit
agenda.
	   Blair is under pressure to rescue tax-free shopping. Every year
and in huge numbers, Britons take ferries to the Continent and
stock up on cheap liquor, tobacco, toiletries and other consumer
goods.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has called the proposed ban ``the
most visible and high-profile (EU) decision'' for the British
public.
	   In continental nations with lower domestic taxes on alcohol, the
duty-free issue is less contentious.
	   France, Germany, Ireland, Spain and Luxembourg backed Britain in
seeking a stay of execution. Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Finland and Italy, opposed it.
	   As the summit was ending, opponents indicated they could live
with a short extension for duty free while a study was made of the
possible loss of jobs that a ban would entail.
	   Airlines, shipping companies and labor unions claim scrapping
the dlrs 6.4-billion-a-year duty-free industry will push up the
cost of travel and throw some 150,000 people out of work.
	   Supporters of abolition say duty-free operators effectively
enjoy a subsidy of dlrs 2.2 billion a year by not paying duties,
giving them an unfair advantage over other retailers.
	   The ban only affects sales for travelers within the EU. Those
traveling to or from the Union will still be able to enjoy tax free
shopping.

EU leaders deplore recent violence in West Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders on Saturday
deplored recurring violence in the West Bank as well as Israel's
setting of new conditions for its continued troop withdrawal from
the territories.
	   In a draft statement at the end of their two-day year-end
summit, the 15 EU leaders called on both Palestinians and Israelis
to show restraint.
	   ``While noting the progress made to date by both sides in
implementing the (Wye River) Memorandum, the European Council
deplores the recent violence, mutual recrimination and the setting
of new conditions which threaten to unravel the fragile peace
progress since Wye,'' the leaders said.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began backing off from
the Wye agreement almost as soon as he got home from signing it in
the United States in October, making new demands on Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat before the Israeli government would move ahead
with further withdrawals.
	   ``The European Council calls on the parties to show restraint
and to implement fully, in time and in good faith, the remaining
provisions and thereby contribute to the rebuilding of the
confidence essential to the completion of the peace process.''
	   The EU is the largest collective donor to the Palestinians.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A French United Nations official kidnapped in
southern Russia more than 10 months ago has been freed and was
flown to Moscow Saturday, news reports reported.
	   Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the regional office of the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees in North Ossetia, was seized by
three masked gunmen in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz on Jan.
29.
	   According to the Interfax news agency, Cochetel was freed early
Saturday in an operation conducted by the Russian Interior Ministry
and the regional security forces of the north Caucasus.
	   He was flown to Moscow and was waiting for a special plane to
take him to Geneva, Switzerland, NTV television news said.
	   It was unclear where Cochetel was held, in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya or in North Ossetia. ``He was liberated on the
border,'' Alexander Dzasokhov, the president of North Ossetia, told
NTV.
	   French President Jacques Chirac spoke to President Boris Yeltsin
by telephone and thanked him for Russia's part in freeing Cochetel,
the Kremlin press service said.
	   His release came four days after the severed heads of four
foreign hostages were found in Chechnya when a government rescue
attempt apparently went wrong. Chechen security forces are still
searching for the men's bodies.
	   Chechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating the killings
and was apparently kidnapped Thursday, was also released Saturday,
Interfax said.
	   Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to
Chechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news
reports said.
	   Tagirov was investigating the deaths Britons Peter Kennedy,
Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand.
They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   Their heads were found Tuesday on a highway about 40 kilometers
(25 miles) west of Grozny.
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are
mostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held
captive.
	   A Russian soldier taken hostage during the war was released
Friday after a year of efforts to free him, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported. Alexei Novikov had been seized in February 1996.
Only a handful of soldiers kidnapped during the war are still in
captivity.

	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are
mostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held
captive.
	   A Russian soldier taken hostage during the war was released
Friday after a year of efforts to free him, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported. Alexei Novikov had been seized in February 1996.
Only a handful of soldiers kidnapped during the war are still in
captivity.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union nations remained at an
impasse Saturday over the EU's future financing, but insisted that
it won't slow plans to add a dozen new members in the years ahead.
	   Wrapping up a two-day summit, the 15 EU leaders were to issue a
statement declaring ``the overall enlargement process ... well
underway.''
	   In the draft text, they promised to resolve the money dispute by
next March and urged one another to impose as much budget austerity
at the EU level as they do at home.
	   The EU's biggest ever expansion involves letting Cyprus, 10
Eastern European nations and Malta into the club in the next
decade. Negotiations began this fall, but the EU governments have
gotten stuck in a dispute over money.
	   Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark
insist on a spending freeze, keeping outlays at 85 billion European
currency units (about dlrs 100 billion) in the 2000-2006 period.
	   But Spain and other southerners fear they will lose EU funds to
poorer newcomers and argue outlays must at least rise in line with
economic growth, adding some dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by
2006.
	   In their draft text, the leaders pledged to craft ``an
appropriate financial framework'' to make enlargement possible.
``This must be done in a spirit of solidarity while ensuring
similar budgetary rigor at the level of the union as applied at the
national level.''
	   The draft text stressed the money fight must not be seen as
backtracking on enlargement itself. On the contrary, the leaders
urged the EU executive Commission and their foreign ministers ``to
maintain the momentum'' of intensive enlargement talks.
	   The leaders carefully avoided giving any entry dates so as to
keep candidates working apace on their economic and political
reforms to meet EU membership requirements.
	   On another issue, the leaders did better by agreeing to pursue
ways of how Europe can craft a credible defense arm without always
relying on the United States.
	   France and Britain _ Western Europe's only nuclear powers _
issued a joint statement this month saying the EU must be able to
act on its own with a ``credible military force'' within the
framework of NATO.
	   Complicating the money dispute is that Germany and other
northerners complain they already pay too much. German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, whose country still pays for absorbing East
Germany, made it clear Europe's enlargement problems are not going
to be solved with a German checkbook.
	   In a related issue, Prime Minister Tony Blair said he will not
give up an annual rebate Britain has been getting since 1984 for
its net payments. ``It shouldn't be negotiated away because it is
justified. Otherwise, Britain would be paying a quite
disproportionate and unfair amount into the European Union,'' he
said
	   Britain's net payment to the EU is some dlrs 8 billion, half of
which is refunded.
	   Eighty percent of the EU's budget goes to farm subsidies and aid
for poor regions. Taking on half a dozen poor East European
countries and millions of uneconomical farmers would break the
budget unless serious reforms are undertaken.
	   The leaders set a March deadline to sort out budget reform.
	   ``All around the table realized the historic need to come to a
deal,'' said Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok. ``If this bogs down
you'll see a serious crisis situation, and that you cannot do to
people whose expectations of Europe we have raised.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Two years ago, two men approached a sports
car in the wealthy Mansour district of Baghdad and raked it with
machine gun fire.
	   Amid the panic and confusion in the streets the assailants
escaped, unaware that their victim, Odai Hussein, had survived,
although with grievous injuries. Odai, President Saddam Hussein's
eldest son and then his heir apparent, was shot about 10 times and
remained in hospital for six months before appearing in public.
	   To mark the second anniversary of his narrow escape, Iraq is
holding day-long, nationwide celebrations Saturday.
	   The biggest festivities will be held in Baghdad, especially on
the street intersection where on Dec. 12, 1996 a bloodied Odai had
lain slumped in his car, only 500 meters (yards) from an
intelligence headquarters.
	   Odai, 34, has regained his health but still walks with the help
of a cane, a reminder of the bullets that had shattered his leg.
	   Prior to the assassination attempt, Odai held considerable power
in Iraq. He is known to be a close confidant of his father and had
previously run the trade and information ministries.

U.N. inspectors testing Iraq's cooperation

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Leaving their headquarters at different
times, U.N. inspectors headed out Saturday on one of their last
missions in the current round of search for Iraq's illegal weapons.
	   At least five 4-wheel drive cars, carrying the experts of the
United Nations Special Commission and their Iraqi escorts, left the
U.N. headquarters.
	   ``Our inspectors have gone out on their normal daily duties,''
UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said. She refused to say where or
what type of inspections will take place.
	   Unconfirmed reports said that the teams will on Saturday visit
sensitive sites such as the defense industry's headquarters or
offices related to national security. UNSCOM or Iraqi government
officials did not comment on the report.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear programs and long-range missiles.
Until then, the U.N. Security Council will not lift an oil embargo
and other sanctions it imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   This week's searches, which are expected to end Monday, have
been the most intensive since Iraq allowed UNSCOM to resume work
last month after putting a halt in August.
	   Iraq backed down only hours before the United States had planned
to launch military strikes on Nov. 14. President Saddam Hussein's
government also pledged full cooperation to the inspectors, and the
latest searches are seen as a test of that.
	   The inspections had proceeded smoothly this week until a
12-member team was turned away from a ruling Baath Party office on
Wednesday. But the dispute hasn't escalated.
	   Neither the Iraqis nor the U.N. inspectors have spoken of any
bid to return to the building. A party leader, however, said
Thursday that even if the inspectors return they will be turned
back as the party building is a private property.
	   The U.N. inspectors say they have the right under U.N.
resolutions to examine any site in Iraq without conditions.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned Iraq Friday
that if it did not honor its promise to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors, ``the military option remains on the table.''
	   But Albright told reporters in Washington that the United States
was reserving judgment until Butler files his report on Iraqi
cooperation to the U.N. secretary-general early next week.

Regional governors to restrict exports of food
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Regional governors, fearing food shortages this
winter, are banning the export of food to other regions of Russia
in defiance of federal law, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The governors of Krasnoyarsk and Kemerovo in Siberia will impose
the restrictions next week, the English-language Moscow Times said.
	   Although such trade restrictions are explicitly forbidden by
federal law, governors Alexander Lebed of Krasnoyarsk and Aman
Tuleyev of Kemerovo do not expect their decress to be overturned by
Moscow, the newspaper said.
	   Lebed signed an order Wednesday making it virtually impossible
to take dairy products, meat, poultry, fish and vegetables out of
the region after next Tuesday, the report said. Tuleyev was
expected to sign an order on Monday banning the export of meat from
Kemerovo.
	   Restricting the export of food without Moscow's approval is a
sign of the growing power and independence of local governors, the
report said.

Chinese sweep four shooting golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Chinese women sharpshooters swept four
Asian Games gold medals Saturday, giving their nation 18 of the 30
on offer at the games.
	   Kazakstan won three of the day's silver medals.
	   Cai Yeqing's gold in the sport pistol individual competition was
her third here. She beat Kazakstan's Yuliya Bondareva 685.3 to
683.8, with China's Cao Ying taking the bronze with 681.2.
	   Cai, Cao and Li Duihong shot a combined 1,743 in the team event
for another Chinese gold. Bondareva and her Kazakstan teammates
took silver with 1,729, and Mongolia won the bronze with 1,726.
	   In the sport rifle event, China's Shan Hong won with 672.8,
followed by Olga Dovgun of Kazakstan with 670.8 and Kong Hyun-ah of
South Korea with 670.2.
	   Shan helped her team take another gold with 1,715 to 1,702 for
Thailand and 1,700 for Uzbekistan.
	   ``I am not satisfied with my score here. But winning is the most
important,'' Shan said.
	   The squad won 12 gold medals at this year's world championships.
	   Chinese head shooting coach Zheng Heng said the team had aimed
for 16 here.
	   ``Now at last I am free of burden,'' he said after the total
reached 18.

Iran beats China 2-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ World Cup veterans Ali Daei and Karim
Beghari rallied against China to spearhead Iran's 2-1 victory
Saturday in an Asian Games soccer group decider earning both teams
quarterfinal berths.
	   Oman faced group weakling Tajikistan in the last match of the
tough qualifying group needing a victory by a near impossible seven
goals to overtake the Iranians in the runner-up spot and advance.
	   China finished atop Group 3 with two victories and a loss. Iran
also ended up with two victories and a loss but behind China on
goal differential.
	   The Chinese face Turkmenistan and the Iranians meet Uzbekistan
in the knockout quarterfinals Monday.
	   The defeat left the Chinese, who were unbeaten in their first
four Asian Games matches, still unavenged for the pair of Iranian
victories that kept them out of this year's World Cup in France.
	   Bobby Houghton, the English coach who has since taken control of
the young Chinese team, said his players had no complex about Iran
and were hoping to meet it again in the semifinals.
	   ``This has been the best game of the tournament,'' Houghton
said. ``These are the two best teams of the tournament. ''
	   ``We are at the top of the group. That has been two groups we
won now and I am pleased with that,'' he said. ``You can play well
and lose and you can play badly and win. As long as you keep a nice
steady standard, that is all you can do.''
	   China scored first. Li Jinyu fired through a wall of Iranians in
the 5th minute but his shot went straight back off the keeper's
hand. Yao Xia took control and flipped a pass to a charging Li in
front of the goal mouth.
	   Li chipped in for his fourth goal of the Asian Games.
	   The Iranians' experience and power began to show a half-hour
into the half as they got through the middle of the China defense
headed by Crystal Palace's Fan Zhiyi.
	   Daei sent a low pass from midfield to the top of the penalty
area and Beghari sent in a blistering shot to equalize.
	   Two minutes later, captain Mohammad Kani Nader, whose own goal
led to Iran's defeat to Oman in the group opener, lofted a 30-meter
free kick that found Daei's head at point blank range before the
goal.
	   The Bayern Munich star easily put Iran ahead ahead 2-1 with his
fifth goal of these games.
	   Iran male fans cheered, sang and beat out a middle Eastern
rhythm on a tambourine while five women wrapped in black Muslim
chadors sat quietly.
	   The second half was dominated by Iran's always physical defense
repeatedly turning rough.
	   Sayed Ali Mousavi, Hamid Reza Estili and Vahid Hashemian-Korbi
drew yellow cards and Iran was lucky not to receive a couple more.
	   Iranian coach Mansour Pourhydari said he couldn't predict his
team would win the gold medal but the victory clearly made it one
of the favorites.
	   ``I think we have gotten over our difficulties so now it will
only get better,'' Pourhydari said. ``We were not satisfied against
Oman. The concentration of our players was very high for this
match.''

EU seeks compromise on trade talks with South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ On an appeal from President Nelson
Mandela, European Union leaders endorsed a compromise Saturday to
resolve a dispute over wine labels threatening to derail a sweeping
trade deal with South Africa.
	   Negotiations have dragged on for four years to on a
market-opening agreement that would phase out duties on 90 percent
of the dlrs 19 billion-a-year trade between South Africa and the
15-nation EU.
	   But efforts to finalize the deal are snagged on Spanish and
Portuguese insistence that South African vintners stop calling
their fortified wines sherry or port.
	   British officials at the EU's year-end summit said negotiators
had presented the South Africans with a compromise that would allow
the South Africans to continue using the names in their domestic
and regional markets for up to 20 years, pending a review.
	   South Africa has already agreed to phase out sherry and port
from the labels on wines exported outside Africa.
	   The deadlock has raised tensions among the EU leaders, who gave
Mandela a pledge in June to wrap up the trade deal by the end of
the year.
	   ``I am really angry. It is ridiculous ... to see the trade
negotiations drag on and on for months,'' said Dutch Prime Minister
Wim Kok.
	   Mandela wrote to the EU leaders last week, appealing for
compromise.
	   However, European nations are fiercely protective of their
exclusive claims to ancient wine labels. The Iberians argue only
Spain can produce sherry and only wines from the Portuguese city of
Oporto can be labeled as port.
	   Their stance reflects French insistence this week that a Swiss
village called Champagne stop using its name on wine labels, before
the EU concluded a trade deal with Switzerland.
	   South Africa claims to have used port and sherry labels for
fortified wines for 300 years but has agreed to stop using the
terms for exports to Europe and phase them out over five-to-ten
years in most other foreign markets.
	   However, Pretoria insists it be allowed to continue marketing
fortified wines as port and sherry in its home market and
neighboring nations.
	   ``For the ordinary population, the agreement cannot be concluded
by us surrendering the household names in southern Africa of our
own port and sherry,'' Mandela wrote in his letter, extracts of
which were shown to reporters last week at EU headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium.
	   South African wine produces say sales of their wine labeled port
or sherry are worth about 750 million rand (dlrs 123 million), of
which 13 percent comes from exports.

Mahathir to attend ASEAN summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
will attend a summit of Southeast Asian leaders in Hanoi next week,
Malaysia's Foreign Ministry said Saturday.
	   It is the first time that a summit for the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations is being held in the Vietnamese capital.
	   Issues expected to be discussed at the meeting include financial
and economic matters besides consolidation of ASEAN unity and
cooperation, the ministry said in a statement.
	   Another topic will be Cambodia's admission into the group, which
now includes Thailand, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam. Laos, Indonesia,
the Philippines, Myanmar and Malaysia.
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said there were
two views on Cambodia's entry into ASEAN.
	   One group feels that the time was right for Cambodia to join the
group while the other group thinks that ``we should be careful
about accepting Cambodia,'' he said.
	   ASEAN summits are held once every three years. The last one was
in Bangkok in 1995.

EU seeks compromise on trade talks with South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ On an appeal from President Nelson
Mandela, European Union leaders endorsed a compromise Saturday to
resolve a dispute over wine labels threatening to derail a sweeping
trade deal with South Africa.
	   Negotiations have dragged on for four years on a market-opening
agreement that would phase out duties on 90 percent of the dlrs 19
billion-a-year trade between South Africa and the 15-nation EU.
	   But efforts to finalize the deal are snagged on Spanish and
Portuguese insistence that South African vintners stop calling
their fortified wines sherry or port.
	   British officials at the EU's year-end summit said negotiators
had presented the South Africans with a compromise that would allow
the South Africans to continue using the names in their domestic
and regional markets for up to 20 years, pending a review.
	   South Africa has already agreed to phase out sherry and port
from the labels on wines exported outside Africa.
	   The deadlock has raised tensions among the EU leaders, who gave
Mandela a pledge in June to wrap up the trade deal by the end of
the year.
	   ``I am really angry. It is ridiculous ... to see the trade
negotiations drag on and on for months,'' said Dutch Prime Minister
Wim Kok.
	   Mandela wrote to the EU leaders last week, appealing for
compromise.
	   However, European nations are fiercely protective of their
exclusive claims to ancient wine labels. The Iberians argue only
Spain can produce sherry and only wines from the Portuguese city of
Oporto can be labeled as port.
	   Their stance reflects French insistence this week that a Swiss
village called Champagne stop using its name on wine labels, before
the EU concluded a trade deal with Switzerland.
	   South Africa claims to have used port and sherry labels for

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The go-ahead for Japanese funding of economic
recovery programs in Thailand is expected to be announced this week
by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, but other Southeast Asian nations
have been slow to respond to the offer of help, Japanese officials
told reporters Saturday.
	   Briefing journalists in advance of Obuchi's meetings in Hanoi
with the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
Japanese government spokesman Masaki Okada expressed hope that
other nations would be inspired by the Thai projects and submit
proposals under last October's Miyazawa Plan.
	   After Japan's Parliament approved a third supplementary budget
bill on Friday, the money for stimulating the Japanese economy and
also aiding Southeast Asia during the next two years is available,
said Okada, the deputy director-general for public information.
	   In fact, he said, about dlrs 7.5 billion needs to be allocated
by the end of March, when the fiscal year ends.
	   Thailand got its proposals in early for projects to strengthen
its social safety net, increase employment, ease a credit crunch
and support corporate debt recovery.
	   Obuchi is expected to give specifics during a policy speech and
press conference on Wednesday, Okada said.
	   The speech will outline four points of Japanese relations with
the ASEAN group, he said.
	   One will be new cooperation on ``human security,'' which can
include aid for alleviating poverty to clearing land mines and
dealing with international gangs, Okada said.
	   The other points involve promotion of intellectual dialogue and
cultural exchange, helping ASEAN achieve its modernization and
trade liberalization visions for the year 2020 and continuing to
help end the economic crisis.
	   Okada sought to dampen any expectations the ASEAN leaders may
have for new announcements of aid money above the dlrs 44 billion
Japan has already earmarked in various programs.
	   That includes the two-year dlrs 30 billion initiative announced
earlier this year by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, half of
which is reserved for emergency loan assistance should the regional
economic crisis worsen.
	   But most of the remaining dlrs 15 billion is sitting idle at the
moment for want of specific proposals from the target countries,
Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea and the Philippines, Okada
indicated.
	   ``What is now needed is not more statements, but the speedy
implementation of what we have announced,'' Okada said. ``The
amount is already big enough. The problem is how to use the
money.''

Workers, students clash with police

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Students and workers attacked police
lines Saturday during a rally demanding an end to an industry
shakeup they feared will lead to mass layoffs.
	   In the shakeup, the country's major conglomerates planned to
swap or merge many debt-ridden subsidiaries in an effort to become
leaner and more competitive.
	   Thousands of workers at two of the nation's top conglomerates _
Daewoo and Samsung _ have staged daily rallies since Tuesday to
oppose the changes.
	   The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, a militant union group
claiming half a million members in the automotive and other key
industries, threatened to call a nationwide strike unless the
government cancels the restructuring.
	   Students and activists from the labor confederation joined
Daewoo and Samsung workers in a large outdoor rally Saturday in
central Seoul.
	   ``No to layoffs!'' 3,000 protesters chanted in a downtown park.
	   Colorful labor union flags and banners demanding job security
fluttered in the cold winter sky. Shaking clenched fists, the
workers sang labor songs to ear-splitting music from a battery of
loudspeakers.
	   Fierce shoving matches erupted when the protesters marched along
the sidewalks to a Roman Catholic cathedral several blocks away.
	   In two more violent clashes, 400 students and workers traded
kicks and punches with riot police forming human barricades with
helmets and shields. The protesters briefly overpowered the police
and pummeled them with sticks and batons they took from the police.
	   Students stomped several policemen on the pavement until they
were rescued by other officers.
	   No serious injuries or arrests were reported.
	   Smaller rallies took place in at least three provincial cities,
according to the national Yonhap News Agency. Hundreds of workers
marched peacefully after those rallies, it said.
	   The new spat of workers' anger erupted when the Daewoo
conglomerate agreed to swap its electronics subsidiary with the
auto-making subsidiary of the Samsung group in a
government-mediated deal on Monday.
	   Samsung Motors will be absorbed by Daewoo Motors, the nation's
No. 2 carmaker, while Daewoo Electronics will be merged into
Samsung's home appliance arm, the nation's largest.
	   Workers at both Samsung Motors and Daewoo Electronics opposed
the swap deal and walked off their jobs in protest.
	   The dlrs 10 billion deal is a key part of an industrial
restructuring in which the nation's top five conglomerates _
Hyundai, Samsung, LG, Daewoo and SK _ will spin off half of their
264 subsidiaries.
	   President Kim Dae-jung said restructuring South Korea's bloated,
family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebol, was crucial to
boosting foreign confidence in the country's battered economy.

Israeli planes raid south Lebanon

	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired missiles and
strafed suspected hideouts of pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas in
south Lebanon Saturday, Lebanese security officials said.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties. There was also no
word on what prompted the attack.
	   The officials said two Israeli planes struck at 12:40 p.m. (0640
GMT), attacking the hills northeast of the Israeli ``security
zone,'' an occupied area in south Lebanon.
	   The jets fired two air-to-surface rockets and strafed over Jabal
al-Rafih, a Shiite Muslim stronghold in Iqlim el-Tuffah province,
said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The Shiite Hezbollah, or Party of God, is fighting to oust the
1,200 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied militiamen of the South
Lebanon Army from the occupied ``security zone.''
	   Israel set up the 440-square-mile (1,100-square-kilometer) zone
in 1985 to shield northern Israeli towns from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.

	   NAGANO, Japan (AP) _ Olympic gold medalist Catriona Lemay Doan
of Canada won the women's 500- and 1,000-meter titles Saturday in
the first round of the Nagano World Cup speedskating competition.
	   World-record holder Hiroyasu Shimizu, also an Olympic champion,
won a gold for host Japan in his specialty, the 500 meters, before
a capacity crowd of 5,500 at the M-Wave Arena.
	   A fourth gold at stake, the men's 1,000-meter title, went to
Olympic silver medalist Jan Bos of the Netherlands.
	   In all, Canada and Japan bagged four medals each, while Bos also
won the bronze in the 500 meters. The United States, Germany and
Russia each had a bronze medal.
	   Two bronze medals were awarded in the women's 1,000 meters as
Olympic silver medalist Chris Witty of the United States and
Monique Garbrecht of Germany were tied for third at 1 minute, 18.63
seconds.
	   Another round of the women's and men's competition also in the
500 and 1,000 meters takes place on the second and final day.
	   The two-day competition is the first of five sprint speedskating
World Cups scheduled for the 1998-1999 season.
	   The first two of another five speedskating World Cups for 1,500
meters and longer distances were held in Europe last month.
	   Lemay Doan won the 500 meters in 38.67 seconds, or 0.50 second
faster than second-place Eriko Sanmiya of Japan. Svetlana Zhurova
of Russia was third in 39.19 seconds.
	   In the afternoon, the 27-year-old Canadian triumphed in the
1,000 meters with a time of 1:18.07, again ahead of Sanmiya, this
time with a margin of 0.42 second.
	   ``I really wasn't happy with the 500 meters,'' Lemany Doan.
``Sometimes you just have to get through the first race of the
year. Then it's over and you go from there. I was very happy with
my 1,000 meters. It was a very good race for me.
	   ``You go into every race being positive. I think my biggest goal
tomorrow is to have much better 500 meters and be more relaxed. If
that brings me golds, it'll be great.''
	   Shimizu, the first Japanese ever to win a speedskating gold,
overcame his shaky physical condition to outrace Jeremy Wotherspoon
in 35.40, or 0.64 seconds faster than the second-place Canadian.
	   ``According to newspaper reports, I'm suffering from a cold,''
Shimizu said jokingly in a voice that sounded like he had a stuffed
nose. ``Yet, I was faster than a number of hopefuls from abroad
because, I think, you'll need quite a few days to get over with jet
lag.''
	   Shimizu set his world record of 34.82 at a world championship in
Calgary in March.
	   Bos won the 1,000 meters in 1:11.20, followed by Junichi Inoue
of Japan, who finished in 1:11.70. Wotherspoon placed third in
1:11.82.
	   ``I think my 500-meter lap time could've been faster. But it was
my first race of the year, so I'm not too much concerned about
it,'' said the 23-year-old Bos, adding that he was pleased with his
1,000 meters. ``We'll have to wait and see what happens tomorrow.''

Hamas warns of bombing attacks unless leader released from house
</HEADLINE>
arrest &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Islamic militants on Saturday threatened
attacks on Israel by the end of the month if their leader is not
released by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
	   Arafat ordered Sheik Ahmed Yassin placed under house arrest in
October when a Hamas-affiliated suicide bomber tried to blow up a
school bus carrying Jewish settler children in the Gaza Strip.
	   ``We are giving the Palestinian Authority until Dec. 25 to lift
the house arrest order placed on Sheikh Yassin,'' a pamphlet faxed
to news agencies said.
	   ``If this is not done then the Qassem brigades will have no
choice but to carry out new bombing attacks against the Zionist
entity and its forces, attacks that would make the Zionist entity
pay a heavy price,'' it said. The Qassem brigades are the military
wing of Hamas.
	   The October attempt on the school children was seen as an
attempt to scuttle the just-achieved U.S.-brokered Wye River
accords.
	   Arafat is anxious to be seen as upholding the accords, and wants
this weekend's visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton to go as
smoothly as possible. He has ordered other Hamas activists arrested
as a means of preventing trouble.
	   After Yassin's arrest, Hamas maintained a low profile heading up
to the Clinton visit _ but the pamphlet was a sign that it expects
its leader released soon after Clinton leaves.
	   Yassin, who is almost blind and wheelchair bound, suffers a
multitude of health problems.
	   ``We hold the Palestinian Authority and its head, Yasser Arafat,
responsible for any health problems the Sheik may suffer,'' the
pamphlet said.

	   MOBA, Congo (AP) _ Sitting at the wheel of an Italian-made
speedboat racing past the green mountain shores of Lake Tangyanika,
a rebel commander said Saturday his troops were poised to capture
the last government stronghold of the vast central African lake.
	   Col. Nora Songolo said his forces, backed by Rwanda and more
recently Burundi, were in control of all other towns on the western
shore of 720-kilometer long lake and were fighting to capture
Molira, on the border with Zambia.
	   ``From (the northernmost Congolese lakeshore town) Uvira to the
Zambian border, we control the lake,'' said Col. Nora Songolo. ``We
are about to capture Molira.''
	   The rebels and their Rwandan allies use the fiberglass
speedboats with anti-aircraft guns to move swiftly and fire on
government fighter jets whose regular raids have slowed but not
stopped rebel advances in eastern Congo.
	   He said the rebels were in control of the airstrip and fishing
village of Moba, 160 kilometers (100 miles) further north,
dismissing as false government claims of a successful
counteroffensive.
	   Although in full control of the remote shore-town however, the
rebels had yet convince war-weary fishermen and farmers to return
to their abandoned hamlet, Songolo said.
	   Like a ghost town, most of Moba's mud brick and straw roof
houses stand empty since the town fell to rebels a month ago.
	   The few remaining residents said their relatives and friends
were hesitant to come back, afraid of either the new army or air
strikes by Zimbabwe, President Laurent Kabila's main ally in the
four-month war.
	   On Tuesday, a Zimbabwean MiG-21 dropped bombs on abandoned
houses a few meters (yards) from the port. There were no
casualties.
	   Songolo said he was setting up anti-aircraft guns around the
town's grassy airstrip, which sits on a plateau on the lush,
3,000-meter (9,900-foot) high Mugila Mountains.
	   The fertile soil used to feed the mineral-rich Katanga Province
before the second war in as many years made roads dangerous and
long, risky lake travel the only way to sell potatoes and maize.
	   But the most difficult challenge facing the rebel coalition of
ethnic Tutsis, disaffected Congolese soldiers and opposition
politicians who took up arms Aug. 2 _ accusing Kabila of misrule
and ethnic warmongering _ is convincing Kabila's Baluba tribesmen
in eastern Katanga to cooperate.
	   Like Kabila, most people saw the rebels as foreign invaders and
they have yet to prove the benefits of their democratic programs
for the potentially rich but impoverished country.
	   Right now, Songolo, himself a defector from Lubumbashi,
Katanga's capital, said the priority was getting Kabila to
negotiate peace directly with the rebels.
	   So far, Kabila has refused, saying the rebels are pawns of their
backers Rwanda and Uganda. He insists the war against him is a
foreign invasion and that Rwandan and Ugandan troops must leave
before any cease fire can be implemented.
	   ``We will continue pushing for Lubumbashi until Kabila realizes
our military strength,'' Songolo said. ''He has no other (choice)
but to negotiate with us.'
	   Kabila's refusal to negotiate directly with the rebels has so
far torpedoed international and regional efforts to negotiate a
cease-fire in Congo.
	   A summit in the Zambian capital Lusaka, originally scheduled for
Dec. 14-15 to bring the parties together to sign a cease-fire
proposed by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan at a summit in Paris
last month, has not yet been confirmed.
	   The conflict has drawn in Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad on
Kabila's side and Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi on the rebel side.
	   Burundi offically denies involvement in Congo, but missionaries,
political sources and rebels said an estimated 3,000 Burundian
troops were present along Congo's Tanganyika shores to secure
Burundian coffee exports to Zambia and keep Burundian Hutu fighters
from using eastern Congo as their rear base.
	   Rebel commander Gaston Sangba said his forces in Moba had
captured 364 Burundian rebels, four Zimbabweans and one white
Namibian officer _ identified as Roger Vandamno.
	   He said all the prisoners had been transfered to eastern rebel
stronghold Goma on the northern shore of Lake Kivu.

Report: Ajax fires Danish coach after run of bad results
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch champion Ajax Amsterdam
fired its Danish coach Morten Olsen Saturday three days after the
club was dumped out of the Champions League following a 3-0 defeat
by Porto in Portugal, Dutch media reported.
	   Ajax spokesman David Endt refused to confirm the reports, but
said that the club had called a special press conference for
Saturday afternoon. Endt would not say if Olsen would be at the
conference.
	   Olsen, 49, has been in charge of the Netherlands' most storied
club for less than two seasons.
	   In his first year in charge he led Ajax to a domestic league and
cup double but success in European competitions has eluded the club
under Olsen.
	   Jan Wouters, a former Ajax player and Dutch international is
expected to succeed Olsen. Wouters is currently a junior trainer at
Ajax.
	   Olsen made a record 102 appearances for Denmark and captained
his national side at the European Championship in France in 1982
and at the World Cup in Mexico in 1986. After ending his playing
career, he turned to training but was fired by Danish club Broendby
IF and Germany's FC Cologne.
	   When he signed a two-year contract in January 1997, Olsen
pledged to continue Ajax's trademark attacking style of soccer, but
in recent weeks the club, plagued by injuruies to key players, has
struggled for form. The club currently is third, nine points adrift
of leader and arch rival Feyernoord Rotterdam.
	   At Ajax's most recent home game, fans waved white handkerchiefs
to express their desire to see the back of Olsen.
	   Belgian club Anderlecht reportedly has offered Olsen a contract.

Libyan oil minister calls for `drastic' cut in production
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya's oil minister said Saturday that
``drastic measures'' must be taken to reduce output by
oil-producing countries to stem the fall in world prices.
	   Producers should cooperate with the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to boost the prices, the Libyan minister,
Abdalla Salem El-Badri, told reporters at a regional oil meeting.
	   ``Efforts are needed to stop that decline. Unless quick and
drastic measures are taken immediately to reduce the reserve and
make further cuts the situation will worsen,'' he said.
	   ``What we need is to reduce the reserve, even if we are obliged
to make drastic cuts for a certain period,'' he said.
	   El-Badri is the chairman of the 11-member Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is holding its one-day annual
conference here.
	   In his opening remarks to the conference, el-Badri said: ``We
are duty bound to overcome this danger and work to achieve just
revenues in order to accomplish development.''
	   The focus of the conference this year is the record low prices
caused by a slump in demand in recession-hit Asia and warmer than
usual winters in the West. The losses are battering the economies
of the petroleum dependent countries, especially Libya and the Gulf
countries.
	   OAPEC includes the Arab OPEC members, Saudi Arabia, United Arab
Emirates, Qatar, Libya, Kuwait, Iraq and Algeria. Its non-OPEC
members are Oman, Egypt and Syria.
	   El-Badri said OPEC has lost dlrs 56 billion so far during the
current oil price crisis, which has seen the January futures
contracts for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fall to a
record low of dlrs 9.92 a barrel.
	   El-Badri made no mention of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's call
on Thursday for a complete production halt by OPEC nations during
the winter.
	   When asked whether OPEC members Venezuela and Iran were to blame
for OPEC's lack of progress in implementing further cuts, El-Badri
replied: ``I'm not accusing anyone, but the problem exists, and
every country is affected by it.''
	   He said that oil producers are suffering because the raw
materials and equipment they import are expensive, while oil is
selling very cheaply.
	   ``This equation is unjust,'' he said. ``It harms the producers.
They have to wake up and know there is a danger, because it affects
their people and there will be social catastrophes very soon.''
	   Last month, El-Badri called for an additional one million to 1.5
million barrels a day OPEC production cut, but ministers failed to
act on the measure.
	   On Wednesday, Gulf Arab OPEC states unilaterally decided to
extend until the end of 1999 a one-year cut in oil production
agreed upon by OPEC and non-OPEC members.
	   Under the agreement, which is scheduled to comes to an end in
June, OPEC is reducing its production by 2.6 million barrels a day
and non-OPEC members are cutting output by 700,000 barrels a day.

French gay rights measure seen accelerating European debate

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ On the sunny morning of Oct. 1, 1989, Ivan Larsen
linked arms with his true love and marched out of Copenhagen's town
hall, grinning broadly.
	   Larsen's wedded bliss had a historic twist: He and his spouse
were among 11 homosexual couples married that day in Denmark _ the
first day any country in the world allowed such marriages.
	   ``It was the best day of my life,'' says Larsen, a Copenhagen
minister. ``Everyone should be able to marry the person they
love.''
	   Nine years later, gay marriage remains legal in only Denmark,
Sweden, the Netherlands and Iceland. But a controversial bill
before the French parliament has accelerated the debate across the
continent.
	   ``France is at the border of the Protestant north and the
Catholic south,'' said Olivier Duhamel, a Socialist member of the
European Parliament and a professor at the Sorbonne in Paris. ``If
the bill is approved, it could push other European countries,
especially those to the south, in the same direction.''
	   The discussion in France, which could lead Europe toward broader
acceptance of gay couples, contrasts with a backlash in the United
States, where referendums on gay marriage were shot down in two
states during recent elections.
	   France's Socialist-led government has made it clear that the
bill, while giving gay couples a series of legal rights, would not
allow them to actually marry _ much less adopt children.
	   Still, opponents say it goes too far. First introduced in
October, the so-called Civil Solidarity Pact has triggered fierce
debate and street protests by those who fear it could lead to
homosexual adoption.
	   Leading the battle has been Christine Boutin, a conservative
lawmaker who argues that the government has tried to sanitize the
bill, which also applies to unwed heterosexual couples.
	   ``It was designed for homosexuals and the government has tried
to hide that,'' Boutin said. ``That's completely unacceptable.''
	   Even Socialist politicians have failed to rally around the bill.
When the proposal was first submitted to parliament, conservatives
were able to scuttle it on a procedural vote because so few
Socialists bothered to show up.
	   The lack of vocal support, even from the party behind the bill,
shows that homosexuality remains on the fringe of what is
acceptable in this Catholic and often socially conservative
country.
	   ``It's an uncomfortable topic for a Latin culture,'' noted
Michel Maffesoli, a sociology professor at the Sorbonne.
	   The government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has revised the
bill, which would allow a union of two unrelated people to file
joint tax returns, gain inheritance benefits and share social
security coverage, among other things.
	   The major change was to grant some benefits to siblings, an
addition some say was meant to deflect conservative criticism. But
that amendment is likely to be struck after Justice Minister
Elisabeth Guigou said it could be unconstitutional.
	   Despite the uproar, the bill should become law by next fall. The
lower house of parliament adopted it Dec. 9. It now goes to the
Senate _ probably in March _ and will then be taken up by the
Constitutional Council, France's highest legal body.
	   ``Gay people are proud their concerns are being addressed,''
said Thomas Doustaly, editor of the magazine Tetu, which focuses on
gay issues. ``Never before have gays been at the center of a
political debate in France.''
	   Germany's new center-left government, taking its cue from
France, has also recently proposed granting some legal status to
same-sex couples, making it clear it won't give homosexual couples
the right to adopt.
	   ``We're not calling it gay marriage,'' Justice Minister Herta
Daeuber-Gmelin said recently.
	   France and Germany appear timid when compared to their northern
neighbors.
	   Following Denmark's lead, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands
have all passed measures granting varying degrees of legal rights
to gay couples.
	   France's proposal, although not as bold as the laws to the
north, will likely influence countries such as Italy, Spain and
possibly Portugal.
	   Gay-rights advocates in Italy are watching the French debate
closely, hoping it will spur lawmakers there to bring forward a
handful of bills currently lingering at the bottom of the
legislative agenda.
	   ``Italy has a tradition of following France when it comes to
government measures and new legislation,'' Maffesoli said. ``Spain
is also somewhat under our influence.''
	   While Europeans have been slowly moving toward legal recognition
of gay couples, U.S. voters have been saying no.
	   Measures to block gay marriages passed overwhelmingly in Alaska
and Hawaii in recent elections. Since 1993, at least 30 states have
banned gay marriages.
	   In California, a proposal to recognize only heterosexual
marriages as legal has won a spot on the primary ballot in 2000.
	   Still, the momentum toward more widespread acceptance of gay
marriage could be hard to stop.
	   ``It is not such a problem to be gay and lesbian anymore,''
Larsen said. ``I am sure that in several years' time, same-sex
marriage will be accepted in many places, even across the U.S.''

	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ As rescue workers combed through
the wreckage of a Thai Airways jetliner Saturday searching for the
remaining survivors and the bodies of victims, police said they
expect the final death toll from the crash to total 101 people.
	   Surat Thani hospital said that of the 146 on board, 94 were
confirmed dead and 45 had survived. The remaining seven people were
still missing, but police held out little hope that any were still
alive.
	   Relatives coming to claim the bodies of the dead broke into
tears after arriving at the crowded, confused passenger terminal at
Surat Thani airport. There were also tearful reunions.
	   At the scene of the crash in a muddy swamp, workers using
special equipment cut through what remained of the jet's fuselage
to extract bodies and anyone who might still be alive inside. Rain
fell throughout the day.
	   Battling a heavy rainstorm, Thai Airways Flight TG261, an Airbus
A310-200, plunged into the swamp at around 6:45 p.m. on Friday
after bursting into flames about 700 meters (765 yards) from the
air strip.
	   It was the third attempt by the jetliner to land at Surat Thani,
a fishing port and travel hub for vacation resorts located 330
miles (530 kilometers) southwest of Bangkok.
	   Police said the black box, or flight recorder, had been
recovered early Saturday.
	   ``We don't know yet. It's very difficult to guess, we cannot
guess, it has to be investigated,'' said Thai Airways President
Thamnoon Wanglee when asked about the cause of the crash.
	   Coffins were lined up at the airport terminal with a flight
scheduled later Saturday to transport them to Bangkok. Poor weather
delayed landing of the aircraft that brought relatives of the dead
and survivors to Surat Thani.
	   ``He doesn't remember what happened after the plane crashed, but
he's safe. I am so relieved,'' said Pippa Bray, the girlfriend of
Briton David Wilson, who survived the crash.
	   Ms. Bray, of Surrey, England, said she was watching television
in Bangkok when she saw Wilson being carried from the crash site by
two rescue workers.
	   Most of the passengers were Thais. Of the at least 25 foreigners
on board, at least a dozen had survived, including three
Australians, three Japanese, three Germans, two Israelis and one
Briton.
	   Officials said work on a complete casualty list was slow since
seven corpses were burned beyond recognition and information on
passengers was difficult to obtain since flyers on domestic routes
did not need to fill out forms.
	   Many of the dead were believed to have drowned in the waist-high
swamp water while trapped in the wreckage.
	   Some 200 rescue workers and volunteers from nearby villagers
struggled to pull bodies from the burnt, twisted metal of the
wrecked plane.
	   ``I pulled out about 20 dead bodies,'' said Pornsak Jaratrae,
23, who rushed to the scene from his village when he heard there
was a crash.
	   ``We had to dive into the freezing water to find bodies. It was
so difficult, I never did anything like that before,'' a soaked and
shivering Pornsak said.
	   He said volunteers initially were turned back from the site
until equipment arrived for dousing flames from the still-burning
aircraft.
	   Police said at least five children _ four boys and a girl _ were
among the hospitalized survivors.
	   Ambulances were unable to reach the crash site, leaving
four-wheel-drive vehicles to navigate the mud. Still, officials
said the water that has hampered rescuers may have cushioned the
aircraft's impact.
	   Flight attendant Akradej Pudemha said that as the plane shook
violently on its third attempt to land, some passengers began to
panic.
	   ``People started screaming. I told them to calm down, but some
were out of control. They wouldn't stay in their seats. They were
thrown around by the shaking of the plane and luggage was flying
everywhere,'' he said.
	   Akradej, who helped rescue 10 passengers, said most of the
survivors were seated at the front of the aircraft.
	   ``I don't remember hitting the ground, just people screaming and
being in half a plane,'' said Lucinda Rhodes, an Australian
survivor, from a hospital bed. ``The aircraft split lengthwise
because there was another whole bit of it about 20 meters (yards)
away but we were in a tree.''
	   Lying in a nearby bed, Australian Melanie McNamee, said her
friend Lucinda, a 24-year-old Sydney accountant, saved her life.
	   ``She was dragging me along because I could barely walk because
I'd fractured three ribs and also a fracture in my spine,'' Ms.
McNamee, also 24, said. ``We were running through all these swamps
just trying to get away from the airplane before it blew up.''
	   A gardener living near the crash site, Sophon Sapkong, 42, said
he heard a loud noise, came out of his home and saw ``the airplane
try to go up high. Then I saw a light, bright like the sunset,
about four stories off the ground, then a fireball falling.''
	   Airbus announced from its headquarters in Toulouse, France, that
it would send five specialists to assist Thai authorities in their
investigation.
	   Airbus said the plane was delivered in April 1986 and had
accumulated 23,000 flight hours.

Status of same-sex couples across Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-Europe-Gay Marriage &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Status of same-sex couples across Europe, in brief:
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DENMARK: In 1989 became the first country in the world to allow
same-sex marriages. But gay couples cannot adopt children.
	   SWEDEN: Has allowed homosexuals to register as partners in a
sort of civil marriage since 1995. The couples cannot adopt
children or have them through artificial means.
	   NETHERLANDS: New law took effect earlier this year permitting
gay and lesbian couples to marry, giving them the same pension,
social security and inheritance rights as other married couples.
Dutch Cabinet approved a plan in November to let homosexuals adopt
children. The proposal will likely go before parliament early next
year.
	   ICELAND: Approved ``registered cohabitation'' in 1996, which
gives gay couples many of the legal rights enjoyed by heterosexual
married couples, but doesn't allow adoption.
	   BELGIUM: A law passed in March gives gay couples inheritance
rights and allows them to open joint bank accounts.
	   FRANCE: Same-sex couples currently have no legal status. Bill to
give some rights to homosexual and unmarried heterosexual couples
is currently under heated debate in parliament.
	   SPAIN: Gay couples have no official status. Northeastern
Catalonia region, however, recently passed a law recognizing
homosexual couples but barring them from adopting children or
receiving inheritance benefits.
	   ITALY: A few cities have taken the symbolic step of creating a
register for unmarried couples, but the measures carry no legal
weight.
	   GERMANY: The new center-left government intends to grant some
legal status to same-sex couples, but not the right to adopt
children.
	   BRITAIN: In July, about 100 British legislators voiced support
for efforts to give homosexuals the right to receive partner's
state pension after death.
	   HUNGARY: Passed a law in 1996 granting gay couples inheritance
rights, but law doesn't allow adoptions.

EU looks again at duty free, stops short of reprieve
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with summit agreeing to study impact of ban, stops
short of reprieve; EDITS to conform
 &UR; With EU-Summit
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders agreed Saturday to
look again an impending ban on tax-free shopping, but stopped short
of granting a reprieve for the perk that lets millions of travelers
snap up liquor, tobacco and other bargains.
	   The 15-EU leaders released a statement calling for a three-month
study into potential job-losses that may be caused by the scheduled
abolition in June of duty-free sales within the 15-nation Union.
	   The leaders left the door open for a ``possible limited
extension'' of duty-free shopping, depending on results of the
study.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, backed by his German and
French counterparts, campaigned to overturn a 1991 decision to
scrap duty-free by the summer of next year.
	   But saving duty free needs unanimous support from all 15
nations, and some remain opposed. Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok held
out for the ban, backed by Denmark, Belgium, Finland and Italy.
They insisted any stay be limited to a few months.
	   France sought a five-year reprieve, Britain also spoke in terms
of years.
	   The duty-free debate briefly pushed weighty issues like defense
and reform of the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget to the back of the
summit agenda.
	   Blair is under particular pressure to rescue tax-free shopping
which is immensely popular among Britons who flock to ferry boats
crossing the English Channel to buy cheap supplies of liquor,
cigarettes and perfume. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook this week
called the proposed ban ``the most visible and high-profile (EU)
decision'' for the British public.
	   In continental nations with lower domestic alcohol taxes, the
ban issue is less contentious, although airlines, shipping
companies and labor unions claim scrapping the dlrs
6.4-billion-a-year duty-free industry will push up the cost of
travel and throw some 150,000 people out of work.
	   Supporters of abolition say duty-free operators effectively
enjoy a subsidy of dlrs 2.2 billion a year by not paying duties,
giving them an unfair advantage over other retailers. The EU voted
unanimously in 1991 to abolish tax-free shopping, claiming it was
incompatible with the notion of a seamless EU market.
	   The ban only affects sales for travelers within the EU. Those
traveling to or from the Union will still be able to enjoy tax free
shopping.

	   MOBA, Congo (AP) _ Sitting at the wheel of an Italian-made
speedboat racing past the green mountain shores of Lake Tangyanika,
a rebel commander said Saturday his troops were poised to capture
the last government stronghold of the vast central African lake.
	   Col. Nora Songolo said his forces, backed by Rwanda and more
recently Burundi, were in control of all other towns on the western
shore of 720-kilometer long lake and were fighting to capture
Molira, on the border with Zambia.
	   ``From (the northernmost Congolese lakeshore town) Uvira to the
Zambian border, we control the lake,'' said Col. Nora Songolo. ``We
are about to capture Molira.''
	   The rebels and their Rwandan allies use the fiberglass
speedboats with antiaircraft guns to move swiftly and fire on
government fighter jets whose regular raids have slowed but not
stopped rebel advances in eastern Congo.
	   He said the rebels were in control of the airstrip and fishing
village of Moba, 160 kilometers (100 miles) further north,
dismissing government claims of a successful counteroffensive.
	   Although in full control of the remote town, the rebels have yet
to convince war-weary fishermen and farmers to return to their
abandoned hamlet, Songolo said. Like a ghost town, most of Moba's
mud brick and straw roof houses stand empty since the town fell to
rebels a month ago.
	   The few remaining residents said their relatives and friends
were hesitant to come back, afraid of either the new army or air
strikes by Zimbabwe, President Laurent Kabila's main ally in the
four-month war.
	   On Tuesday, a Zimbabwean MiG-21 dropped bombs on the abandoned
houses. There were no casualties.
	   But the most difficult challenge facing the rebel coalition of
ethnic Tutsis, disaffected Congolese soldiers and opposition
politicians who took up arms Aug. 2, is convincing Kabila's Baluba
tribesmen in eastern Katanga to cooperate.
	   Like Kabila, most people saw the rebels as foreign invaders and
they have yet to prove the benefits of their democratic programs
for the potentially rich but impoverished country.
	   Right now, Songolo, himself a defector from Lubumbashi,
Katanga's capital, said the priority was getting Kabila to
negotiate peace directly with the rebels.
	   So far, Kabila has refused, saying the rebels are pawns of their
backers Rwanda and Uganda. His refusal to negotiate directly with
the rebels has so far torpedoed international and regional efforts
to negotiate a cease-fire in Congo.
	   A summit in the Zambian capital Lusaka, originally scheduled for
Dec. 14-15 to bring the parties together to sign a cease-fire
proposed by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan at a summit in Paris
last month, has not yet been confirmed.
	   The conflict has drawn in Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad on
Kabila's side and Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi on the rebel side.
	   Burundi officially denies involvement in Congo, but
missionaries, political sources and rebels said an estimated 3,000
Burundian troops were present along Congo's Tanganyika shores to
secure Burundian coffee exports to Zambia and keep Burundian Hutu
fighters from using eastern Congo as their rear base.

 &UR; Bioweapon threat seen rising, but treaty talks are far from getting
results &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos NY343-346 of Dec. 7 &QL;

 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ At least 10 countries are suspected of developing
biological weapons, American and European specialists warn, and
contentious international talks show scant promise of countering
them.
	   The only legal barrier to toxic arms that can kill by the
millions is the toothless Biological Weapons Convention of 1972.
Except for U.N. resolutions on Iraq, no mandate allows spot checks
across borders.
	   Opponents of new treaty provisions for inspection visits include
not only leaders with something to hide but also U.S. drug
executives who fear for the secrecy of research worth billions of
dollars.
	   The result, scientists and intelligence analysts agree, is the
nightmare of a proliferating ``poor man's bomb,'' potentially more
deadly than nuclear devices or chemical weapons such as nerve gas,
at a fraction of the cost.
	   Already, U.S. and European officials see evidence that Russian
experts are helping several countries to perfect bioweapons,
privately or officially, and some states are believed cooperating
with terrorists.
	   Also, they say, private Western suppliers are evading export
controls to sell equipment needed to make weapons.
	   During three years of negotiations in Geneva, a working group
representing more than 60 countries has produced a thick ``rolling
text'' draft of new proposals and a promise to work harder over 16
weeks next year.
	   Specialists are divided over what to expect. Some fear that a
watered-down new protocol to the treaty would do little more than
create a false sense of security.
	   Milton Leitenberg of the University of Maryland, who has tracked
secret bioweapons programs for decades, says experience in Iraq
proved that a committed offender can thwart the most dogged
investigators.
	   ``After eight years of blatant violations by Iraq _ gross,
transparent lying _ what are the implications for a new
international treaty, even if we get one?'' he put it. ``They are
dreadful.''
	   Others argue that any provision allowing visits would help even
if inspectors might not find a smoking gun. Signs of a coverup or
other clues can reveal the existence of a clandestine program,
explained Matthew Meselson of Harvard, longtime adviser to U.S.
administrations.
	   Yet without some international control mechanism, he added, the
world faces ``an eternal twilight of suspicion.'' Countries can
inflict casualties or destroy crops in ways that suggest natural
causes.
	   ``With weapons that go bang, you know when you're at war and who
your enemy is,'' Meselson said. ``With biological weapons, it is
different.''
	   In a report to Congress this year, the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency said bioweapons programs were confirmed or
suspected in Russia, Iraq, China, Syria, Iran, Egypt, Libya and
Taiwan.
	   A separate Defense Department report said North Korea was
pursuing germ warfare research at universities and special centers
and has tested biological weapons on its island territories.
	   The U.S. Office of Technology Assessment says that Israel, which
like Syria and Egypt has not ratified the 1972 treaty, likely has
the capacity to deliver anthrax, botulinum toxin or other
pathogens.
	   British authorities name 10 countries of ``proliferation
concern'': Russia, Iraq, North Korea, China, Iran, Libya, Syria,
Egypt, Israel and Taiwan.
	   U.S. and European intelligence sources believe other hidden
research remains undetected elsewhere.
	   South Africa had a substantial capability until the early 1990s,
and some of it may remain. Cuba is suspected, among others.
	   India and Pakistan, which each surprised the world with nuclear
bomb tests, could easily develop biological weapons, specialists
say, although nothing yet shows that they have.
	   How serious and imminent the threat is remains largely
guesswork, experts say, because only intrusive inspections like
those being forced on Iraq can get at the truth.
	   Programs are easily hidden from spying satellites, cloaked by
medical research. So-called ``dual use'' equipment is exported to
fight agricultural pests and disease and then diverted to weaponry.
	   ``We don't know what's out there because you can't get in to
find out,'' Leitenberg said.
	   Richard Spertzel, a former U.S. military microbiologist who
directed the U.N. teams that exposed Iraq's germ warfare work,
echoed his point.
	   ``If a government wants to hide a biological weapons program and
can stall an inspection visit by 24 to 48 hours, there's no way in
hell you're going to find it,'' said Spertzel, who is now retired.
	   ``A country with know-how can obtain the necessary equipment,''
Spertzel said, ``and Iraq has proved that if a rogue state is
willing to suffer for any length of time, it can get away with
it.''
	   U.N. investigators estimate that Iraq has enough pathogens to
kill humankind twice over, and a dozen missiles to deliver some of
the deadly payload. This is apart from chemical weapons.
	   ``Sanctions were and are a joke in Iraq,'' said Spertzel.
``Stuff is still going in there.''
	   Scott Ritter, a former U.S. Marine who quit the U.N. Iraq team,
accused Western leaders of lacking the will to act firmly even when
they know a country is violating the Biological Weapons Convention.
	   ``If the world won't stand up in Iraq where we do have a law,''
he asked, ``what can we expect where we don't have a law?''
	   Russian stockpiles and expertise remain a primary threat.
	   The 1972 treaty had no verification provisions, because of
Soviet objections and because delivery systems were still
rudimentary.

	   President Richard Nixon dismantled the large U.S. biological
weapons program in 1969, leaving only defensive research permitted
under the treaty.
	   But U.S. officials say much remains of a Soviet program that
until 1992 employed 60,000 people and stockpiled tons of lethal
material.
	   Specialists fear Russia's economic slide has put irresistible
pressure on jobless scientists and technicians to hire out their
skills, if not smuggle equipment or deadly cultures.
	   The destruction of the Soviet Union's stock of smallpox was
never verified, said Donald A. Henderson of Johns Hopkins
University, who directed the World Health Organization program that
eradicated the disease.
	   ``Russia worries me,'' agreed Graham Pearson, former head of the
Porton Down center, which housed Britain's dismantled bioweapons
program. ``It is a big problem.''
	   European and U.S. intelligence reports say that not only some
smallpox but also anthrax strains and other agents were taken over
by the Russian military and shrouded in secrecy.
	   Ken Alibek, deputy director of the giant Biopreparat program
until he defected to the United States in 1992, confirms this,
explaining that Russian defense officials are free of most civilian
oversight.
	   And, he adds, he believes that his former colleagues are still
at work.
	   ``It is hard for me to imagine that their efforts have no
relation to biological weapons,'' he wrote in The New York Times.
	   Although details are classified, U.S. officials say freelance
Russians _ as Alibek warned Congress _ are helping Third World
countries solve specific problems in weaponizing pathogens.
	   Even at a government level, recent history is unsettling.
	   U.N. inspectors found evidence that Russia agreed in 1995 to
sell Iraq a sophisticated 5,000-liter (1,320-gallon) fermenter, 10
times bigger than anything the Iraqis had.
	   The relatively low-tech requirements of biological weapons are
surprisingly simple for governments to obtain, especially since
most elements also have legitimate uses in medicine or science.
	   This was evident in Iraq's case, at least until Saddam Hussein
invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Before Saddam came to be seen as a threat, Iraq obtained anthrax
from a Rockville, Maryland, lab. European companies supplied
equipment and expertise. Iraqi scientists studied in Western
universities.
	   A British company supplied Iraq with 40 tons of growth medium
when only kilos (pounds) of it were necessary for medical use.
Authorities accepted the explanation that it was a legitimate
mistake.
	   But Rolf Ekeus, head of the U.N. inspectors in Iraq until last
year, is cynical about the role of Western business.
	   ``Many suppliers know exactly what they are doing, and they are
in it only for the money,'' he said.
	   Ekeus has compiled a list of European sellers from seized Iraqi
documents. He won't name them, but said with a laugh: ``Oh, perhaps
only Liechtenstein is not among them.''
	   A treaty that allows routine visits or spot checks would have to
apply to all countries, and the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America (Phrma) is opposed.
	   Such inspections, Phrma spokeswoman Gillian Woollett said, could
not only give competitors access to drug companies' secrets but
also create unfair publicity that could erode consumer confidence.
	   ``At its best,'' she said, ``a treaty is only for those who play
cricket.''
	   Drug executives cite a 1994 agreement that allowed American,
British and Russian teams reciprocal assess to build confidence
after Russia was caught developing anthrax.
	   Russian inspectors toured Pfizer plants and, Phrma charges,
broke ground rules against gathering commercial data, with no
intervention by their U.S. government escorts.
	   ``Essentially,'' Woollett concluded, ``we don't trust the
government to protect us.''
	   President Bill Clinton said in January that the United States
would lead the push for a tougher treaty that includes inspections
to ``help detect and deter cheating.''
	   But while the National Security Council and the CIA support site
inspections, other departments and agencies back the pharmaceutical
companies' position.
	   Amy Smithson of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a Washington
research center that follows the negotiations, says these
conflicting interests create policy gridlock, and few legislators
are actively involved.
	   ``I think this subject is so scary that no one wants to deal
with it,'' she said.
	   Smithson said the Geneva negotiations are further complicated by
developing countries which want to use them as leverage for getting
more foreign aid.
	   In Britain, Pearson said so many governments want a stronger
treaty that a new protocol could be adopted without the United
States.
	   Pearson advocates a four-part ``web of deterrence:'' a stronger
treaty, along with tough law enforcement, stockpiling of medicines
and better international cooperation.
	   ``None of these will work by themselves,'' he said. ``But
together, they are a significant deterrent. If one sees what he
faces by using these things, he may decide the price is too high.''
	   Meanwhile, the United States has this year begun stepping up
civil defense measures, such as stockpiling medicines and educating
public health officials about the physical symptoms of potential
pathogens.
	   But Meselson argues that heightening public anxiety about a
terrorist threat might goad extremists into trying their hand.
Instead, he champions concerted action to stop biological weapons
at the source.
	   Along with Julian Robinson of England's University of Sussex, he
proposes a treaty to stop individuals and private companies from
abetting biological warfare.
	   This would target exporters and advisers without having to
establish their governments' involvement. Violators would be
pursued across borders, as in the case of genocide, piracy or
hijacking.
	   Meselson insists that international treaties are vital to lessen
the danger even if they do not eliminate it.
	   ``Every technology we have had has been exploited for human
welfare but also vigorously exploited for warfare,'' he concluded.
``It is happening with biological weapons. You can't give up on
this.''

Moderate quake rattles eastern Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A moderate earthquake shook eastern
Romania Saturday, but there were no reports of damage or injury, a
spokeswoman for the Earth Physics Institute said.
	   The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 3.6, occurred 12:55
(0955 GMT) in the Vrancea region in the eastern Carpathian
mountains, some 175 kilometers (103 miles) northeast of the
capital.
	   It rumbled at a depth of 126 kilometers (79 miles) and was not
felt in the capital, said spokeswoman Neli Fantana by telephone
from the Bucharest-based institute.
	   More than 30 minor earthquakes hit the Vrancea region every
year, most of them causing no damage. Romania's last serious quake
left over 1,000 people dead and destroyed hundreds of buildings in
March 1977.

faces by using these things, he may decide the price is too high.''
	   Meanwhile, the United States has this year begun stepping up
civil defense measures, such as stockpiling medicines and educating
public health officials about the physical symptoms of potential
pathogens.
	   But Meselson argues that heightening public anxiety about a
terrorist threat might goad extremists into trying their hand.
Instead, he champions concerted action to stop biological weapons
at the source.
	   Along with Julian Robinson of England's University of Sussex, he
proposes a treaty to stop individuals and private companies from
abetting biological warfare.
	   This would target exporters and advisers without having to
establish their governments' involvement. Violators would be
pursued across borders, as in the case of genocide, piracy or
hijacking.
	   Meselson insists that international treaties are vital to lessen
the danger even if they do not eliminate it.
	   ``Every technology we have had has been exploited for human
welfare but also vigorously exploited for warfare,'' he concluded.
``It is happening with biological weapons. You can't give up on
this.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A French United Nations official kidnapped in
southern Russia more than 10 months ago was set free Saturday and
flown to Moscow, news reports said.
	   Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the regional office of the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees in North Ossetia, was seized by
three masked gunmen in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz on Jan.
29.
	   Cochetel was freed early Saturday in an operation conducted by
the Russian Interior Ministry and the regional security forces of
the north Caucasus, Russian news agencies said. Two security
officers were slightly injured during the operation, the reports
said.
	   He was flown aboard a chartered jet to Moscow, where he was
greeted at the airport by French Ambassador Hubert Colin de
Verdiere and U.N. officials. He was scheduled to be flown later to
Geneva aboard a special plane, NTV television reported.
	   Speaking briefly to reporters, Cochetel thanked Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and other officials who made his release
possible. ``It is the first time people have risked their lives for
me,'' he said, appearing tired, but in good health.
	   ``We couldn't imagine a better Christmas present that to have
him back,'' UNHCR spokesman Judith Kumin said in Geneva. ``He's had
a shower and is beginning to unwind from a year's ordeal,'' she
said. ``He's physically and psychologically exhausted, but he's
unharmed.''
	   It was unclear where Cochetel was held, in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya or in North Ossetia. ``He was liberated on the
border,'' Alexander Dzasokhov, the president of North Ossetia, told
NTV television.
	   French President Jacques Chirac spoke to Yeltsin by telephone
and thanked him for Russia's part in freeing Cochetel, the Kremlin
press service said.
	   His release came four days after the severed heads of four
foreign hostages were found in Chechnya when a government rescue
attempt apparently went wrong. Chechen security forces are still
searching for the men's bodies.
	   Chechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating the killings
and was apparently kidnapped Thursday, was also released Saturday,
Interfax said.
	   Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to
Chechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news
reports said.
	   Tagirov was investigating the deaths Britons Peter Kennedy,
Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand.
They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   Their heads were found Tuesday on a highway about 40 kilometers
(25 miles) west of Grozny.
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are
mostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held
captive.
	   A Russian soldier taken hostage during the war was released
Friday after a year of efforts to free him, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported. Alexei Novikov had been seized in February 1996.
Only a handful of soldiers kidnapped during the war are still in
captivity.

Holbrooke tries ``second-track'' diplomacy on Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Richard Holbrooke's latest initiative to
find peace does not involve pressure cooker diplomacy or threats of
NATO airstrikes.
	   ``It all boils down to cooperation _ the businessmen working
together,'' Constantinos Lordos, head of a Greek Cypriot business
delegation, said Saturday. The delegation is here to meet with
entrepreneurs from the other side of Nicosia, the world's last
divided city and capital of Cyprus.
	   Holbrooke's latest attempt at peace has targeted not so much the
politicians on the war-divided island of Cyprus, but its business
community. U.N.-sponsored reunification talks have failed for years
to find a way to rejoin the island.
	   Meeting for the first time ever on Turkish soil on Sunday and
Monday, about 20 business people from the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities will try to find the nuts and bolts of peaceful
coexistence rather than concentrating on deadlocked political
negotiations to solve the division of the eastern Mediterranean
island.
	   ``The general purpose of these meetings is to focus on practical
everyday problems in the lives of citizens and to do it in a
framework of mutual benefits,'' said Thomas Miller, the State
Department's coordinator for Cyprus.
	   With the threat of war looming ever closer because of a Greek
Cypriot decision to deploy Russian-made S-300 missiles on the
island later this month, Holbrooke's ``second track'' diplomacy
approach has so far proved much more successful than the mainstream
method of problem solving _ meeting with political leaders.
	   Not that he's left the other approach by the wayside. On Monday
he travels to Athens for meetings with Greece's ministers of
defense and foreign affairs. His goal will be to ensure that the
missiles are not deployed on Cyprus. One proposal is to put them on
the Greek island of Crete.
	   Miller discussed the S-300's in Cyprus Friday with U.N.
representative Dame Ann Hercus. After the talks, he said `` the
missiles are clearly are a problem.''
	   Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, in Ankara for eye surgery,
was also meeting with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.
	   ``The Istanbul meetings may be a way for the Holbrooke-Miller
group to keep their initiative going in light of the fact that
everything else _ the politics, the missiles _ is apparently at a
dead end,'' said Marios Evriviades, a regional analyst with Athens'
Institute for International relations.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded and seized
its northern third in the wake of an abortive coup by supporters of
union with Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north
is only recognized by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   U.N.-sponsored talks froze in 1997, while Holbrooke's efforts
were stymied last May following a demand by Denktash for
recognition of his breakaway state and the cancellation of Cyprus'
entry talks with the European Union. The EU began accession talks
with Cyprus earlier this year, after rebuffing Turkey for
membership.
	   ``It is nothing new to say that this has been a difficult year
for Cyprus following the EU decision and the missiles. Dialogue has
broken down and this essentially is all that's left,'' said Dan
Smith, director of the International Peace Research Institute in
Oslo, Norway.
	   The Institute, which organized the groundbreaking peace meetings
between Israelis and Palestinians, is co-organizing the meetings
here with Columbia University's International Conflict Resolution
Program.
	   ``All I do hope is to overcome political difficulties so we can
go on to the real problems. The political will is what is
lacking,'' said Vedat Chelik, the head of the Turkish Cypriot
businessmen attending the two-day meeting.
	   In their first meeting, held last November in Brussels, the
businessmen agreed to 42 joint projects to bring the two
communities together. So far, the only one that has worked is a
telephone exchange set up with Holbrooke's help allowing the two
sides to speak to each other.
	   Before, Greek and Turkish Cypriots had no way of communicating
directly. Even today, mail sent from one side of Cyprus to the
other has to go through Turkey and Greece.

 &UR; Fog and bad light ruin Pakistan's hopes &QL; 
 &UR; BY RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Heavy fog and poor light dampened
Pakistan's hopes of squaring the three-match series against
Zimbabwe on the third day of the second cricket Test at the Gaddafi
Stadium Saturday.
	   Only 13 overs could be bowled in a day because there was dense
fog in the morning and then bad light delayed the match for four
hours. Pakistan moved from 184 for five overnight to 211 without
further damage in nearly an hour's play after lunch before bad
light brought an early stumps for the third day in succession.
	   Sixteen minutes of play was lost on the first day while stumps
were drawn 35 minutes before schedule on Friday.
	   When the umpires offered light to the Pakistani batsmen, one
over before tea Saturday, Yousaf Youhanna, who resumed his innings
at 30, was closing in on to his half century and was on 46 while
Moin Khan had added another six runs to his overnight 18 and was on
24.
	   Pakistan, trailing 1-0 in the three-Test series, now has an
overall first innings lead of 28 runs as it dismissed Zimbabwe for
183 on the first day. However, heavy fog and bad light are likely
to disrupt the remaining two days which ensure Zimbabweans a vital
draw that will keep their 1-0 lead intact.

Noted Muslim opposition leader urges elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS assembly will meet Aug. 29 in 3rd graf; EDITS to trim

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A prominent Muslim opposition leader
urged President B.J. Habibie on Saturday to hold presidential
elections next fall as promised.
	   During nearly two hours of talks, Abdurrahman Wahid, the leader
of the country's largest Muslim organization, Nahdlatul Ulama,
asked the Indonesian president not to postpone elections again, as
he has done twice before.
	   Habibie has already agreed to convene the People's Consultative
Assembly on Aug. 29, 1999, to set a date for the assembly to meet a
second time to elect a new president and vice president.
	   Wahid asked Habibie to hold the second assembly session two
months after the first.
	   ``I proposed to the president that the second stage of Assembly
meeting to be opened on Oct. 28, 1999, and the new elected
president would take the oath of office on Nov. 10,'' Wahid said
after the meeting at Habibie's residence in central Jakarta.
	   President Habibie responded positively to the proposal but said
it would have to be decided by the assembly, the nation's highest
constitutional body, said Wahid.
	   Habibie and lawmakers agreed last week to hold elections on June
7 for the Parliament, whose members would make up the People's
Consultative Assembly, along with some presidential appointees.
	   Wahid, popularly known as Gus Dur, had also earlier suggested
the need to hold a public dialogue about solving Indonesia's
current economic crisis. Habibie has already rejected the proposal,
arguing it was difficult to pick up the participants who really
represent the national interest.
	   State Secretary Akbar Tanjung, who accompanied Habibie during
Saturday's meeting, said the president welcomed such a dialogue but
saw no need to be institutionalized.
	   ``The dialogue can be held wherever, including through mass
media,'' said Tanjung. ``This morning's meeting was already a
dialogue and it is unnecessary to be institutionalized.''
	   Wahid's 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama has set up its own
political party, which many believe will be a strong contender for
next year's Parliament elections.

Activists throughout China call on government to release dissidents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Responding to a crackdown on leaders of a
would-be opposition party, a diverse group of 184 dissidents
throughout China released a letter to the nation's leaders on
Saturday urging them to make good on their promises to respect
human rights.
	   The letter focused on the case of Wang Youcai, a student leader
in the 1989 democracy demonstrations who is expected to go on trial
for subversion next week for trying to set up an opposition
political party.
	   Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin, veteran dissidents also active in
leading efforts to found the China Democracy Party, were seized on
Nov. 30 and have been accused of endangering state security. Wang
was already in custody when police raided the homes of Xu and Qin
and took them into custody.
	   The letter, released by New York-based Human Rights in China,
urged President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji to release these
three and other democracy advocates who have been seized in recent
months.
	   It urged them to halt Wang's upcoming trial and, failing that,
to ensure it is open, fair and held in a court that is not under
the direct control of the government or ruling Communist Party.
	   The letter argued China had been making progress in protecting
citizens' rights and applauded China's recent signing of two key
human rights treaties. But it warned that recent arrests of
activists was a setback that produced ``doubts and deep
disappointment.''
	   Among those signing the letter were Xu Liangying, a scientist
who has written articles urging democratic reform, and Ding Zilin
and Jiang Peikun, who have tried to seek redress for the killing of
their 17-year-old son and other victims of the army attack on
unarmed pro-democracy protesters on Tiananmen Square in 1989.
	   Meanwhile, in Beijing on Saturday, Ren Wanding, a fellow
activist with Xu and Qin in the Democracy Wall movement of the late
1970s, gave a speech commemorating the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Addressing about 15 people in the office of the China
Development Union, a group holding weekly meetings about social
problems, Ren said China has made progress in expanding personal
freedoms in the past 20 years, particularly in allowing people to
discuss social problems privately in their homes.
	   Ren also was active in trying to set up a branch of the would-be
opposition party but withdrew when police warned him to stop. He,
Xu and Qin all have served long periods in prison.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Sirens blared, Christmas carols
warbled and fireworks exploded. At the close of a feisty campaign,
politicians made last-minute appeals for Puerto Ricans to get out
and vote to tell Americans what they want from the country that
colonized them 100 years ago.
	   ``Hear the cry of our people: We want statehood now!'' Gov.
Pedro Rossello said, urging people to overcome their fear of change
and fight for the 51st star on the U.S. flag.
	   He spoke at a rally before thousands of people waving the Stars
and Stripes below a sky cascading with giant sparklers.
	   ``Vote with your hearts!'' was the cry from his chief rival,
pro-commonwealth Mayor Sila Calderon. ``Only a citizenship and
federal sovereignty will give us the resources to defend our most
precious treasures: our language, our traditions, our 505-year
legacy,'' she said of the Caribbean island the United States won in
the Spanish-American War.
	   Sunday's vote is a nonbinding referendum, a contest too close to
call in which officials expect 80 percent of 2.2 million voters to
make their will known.
	   Flag-waving supporters of Puerto Rico's status as a U.S.
``commonwealth'' marched through San Juan on Friday amid a
cacophony of truck sirens, political ditties and Christmas carols
broadcast from loudspeakers.
	   Calderon's Popular Democratic Party supports a ``none of the
above'' protest option on the ballot because it objects to the
ballot's commonwealth description. Written by Rossello's statehood
party, the description suggests that under commonwealth, Congress
can revoke Puerto Ricans' U.S. citizenship.
	   In suburban Bayamon, Rossello led a boisterous rally invigorated
by live performances from such artists as Grupomania, Jerry Rivera
and Elvis Crespo.
	   Rossello called the referendum in hopes of persuading Congress
to change what he calls a 100-year-old colonial relationship.
President Bill Clinton has asked Congress to abide by the result.
	   Early polls gave statehood a lead, but an El Nuevo Dia newspaper
poll published Friday showed statehood and ``none of the above''
virtually even, with the latter ahead 48 percent to 45 percent. The
Dec. 5-8 poll of 1,000 voters had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.
	   The remaining 7 percent chose among the disputed commonwealth
option, independence and a ``free association'' form of
independence with U.S. treaty ties.
	   Under commonwealth, Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory with local
autonomy. Its 3.8 million residents are U.S. citizens, but they
can't vote for president or Congress, which alone can change Puerto
Rico's political status.
	   The U.S. Senate this year failed to act on legislation that
called for a binding series of votes designed to resolve the debate
over status.
	   Rossello was betting that, with his party controlling the local
legislature, he could present Congress with a mandate to pursue
statehood _ and eliminate what he calls Puerto Ricans' second-class
U.S. citizenship.
	   But the message may be clouded by the commonwealth party's
protest vote.
	   Commonwealthers say statehood would destroy Puerto Rico's
culture and that English would supplant the Spanish language. They
argue that commonwealth is the best of both worlds: a little
American and a little independent.
	   Statehooders counter that theirs is the only way to promote
development of an island where the per-capita income of dlrs 8,000
a year is half that of the poorest U.S. state, Mississippi.
	   Polls aside, both sides predicted a triumph on Sunday.
	   ``We had to have our local plebiscite after the U.S. Senate
refused to consider it,'' said Puerto Rico's pro-statehood Senate
president, Charlie Rodriguez. ``For me, it is an embarrassment for
the U.S. to enter the new millennium and have a colony.''

Former drug offender gives China gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Former drug offender Xiong Guoming won
an Asian Games swim title Saturday, four years after playing a role
in China's worst doping scandal.
	   Xiong won four golds at the 1994 Hiroshima Games but served a
two-year ban after he and six other Chinese swimmers tested
positive for steroids at the meet.
	   He joined another of his teammates here, Fu Yong, in returning
to the games with a gold medal and helped China briefly level the
standings against Japan.
	   China was an overwhelming winner in Hiroshima but went into the
final night of six events here down by one gold medal. Japan's
Tomoko Hagiwara won the women's 200-meter backstroke to put Japan
back ahead 13-12 with three races remaining in the meet.
	   Xiong's 200-meter medley victory followed his silver medal in
the 400 medley. Japan's Jo Yoshimi led through the opening 50
meters of butterfly before Xiong took over in the backstroke. A
slow turn into breaststroke allowed Yoshimi to cut the margin but
Xiong powered away again, sealing the gold with an excellent
freestyle effort.
	   After a poor start to the meet, including a second evening with
no golds, Chinese officials marshaled their troops into the stands,
where they stood Friday and Saturday waving tiny red flags and
cheering their teammates.
	   Xiong turned and waved to his compatriots after his race and
pointed at the scoreboard. His time showed 2 minutes, 3.34 seconds,
an Asian Games record. Yoshimi finished in 2:04.93, with China's
Xie Xufeng taking bronze in 2:05.45.
	   The opening event gave a sixth country a chance to share in the
swim gold medals.
	   Cho Hee-yeon of South Korea was an easy winner of the women's
200-meter butterfly, clocking 2:11.34. Japan's Hitomi Kashima held
a slight advantage turning through the 100-meter mark but faded
into third in 2:13.26. China's Ruan Yi won bronze.
	   Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand also have one gold each in the
pool.
	   As China and Japan struggled for supremacy on the final night
Saturday, Chinese coach Han Mingyan admitted that he had
underestimated the rival team.
	   Han coaches world 400-meter medley record-holder and dual world
champion Chen Yan, who failed to get a gold and was hit by a
stomach ailment. Han suggested that poor preparation rather than
the illness had been behind Chen's failure.
	   ``We have underestimated our Japanese rivals, and they are
stronger than expected,'' said Han. ``I introduced a rather
conservative training method for Chen in preparation for the games.
I thought we didn't have to push too hard. We will never let this
happen again.''
	   Han said he would rethink his approach for the future, adding,
``I will scrap the training method after going home.''
	   Japan's Masami Tanaka, a dual gold medalist here, said Japan's
improved showing from four years ago was a sign of a better team
approach and more support for the sport in her country.
	   ``We have some good individuals but most importantly we work
together. We're a team,'' Tanaka said.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Must a country have a unifying
language to survive? Can a Spanish-speaking island, with its own
proud culture, really join the United States?
	   For Pro-English master lobbyist Mauro Mujica, it was a pretty
simple call: When he emigrated from Chile 35 years ago, he learned
English, and that was that. He's here this week telling Puerto
Ricans that given their fierce devotion to Spanish, it would be
folly to join English-speaking America.
	   ``I believe in the melting pot,'' said Mujica, an ex-architect
who heads the ``U.S. English'' lobby. ``The U.S. is a multicultural
country, but we all have one thing in common: our common language.
Countries with multiple languages have multiple problems.''
	   For statehooders, this is the key point they absolutely had to
dismantle to stand any chance of winning in Sunday's nonbinding
referendum on whether Puerto Rico should petition Congress to
become the 51st state. Polls show the contest is in a dead heat.
	   Advocates of statehood have been portraying the United States as
a collection of ethnicities and culture. Puerto Rico is no
different, they say, from many other states whose incorporation
into the union was perhaps rocky but proved ultimately successful.
	   In an interview, Economic Development Secretary Carlos Vivoni
argued that Puerto Rico's cultural profile could be an asset to the
United States in its globalization push, and as it looks to the
Free Trade Area of the Americas.
	   ``We could become the business and cultural translator for
(U.S.) companies venturing into those (Latin American) economies,
and I think we could do the same for South American companies
wanting to venture into the U.S.,'' he said.
	   He discounted the fear of many Puerto Ricans that statehood
would mean a loss of their culture and the imposition of English _
which perhaps a quarter of the Puerto Rican population speaks well.
	   ``To those who (say) that if we become a state we are going to
be overtaken by the American culture, I snap back with: Which of
the American cultures? Italians in Philadelphia? Poles in
Milwaukee? Cubans in Miami? Japanese in Hawaii? Mexican-Americans
in Texas?
	   ``If Texas can be a state and assert its unique cultural
identity, so can we,'' he said, echoing many islanders' conviction
that Texas is every bit as distinct as Puerto Rico.
	   He noted that New Mexico became a state despite its majority
Hispanic population, that Florida was accepted into the union
despite concerns about its poverty and that Alaska's statehood
movement had to overcome substantial local opposition.
	   When Mujica argues his case against Puerto Rican statehood, he
invokes other states too _ but they're headed the other way:
They're following Puerto Rico's lead and, with immigrants streaming
in from Mexico, moving away from English.
	   ``Puerto Rico has its own culture, music, food, everything,'' he
said, citing a U.S. English poll in which 65 percent of island
respondents said they were primarily Puerto Rican. Only 16 percent
said American, while 18 percent said both.
	   ``If the United States swallows up a Latin American nation, how
would it affect the country? What would stop New Mexico or Arizona
from declaring themselves Spanish-speaking? It would open the door
to what we're trying to avoid.''

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Heavy fog and poor light dampened
Pakistan's hopes of squaring the three-match series against
Zimbabwe on the third day of the second cricket Test at the Gaddafi
Stadium Saturday.
	   Only 13 overs could be bowled in a day because there was dense
fog in the morning and then bad light delayed the match for four
hours. Pakistan moved from 184 for five overnight to 211 without
further damage in nearly an hour's play after lunch before bad
light brought an early stumps for the third day in succession.
	   Sixteen minutes of play was lost on the first day while stumps
were drawn 35 minutes before schedule on Friday.
	   When the umpires offered light to the Pakistani batsmen, one
over before tea Saturday, Yousaf Youhanna, who resumed his innings
at 30, was closing in on to his half century and was on 46 while
Moin Khan had added another six runs to his overnight 18 and was on
24.
	   Pakistan, trailing 1-0 in the three-Test series, now has an
overall first innings lead of 28 runs as it dismissed Zimbabwe for
183 on the first day. However, heavy fog and bad light are likely
to disrupt the remaining two days which ensure Zimbabweans a vital
draw that will keep their 1-0 lead intact.

Congo peace summit postponed again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ An end to the war in Congo appeared as
remote as ever Saturday after Zambia again postponed peace talks
amid a refusal by Congo President Laurent Kabila to meet with rebel
leaders.
	   Kabila's refusal to meet with the rebels doomed a series of
earlier summits aimed at ending the four-month-old war that
involves troops from six other nations.
	   The summit scheduled for Monday and Tuesday has been rescheduled
for Dec. 28, the Zambian foreign ministry said. Officials hope the
delay will give special Zambian envoy Eric Silwamba time to
persuade foes in the Congolese conflict to attend the summit. The
meeting had originally been scheduled for Dec. 8.
	   South Africa, meanwhile, will not attend if the rebels continue
to be excluded, the Saturday Star of Johannesburg reporterd. South
Africa has launched its own fruitless peace initiatives to end the
fighting in Congo, which threatens to destabilize much of
sub-Saharan Africa.
	   Zimbabwean, Angolan, Chadian and Namibian troops are fighting
alongside Kabila's forces against the rebels in the vast central
African country.
	   Rwanda and Uganda, which back the rebels, have admitted sending
troops onto Congolese soil. The two countries argue that a
tentative peace agreement recently forged in Paris does not fully
address their security concerns.
	   Kabila has insisted negotiating only with Rwanda and Uganda and
not the rebel coalition made up of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected
Congolese soldiers and opposition Congolese politicians.

Kjus wins downhill, ends two-year winning drought

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Olympic silver medallist Lasse Kjus
claimed the season's first downhill on Saturday, bringing to an end
a two-year winning drought.
	   Twenty-fourth out of the start-hut, Kjus took full advantage of
improving light conditions to storm down the 3,129-meter
(10,265-ft) classic Oreiller-Killy course with a winning time of 1
minute, 43.20 seconds.
	   The 1996 Overall World Cup champion, Kjus's last victory dates
back to March 1997, when the Norwegian won a a downhill on home
snow in Kvitfjell, Norway.
	   It marked the Norwegian's eighth career World Cup win, his
fourth in the downill.
	   Recording his best career result, Italy's Luca Cattaneo was
runnerup in 1:43.48, ahead of teammate Erik Seletto, climbing onto
the podium for the first time in his career, with a time of
1:43.64.
	   Though home fans were left disappointed when their Olympic hero
Cretier was pushed off the podium after holding a massive lead for
the first half of the race, they were slightly consoled with a
fourth place by unheralded Antoine Deneriaz.
	   A member of France's back-up team, Deneriaz had already shown
his potential, posting the fastest time in Friday's training.
	   Starting 34th, the 22-year-old training, confirmed his training
results, crossing fourth in 1:43.67.
	   As the conditions began to improve, several late starters began
slipping amongst the top-10.
	   A virtual unknown, Audun Groenvold of Norway clocked the fifth
fastest time of 1:44.17. Canada's Kevin Wert posted his career best
result, finishing sixth 1.00 back after missing almost all of last
year due to injury.
	   Slovenia's Ales Brezavsek, who best result was a 10th place in
the combined last year, tied for seventh with Italy's Peter
Runggaldier.
	   In his first downhill on French soil since becoming Olympic
champion last February, Cretier was forced to settle for 12th.
	   Tenth out of the start hut, Cretier's time of 1:44.64 held as 14
other skiers struggled with the deteriorating light conditions.
	   But as the sky began to clear up once more, Kjus took the lead
before Cattaneo and Runggaldier completely pushed the Frenchman off
the podium.
	   Reigning World Cup downhill champion Andreas Schifferer finished
back in 21st, just ahead of teammate Hermann Maier, the fearless
skier who won two Olympic golds, the World Cup overall, super-G and
giant slalom titles last season.
	   The day saw just one serious accident when France's David Pretot
was blinded by the strobe effect of the tree-shadows on the course,
veering off and taking a spectacular fall.
	   With his left ski failing to pop off during the tumble, Pretot
injured the lateral ligament in his left ankle. Doctors have yet to
X-ray the leg for possible fractures.

	   NAGANO, Japan (AP) _ Olympic gold medalist Catriona Lemay Doan
of Canada won the women's 500- and 1,000-meter titles Saturday in
the first round of the Nagano World Cup speedskating competition.
	   World-record holder Hiroyasu Shimizu, also an Olympic champion,
won a gold for host Japan in his specialty, the 500 meters, before
a capacity crowd of 5,500 at the M-Wave Arena.
	   A fourth gold at stake, the men's 1,000-meter title, went to
Olympic silver medalist Jan Bos of the Netherlands.
	   In all, Canada and Japan bagged four medals each, while Bos also
won the bronze in the 500 meters. The United States, Germany and
Russia each had a bronze medal.
	   Two bronze medals were awarded in the women's 1,000 meters as
Olympic silver medalist Chris Witty of the United States and
Monique Garbrecht of Germany were tied for third at 1 minute, 18.63
seconds.
	   Another round of the women's and men's competition also in the
500 and 1,000 meters takes place on the second and final day.
	   The two-day competition is the first of five sprint speedskating
World Cups scheduled for the 1998-1999 season.
	   The first two of another five speedskating World Cups for 1,500
meters and longer distances were held in Europe last month.
	   Lemay Doan won the 500 meters in 38.67 seconds, or 0.50 second
faster than second-place Eriko Sanmiya of Japan. Svetlana Zhurova
of Russia was third in 39.19 seconds.
	   In the afternoon, the 27-year-old Canadian triumphed in the
1,000 meters with a time of 1:18.07, again ahead of Sanmiya, this
time with a margin of 0.42 second.
	   ``I really wasn't happy with the 500 meters,'' Lemany Doan.
``Sometimes you just have to get through the first race of the
year. Then it's over and you go from there. I was very happy with
my 1,000 meters. It was a very good race for me.
	   ``You go into every race being positive. I think my biggest goal
tomorrow is to have much better 500 meters and be more relaxed. If
that brings me golds, it'll be great.''
	   Shimizu, the first Japanese ever to win a speedskating gold,
overcame his shaky physical condition to outrace Jeremy Wotherspoon
in 35.40, or 0.64 seconds faster than the second-place Canadian.
	   ``According to newspaper reports, I'm suffering from a cold,''
Shimizu said jokingly in a voice that sounded like he had a stuffed
nose. ``Yet, I was faster than a number of hopefuls from abroad
because, I think, you'll need quite a few days to get over with jet
lag.''
	   Shimizu set his world record of 34.82 at a world championship in
Calgary in March.
	   Bos won the 1,000 meters in 1:11.29, followed by Junichi Inoue
of Japan, who finished in 1:11.70. Wotherspoon placed third in
1:11.82.
	   ``I think my 500-meter lap time could've been faster. But it was
my first race of the year, so I'm not too much concerned about
it,'' said the 23-year-old Bos, adding that he was pleased with his
1,000 meters. ``We'll have to wait and see what happens tomorrow.''

<TEXT>
	   MOBA, Congo (AP) _ Sitting at the wheel of an Italian-made
speedboat racing past the green mountain shores of Lake Tangyanika,
a rebel commander said Saturday his troops were poised to capture
the last government stronghold of the vast central African lake.
	   Col. Nora Songolo said his forces, backed by Rwanda and more
recently Burundi, were in control of all other towns on the western
shore of 720-kilometer long lake and were fighting to capture
Molira, on the border with Zambia.
	   ``From (the northernmost Congolese lakeshore town) Uvira to the
Zambian border, we control the lake,'' said Col. Nora Songolo. ``We
are about to capture Molira.''
	   The rebels and their Rwandan allies use the fiberglass
speedboats with anti-aircraft guns to move swiftly and fire on
government fighter jets whose regular raids have slowed but not
stopped rebel advances in eastern Congo.
	   As the war advances, efforts at peace appeared to be again
foundering Saturday, with the announcement of a delay in a meeting
of involved parties who were to discuss a cease fire proposed last
month.
	   The Zambian government, which was to host the meeting in the
capital Lusaka on Dec. 14-15, said Saturday the summit was
postponed until Dec. 28, to give officials time to drum up support
for peace efforts. The meeting was originally set for Dec. 8.
	   Songolo, a defector from the capital of the southern Katanga
region Lubumbashi, said the priority now was getting Kabila to
negotiate peace directly with the rebels.
	   So far, Kabila's refusal to negotiate directly with the rebels,
saying they are pawns of their backers Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi,
has torpedoed international and regional efforts to negotiate a
cease-fire.
	   Kabila insists the war against him is a foreign invasion and
that those countries troops must leave before any cease fire can be
implemented.
	   ``We will continue pushing for Lubumbashi until Kabila realizes
our military strength,'' Songolo said. ``He has no other (choice)
but to negotiate with us.''
	   Songolo said the rebels control the airstrip and fishing village
of Moba, 160 kilometers (100 miles) further north, dismissing as
false government claims of a successful counteroffensive.
	   However, the rebels had yet convince war-weary fishermen and
farmers to return to their abandoned hamlet, Songolo said. Like a
ghost town, most of Moba's mud brick and straw roof houses stand
empty since the town fell to rebels a month ago.
	   The few remaining residents said their relatives and friends
were hesitant to come back, afraid of either the new army or air
strikes by Zimbabwe, President Laurent Kabila's main ally in the
four-month war.
	   On Tuesday, a Zimbabwean MiG-21 dropped bombs on abandoned
houses a few meters (yards) from the port. There were no
casualties.
	   Songolo said he was setting up anti-aircraft guns around the
town's grassy airstrip, on a plateau of the lush, 3,000-meter
(9,900-foot) high Mugila Mountains.
	   The fertile soil once fed the mineral-rich Katanga Province
before the second war in as many years made roads too dangerous.
	   But the greatest difficulty facing the rebel coalition of ethnic
Tutsis, disaffected Congolese soldiers and opposition politicians
who took up arms Aug. 2 is convincing Kabila's Baluba tribesmen in
eastern Katanga to cooperate.
	   Like Kabila, most people see the rebels as foreign invaders and
they have yet to prove the benefits of their democratic programs
for the potentially rich but impoverished country.
	   The conflict has drawn in Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad on
Kabila's side and Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi on the rebel side.
	   Burundi offically denies involvement in Congo, but missionaries,
political sources and rebels said an estimated 3,000 Burundian
troops were present along Congo's Tanganyika shores to secure
Burundian coffee exports to Zambia and keep Burundian Hutu fighters
from using eastern Congo as their rear base.

Italian League champions' coach ends suspense
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Marcello Lippi said Saturday he will leave
Juventus of Turin at the end of this season, ending a successful
run as coach of the Italian League champions.
	   Lippi's five-year contract ends in June, and there was
widespread speculation he would not sign a new deal.
	   ``I told club officials last summer'' about his decision, Lippi
said, ``and everyone, players included, knew. After five years I
felt the need for a new experience.''
	   His tenure saw the club known as the Old Lady of Italian soccer
return to prominence after a rare down period. Preaching teamwork
and solid defense, Lippi has led Juventus to three Serie A titles
in the past four years, plus the 1196 European Champions Cup crown.
	   Media reports have indicated Lippi might be headed to
Internazionale of Milan or Lazio of Rome next season, but he said
his future plans are not set.
	   ``I could even just take a break for a year,'' he said.

Clock chimes Saddam's song _ 24 times a day
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ As the clock in the 50-meter (150-foot)
tower began chiming the tune from a popular anthem to President
Saddam Hussein, a group of visiting schoolgirls provided the words.
	   ``There is a covenant between us and you,'' the girls recited
dutifully _ a line from the song familiar to almost all 22 million
Iraqis.
	   The Baghdad clock tower, with its seven exhibition halls,
gold-plated statues of falcons and many portraits of Saddam, plays
the song on the hour 24 times a day.
	   Until now, the paean to Saddam could only be heard within a five
kilometer (three-mile) radius of the tower.
	   But that will soon change, on Saddam's orders.
	   Engineers are working to link the chimes to air raid siren
speakers so that all of Baghdad's 5 million people can hear the
tune around the clock.
	   ``The basic idea is that the chimes of this clock should be
heard all over Baghdad. Work is in progress, and we expect it to
finish soon,'' said Waleed Hummadi, director of the Baghdad Clock,
one of the capital's main landmarks.
	   Work on the monument started in 1986 but stopped after Iraq's
1990 invasion of neighboring Kuwait, which triggered the Gulf War.
Construction resumed in 1992 after Iraq's defeat, and the
three-story building with the tower atop it was completed in 1996.
	   Schools arrange visits to the site, whose entrance is adorned
with gold-plated inscriptions of Saddam telling of his pride that
the tower was built despite a lack of funds, a shortage caused by
sanctions the United Nations imposed on Iraq after the Kuwaiti
invasion.
	   Everything in the monument celebrates or pertains to the
president's life and deeds.
	   ``Those four rifles waving with the pendulum are made of pure
gold and belong to four martyrs who fell in defense of Iraq in the
Iraq-Iran war,'' said Mohammed Zuheir, a guide. In fact, the rifles
were real weapons plated in gold for display at the tower.
	   For the hundreds of girls and boys touring the Baghdad Clock, a
visit echoes what textbooks say about their leader. Documents
written in blood hang on the walls and tell the children about the
loyalty Iraqis across the nation feel toward Saddam.
	   ``We bring them here to prove to our pupils how the people love
their president,'' said a teacher, Muna Kadhim.
	   Students Rua al-Shami and Taghrid al-Asam stood spellbound in
front of statements Saddam wrote by hand during the Gulf War.
	   ``See the changes he makes and the sentences he crosses out. It
tells about the president's psychology during that time,'' said the
guide, Zuheir.
	   The exhibition halls are packed with gifts that Iraqis and
foreigners are said to have sent to Saddam on his birthday each
April 28. The booty includes medals, jewelry, gold, silver,
embalmed birds and animals, crystal, porcelain, chess sets and
copies of the Koran, Islam's holy book.
	   ``We haven't heard or read that any president in the world is
offered so many gifts as ours,'' said Hummadi, the monument's
director.
	   Among the most interesting gifts is a piece of pottery that U.S.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson _ who railed against Saddam as
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations _ presented during a 1995
visit to secure the release of two Americans jailed in Iraq.
	   ``The Baghdad Clock is like an open book for the visitors to
illustrate how loyal the people are to their president and also
show his standing on both Arab and foreign levels,'' Hummadi said.
	   He has another plan for Iraqis to show their fealty to Saddam.
Oncethe clock's chimes are audible all over Baghdad, Hummadi hopes
to arrange for them to sound their paean via air raid siren
speakers throughout the entire country.

West Indies chase 320 against South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa set the West
Indies 320 runs to win in the second test at St George's Park on
Saturday.
	   The home team was dismissed for 195 in their second innings just
before lunch, and the West Indies were on four for one wicket at
the break.
	   Curtly Ambrose took four of the five South African wickets to
fall in the morning session in a very hostile spell. His victims
included the two men not out overnight, Shaun Pollock and Jonty
Rhodes. Pollock added just two to his 40, before falling, caught by
Mervyn Dillon at mid-on off a very injudicious attempted pull.
Rhodes batted well, before dragging another poor pull shot down
onto his stumps.
	   Pat Symcox and Allan Donald again provided some resistance after
Mark Boucher simply guided a short ball from Ambrose into Carl
Hooper's hands at second slip. Symcox was the first to go, fending
a throat-high bouncer from Ambrose to a grateful Clayton Lambert at
short leg.
	   Donald survived a torrid period, and was even struck hard on the
helmet by Ambrose. He was eventually bowled by Walsh for 11.
	   Donald struck immediately for South Africa, having Lambert
caught behind for two by wicketkeeper Boucher off an atrocious hook
shot.

IOC official alleges widespread bribery in Olypmic selection

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ A top IOC official on Friday made
explosive allegations of widespread Olympic corruption, saying
agents demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver votes in the
selection of host cities.
	   Marc Hodler, a senior member of the International Olympic
Committee executive board, alleged malpractices in the voting for
the 1996 Atlanta Games, 2000 Sydney Olypmics and 2002 Salt Lake
Games.
	   Hodler said a group of four agents, including one IOC member,
have been involved in promising votes for payment. He declined to
identify them.
	   ``The four agents try to make a living out of this,'' he said.
``I missed a chance to be a rich man. Some of the agents do the
following: they say, `I can offer this or that number of votes.'
	   ``The price wold be between dlrs 500,000 and dlrs 1 million for
a number of votes, a bloc.''
	   Hodler added that the agents then charge the city winning the
bid ``something like dlrs 3 million to dlrs 5 millon.''

Ajax fires Danish coach after run of bad results

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch champion Ajax Amsterdam
fired its Danish coach Morten Olsen Saturday three days after the
club was dumped out of European soccer's prestigious Champions
League following a 3-0 defeat by Porto in Portugal.
	   Olsen, 49, had been in charge of the Netherlands' most storied
club for less than two seasons.
	   In his first year in charge he led Ajax to a domestic league and
cup double but success in European competitions eluded the club
under Olsen. The four-time European champion finished last in its
Champions League Group A and never won a European tie away from
home under the Dane.
	   Jan Wouters, a former Ajax player and Dutch international,
succeeded Olsen. Wouters, who formerly trained Ajax's reserves,
took charge of his first first team training session Saturday.
	   Wouters signed a contract with Ajax until mid-2002, the club
announced at a hastily-arranged press conference.
	   Olsen made a record 102 appearances for Denmark and captained
his national side at the European Championship in France in 1982
and at the World Cup in Mexico in 1986. After ending his playing
career, he turned to training but was fired by Danish club Broendby
IF and Germany's FC Cologne.
	   When he signed a two-year contract in January 1997, Olsen
pledged to continue Ajax's trademark attacking style of soccer, but
in recent weeks the club, plagued by injuries to key players, has
struggled for form. The club currently is third, nine points adrift
of leader and arch rival Feyernoord Rotterdam.
	   At Ajax's most recent home game, fans waved white handkerchiefs
to express their desire to see the back of Olsen. Shares of the
club plummeted in value on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange following
the humiliating defeat in Portugal.
	   Belgian club Anderlecht reportedly is interested in hiring
Olsen.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For the sixth straight day, a Chinese
woman weightlifter broke a world record and won gold at the Asian
Games Saturday.
	   With one day left in women's weightlifting competition, Wei
Xiangying became the latest record-breaker, winning the 75-kilogram
division with an Asian record total of 242.5 kilograms and a world
record snatch of 115.
	   China's Zhao Na had held both the old records _ 111.5 in the
snatch and 240 in total.
	   South Korea's Kim Soon-hee and Myanmar's Aye Mon Khin both
lifted a total of 230, but Kim won the bronze because of her
lighter body weight.
	   Wei's winning margin came from the snatch, well ahead of Kim's
102.5 and Aye Mon Khin's 100. In the jerk, Kim matched Wei's 127.5,
and Aye Mon Kim beat it with a 130 lift.
	   Kim unsuccessfully tried for a world record 145 jerk on her
final attempt for gold.
	   Wei, a 19-year-old from Liaoning province, progressed from 107.5
to 112.5 and 115 in her three attempts in the snatch.
	   While all of China's women gold medalists here have broken world
records, Sun Tianni did the most thorough job Friday, setting marks
in snatch, jerk and total. Her total of 245 in the 69-kilogram
division beat the winning total of 242.5 in Saturday's 75-kilogram
competition.

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Marcello Lippi said Saturday he will leave
Juventus of Turin at the end of this season, ending a successful
run as coach of the Italian League champions.
	   Lippi's five-year contract ends in June, and there was
widespread speculation he would not sign a new deal.
	   ``I told club officials last summer'' about the decision, Lippi
said, ``and everyone, players included, knew. After five years I
felt the need for a new experience.''
	   His tenure saw the club known as the Old Lady of Italian soccer
return to prominence after a rare down period. Preaching teamwork
and solid defense, Lippi has led Juventus to three Serie A titles
in the past four years, plus the 1996 European Champions Cup crown.
	   Media reports have indicated Lippi, 50, might be headed to
Internazionale of Milan or Lazio of Rome next season, but he said
his future plans are not set.
	   ``I could even just take a break for a year,'' he said.
	   Other feats with Juventus include one Intercontinental Cup, one
European SuperCup, one Italian Cup, and two Italian SuperCups, as
well as reaching two other Champions Cup finals.
	   Juve clinched a fourth straight Champions Cup quarterfinal
appearance on Wednesday by beating Norway's Rosenborg 2-0.
	   If success is one hallmark of Lippi's years with the Turin club,
another is certainly constant roster renewal _ selling off stars
and replacing them with new ones. Roberto Baggio, Christian Vieri,
Gianluca Vialli and Fabrizio Ravanelli have been among the
castoffs.
	   Lippi coached a series of lower-division clubs in the 1980s
before bringing Cesena up to Serie A in the 1990-91 season. Fired
by Cesena, though, after it was relegated at the end of that
campaign, he spent another year in the minor leagues with Lucchese,
his hometown team.
	   One-year stints with Serie A teams Atalanta of Bergamo and
Napoli followed, and in 1994 he replaced the legendary Giovanni
Trapattoni at Juventus _ and immediately led the storied team to
its first league title in nine years.

Japan prods major bank to request government take-over

	   TOKYO (AP) _ In what appears to be the second collapse of a
major Japanese bank in less than two months, Nippon Credit Bank
Ltd. said financial authorities asked it Saturday to formally
request the government to take over its operations.
	   The Financial Supervisory Agency delivered what effectively was
an ultimatum to Nippon Credit's president, Shigeoki Togo, after
determining that the bank was insolvent due to a massive burden of
bad loans, said a bank spokesman who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   NCB would be only the second bank in Japan to be placed under
state control since World War II. The government nationalized the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. on Oct. 23.
	   Like many other Japanese lenders, NCB's bad loans mounted after
the collapse of inflated real estate prices and stock values in the
early 1990s.
	   After meeting financial authorities at the Prime Minister's
Office, Togo called an emergency board meeting to discuss the
government's request.
	   Kyodo News agency reported that top officials of the bank have
agreed to accept the government request. The NCB spokesman refused
to confirm the report, saying the bank plans to respond by around
noon Sunday.
	   But a government official told reporters that the bank will be
nationalized Sunday regardless of the board's decision, Kyodo News
agency reported.
	   The move was widely expected after merger talks collapsed
between NCB and suitor Chuo Trust and Banking Co.
	   In a bid to protect its joint venture with the collapsing bank,
Britain's Gartmore Investment Management PLC will take effective
control of NCG Investment Trust Management Co., a joint venture
with Nippon Credit Bank, Kyodo reported.
	   NCG spokesman Tetsuo Kubo said Gartmore said it will protect NCG
clients from losses but no decision has been made over control of
the joint venture.
	   Nippon Credit has 2,000 employees and the bank was one of the
fifty largest in the world, according to a 1997 ranking by Fortune
magazine. NCB has assets totaling 12.34 trillion yen (dlrs 106
billion), but 12.34 trillion yen some 3.2 trillion yen (dlrs 27
billion) of its loans were at risk of being unpaid, according to
Kyodo.
	   Nippon Credit is one of three of Japan's so-called long-term
credit banks. These banks financed the rebuilding of Japanese
industry following World War II by providing companies long-term,
low-cost loans. But deregulation has allowed more companies to
raise money directly from financial markets and the banks have
failed to find a new role.
	   The government has stepped in to aid NCB before. Last April,
finance officials asked a group of financial institutions and the
central bank to contribute to a fund to bailout the lender.

	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated
himself from Hodler's allegations.
	   ``The only official spokeman for the IOC executive board is
(director general) Francois Carrard,'' Samaranch said. ``All the
other comments are personal comments. They are not official
comments.''
	   Hodler's allegations, made to a group of reporters, came as the
IOC continued investigations into alleged financial misconduct by
the Salt Lake City group which won the bid for the 2002 games.
	   Hodler has described as a ``bribe'' the dlrs 500,000 scholarship
fund set up by Salt Lake which benefited the relatives of six IOC
members.
	   It also came as the former minister in charge of Sydney's 2000
Olympic bid revealed he was asked to offer bribes in exchange for
votes. Bruce Baird, the former New South Wales minister, said he
refused.

Thai official says games boosting tourist arrivals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand is not only winning medals at
the Asian Games, it's winning over tourists too, the chairman of
the country's tourism authority said Saturday.
	   ``That successful holding of the games has put Thailand on the
map,'' said Pitak Intrawityanunt, chairman of the Tourism Authority
of Thailand.
	   ``We've seen an increase in the number of arrivals from our
neighbors and an increase in visitors from Europe and North
America,'' Pitak said, although he supplied no supporting figures.
	   Thailand is in the midst of its best tourist season in years.
	   Travelers have been attracted by bargain prices for hotels,
goods and services resulting from the devaluation of the Thai
currency. They are also shunning some competing tourist
destinations, such as Indonesia, because of fears over social
instability.
	   Tour operators and hotels at Thai beach resorts have reported
they are booked solid for months to come.
	   Pitak said the Asian Games demonstrated that Thailand could
handle major international events, and that the country was looking
forward to playing host to 40,000 youngsters during the 2003 World
Scout Jamboree.
	   He also pledged to speed up immigration procedures for tourists.

ASEAN ministers gather to discuss Asian crisis

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Economic ministers from the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations said Saturday they were close to an
agreement on ``bold'' measures to combat the region's worst
economic crisis in a half-century.
	   However, they still have to get approval from home before
meeting with their foreign ministers Sunday to work out final
details. The proposals then will be offered for approval by their
countries' leaders at an ASEAN summit Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Philippine Trade Secretary Jose Pardo told The Associated Press
that officials, in what he called ``11th-hour consultations,'' must
determine the impact of any incentives for foreign investors or
cuts in tariffs.
	   There also are proposals for making capital equipment duty-free
in ASEAN's nine member countries and moving up establishment of an
ASEAN Investment Area several years.
	   ``We're consulting with our countries to see how deep a revenue
cut we can do,'' Pardo said. ``We are in difficult economic
situations. We're under pressure in our countries to look at the
domestic circumstances.''
	   He said assessments would be made whether the measures would
create balanced-budget problems or compromise commitments with the
International Monetary Fund on revenue measures.
	   But those losses should be balanced by creating jobs and raising
hopes for the future, Pardo said.
	   ``We're almost there,'' he said. ``By tomorrow, we should have
final support from our countries.''
	   The measures were developed after the economic ministers told
senior officials, who had worked out a joint declaration and plan
of action earlier in the week, to bolster their proposals.
	   Now a separate document is being prepared on the bold measures.
In an effort to shore up investor confidence, some would ``be
effective almost immediately,'' Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi said.
	   ``Overall, we're now moving faster with our game plan,'' Thai
Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said. ``That's a
positive result of the crisis. Before the crisis, this would have
not been possible.''
	   However, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said there
is general agreement that more-developed countries will have a
faster deadline for implementation.
	   Thailand's Kobsak said the ministers ``want to send a clear
message that ASEAN is facing the challenge'' of the economic crisis
and ``will be more integrated with the world economy.''
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Malaysia's
controversial capital controls, which have curtailed access to the
economy for foreign investors and currency traders, were discussed.
	   ``We are of the view that each country has the right to
determine for itself what the best policies are in order to get out
of the crisis,'' Alatas said.
	   ``The situation is not the same in each country. What pertains
in Malaysia does not necessarily pertain in Indonesia and vice
versa. We leave it for each country to decide.''
	   One goal is to encourage equitable development to prevent ASEAN
from becoming a two-tiered group of less-developed and rapidly
industrializing nations. But the region's economies already range
from powerhouses like Singapore to some of the world's poorest
countries.
	   The foreign ministers failed to reach a consensus at a four-hour
dinner Friday night on whether to admit Cambodia now, an issue
which had threatened to overshadow the economic moves.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The House Judiciary Committee is nearing the
end of its history-making votes to remove President Bill Clinton
from office, setting the stage for an impeachment confrontation
before all 435 lawmakers next week. Clinton said he would accept a
censure. Despite Democratic attacks that never let up during a
grueling 12-hour day, the Republican majority pushed three articles
of impeachment through the committee on Friday. Rep. Lindsey Graham
of South Carolina was the only Republican to vote against an
article. On Saturday, the panel planned to take up a fourth article
alleging abuse of power _ and a censure proposed by Democrats as an
alternative to impeachment. (US-CLINTON IMPEACHMENT)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In what appears to be the second collapse of a
major Japanese bank in less than two months, Nippon Credit Bank
Ltd. said financial authorities asked it Saturday to formally
request the government to take over its operations. The Financial
Supervisory Agency delivered what was effectively an ultimatum to
Nippon Credit's president, Shigeoki Togo, after determining that
the bank was insolvent due to a massive burden of bad loans, said a
bank spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity. NCB would be
only the second bank in Japan to be placed under state control
since World War II. The government nationalized the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. on Oct. 23. (JAPAN-TROUBLED BANK)
	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ As rescue workers combed through
the wreckage of a Thai Airways jetliner Saturday searching for the
remaining survivors and the bodies of victims, police said they
expect the final death toll from the crash to total 101 people.
Surat Thani hospital said that of the 146 on board, 94 were
confirmed dead and 45 had survived. The remaining seven people were
still missing, but police held out little hope that any were still
alive. Relatives coming to claim the bodies of the dead broke into
tears after arriving at the crowded, confused passenger terminal at
Surat Thani airport. There were also tearful reunions. At the scene
of the crash in a muddy swamp, workers using special equipment cut
through what remained of the jet's fuselage to extract bodies and
anyone who might still be alive inside. Rain fell throughout the
day. (THAILAND-PLANE CRASH)
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Southeast Asian economic ministers have
told senior officials to go back to the drawing board and devise
stronger measures to help the region recover from its economic
crisis, a spokesman said Saturday. ``The officials did not come up
with enough bold measures,'' Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak
Chutikul told reporters as ASEAN economic ministers and foreign
ministers met separately Saturday. Senior ASEAN officials started
meeting here earlier in the week to hammer out a joint declaration
and a plan of action to be submitted for approval by leaders of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations at their summit, which
starts next week. Kobsak said the ministers are pressing for
stronger measures because the countries ``want to send a clear
message that ASEAN is facing the challenge'' of the economic
crisis. The ministers also want to speed up the pace of reform.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors headed out Saturday on one
of their last missions in the current round of searches for Iraq's
illegal weapons. At least five vehicles, carrying the experts of
the United Nations Special Commission and their Iraqi escorts, left
the U.N. headquarters. ``Our inspectors have gone out on their
normal daily duties,'' UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said. She
refused to say where or what type of inspections will take place.
Unconfirmed reports said that the teams were to visit sensitive
sites such as the defense industry's headquarters or offices
related to national security. UNSCOM or Iraqi government officials
did not comment on the report. (IRAQ-UN)

Ajax fires Danish coach after run of bad results
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch champion Ajax Amsterdam
fired its Danish coach Morten Olsen on Saturday, three days after
the club was dumped out of European soccer's prestigious Champions
League following a 3-0 defeat by Porto in Portugal.
	   Olsen, 49, had been in charge of the Netherlands' most storied
club for less than two seasons.
	   In his first year in charge he led Ajax to a domestic league and
cup double, but success in European competitions eluded the club
under Olsen. The four-time European champion finished last in its
Champions League Group A and never won a European tie away from
home under the Dane.
	   Jan Wouters, a former Ajax player and Dutch international,
succeeded Olsen. Wouters, who formerly trained Ajax's reserves,
took charge of his first first team training session Saturday.
	   Wouters signed a contract with Ajax until mid-2002, the club
announced at a hastily-arranged press conference.
	   Olsen made a record 102 appearances for Denmark and captained
his national side at the European Championship in France in 1982
and at the World Cup in Mexico in 1986. After ending his playing
career, he turned to training but was fired by Danish club Broendby
IF and Germany's FC Cologne.
	   When he signed a two-year contract in January 1997, Olsen
pledged to continue Ajax's trademark attacking style of soccer, but
in recent weeks the club, plagued by injuries to key players, has
struggled for form. The club currently is third, nine points adrift
of leader and arch rival Feyernoord Rotterdam.
	   At Ajax's most recent home game, fans waved white handkerchiefs
to express their desire to see the back of Olsen. Shares of the
club plummeted in value on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange following
the humiliating defeat in Portugal.
	   Belgian club Anderlecht reportedly is interested in hiring
Olsen.

ASEAN to urge China, other countries to exercise restraint in
</HEADLINE>
Spratlys

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Association of Southeast Asian Nations
will urge China and other countries that claim the Spratly Islands
in the South China Sea to avoid taking actions that would aggravate
tensions there, Vietnam's foreign minister said Saturday.
	   Nguyen Manh Cam said ASEAN foreign ministers discussed the
territorial disputes in the Spratlys in a meeting Saturday and
agreed that peace and stability in the region are particularly
critical now as Southeast Asia attempts to recover from an economic
crisis.
	   The ministers also agreed that third parties must ``exercise
self-restraint and refrain from taking actions which would
exacerbate the situation,'' Cam said.
	   The Spratlys, which straddle vital sea lanes in the South China
Sea, are claimed in whole by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and in part
by Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei. All except China and
Taiwan are members of ASEAN.
	   Last month, Manila lodged a protest with Beijing after Chinese
workers began enlarging buildings erected at Mischief Reef, part of
the Spratly chain. Both countries claim the reef.
	   China says the concrete structures are shelters for fishermen,
but the Philippines says they could be used militarily because of
extensive docking areas and sophisticated communications equipment.
	   Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon briefed the ASEAN
ministers Saturday on the Chinese construction, officials said.
	   The dispute is expected to be discussed by ASEAN leaders when
they meet next week with Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao following
an ASEAN summit meeting.
	   Philippine officials earlier said they had prepared a separate
statement on the Spratlys for possible adoption by ASEAN but
decided not to submit it after the group agreed to include the
issue in a declaration to be issued next week by the ASEAN heads of
government.
	   A draft of the declaration said the leaders would promote
efforts to settle disputes in the South China Sea in accordance
with international law, including the 1982 U.N. Convention on the
Law of the Sea.
	   ASEAN also includes Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore and
Thailand.

EU looks again at duty free, stops short of reprieve

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by Kok, Danish leader; raises context;
trims.
 &UR; With EU-Summit
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders agreed Saturday to
look again at an impending tax-free shopping ban, but stopped short
of granting a reprieve for the perk that lets millions of travelers
snap up liquor, tobacco and other bargains.
	   They released a statement calling for a three-month study into
potential job losses by the scheduled abolition in June of
duty-free sales for travel within the 15-nation Union.
	   At a summit, the leaders left the door open for a ``possible
limited extension'' of duty-free shopping.
	   The EU voted unanimously in 1991 to abolish tax-free shopping,
claiming it was incompatible with the notion of a seamless EU
market.
	   The ban would only affect sales for travelers within the EU.
Those traveling to or from the Union will still be able to enjoy
tax free shopping.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, backed by his German and
French counterparts, campaigned to overturn the 1991 decision to
scrap duty-free by next summer.
	   But that needs unanimous support of the EU governments.
	   Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok insisted tax free sales be ended as
agreed, saying an initial extension until 1999 ``had been enough.''
	   He was backed by Denmark, Belgium, Finland and Italy. ``Our
policy has not changed,'' said Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen.
	   France sought a five-year reprieve, Britain also spoke in terms
of years.
	   The duty-free debate briefly pushed weighty issues like defense
and reform of the EU's dlrs 100 billion budget to the back of the
summit agenda.
	   Blair is under particular pressure to rescue tax-free shopping
which is immensely popular among Britons who flock to ferry boats
crossing the English Channel to buy cheap supplies of liquor,
cigarettes and perfume.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook this week called the proposed ban
``the most visible and high-profile (EU) decision'' for the British
public.
	   In continental nations with lower domestic alcohol taxes, the
ban issue is less contentious, although airlines, shipping
companies and labor unions claim scrapping the dlrs
6.4-billion-a-year duty-free industry will push up the cost of
travel and throw some 150,000 people out of work.
	   Supporters of abolition say duty-free operators effectively
enjoy a subsidy of dlrs 2.2 billion a year by not paying duties,
giving them an unfair advantage over other retailers.

	   Hodler said there was one agent who boasts ``that no city has
ever won the Olympic Games without his help.''
	   ``No one can prove that,'' Hodler said.
	   ``The four agents try to make a living out of this,'' he said.
	   Asked whether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the 1996 games
was clean, Hodler said, ``Certainly not.'
	   Asked whether Sydney's election was clean, he said, ``I would be
surprised. I know what happened but I don't want to disclose it.''
	   ``I can't imagine that Sydney is different from the others.
Sydney pretends it is completely clean, clean, clean.''
	   On Salt Lake, Hodler contested the argument by the current
organizing committee that it was not directly involved in the
controversial scholarship program and that the onus was on former
bid chief Thomas Welch.
	   ``Yesterday the lawyer of Salt Lake City said everything had
been done by Tom Welch who is not there any more, we know nothing.
My experience is that this is not true.''
	   The controversy centers on scholarships _ including tuition
assistance and athlete training programs _ paid to relatives of IOC
members by the Salt Lake bid committee.
	   From 1991 to 1995, the committee _ under the direction of Welch
_ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships to 13 individuals _ six
of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa.
	   The current SLOC president, Frank Joklik, was chairman of the
bid committee at the time. SLOC vice president Dave Johnson was
also a high official on the bid committee.

	   Highlights of the two-day European Union summit that concluded
Saturday in Vienna, Austria:
	   - The leaders of the 15 EU nations agreed to reach ``an
appropriate financial framework'' by March for carrying out the
next phase of the Union's enlargement program while at the same
time ``ensuring budgetary rigor.''
	   - Agreed on a ``Vienna Strategy for Europe'' promoting
employment, economic growth and stability, improving security and
the quality of life, reforming the EU's policies and institutions,
and promoting stability and prosperity through Europe and the
world.
	   - Approved guidelines for employment, urging member nations to
pay particular attention to such things as using tax-benefit
systems to provide incentives, supporting older workers and
promoting inclusion of disadvantaged persons. It also urged them to
``set themselves additional quantified targets and deadlines'' for
employment measures.
	   - Took no action on appointing a high representative to
represent the EU on foreign and security policy but said such a
person ``will be appointed soon'' and would be ``a personality with
a strong political profile.''
	   - Agreed that the EU's common foreign and security policy must
be ``backed by credible operational capabilities'' and welcomed the
recent Franco-British summit declaration pressing for a defense
strategy that would permit Europeans to assume a greater role in
continental defense independent from the United States but still
within the NATO framework.
	   - Put off a decision on retreating from an earlier agreement on
abolishing duty-free shopping in the EU, asking the Union's
Economic and Financial Council and the executive Commission to
examine until March 1999 possible moves for addressing problems
that may arise if duty free is extended.
	   - Agreed to a wide-ranging trade agreement with South Africa
after resolving a dispute over wine labeling that threatened to
kill the deal.
	   - Reaffirmed the EU's endorsement of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights on the 50th anniversary of its adoption.
	   - Noted that the creation of a single European currency on Jan.
1 will be ``a major achievement for the international monetary
system'' and that the EU now has a full economic coordination
process among member countries.
	   - Awarded former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl the title of
``Honorary Citizen of Europe'' for his contribution to the
development of the European Union during his 16 years in office.

Re-election expected for Guinea's president in Monday's elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ Fourteen years after he came to power in
a military coup, President Lansana Conte is set to face his second
presidential elections Monday.
	   But there are few people in this West African country who think
Conte faces much serious opposition. Backed by government funding,
military support, control of the broadcast media and a political
party that is tightly entwined with the government, even Conte's
opponents say he'll win the Dec. 14 vote.
	   ``It's impossible for an opposition candidate to win the
elections,'' Mohamed Diane, a top official in the Rally of the
Guinean People said in a recent interview. ``The government has
created the facade of democracy.''
	   But still hoping it can make some campaign headway and claiming
that only 40 percent of the electorate has received their voter
cards, the opposition has asked that the elections be put off for a
month.
	   ``Wisdom demands that such a request be accepted ... to avoid
trouble that may have unforeseeable consequences,'' the Rally of
the Guinean People said in a statement.
	   The government, however, dismisses those demands.
	   Kader Sangari, an Interior Ministry official handling logistical
planning for the balloting, said that between 95 percent and 98
percent of voters had received their cards.
	   He also promised a free and transparent election, despite the
opposition claims to the contrary. The opposition also lashed out
at the 1993 presidential elections _ the first multiparty
presidential vote since independence from France in 1958 _ saying
they had been rigged in Conte's favor.
	   Conte, who seized power in 1984 just after the death of Guinea's
former dictator, Sekou Toure, faces four opponents in Monday's
voting.
	   Alpha Conde, one of the two prominent opposition candidates,
faced Conte in the 1993 elections and recently returned from a
self-imposed exile in Senegal. He heads the Rally of the Guinean
People.
	   The other prominent candidate, Mamadou Ba, the leader of the
Union for Progress and Renewal, is believed to have widespread
support in part of the country's interior.
	   In recent months, Mamadou Ba was briefly arrested and a number
of supporters of the Rally of the Guinean People were also detained
in what the opposition called a crackdown.
	   The other two candidates are not believed to have much support.
	   Guinea, which has an average per capita income of just a few
hundred dollars a year and an illiteracy rate of 75-80 percent, is
still recovering from the brutal 26-year regime of Toure, who ruled
a one-party Marxist state that terrorized its people with imagined
plots and widespread arrests.
	   Thousands of people died in Toure's prison camps and by the time
of his death some 2 million people had fled the country.
	   While Conte's regime allows much more political freedom than
Toure's _ independent newspapers, for instance, now regularly
criticize and ridicule the government _ critics say Conte turned
more autocratic after a 1996 military revolt.
	   Conte faced a military mutiny then in which 2,000 of Guinea's
8,500-member armed forces rampaged through Conakry, the capital,
demanding back pay and dismissal of the defense minister. At least
30 people are believed to have died.
	   Conte put down the rebellion by promising pay raises and better
rations.

Plane, train, air, highway and subway workers to strike in Italy _
</HEADLINE>
feet still work &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ What looked ominously like the week of going nowhere
loomed Saturday in Italy, where workers for planes, trains,
highways, buses and subways all were planning to walk off their
jobs.
	   Newspapers and TV ran complicated calendars Saturday advising
Italians and tourists exactly what workers will be striking, when,
and where. Come Monday, travel stood to require the exquisite
timing and strategic finesse of a battlefield general.
	   ``A hellish week,'' Rome's Il Messagero daily warned.
	   As of Saturday, highlights of the strike calendar included rail
strikes Monday night through Wednesday, ground crew strikes at
Milan's airports Monday and Wednesday and a toll-booth worker
strike on Thursday.
	   The toughest day promised to be Tuesday, when rail workers,
flight attendants and Rome's public transportation workers all
intended to walk off the job.
	   Trying to ease the coming paralysis, the government reminded
unions on Friday that concurrent strikes were illegal. Authorities
also spoke of revising a 1991 pact so as to ban big-city bus and
subway strikes of more than 24 hours.

Malaysia makes it easier for foreigners to buy land
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia will offer incentives to
foreigners to buy real estate in an effort to revitalize the
property market and speed up economic recovery, a news report said
Saturday.
	   The temporary measures, which will be in effect for one month
starting Saturday, will make it easier for foreigners to get loans
to buy residential real estate.
	   Non-resident foreigners without work permits will be allowed to
borrow up to 50 percent of the property price from banks and other
financial institutions. Normally, Malaysian law bars foreigners
without works permits from getting loans at all.
	   Non-residents with work permits will be able to get bank loans
for up to 95 percent of the sale price. They are normally only
eligible for loans up to 60 percent.
	   The incentives are part of a national Home Ownership Campaign,
during which property will also be offered at a 10 percent
discount.
	   The incentives for foreigners will only apply to residential
properties worth more than 250,000 ringgit (dlrs 61,000).

Forensics expert says digging may be off at disputed Kosovo site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Plans to exhume Kosovo massacre
victims from a site in rebel-held territory may have to be dropped
due to Serbian police resistance, a forensics team member said
Saturday.
	   A Finnish team that tried to start work Thursday at a site in
the central Drenica region was blocked by police in armored
vehicles who said the digging couldn't be carried out without their
presence. Talks between the experts and government authorities have
yet to resolve the dispute, said team member Tino Lahelma.
	   ``Anything can happen, but I do think we have an impasse with
Gornje Obrinje,'' the pathologist said. ``If this situation would
persist, then Gornje Obrinje would not be possible.''
	   Efforts would continue to carry out exhumations at five other
sites where government authorities also gave the European
Union-funded team permission to dig. ``We don't want to give up,''
he said.
	   In the latest violence in tense Kosovo, Serbian media said
ethnic Albanian gunmen killed five people Friday. Four of the dead
reportedly were ethnic Albanians loyal to the Serbian government _
three near Glogovac and one in a southwestern village _ and one was
a Serb policeman, killed near Djakovica in western Kosovo.
	   Gornje Obrinje, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Pristina, is
the site of among the most gruesome killings from fighting between
Serb forces and ethnic Albanian separatist rebels that left
hundreds dead this year.
	   A makeshift collective grave on a hillside there is believed to
contain the bodies of 22 ethnic Albanians from a single family
clan, including those of women and children. The mutilated bodies
were seen by diplomats and journalists shortly after the slayings
in a nearby forest in September.
	   The top government official for Kosovo, Zoran Andjelkovic,
insists the Finns are not being prevented from doing their work.
	   But Lahelma said it's unrealistic for police to insist on
escorting the Finns and the Serbian legal team accompanying them to
the site in rebel-controlled territory, with tensions remaining
high despite a two-month-old truce.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army has said only the Finns, not the
police, are welcome in Drenica, heartland of the guerrilla
movement.
	   ``We don't want to risk our lives'' by bringing police into a
KLA-controlled area, Lahelma said.
	   Meanwhile, family members of Serb civilians believed abducted by
rebels appealed Saturday to the U.S. head of international peace
monitors to help in the search for the missing.
	   ``Your authority with representatives of Albanians can help
solve the mystery and we could learn the truth what happened to our
loved ones,'' said the open letter sent to U.S. diplomat William
Walker. Walker heads the Kosovo Verification Mission still being
assembled by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo, including some 40
from the town of Orahovac, where hundreds of people held a protest
march to a rebel stronghold Thursday to demand information about
their fate.

 &UR; IOC official alleges widespread bribery in Olympic selection
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous; adds byline, fixes to Saturday; minor
editing
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ A top IOC official on Saturday made
explosive allegations of widespread Olympic corruption, saying
agents demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver votes in the
selection of host cities.
	   Marc Hodler, a senior member of the International Olympic
Committee executive board, alleged malpractices in the voting for
the 1996 Atlanta Games, 2000 Sydney Olympics and 2002 Salt Lake
Games.
	   Hodler said a group of four agents, including one IOC member,
have been involved in promising votes for payment. He declined to
identify them.
	   ``The four agents try to make a living out of this,'' he said.
``I missed a chance to be a rich man. Some of the agents do the
following: they say, `I can offer this or that number of votes.'
	   ``The price wold be between dlrs 500,000 and dlrs 1 million for
a number of votes, a bloc.''
	   Hodler added that the agents then charge the city winning the
bid ``something like dlrs 3 million to dlrs 5 millon.''
	   Hodler, an 80-year-old Swiss lawyer, said there is one agent who
boasts ``that no city has ever won the Olympic Games without his
help.''
	   ``No one can prove that,'' Hodler said.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated
himself from Hodler's allegations.
	   ``The only official spokeman for the IOC executive board is
(director general) Francois Carrard,'' Samaranch said. ``All the
other comments are personal comments. They are not official
comments.''
	   Hodler's allegations, made to a group of reporters, came as the
IOC continued investigations into alleged financial misconduct by
the Salt Lake City group which won the bid for the 2002 games.
	   Hodler has described as a ``bribe'' the dlrs 500,000 scholarship
fund set up by Salt Lake which benefited the relatives of six IOC
members.
	   It also came as the former minister in charge of Sydney's 2000
Olympic bid revealed he was asked to offer bribes in exchange for
votes. Bruce Baird, the former New South Wales minister, said he
refused.
	   Asked whether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the 1996 games
was clean, Hodler said, ``Certainly not.'
	   Asked whether Sydney's election was clean, he said, ``I would be
surprised. I know what happened but I don't want to disclose it.''
	   ``I can't imagine that Sydney is different from the others,'' he
said. ``Sydney pretends it is completely clean, clean, clean.''
	   Hodler contested the argument by the current Salt Lake
organizing committee that it was not directly involved in the
controversial scholarship program and that the onus was on former
bid chief Thomas Welch.
	   ``Yesterday the lawyer of Salt Lake City said, `Everything had
been done by Tom Welch, who is not there any more. We know
nothing.' My experience is that this is not true.''
	   The controversy centers on scholarships _ including tuition
assistance and athlete training programs _ paid to relatives of IOC
members by the Salt Lake bid committee.
	   From 1991 to 1995, the committee _ under the direction of Welch
_ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships to 13 individuals _ six
of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa.
	   The current SLOC president, Frank Joklik, was chairman of the
bid committee at the time. SLOC vice president Dave Johnson was
also a high official on the bid committee.

Earthquake rocks Afghan capital, no injuries reported
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Residents of this war-weary captial
leapt from their beds and ran from their homes early Saturday as a
moderate intensity earthquake shook the city.
	   The earthquake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.4, was
centered about 150 kilometers (90 miles) north of Kabul in the
rugged Hindu Kush mountain range, said Malik Salauddin, deputy
director of the Pakistan Meteorological Center in neighboring
Pakistan.
	   The earthquake struck shortly before 1 a.m. local time as
residents slept. But eyewitnesses said that throughout the city
people woke from their sleep and left their homes.
	   The capital has been shaken by five separate tremors in the past
one week say residents.
	   There were no immediate reports of damage in northern
Afghanistan, which often is hardest hit by the tremors. In May more
than 5,000 people were killed when an earthquake in northern
Afghanistan unleased massive mudslides and flooding that wiped out
entire villages.
	   But a spokesman for the anti-Taliban alliance, which controls
much of northern Takhar and Badakshan provinces, some 300
kilometers (180 miles) north of Kabul, said commanders in the area
contacted by radio said there were no damages.
	   The Taliban religious militia rules about 90 percent of
Afghanistan, including the capital of Kabul. However, the militia
is locked in a fierce battle with its opponents on several battle
fronts north of Kabul
	   On Friday a raging artillery duel rocked the battlefield barely
20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Kabul. The Taliban said they held
their ground and they claimed to have killed dozens of opposition
soldiers.
	   However, the claim could not be independently confirmed.

EBRD ponders financing Ukraine's nuclear reactors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development is considering a loan for completing two nuclear
reactors in Ukraine, but wants proof the project will be
profitable, the bank's president said Saturday.
	   Horst Koehler told a news conference in Kiev that the EBRD would
propose the loan to the bank's board of governors if Ukraine proves
that the project, with an estimated cost of dlrs 1.2 billion, will
make enough profit to repay the loan.
	   ``Nothing has been decided yet,'' Koehler said.
	   Ukraine wants to complete the reactors at the Khmelnytsky and
Rivne power plants to compensate for the planned closing of the
Chernobyl power plant, which the government has pledged to shut
down by 2000.
	   The former Soviet republic has said it does not have the money
to finish the reactors, and has been seeking help from the EBRD and
Western nations.
	   The government has warned repeatedly it will not shut down
Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986,
until the two reactors are completed.
	   Koehler said, the EBRD does not want the closing of the
Soviet-designed nuclear reactors at Chernobyl delayed. ``The
closure of Chernobyl as early as possible is a most urgent and
necessary task,'' he said.
	   Koehler, appointed to head the EBRD in September, spoke at the
end of a three-day visit to Ukraine, his first trip to one of the
bank's 26 countries of operations.
	   During meetings with President Leonid Kuchma and Prime Minister
Valery Pustovoitenko on Friday, Koehler praised Ukraine's efforts
in battling the effects of the economic crisis in neighboring
Russia, and said the EBRD would continue to help Ukraine through
its present economic hardships.
	   The EBRD so far has committed about dlrs 750 million for nearly
30 projects in Ukraine.
	   The latest was approved Saturday after Koehler and Kiev Mayor
Oleksandr Omelchenko signed an agreement under which the EBRD would
become a major investor in the construction of a dlrs 41 million
four-star hotel in Kiev, the first of its kind in Ukraine.

Sri Lankan military kills 17 rebels in the north
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Clashes between separatist guerrillas
and army soldiers in the war-torn north left 17 rebels dead, the
military said Saturday.
	   Five rebels were killed by soldiers near the government
controlled Oddusuddan town in northeastern Mullaitivu district on
Friday, the Defense Ministry said.
	   Mullaitivu is 260 kilometers (160 miles) northeast of the
capital Colombo.
	   In separate confrontations in nearby districts Friday, troops
gunned down 12 rebels, the military said.
	   Last week, the military captured Oddusuddan in a renewed push
against the main Tamil Tiger rebels.
	   Independent confirmation is impossible as journalists are barred
from the war zone. A censorship has been in force since June 5 and
journalists have had to submit their stories to a military official
for clearance.
	   But, in a move designed to placate critics, the government on
Friday shifted censorship of the news of the country's civil war
from the military and appointed a civilian official to screen
reports.
	   Tamil guerrillas are fighting for a homeland in the northeast
for the country's minority ethnic Tamils who claim discrimination
from the majority Sinhalese who dominate the government and the
military.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development is considering a loan for completing two nuclear
reactors in Ukraine, but wants proof the project will be
profitable, the bank's president said Saturday.
	   Horst Koehler told a news conference in Kiev that the EBRD would
propose the loan to the bank's board of governors if Ukraine proves
that the project, with an estimated cost of dlrs 1.2 billion, will
make enough profit to repay the loan.
	   ``Nothing has been decided yet,'' Koehler said.
	   Ukraine wants to complete the reactors at the Khmelnytsky and
Rivne power plants to compensate for the planned closing of the
Chernobyl power plant, which the government has pledged to shut
down by 2000.
	   The former Soviet republic has said it does not have the money
to finish the reactors, and has been seeking help from the EBRD and
Western nations.
	   The government has warned repeatedly it will not shut down
Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986,
until the two reactors are completed.
	   Koehler said, the EBRD does not want the closing of the
Soviet-designed nuclear reactors at Chernobyl delayed. ``The
closure of Chernobyl as early as possible is a most urgent and
necessary task,'' he said.
	   Koehler, appointed to head the EBRD in September, spoke at the
end of a three-day visit to Ukraine, his first trip to one of the
bank's 26 countries of operations.
	   During meetings with President Leonid Kuchma and Prime Minister
Valery Pustovoitenko on Friday, Koehler praised Ukraine's efforts
in battling the effects of the economic crisis in neighboring
Russia, and said the EBRD would continue to help Ukraine through
its present economic hardships.
	   The EBRD so far has committed about dlrs 750 million for nearly
30 projects in Ukraine.
	   The latest was approved Saturday after Koehler and Kiev Mayor
Oleksandr Omelchenko signed an agreement under which the EBRD would
become a major investor in the construction of a dlrs 41 million
four-star hotel in Kiev, the first of its kind in Ukraine.

	   MOBA, Congo (AP) _ Sitting at the wheel of an Italian-made
speedboat racing past the green mountain shores of Lake Tangyanika,
a rebel commander said Saturday his troops were poised to capture
the last government stronghold of the vast central African lake.
	   Col. Nora Songolo said his forces, backed by Rwanda and more
recently Burundi, were in control of all other towns on the western
shore of 720-kilometer (450-mile) long lake and were fighting to
capture Molira, on the border with Zambia.
	   ``From (the northernmost Congolese lakeshore town) Uvira to the
Zambian border, we control the lake,'' said Col. Nora Songolo. ``We
are about to capture Molira.''
	   The rebels and their Rwandan allies use the fiberglass
speedboats with anti-aircraft guns to move swiftly and fire on
government fighter jets whose regular raids have slowed but not
stopped rebel advances in eastern Congo.
	   As the war advances, efforts at peace appeared to be again
foundering Saturday, with the announcement of a delay in a meeting
of involved parties who were to discuss a cease fire proposed last
month.
	   The Zambian government, which was to host the meeting in the
capital Lusaka on Dec. 14-15, said Saturday the summit was
postponed until Dec. 28, to give officials time to drum up support
for peace efforts. The meeting was originally set for Dec. 8.
	   Songolo, a defector from the capital of the southern Katanga
region Lubumbashi, said the priority now was getting Kabila to
negotiate peace directly with the rebels.
	   So far, Kabila's refusal to negotiate directly with the rebels,
saying they are pawns of their backers Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi,
has torpedoed international and regional efforts to negotiate a
cease-fire.
	   Kabila insists the war against him is a foreign invasion and
that those countries troops must leave before any cease fire can be
implemented.
	   ``We will continue pushing for Lubumbashi until Kabila realizes
our military strength,'' Songolo said. ``He has no other (choice)
but to negotiate with us.''
	   Songolo said the rebels control the airstrip and fishing village
of Moba, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Molira, dismissing as
false government claims of a successful counteroffensive.
	   However, the rebels had yet convince war-weary fishermen and
farmers to return to their abandoned hamlet, Songolo said. Like a
ghost town, most of Moba's mud brick and straw roof houses stand
empty since the town fell to rebels a month ago.
	   The few remaining residents said their relatives and friends
were hesitant to come back, afraid of either the new army or air
strikes by Zimbabwe, President Laurent Kabila's main ally in the
four-month war.
	   On Tuesday, a Zimbabwean MiG-21 dropped bombs on abandoned
houses a few meters (yards) from the port. There were no
casualties.
	   Songolo said he was setting up anti-aircraft guns around the
town's grassy airstrip, on a plateau of the lush, 3,000-meter
(9,900-foot) high Mugila Mountains.
	   The fertile soil once fed the mineral-rich Katanga Province
before the second war in as many years made roads too dangerous.
	   But the greatest difficulty facing the rebel coalition of ethnic
Tutsis, disaffected Congolese soldiers and opposition politicians
who took up arms Aug. 2 is convincing Kabila's Baluba tribesmen in
eastern Katanga to cooperate.
	   Like Kabila, most people see the rebels as foreign invaders and
they have yet to prove the benefits of their democratic programs
for the potentially rich but impoverished country.
	   The conflict has drawn in Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad on
Kabila's side and Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi on the rebel side.
	   Burundi offically denies involvement in Congo, but missionaries,
political sources and rebels said an estimated 3,000 Burundian
troops were present along Congo's Tanganyika shores to secure
Burundian coffee exports to Zambia and keep Burundian Hutu fighters
from using eastern Congo as their rear base.

	   MOBA, Congo (AP) _ Sitting at the wheel of an Italian-made
speedboat racing past the green mountains sloping down to Lake

New anti-carjacking device would burn thieves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ An inventor says he has a
radical solution to South Africa's soaring carjacking rate:
barbecue the carjackers.
	   The ``Blaster'' anti-hijacking system is essentially a
flame-thrower installed on a car's undercarriage. It directs
flames, fed by four gas jets mounted under the doors, out both
sides of a car without singeing the vehicle itself.
	   Police Superintendent David Walkley says the device is legal and
in fact has one installed on his own car, the Saturday Star
reported.
	   ``It is a lot less extreme than a firearm,'' the policeman was
quoted as saying in the Johannesburg weekly.
	   Inventor Charles Fourie says he has already installed the
Blaster, which is activated by a foot switch, on 25 cars.
	   ``This system ... will stop the hijacker in his tracks,'' Fourie
told Associated Press Television News. ``He will never get your
car.''
	   During a demonstration, the Blaster incinerated a dummy that had
been placed outside the car next to the driver's window.
	   But so far, the system remains untested in a real situation.
	   A carjacker could theoretically fire a gun at the driver before
or after jumping away from the flames. And because the flames blast
out from both sides of the car and cannot be aimed, there is
nothing to prevent an innocent bystander from being torched.

Iran beats China 2-1; Qatar beats Thais
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late games: CORRECTS Bagheri spelling &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ World Cup veterans Ali Daei and Karim
Bagheri rallied against China to spearhead Iran's 2-1 victory
Saturday in an Asian Games soccer group decider earning both teams
quarterfinal berths.
	   Oman drew with group weakling Tajikistan 3-3 in the last match
of the tough qualifying group. Oman had needed a victory by a near
impossible seven goals to overtake the Iranians for the runner-up
spot and advance.
	   In Group 4 play, Lebanon surprised Kazakstan 3-0, knocking the
Kazaks out of the quarterfinals when Qatar beat Thailand 2-1.
	   In a packed stadium full of security, Qatar had a questionable
goal in the second half to down Thailand but both teams got into
the quarterfinals. Qatar led the group with two victories and a
loss and advanced to a quarterfinal meeting with Kuwait.
	   Thailand and Kazakstan ended up with a win, a loss and a draw
apiece. The host Thais moved to the quarterfinals with a zero goal
difference while the Kazaks were minus one.
	   On Monday, the Thais play South Korea, the only unbeaten and
untied team in the second round.
	   China finished atop Group 3 with two victories and a loss. Iran
also ended up with two victories and a loss but behind China on
goal differential.
	   The Chinese face Turkmenistan and the Iranians meet Uzbekistan
in the knockout quarterfinals Monday.
	   The defeat left the Chinese, who were unbeaten in their first
four Asian Games matches, still unavenged for the pair of Iranian
victories that kept them out of this year's World Cup in France.
	   Bobby Houghton, the English coach who has since taken control of
the young Chinese team, said his players had no complex about Iran
and were hoping to meet it again in the semifinals.
	   ``This has been the best game of the tournament,'' Houghton
said. ``These are the two best teams of the tournament. ''
	   ``We are at the top of the group. That has been two groups we
won now and I am pleased with that,'' he said. ``You can play well
and lose and you can play badly and win. As long as you keep a nice
steady standard, that is all you can do.''
	   China scored first. Li Jinyu fired through a wall of Iranians in
the 5th minute but his shot went straight back off the keeper's
hand. Yao Xia took control and flipped a pass to a charging Li in
front of the goal mouth.
	   Li chipped in for his fourth goal of the Asian Games.
	   The Iranians' experience and power began to show a half-hour
into the half as they got through the middle of the China defense
headed by Crystal Palace's Fan Zhiyi.
	   Daei sent a low pass from midfield to the top of the penalty
area and Bagheri sent in a blistering shot to equalize.
	   Two minutes later, captain Mohammad Kani Nader, whose own goal
led to Iran's defeat to Oman in the group opener, lofted a 30-meter
free kick that found Daei's head at point blank range before the
goal.
	   The Bayern Munich star easily put Iran ahead ahead 2-1 with his
fifth goal of these games.
	   Iran male fans cheered, sang and beat out a middle Eastern
rhythm on a tambourine while five women wrapped in black Muslim
chadors sat quietly.
	   The second half was dominated by Iran's always physical defense
repeatedly turning rough.
	   Sayed Ali Mousavi, Hamid Reza Estili and Vahid Hashemian-Korbi
drew yellow cards and Iran was lucky not to receive a couple more.
	   Iranian coach Mansour Pourhydari said he couldn't predict his
team would win the gold medal but the victory clearly made it one
of the favorites.
	   ``I think we have gotten over our difficulties so now it will
only get better,'' Pourhydari said. ``We were not satisfied against
Oman. The concentration of our players was very high for this
match.''
	   Lebanon went ahead early with a goal by Zaher Andari in the 13th
minute. He upped the margin 4 minutes into the second half amd
Nabil El Jourdi completed the scoring with a shot in the 31st
minute for 3-0.
	   Tajikistan was headed for victory on two goals by Takhirdjon
Muminov and one by Shukran Djabarov late in the second half when a
dangerous tackle gave Oman a shot from the penalty spot, spotted by
Majdi Shaban Fateh, and the Omanis gained the draw.
	   For Thailand's match with Qatar, officials were fearful of
trouble after 80,000-strong crowds converged on the 60,000-seat
Rajamangala National Stadium. Also, fighting had erupted the last
time the two teams played, ending the match.
	   With a quarterfinal berth on the line, police brought in an
extra 1,000 police and security staff for the match.
	   After the Thais went ahead 1-0 on Surachai Juturapattarapo's
12th minute goal, Qatar equalized a few minutes later on a free
kick by Mustafa Mubarek.
	   In the second half, Qatar got the game-winner when a pass was
deflected twice and found its way to Jamal Taha, ahead of the Thai
defenders, who were raising their hands, thinking there was an
offside.
	   Taha chipped in an easy shot for the goal while the Thais looked
at the officials, who made no call.
	   Although thre was sporadic bottle throwing at the end of the
game by some fans, there were no major disturbances since Thailand
advanced.
	   ``I think we played a good game but we had two defensive
lapses,'' said Thailand's British coach, Peter Tithe. `` We get the
first goal and then we have a lapse in concentration.''

Kjus wins downhill, ends two-year winning drought

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Olympic silver medallist Lasse Kjus
claimed the season's first downhill on Saturday, bringing to an end
a two-year winning drought.
	   Twenty-fourth out of the start-hut, Kjus took full advantage of
improving course and light conditions to storm down the 3,129-meter
(10,265-ft) classic Oreiller-Killy course with a winning time of 1
minute, 43.20 seconds.
	   ``I generally like a later start number in the downhill,'' said
Kjus, who finished second in the downhill behind Olympic champion
Jean-Luc Cretier in Nagano last February. ``This time it really
gave me a distinct advantage.
	   ``The recent snow on the course was pushed off by the skiers
ahead of me making the surface harder,'' explained Kjus. ``The
conditions overall were much better later.''
	   The 1996 overall World Cup champion, Kjus's last victory dated
back to March 1997, when the Norwegian won a downhill on home snow
in Kvitfjell, Norway.
	   ``I really wasn't expecting anything special because I'd been
through two bad seasons,'' said Kjus, who suffered from frequent
colds which kept him off the slopes until a sinus operation last
April alleviated the problem. ``I have to say this win makes me
very happy ... almost relieved.''
	   It marked the Norwegian's eighth career World Cup win, his
fourth in the downill.
	   Recording his career best result, Italy's Luca Cattaneo was
runnerup in 1:43.48. The Italian's previous best was a third place
in a super-G in Schladming, Austria, last year.
	   ``I was lucky with my start number,'' said Cattaneo, whose World
Cup ranking is too low to permit him to choose his start number.
``When I saw Lasse's time I knew the conditions were improving and
I could do well, especially after doing well in training.
	   ``Though I was lucky this time with my start number, one of my
goals this season is to rank high enough so I can choose my own.''
	   Cattaneo's teammate Erik Seletto placed third in 1:43.64 for his
first career podium finish.
	   Though home fans were left disappointed when their Olympic hero
Cretier was pushed off the podium after holding a massive lead for
the first half of the race, they were slightly consoled with a
fourth place by unheralded Antoine Deneriaz.
	   A member of France's back-up team, Deneriaz had already shown
his potential, posting the fastest time in Friday's practice
session.
	   Starting 34th, the 22-year-old confirmed his training results,
crossing fourth in 1:43.67.
	   ``This fourth place is like a win for me,'' said Deneriaz. ``I'm
really happy and it's a good start to the season. It'll give me
great confidence going into the next races in Val Gardena,
(Italy).''
	   As the conditions continued to improve, several other late
starters began slipping amongst the top-10.
	   A virtual unknown, Audun Groenvold of Norway clocked the fifth
fastest time of 1:44.17. Canada's Kevin Wert posted his career best
result, finishing sixth 1.00 back, after missing almost all of last
season due to injury.
	   Slovenia's Ales Brezavsek, whose best result was a 10th place in
the combined last year, tied for seventh with Italy's Peter
Runggaldier in 1:44.23.
	   ``When I saw my time I thought ``today I will win,'''' Kjus
said. ``But when I saw Luca Cattaneo post a time just .28 slower
than mine and the other times getting better and better, I was
worried and knew I'd have to wait until the end of the race before
being sure of victory.''
	   Seeking his first career World Cup win, Jean-Luc Cretier was
forced to settle for 12th in his first downhill on French soil
since becoming Olympic champion.
	   Tenth out of the start hut, Cretier's time of 1:44.64 held as 14
other skiers struggled with the deteriorating light conditions.
	   But as the sky began to clear up once more, Kjus took the lead
before the Frenchman was completely pushed off the podium by later
skiers.
	   Reigning World Cup downhill champion Andreas Schifferer finished
back in 29th 2.18 adrift, just ahead of teammate Hermann Maier, the
fearless skier who won two Olympic golds, the World Cup overall,
super-G and giant slalom titles last season.
	   Though the Austrians have dominated in every discipline since
the start of the season, none made it into the top-10 in Saturday's
downhill. The top Austrian skier was 22-year-old Norbert Holzknecht
who finished 15th, 1.67 back.
	   The day saw just one frightening accident when France's David
Pretot was blinded by the strobe effect of the tree-shadows on the
course, and took a spectacular fall.
	   With his left ski failing to pop off during the tumble, Pretot
injured the lateral ligament in his left ankle. Doctors have yet to
X-ray the leg for possible fractures.

 &UR; Palestinians quell violence ahead of Clinton visit &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian police helped quell
anti-Israel protests on Saturday, hours before U.S. President Bill
Clinton is to arrive in the region _ a sign of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's determination to smooth the visit.
	   In Palestinian-administered Bethlehem, Palestinian protesters
stoned Israeli soldiers guarding the entrance of the city.
	   The troops _ positioned below a banner declaring ``Bill Clinton:
Welcome to Palestine'' _ responded with tear gas and rubber
bullets.
	   A few minutes before the fighting broke out, a family set up
Christmas decorations on a balcony directly above the banner.
	   Palestinian police later moved in to contain the protesters.
Clinton is to light a Christmas tree in the town believed to be
where Jesus was born on Monday.
	   The visit was meant to celebrate the U.S.-brokered agreement
achieved at Wye River in October; instead, Clinton will now try to
salvage it.
	   The Palestinians are angry that Israel refuses to release
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities and has instead
released mostly common criminals to meet its prisoner release
commitments.
	   The Israelis accuse the Palestinian Authority of being behind
the wave of violence that broke out last month over prisoner
releases.
	   Two protesters died in heavy violence on Friday. In the
Palestinian-administered town of Qalqilya on Saturday, 10,000
people attended the funeral of Kamal Adwan, 21.
	   The mourners shouted ``Revenge!'' and Adwan's father, Mansour,
beseeched them not to offer condolences: ``My son is in paradise,
he has done his duty for the homeland.''
	   The Palestinian Authority, while expressing sympathy for the
protesters, has denied any involvement _ but did not take concrete
steps to contain the violence until recent days.
	   In the militant Islamic bastion of Hebron on Saturday,
Palestinian police and security agents flooded the campus of the
Islamic University after militants said they would stage a
flag-burning anti-U.S. demonstration in time for the visit. The
demonstrators never showed.
	   Palestinians aiming their slingshots at Israeli troops in
Bethlehem said they were not opposed to the Clinton visit.
	   ``I'm protesting by throwing stones so that my brother will be
released from prison,'' said 18-year-old Khaled Dakakta, slingshot
in hand. ``This is not timed for Clinton ... but we will not stop
until they will be free.''
	   The Palestinians Prisoner's Association, which has been
coordinating some of the protests, called off a commercial West
Bank-wide strike scheduled for Monday, out of deference to Clinton.
	   The highlight of the visit will be Clinton's attendance at a
meeting of the Palestine National Council on Monday evening,
intended to abrogate clauses in the Palestinian charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from
hard-liners who may bring down his government unless he scraps Wye,
has said he will not go ahead with a planned withdrawal from
further West Bank territory unless the offending passages are
abrogated in a clear-cut vote.
	   Arafat says that ``affirmation'' is enough. Asked what that
means, he said Saturday that ``we are not in need of a vote.''
	   Although he likely has a majority behind him, Arafat may be
backing off a vote because he lacks the numbers to get the required
two-thirds quorum of the 600-member to attend Monday's meeting.
	   On Saturday, 104 rejectionists said they would not attend the
meeting on principle; Israel has refused to allow some other PNC
members into Gaza.
	   In a pamphlet published Saturday, the militant Islamic group
Hamas also dismissed Clinton as ``an enemy of the Arabs'' who is
arriving to ``personally supervise in the direst way the
destruction of the Palestinian charter.''
	   Hamas warned Arafat to release its leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin,
from house arrest by Dec. 25 _ otherwise it would carry out attacks
against Israel.
	   In Bethlehem, Christmas preparations continued apace. Huge
Palestinian and U.S. flags hung over Manger Square, and locals
shopping for presents mingled with U.S. agents securing the site.
	   ``I wish that Mr. Clinton he can make Netanyahu release our
prisoners and to move forward with the peace process,'' said one
shopper, Georgina Khoury.
	   Douglas Dicks, from Strasburg, Va., snapped a photo of two
Palestinian policemen holding aloft a poster of Clinton and Arafat.
	   Dicks said he was proud to be in Bethlehem for the seasonal
celebrations this year.
	   ``I'm proud that (Clinton) is coming to make peace and push the
peace forward,'' he said. ``I think it's the right message.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Plans to exhume Kosovo massacre
victims from a site in rebel-held territory may have to be dropped
due to Serbian police resistance, a forensics team member said
Saturday.
	   A Finnish team that tried to start work Thursday at a site in
the central Drenica region was blocked by police in armored
vehicles who said the digging couldn't be carried out without their
presence. Talks between the experts and government authorities have
yet to resolve the dispute, said team member Tino Lahelma.

Gornje Obrinje,'' Lahelma said. ``If this situation would persist,
then Gornje Obrinje would not be possible.''

Kjus wins downhill, ends two-year winning drought

 &UR; EDS: CLARIFIES Hermann Maier's place 36th &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Olympic silver medallist Lasse Kjus
claimed the season's first downhill on Saturday, bringing to an end
a two-year winning drought.
	   Twenty-fourth out of the start-hut, Kjus took full advantage of
improving course and light conditions to storm down the 3,129-meter
(10,265-ft) classic Oreiller-Killy course with a winning time of 1
minute, 43.20 seconds.
	   ``I generally like a later start number in the downhill,'' said
Kjus, who finished second in the downhill behind Olympic champion
Jean-Luc Cretier in Nagano last February. ``This time it really
gave me a distinct advantage.
	   ``The recent snow on the course was pushed off by the skiers

	   The 1996 overall World Cup champion, Kjus's last victory dated

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's swim team, humiliated by the
steroid-fueled Chinese four years ago, surpassed the world swim
power as champion of Asia on Saturday.
	   Japan beat a Chinese team without several top stars 15-13 in the
gold medal count, bouncing back from a 25-5 trouncing in Hiroshima
in 1994.
	   Masato Hirano sealed Japan's victory with a gold medal in the
1,500-meter freestyle, the last of 32 events.
	   Not even a win by convicted drug offender Xiong Guoming, who won
four golds in 1994 before he and six other Chinese swimmers were
banned for positive tests, could stem the Japanese tide.
	   Before Saturday's final session, leading coach Han Mingyan
admitted he had underestimated the Japanese.
	   Han coaches world 400 medley record-holder and dual world
champion Chen Yan, who failed to get a gold and was hit by a
stomach ailment. Han suggested that poor preparation was the reason
for China's failure to win the gold count.
	   ``We have underestimated our Japanese rivals, and they are
stronger than expected,'' said Han. ``I introduced a rather
conservative training method for Chen in preparation for the games.
I thought we didn't have to push too hard. We will never let this
happen again.''
	   Japan's Mai Nakamura, second in the 200-meter backstroke
Saturday, said the team had worked hard to face China at this meet
following the disaster in 1994.
	   ``This time we set the goal of beating China and we've achieved
the goal,'' Nakamura said.
	   Xiong, one of the main figures in China's worst drugs scandal,
was back in winning form Saturday. He joined another of his
teammates here, Fu Yong, in returning to the games with a gold
medal and helped China briefly level the gold standings at 12-12
through 26 events.
	   After a poor start to the meet, including a second evening with
no golds, Chinese officials marshaled their troops into the stands,
where they stood Friday and Saturday waving tiny red flags and
cheering their teammates.
	   Xiong turned and waved to his compatriots after his 200 medley
win and pointed at the scoreboard. His time showed 2 minutes, 3.34
seconds, an Asian Games record. Yoshimi finished in 2:04.93, with
China's Xie Xufeng taking bronze in 2:05.45.
	   But Japan went back ahead when Tomoko Hagiwara won the women's
200-meter backstroke, and then the men's 4x100 medley team gave it
a two-gold lead.
	   China's Shan Ying added a 50-meter freestyle gold to her earlier
100 triumph, narrowing the gap to one again.
	   Shan clocked 25.88 seconds to edge compatriot Han Xue and
Japan's Sumika Minamoto.
	   But Hirano's 1,500 freestyle triumph sealed the meet.
	   The opening event gave a sixth country a chance to share in the
swim gold medals.
	   Cho Hee-yeon of South Korea was an easy winner of the women's
200-meter butterfly, clocking 2:11.34. Japan's Hitomi Kashima held
a slight advantage turning through the 100-meter mark but faded
into third in 2:13.26. China's Ruan Yi won silver.
	   Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand also finished with one gold each
in the pool.

EU looks again at duty free, stops short of reprieve
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Blair quote
 &UR; With EU-Summit
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders agreed Saturday to
look again at an impending tax-free shopping ban, but stopped short
of granting a reprieve for the perk that lets millions of travelers
snap up liquor, tobacco and other bargains.
	   They released a statement calling for a three-month study into
potential job losses by the scheduled abolition in June of
duty-free sales for travel within the 15-nation Union.
	   At a summit, the leaders held out the possibility of a ``limited
extension'' of duty-free shopping.
	   ``The door is now open (for) an extension of time on duty
free,'' said British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who led the
campaign to preserve it.
	   The EU voted unanimously in 1991 to abolish tax-free shopping,
claiming it was incompatible with the notion of a seamless EU
market.
	   The ban would only affect sales for travelers within the EU.
Those traveling to or from the Union will still be able to enjoy
tax-free shopping.
	   Blair, backed by his German and French counterparts, campaigned
to overturn the 1991 decision to scrap duty free by next summer.

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian police helped quell
anti-Israel protests on Saturday, hours before U.S. President Bill
Clinton is to arrive in the region _ a sign of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's determination to smooth the visit.
	   In Palestinian-administered Bethlehem, Palestinian protesters
stoned Israeli soldiers guarding the entrance of the city.
	   The troops _ positioned below a banner declaring ``Bill Clinton:
Welcome to Palestine'' _ responded with tear gas and rubber
bullets.
	   A few minutes before the fighting broke out, a family set up
Christmas decorations on a balcony directly above the banner.
	   Palestinian police later moved in to contain the protesters.
Clinton is to light a Christmas tree in the town believed to be
where Jesus was born on Monday.
	   The visit was meant to celebrate the U.S.-brokered agreement
achieved at Wye River in October; instead, Clinton will now try to
salvage it.
	   The Palestinians are angry that Israel refuses to release
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities and has instead
released mostly common criminals to meet its prisoner release
commitments.
	   The Israelis accuse the Palestinian Authority of being behind
the wave of violence that broke out last month over prisoner
releases.
	   Two protesters died in heavy violence on Friday. In the
Palestinian-administered town of Qalqilya on Saturday, 10,000
people attended the funeral of Kamal Adwan, 21.
	   The mourners shouted ``Revenge!'' and Adwan's father, Mansour,
beseeched them not to offer condolences: ``My son is in paradise,
he has done his duty for the homeland.''
	   The Palestinian Authority, while expressing sympathy for the
protesters, has denied any involvement _ but did not take concrete
steps to contain the violence until recent days.
	   In the militant Islamic bastion of Hebron on Saturday,
Palestinian police and security agents flooded the campus of the
Islamic University after militants said they would stage a
flag-burning anti-U.S. demonstration in time for the visit. The
demonstrators never showed.
	   Palestinians aiming their slingshots at Israeli troops in
Bethlehem said they were not opposed to the Clinton visit.
	   ``I'm protesting by throwing stones so that my brother will be
released from prison,'' said 18-year-old Khaled Dakakta, slingshot
in hand. ``This is not timed for Clinton ... but we will not stop
until they will be free.''
	   The Palestinians Prisoner's Association, which has been
coordinating some of the protests, called off a commercial West
Bank-wide strike scheduled for Monday, out of deference to Clinton.
	   The highlight of the visit will be Clinton's attendance at a
meeting of the Palestine National Council on Monday evening,
intended to abrogate clauses in the Palestinian charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from
hard-liners who may bring down his government unless he scraps Wye,
has said he will not go ahead with a planned withdrawal from
further West Bank territory unless the offending passages are
abrogated in a clear-cut vote.
	   Arafat says that ``affirmation'' is enough. Asked what that
means, he said Saturday that ``we are not in need of a vote.''
	   Although he likely has a majority behind him, Arafat may be
backing off a vote because he lacks the numbers to get the required
two-thirds quorum of the 600-member PNC to attend Monday's meeting.
	   On Saturday, 104 rejectionists said they would not attend the
meeting on principle; Israel has refused to allow some other PNC
members into Gaza.
	   In a pamphlet published Saturday, the militant Islamic group
Hamas also dismissed Clinton as ``an enemy of the Arabs'' who is
arriving to ``personally supervise in the direst way the
destruction of the Palestinian charter.''
	   Hamas warned Arafat to release its leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin,
from house arrest by Dec. 25 _ otherwise it would carry out attacks
against Israel.
	   In Bethlehem, Christmas preparations continued apace. Huge
Palestinian and U.S. flags hung over Manger Square, and locals
shopping for presents mingled with U.S. agents securing the site.
	   ``I wish that Mr. Clinton could make Netanyahu release our
prisoners and move forward with the peace process,'' said one
shopper, Georgina Khoury.
	   Douglas Dicks, from Strasburg, Virginia, snapped a photo of two
Palestinian policemen holding aloft a poster of Clinton and Arafat.
	   Dicks said he was proud to be in Bethlehem for the seasonal
celebrations this year.
	   ``I'm proud that (Clinton) is coming to make peace and push the
peace forward,'' he said. ``I think it's the right message.''

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Inge DeBruijn of the Netherlands broke
two more European records Saturday in preliminary heats of the
three-day European short-course championships.
	   She broke a third on Friday when she twice topped the European
50-meter butterfly mark.
	   DeBruijn clocked 57.93 seconds in the 100-meter butterfly,
topping the old record of 58.80 set in December 1996 by Johanna
Sjoberg.
	   DeBruijn also broke the 50-freestyle mark with a time of 24.38.
Sandra Voelker of Germany set the old mark of 24.62 in April 1997.
	   On Friday, the first day of the meet, the Dutch woman twice
shattered the European 50-butterfly record, clocking 26.54 in the
prelims and 26.09 in the final.
	   On Friday, Germans Mark Warnecke and Thomas Rupprath set the
only world records so far in the meet.
	   Warnecke won gold in a record time of 26.70 seconds in the
50-meter breaststroke, bettering his own mark of 26.97 set last
year.
	   Rupprath clocked 24.13 in winning the 50-meter backstroke,
bettering the world mark set last year by Canadian Chris Renaud
(24.25).
	   Organizers are paying 20,000 Germany marks (dlrs 12,100) for a
world record and 5,000 (dlrs 3,030) for a European record.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Thailand losing, minor bottle throwing at end &QL; 
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Ticketless soccer fans scaled fences
and hurled bottles at police, and one person was slightly hurt, as
huge crowds descended Saturday on a Bangkok stadium for a charged
Asian Games match between Qatar and host Thailand, organizers said.
	   Officials fearful of trouble urged people to watch the match on
television at home after 80,000-strong crowds converged on the
60,000-seat Rajamangala National Stadium, said Torpong Sewarmra, a
spokesman for Asian Games organizers.
	   After Qatar won the game 2-1, there was some sporadic bottle
throwing from the stands. The Thais thought Qatar had been offside
for its second goal.
	   But there were no major disturbances since Omar and Qatar both
advanced to the quarterfinals.
	   Hours before the game, a sea of people pressed toward the sports
complex.
	   Some people threw plastic bottles of water at police; others
tried clambering over stadium fences and were repelled by police,
he said. One man used a loudhailer to shout curses at police. He
was not arrested.
	   People also threw bottles, cans and shoes that members of the
crowd lost in the crush at a ticketing booth that shut down at 8
a.m., having sold out, said Nop Beaugot, who traveled 30 kilometers
(18 miles) by bus to see the match.
	   She said police came out to calm the crowd but did not make any
arrests.
	   Despite having reached the stadium at 4:30 a.m., she said she
was unable to get a ticket, even though ``there were just a few
individuals in front of me.''
	   ``I'm very upset at the organizers. They did not take the time
to explain to us why the tickets sold out so quickly,'' she said.
	   She scaled a fence to get into the sports complex, but could not
get into the stadium itself.
	   Anticipating a large crowd, police brought in an extra 1,000
police and security staff for the match, organizers said.
	   Thailand was looking for a win or draw in the second-round match
to advance to the soccer competition's knockout quarterfinals,
which start Monday.
	   Fighting erupted when Qatar and Thailand met last month in a
``friendly'' match ahead of the Asian Games. The match was
suspended after players from both sides punched, kicked and
body-slammed each other for several minutes, and several players on
both teams suffered slight injuries. Fans joined the melee,
throwing debris from the sidelines.
	   For Saturday's re-match, people began lining up for tickets at 5
a.m. The tickets went on sale three hours later and all 60,000
seats were sold out within two hours, leaving an estimated 20,000
people ticketless, Torpong said.
	   By 3 p.m., as a first match was starting between Kazakstan and
Lebanon, several thousand people were still milling around outside.
	   Police checked bags and tickets thoroughly, and used
loudspeakers to appeal for people to go home.
	   ``Police are trying not to use force but trying to negotiate
first,'' Torpong said. ``Police aren't worried because Thai people
are very friendly and everyone understands there is a limit on
seats.''
	   He said a giant television screen had been set up outside the
stadium for people to watch the match. The crowds were swollen by
people arriving for a sepak takraw match between Thailand and
Malaysia in a nearby arena, he added.
	   One person was slightly hurt in the jostling but did not require
hospital treatment, he said.

OPEC chief calls for big cut in oil production
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with conference ending, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Key Arab oil producers on Saturday called
for greater efforts to slash production or to at least stick to
earlier pledges of cuts if falling world prices are to be boosted.
	   The president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, Algerian Oil Minister Youcef Yousfi, said at least 1.5
million barrels a day should stay away from the market.
	   ``Every thing is in the hands of the producers from both inside
and outside OPEC. They should cut some 1.5 million barrel a day,
and now,'' Yousfi told reporters.
	   He was speaking after a one-day meeting of the Organization of
Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose members are Saudi Arabia,
United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Libya, Kuwait, Iraq, Algeria, Oman,
Egypt and Syria. All except the last three are OPEC members.
	   Yousfi proposed the cuts in addition to OPEC's pledge in June to
reduce its cumulative production by 2.6 million barrels a day until
June 1999. As part of that initiative, non-OPEC members are also
cutting output by 700,000 barrels a day.
	   Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Neimi said that simply honoring these
pledges alone could help solve the crisis, reinforcing widely held
view that some countries are cheating and producing beyond their
quotas.
	   ``It is not possible that the imbalance will be corrected in a
short time,'' he said.
	   The low oil prices are battering the economies of petroleum
dependent countries, especially Libya and the Gulf countries.
	   In a unilateral move to salvage the situation, Saudi Arabia and
other Gulf Arab countries on Wednesday pledged to extend the
OPEC-endorsed cuts beyond June 1999 to December, 1999.
	   Libyan Oil Minister Abdalla Salem el-Badri said OPEC has lost
dlrs 56 billion so far during the current oil price crisis caused
by a slump in demand in recession-hit Asia and warmer than usual
winters in the West.
	   This week the benchmark oil price of Brent futures fell to below
dlrs 10 a barrel, a 12-year low.
	   El-Badri had also called earlier for a production cut of 1.5
million barrels a day but the proposal has gone nowhere.
	   He and Yousfi, the OPEC president, made no mention of Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi's call on Thursday for a complete production
halt by OPEC nations during the winter.
	   Asked whether OPEC members Venezuela and Iran _ privately blamed
for overproduction _ were responsible for OPEC's lack of progress,
el-Badri replied: ``I'm not accusing anyone, but the problem
exists, and every country is affected by it.''
	   On Friday, Venezuelan President-elect Hugo Chavez reiterated
that his administration will comply fully with its promise to
reduce production by 525,000 barrels a day.
	   ``We affirm before the oil world ... that our government will
respect these agreements,'' Chavez told reporters.
	   Meanwhile, Egyptian Oil Minister Hamby El-Banbi said his country
will extend its 20,000 barrels a day production cut through the end
of 1999.
	   ``Not just to the end of 1999 but to 2000 if necessary,'' he
said.

Kjus wins downhill, ends two-year winning drought

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with quotes, details &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Olympic silver medallist Lasse Kjus
claimed the season's first downhill Saturday, bringing to an end
his two-year winning drought.
	   Twenty-fourth out of the start hut, the Norwegian took full
advantage of improving course and light conditions to storm down
the 3,129-meter (10,265-ft) classic Oreiller-Killy course with a
winning time of 1 minute, 43.20 seconds.
	   ``I generally like a later start number in the downhill,'' said
Kjus, who finished second in the downhill behind Olympic champion
Jean-Luc Cretier in Nagano last February. ``This time it really
gave me a distinct advantage.
	   ``The recent snow on the course was pushed off by the skiers
ahead of me making the surface harder,'' explained Kjus. ``The
conditions overall were much better later.''
	   The 1996 overall World Cup champion, Kjus's last victory dated
back to March 1997, when he won a downhill on home snow in
Kvitfjell, Norway.
	   ``I really wasn't expecting anything special because I'd been
through two bad seasons,'' said Kjus, who suffered from frequent
colds which kept him off the slopes until a sinus operation last
April alleviated the problem. ``I have to say this win makes me
very happy ... almost relieved.''
	   It marked the Norwegian's eighth career World Cup win, his
fourth in the downill.
	   Recording his career best result, Italy's Luca Cattaneo was
runnerup in 1:43.48. The Italian's previous best was a third place
in a super-G in Schladming, Austria, last year.
	   ``I was lucky with my start number,'' said Cattaneo, whose World
Cup ranking is too low to permit him to choose his start number.
``When I saw Lasse's time I knew the conditions were improving and
I could do well, especially after doing well in training.
	   ``Though I was lucky this time with my start number, one of my
goals this season is to rank high enough so I can choose my own.''
	   Cattaneo's teammate Erik Seletto placed third in 1:43.64 for his
first career podium finish.
	   Though home fans were left disappointed when their Olympic hero
Cretier was pushed off the podium after holding a massive lead for
the first half of the race, they were slightly consoled with a
fourth place by unheralded Antoine Deneriaz.
	   A member of France's back-up team, Deneriaz had already shown
his potential, posting the fastest time in Friday's practice
session.
	   Starting 34th, the 22-year-old confirmed his training results,
crossing fourth in 1:43.67.
	   ``This fourth place is like a win for me,'' said Deneriaz. ``I'm
really happy and it's a good start to the season. It'll give me
great confidence going into the next races in Val Gardena,
(Italy).''
	   As the conditions continued to improve, several other late
starters began slipping amongst the top-10.
	   A virtual unknown, Audun Groenvold of Norway clocked the fifth
fastest time of 1:44.17. Canada's Kevin Wert posted his career best
result, finishing sixth 1.00 back, after missing almost all of last
season due to injury.
	   Slovenia's Ales Brezavsek, whose best result was a 10th place in
the combined last year, tied for seventh with Italy's Peter
Runggaldier in 1:44.23.
	   ``When I saw my time I thought ``today I will win,'''' Kjus
said. ``But when I saw Luca Cattaneo post a time just .28 slower
than mine and the other times getting better and better, I was
worried and knew I'd have to wait until the end of the race before
being sure of victory.''
	   Seeking his first career World Cup win, Jean-Luc Cretier was
forced to settle for 12th in his first downhill on French soil
since becoming Olympic champion.
	   Tenth out of the start hut, Cretier's time of 1:44.64 held as 14
other skiers struggled with the deteriorating light conditions.
	   But as the sky began to clear up once more, Kjus took the lead
before the Frenchman was completely pushed off the podium by later
skiers.
	   Reigning World Cup downhill champion Andreas Schifferer finished
back in 29th 2.18 adrift, just ahead of teammate Hermann Maier, the
fearless skier who won two Olympic golds, the World Cup overall,
super-G and giant slalom titles last season.
	   Though the Austrians have dominated in every discipline since
the start of the season, none made it into the top-10 in Saturday's
downhill. The top Austrian skier was 22-year-old Norbert Holzknecht
who finished 15th, 1.67 back.
	   The day saw just one frightening accident when France's David
Pretot was blinded by the strobe effect of the tree-shadows on the
course, and took a spectacular fall.
	   With his left ski failing to pop off during the tumble, Pretot
injured the lateral ligament in his left ankle. Doctors have yet to
X-ray the leg for possible fractures.

Second Chinese held for murder of Chinese couple

	   LIMASSOL, Cyprus (AP) _ A second Chinese man wanted for the
murder of a young Chinese couple confessed to the crime following
his overnight arrest, police told a court Saturday.
	   A nine-day manhunt for Hua Cheng Bu, 22, ended Friday night when
he was found hiding in the boiler room of a local hospital, the
police said.
	   The Limassol District court ordered his detention for eight days
pending a full investigation into his admission of responsibility
for the double murder.
	   Another Chinese man, Wang Yiang, 21, was arrested last week and
confessed to taking part in the murder that has shocked normally
placid Cyprus. Wang implicated Hua as the mastermind.
	   Both men are registered in the college where the victims, Lou
Jian Hui and Jiang Ming Xia, both 23, were had enrolled to study
tourism two months ago.
	   Their bodies were found on Dec. 2 at the bottom of a remote
cliff in the central Troodos mountains, 30 miles (50 kilometers)
north of Limassol.
	   Police said they had been battered on the head with an iron bar
and strangled with leather thongs a day earlier. Xia had also been
sexually assaulted.
	   Limassol police chief Miltiades Neocleous said the victims had
been killed in their Limassol apartment, which had been ransacked.
He added that the motive appeared to be robbery as the culprits had
recently received dlrs 3,000 from their parents, which they were
keeping in their apartment.
	   This island nation with a population of 650,000 records less
than 10 murders a year.

President Moi warns of economic hardship, says he will intervene in
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Calling on Kenyans to buckle up for
another year of tough economics, President Daniel arap Moi said
Saturday that a worldwide slump, a foundering banking system and
corruption were contributing to Kenya's ailing economy.
	   Speaking to about 20,000 people at Nyayo Stadium in the capital
to commemorate the 35th anniversary of Kenya's Independence from
British colonial rule, Moi said regional conflicts also endangered
development.
	   In speeches in English and Kiswahili, that were read out at
government offices throughout Kenya, Moi urged warring countries in
the region to resolve their hostilities.
	   Moi said Kenya was concerned about the rebellion in the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila's forces are backed by allies
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad. Kabila demands that Rwanda and
Uganda, who back the rebels, withdraw their troops before a cease
fire is implemented.
	   Moi said he supports the call for the withdrawal of foreign
troops.
	   ``I am going to intervene to see that the people of Congo live
in peace,'' he said, without elaborating.
	   He said Ethiopia and Eritrea must bridge their differences over
a six-month border dispute, and called on the Sudanese government
and southern rebels ``to make concessions'' to end the 15-year
civil war in southern Sudan.
	   Moi said Kenya's economy was on in recovery, with interest rates
at the lowest level in three years and commercial bank lending
rates down, but bad times were still ahead.
	   Corruption in Kenya is rampant, leading the International
Monetary Fund to suspend a dlrs 220 million dollar loan and Kenya's
finance minister to say corrupt customs practices had destroyed
Kenya's economy.
	   Moi said transit cargo controls put in place will remain to
prevent untaxed transit goods from being dumped into local markets.
	   He also addressed a banking scandal exposed last month in which
dozens of prominent politicians, among them several ministers, and
businessmen were listed as owing millions of dollars to Kenyan
Banks, many of which have recently collapsed.
	   ``There is a lot of theft in government,'' Moi said. ``Those
doing it will pay for their misdeeds.''
	   However, the president insisted that the government could not be
blamed for bad banking practices and called on debtors to honor
their obligations.
	   In addition, Moi warned that the deadly AIDS virus was posing a
threat Kenyans must begin to take seriously.
	   ``You are getting finished by AIDS,'' Moi said. ``One point two
million (Kenyans) are AIDS positive.''
	   The annual Dec. 12 Jamhuri Day celebrations this year included a
military air show, cheered by the crowd, and traditional dancers
and choirs who sang Kenyan and Christmas songs.

Forensics expert says digging may be off at disputed Kosovo site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Plans to exhume Kosovo massacre
victims from a site in rebel-held territory may have to be dropped
because of Serbian police resistance, a forensics team member said
Saturday.
	   A Finnish team that tried to start work Thursday at a site in
the Drenica region was blocked by police in armored vehicles who
said the digging couldn't be carried out without their presence.
Talks between the experts and government authorities have yet to
resolve the dispute at Gornje Obrinje, team member Tino Lahelma
said.
	   ``Anything can happen, but I do think we have an impasse,''
Lahelma said. ``If this situation would persist, then Gornje
Obrinje would not be possible.''
	   Efforts will continue to carry out exhumations at five other
sites where government authorities also gave the European
Union-funded team permission to dig. ``We don't want to give up,''
he said.
	   In the latest violence in tense Kosovo, Serbian media said
ethnic Albanian gunmen killed five people Friday. Four of the dead
were reportedly ethnic Albanians loyal to the Serbian government
and one was a Serb policeman.
	   Gornje Obrinje, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Pristina, is
the site of some of the most gruesome killings stemming from
fighting between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian separatist rebels
that left hundreds dead this year.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and up to 300,000 forced
from their homes in Kosovo, a southern Serbian province with a 90
percent ethnic Albanian population, since a Yugoslav crackdown on
separatist guerrillas began in February. Serbia is the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   A makeshift collective grave on a hillside in Gornje Obrinje is
believed to contain the bodies of 22 ethnic Albanians from a single
clan, including women and children. The mutilated bodies were seen
by diplomats and journalists shortly after the slayings in a nearby
forest in September.
	   The top government official for Kosovo, Zoran Andjelkovic,
insists the Finns are not being prevented from doing their work.
	   But Lahelma said it's unrealistic for police to insist on
escorting the Finns and the Serbian legal team accompanying them to
the site in rebel-controlled territory, with tensions remaining
high despite a two-month truce.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army has said that only the Finns, not the
police, are welcome in Drenica, heartland of the guerrilla
movement.
	   ``We don't want to risk our lives'' by bringing police into a
KLA-controlled area, Lahelma said.
	   Meanwhile, relatives of Serb civilians believed to have been
abducted by rebels appealed Saturday to the U.S. head of
international peace monitors to help in their search.
	   ``Your authority with representatives of Albanians can help
solve the mystery and we could learn the truth what happened to our
loved ones,'' said the open letter sent to U.S. diplomat William
Walker. Walker heads the Kosovo Verification Mission being
assembled by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo, including some 40
from the town of Orahovac, where hundreds of people marched to a
rebel stronghold Thursday to demand information about their fate.

	   In the men's final, Thailand swept all three regus to beat
archrival Malaysia, 15-9, 15-3; 15-3, 15-5; 15-5, 15-5.
	   The Thai women topped Myanmar, 15-6, 15-13; 15-5, 15-9; 15-2,
15-4.
	   Sepak takraw is akin to volleyball, with players using their
feet to kick a rattan ball back and forth across a net.
	   The men's final was between two sides that know each other well.
They have met three times in the finals of major championships
since 1994. Malaysia defeated Thailand in the last Asian Games for
its last major victory.
	   Since then, Thailand has won, including victories by Thailand's
A and B teams in the King's Cup World Championship last September
in Bangkok, pushing the Malaysians into third.
	   Kriengkrai Mutalai, a veteran of three Asian Games and one of
the most popular Thai players, was mobbed by fans after the game.
	   ``I'm very excited, especially since it's my last games,'' said
Kriengkrai.
	   The women also celebrated after their victory.
	   Paungoi Jenkit, grabbed her young son from the stands for a
victory lap of the arena.
	   ``As I went for the last serve of the game, I thought if I win
this I will take my young son around the arena,'' Paungoi said.
	   The crowd, which had been growing noisier with each point,
erupted with screaming and cheering as the team clinched gold by
winning the second regu for an unbeatable 2-0 lead in both the
best-of-three regu finals.
	   China and Vietnam, the semifinal losers, got women's bronze.
Myanmar and Singapore took the men's bronzes.
	   Cheering, flag-waving and kazoo-playing erupted from the crowd
every time Thailand scored, and spectators joined in the wave.
	   The Thai team and spectators fed off each other, with players
gesturing to the crowd to make more noise.
	   The men's team from Myanmar, which was on the sidelines watching
and had been quite boisterous at the start, grew quieter and
quieter as their women's team edged nearer to defeat.

Opposition introduces no confidence motion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's opposition introduced a no
confidence motion in parliament, charging that since taking office
in 1996, the government has destroyed economy and slowed
privatization, an opposition lawmaker said Saturday.
	   The motion was introduced late Friday and is to be discussed and
put to vote next week, Valeriu Tabara, leader of the National Unity
Party, said by telephone.
	   Only 143 lawmakers of the 486-seat, two-chamber legislature
signed the motion, which stands no chance of passing but shows how
deeply split Romanian politicians over attempts to reform the
country's economy.
	   For the past three weeks, opposition lawmakers _ comprising the
leftist Social Democracy Party and the nationalist National Unity
and Greater Romania parties _ have boycotted parliament. They said
last week they would return if the government ``took
responsibility'' for alleged mistakes made in the last two years.
	   In Nov. 1996, the newly elected government launched an ambitious
but painful economic reform program to privatize the state sector
and a introduce a severe fiscal policy. Since then, purchasing
power and production have dropped sharply. While unemployment has
risen to 8.6 percent, the average salary has dropped to about 1.2
million lei (dlrs 120).
	   Last week, the government announced some 170,000 people lost
their jobs this year and other 70,000 jobs would be cut off over
the upcoming weeks, as 29 state money-losing companies would be
closed soon.
	   In the no confidence motion, the opposition said the government
is to be blamed for ``the most serious social and economic crisis
since (communism ended in) 1989'' and is responsible for the
dramatic drop in living standards in the past two years.
	   This would be the third no confidence vote brought against the
government, which withstood the other two without problem.

	   SURAT THANI, Thailand (AP) _ Using bare hands and bulldozers to
sift through the waters of a flooded rubber plantation, rescue
workers recovered the bodies of 100 people who perished in the
crash of a Thai Airways jetliner before suspending their search on
Saturday night.
	   Forty five survivors of flight TG261, including 12 foreign
passengers, were scattered across several local hospitals.
	   Only one passenger was still missing, police and airline
officials said as darkness fell on the airport at Surat Thani, and
they assume that person is dead.
	   Police said many of the bodies were burned beyond recognition
and so could not be identified.
	   Relatives coming to claim the bodies broke into tears at the
crowded, confused passenger terminal. There were also tearful
reunions.
	   As a steady rain pummeled them throughout the day, more than 500
rescue workers and volunteers trudged through the chilly waters
searching for bodies and possible survivors.
	   Some used special equipment to cut through what remained of the
jet's fuselage to extract more victims.
	   Battling a heavy rainstorm, Thai Airways Flight TG261, an Airbus
A310-200, plunged into the swamp at around 6:45 p.m. on Friday
about 700 meters (765 yards) from the air strip. It then burst into
flames.
	   It was the third attempt by the jetliner to land at Surat Thani,
a fishing port and travel hub for vacation resorts located 330
miles (530 kilometers) southwest of Bangkok.
	   The crash ended almost six years of safe flying for Thai
Airways. Its last fatal accident occurred on July 31, 1992, when
another Airbus slammed into a Nepal mountain killing 113 people on
board.
	   Police said the black box, or flight recorder, had been
recovered early Saturday.
	   ``We don't know yet. It's very difficult to guess, we cannot
guess, it has to be investigated,'' said Thai Airways President
Thamnoon Wanglee when asked about the cause of the crash.
	   Coffins were lined up at the airport terminal waiting to be
transported to Bangkok. Poor weather delayed landing of the
aircraft that brought relatives of the dead and survivors to Surat
Thani.
	   Most of the passengers were Thais. Of the at least 25 foreigners
on board, at least a dozen had survived, including three
Australians, three Japanese, three Germans, two Israelis and one
Briton.
	   Many of the dead were believed to have drowned in the waist-high
swamp water while trapped in the wreckage.
	   ``I pulled out about 20 dead bodies,'' said Pornsak Jaratrae,
23, who rushed to the scene from his village when he heard there
was a crash.
	   ``We had to dive into the freezing water to find bodies. It was
so difficult, I never did anything like that before,'' a soaked and
shivering Pornsak said.
	   He said volunteers initially were turned back from the site
until equipment arrived for dousing flames from the still-burning
aircraft.
	   Police said at least five children _ four boys and a girl _ were
among the hospitalized survivors.
	   Ambulances were unable to reach the crash site, leaving
four-wheel-drive vehicles to navigate the mud. Still, officials
said the water may have cushioned the aircraft's impact.
	   Flight attendant Akradej Pudemha said that as the plane shook
violently on its third attempt to land, some passengers began to
panic.
	   ``People started screaming. I told them to calm down, but some
were out of control. They wouldn't stay in their seats. They were
thrown around by the shaking of the plane and luggage was flying
everywhere,'' he said.
	   Akradej, who helped rescue 10 passengers, said most of the
survivors were seated at the front of the aircraft.
	   ``I don't remember hitting the ground, just people screaming and
being in half a plane,'' said Lucinda Rhodes, an Australian
survivor, from a hospital bed.
	   ``The aircraft split lengthwise because there was another whole
bit of it about 20 meters (yards) away but we were in a tree,'' the
24-year-old Sydney accountant said.
	   Lying in a nearby bed, Australian Melanie McNamee, said Lucinda
saved her life.
	   ``She was dragging me along because I could barely walk because
I'd fractured three ribs and also a fracture in my spine,'' Ms.
McNamee, also 24, said. ``We were running through all these swamps
just trying to get away from the airplane before it blew up.''
	   A gardener living near the crash site, Sophon Sapkong, 42, said
he heard a loud noise, came out of his home and saw ``the airplane
try to go up high. Then I saw a light, bright like the sunset,
about four stories off the ground, then a fireball falling.''
	   Airbus announced from its headquarters in Toulouse, France, that
it would send five specialists to assist Thai authorities in their
investigation.
	   Airbus said the plane was delivered in April 1986 and had
accumulated 23,000 flight hours.

EU leaders stuck on finance reform but say enlargement not in
</HEADLINE>
jeopardy
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final statement; summit details, comments

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders remained
deadlocked Saturday over the EU's future financing but told
counterparts from 11 other nations the money fight won't slow their
entry into the club.
	   The 15 EU leaders ended a two-day summit declaring ``the overall
enlargement process ... well underway.'' In a statement, they
promised to resolve the money dispute by next March.
	   After the summit, the West Europeans met with leaders from
Cyprus and 10 East European countries with which membership talks
began this fall.
	   They assured them their ambitious expansion plan remains on
track but set no entry dates. These depend on how hard the
candidates work to get themselves in shape for membership.
	   The first newcomers will not likely join until at least 2004.
	   The summit did not end a dispute over how to finance expansion.
Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark seek
a spending freeze, keeping outlays at 85 billion European currency
units (about dlrs 100 billion) in the 2000-2006 period.
	   But Spain and other southerners fear losing aid money to poorer
newcomers and want outlays at least to rise in line with economic
growth, adding some dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by 2006.
	   The leaders pledged to craft ``an appropriate financial
framework'' combining solidarity with austerity.
	   On another contentious issue, they agreed to take another look
at an impending tax-free shopping ban, but stopped short of
granting a reprieve for the perk that lets millions of travelers
snap up liquor, tobacco and other bargains.
	   Tax-free shopping for travel within the EU is due to end next
summer but France, Germany and Britain and others would like it to
continue to save jobs. Critics say there is no need for duty-free
shops in an EU without borders.
	   The leaders also recommitted themselves to fight joblessness
through ``quantified targets and deadlines,'' expanding an
employment strategy launched last year.
	   The leaders pledged to pursue a credible European defense to
ease their reliance on the United States. The impetus to that was a
declaration this month by France and Britain _ Western Europe's
only nuclear powers _ that the EU must be able to act on its own
with a ``credible military force'' within the NATO framework.
	   Complicating the money dispute is that Germany and other
northerners complain they already pay too much. German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, whose country still pays for absorbing East
Germany, made it clear Europe's enlargement problems are not going
to be solved with a German checkbook.
	   In a related issue, Prime Minister Tony Blair said he will not
give up an annual rebate Britain has been getting since 1984 for
its net payments.
	   Britain's net payment to the EU is some dlrs 8 billion, half of
which is refunded.
	   Still, Blair sided with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
telling reporters: ``It is obvious ... that enlargement will mean
additional expenditure. We entirely understand the problems Germany
has.''
	   Eighty percent of the EU's budget goes to farm subsidies and aid
for poor regions. Taking on half a dozen poor East European
countries and millions of uneconomical farmers would break the
budget unless serious reforms are undertaken.
	   ``All around the table realized the historic need to come to a
deal,'' said Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok on the expansion issue.
``If this bogs down you'll see a serious crisis situation, and that
you cannot do to people whose expectations of Europe we have
raised.''

Workers dig up 19th-century bones in Madrid parking lot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Workers building an underground parking lot
in central Madrid unearthed 20 children's skeletons and two
cannons, all from the 19th century, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Archeologists said they were baffled by the find, made at a
depth of 15 meters (50 feet.)
	   One of them, Jose Polo Lopez, speculated that the cannons -- on
wheels, with a meter-long (yard-) barrel -- had been buried by
Spanish forces fighting Napoleonic troops in what Spain's calls its
War of Independence. It lasted from 1808 to 1812.
	   The Spaniards may have dumped the weapons to keep them from
falling into enemy hands, Polo told El Pais.
	   As for the children, all of them believed to be four or younger
when they died, Polo said that until 1835 there was a hospital on
the site where today's parking lot is being built.
	   The hospital housed a morgue for children who died of epidemics
and took in wounded soldiers from the War of Independence.
	   Polo hypothesized that a group of children may have been buried
in a mass grave, and that the military used that same pit to get
rid of the cannons.
	   What's most surprising, Polo said, is that the military disposed
of the guns rather than melt them down to salvage the iron.

	   DOBBIACO, Italy (AP) _ Bjorn Daehlie picked up his 42nd career
Cross Country World Cup victory Saturday, winning a 10-kilometer
(6.2-mile) freestyle race by nearly 15 seconds.
	   The Norwegian, owner of a record eight Winter Olympics gold
medals, led throughout and finished in 22 minutes, 50.7 seconds.
Austria's Mikhail Botwinov was second in 23:05.3.
	   ``I really wanted this first win of the season,'' Daehlie said.
``It's always tough to stay No. 1 for a long time.''
	   Katerina Neumannova of the Czech Republic won the women's
5-kilometer (3.1-mile) freestyle in 12:52.1 to extend her lead in

Kenyan president warns of hardship, says he will intervene in
</HEADLINE>
Congo &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE MWANGI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Calling on Kenyans to buckle down for
another year of tough economics, President Daniel arap Moi said
Saturday that a worldwide slump, a foundering banking system and
corruption were contributing to Kenya's ailing economy.
	   Speaking to about 20,000 people at Nyayo Stadium in the capital
to commemorate the 35th anniversary of Kenya's independence from
British colonial rule, Moi said regional conflicts also endangered
development.
	   In speeches in English and Kiswahili, read out at government
offices throughout Kenya, Moi urged warring countries in the region
to resolve their hostilities.
	   Moi said Kenya was concerned about the rebellion in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, where Congolese President Laurent
Kabila's forces are backed by Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad.
Kabila demands that Rwanda and Uganda, who back the rebels,
withdraw their troops before he will agree to a cease-fire.
	   Moi said he supports the call for the withdrawal of foreign
troops.
	   ``I am going to intervene to see that the people of Congo live
in peace,'' he said without elaborating.
	   He said Ethiopia and Eritrea must bridge their differences over
a six-month border dispute, and called on the Sudanese government
and southern rebels ``to make concessions'' to end the 15-year
civil war in southern Sudan.
	   Moi said Kenya's economy was recovering, with interest rates at
the lowest level in three years and commercial lending rates down,
but bad times were still ahead.
	   Corruption in Kenya is rampant, leading the International
Monetary Fund to suspend a dlrs 220 million loan and Kenya's
finance minister to say that corrupt practices had destroyed
Kenya's economy.
	   He also addressed a banking scandal exposed last month in which
dozens of prominent politicians and businessmen were listed as
owing millions of dollars to Kenyan Banks, many of which have
recently collapsed.
	   ``There is a lot of theft in government,'' Moi said. ``Those
doing it will pay for their misdeeds.''
	   However, the president insisted that the government could not be
blamed for bad banking practices and called on debtors to honor
their obligations.
	   In addition, Moi warned that the deadly AIDS virus was posing a
threat that Kenyans must take seriously. ``You are getting finished
by AIDS,'' Moi said.
	   The annual Dec. 12 Jamhuri Day celebrations this year included a
military air show, cheered by the crowd, and traditional dancers
and choirs who sang Kenyan and Christmas songs.

Palestinians quell violence ahead of Clinton visit

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian police helped quell
anti-Israel protests on Saturday, hours before U.S. President Bill
Clinton is to arrive in the region _ a sign of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's determination to smooth the visit.
	   In Palestinian-administered Bethlehem, Palestinian protesters
stoned Israeli soldiers guarding the entrance of the city.
	   The troops _ positioned below a banner declaring ``Bill Clinton:
Welcome to Palestine'' _ responded with tear gas and rubber
bullets.
	   A few minutes before the fighting broke out, a family set up
Christmas decorations on a balcony directly above the banner.
	   Palestinian police later moved in to contain the protesters.
Clinton is to light a Christmas tree in the town believed to be
where Jesus was born on Monday.
	   The visit was meant to celebrate the U.S.-brokered agreement
achieved at Wye River in October; instead, Clinton will now try to
salvage it.
	   The Palestinians are angry that Israel refuses to release
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities and has instead
released mostly common criminals to meet its prisoner release
commitments.
	   The Israelis accuse the Palestinian Authority of being behind
the wave of violence that broke out last month over prisoner
releases.
	   Two protesters died in heavy violence on Friday. In the
Palestinian-administered town of Qalqilya on Saturday, 10,000
people attended the funeral of Kamal Adwan, 21.
	   The mourners shouted ``Revenge!'' and Adwan's father, Mansour,
beseeched them not to offer condolences: ``My son is in paradise,
he has done his duty for the homeland.''
	   The Palestinian Authority, while expressing sympathy for the
protesters, has denied any involvement _ but did not take concrete
steps to contain the violence until recent days.
	   In the militant Islamic bastion of Hebron on Saturday,
Palestinian police and security agents flooded the campus of the
Islamic University after militants said they would stage a
flag-burning anti-U.S. demonstration in time for the visit. The
demonstrators never showed.
	   Palestinians aiming their slingshots at Israeli troops in
Bethlehem said they were not opposed to the Clinton visit.
	   ``I'm protesting by throwing stones so that my brother will be
released from prison,'' said 18-year-old Khaled Dakakta, slingshot
in hand. ``This is not timed for Clinton ... but we will not stop
until they will be free.''
	   The Palestinians Prisoner's Association, which has been
coordinating some of the protests, called off a commercial West
Bank-wide strike scheduled for Monday, out of deference to Clinton.
	   The highlight of the visit will be Clinton's attendance at a
meeting of the Palestine National Council on Monday evening,
intended to abrogate clauses in the Palestinian charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from
hard-liners who may bring down his government unless he scraps Wye,
has said he will not go ahead with a planned withdrawal from
further West Bank territory unless the offending passages are
abrogated in a clear-cut vote.
	   Arafat says that ``affirmation'' is enough. Asked what that
means, he said Saturday that ``we are not in need of a vote.''
	   Although he likely has a majority behind him, Arafat may be
backing off a vote because he lacks the numbers to get the required
two-thirds quorum of the 600-member PNC to attend Monday's meeting.
	   On Saturday, 104 rejectionists said they would not attend the
meeting on principle; Israel has refused to allow some other PNC
members into Gaza.
	   Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said that there would no
assessment of whether there was a quorum.
	   Arafat, speaking after meeting Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawmeh to discuss the prisoners issue, said he had accepted a
U.S. proposal for a trilateral meeting after the PNC meet _ but
that Israel had yet to respond.
	   Netanyahu is unlikely to attend such a meeting unless he is
satisfied with the PNC results.
	   In a pamphlet published Saturday, the militant Islamic group
Hamas dismissed Clinton as ``an enemy of the Arabs'' who is
arriving to ``personally supervise in the direst way the
destruction of the Palestinian charter.''

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders remained
deadlocked Saturday over the EU's future financing but told
counterparts from 11 other nations that the money fight won't slow
their entry into the club.
	   The 15 EU leaders ended a two-day summit declaring ``the overall
enlargement process ... well underway.'' In a statement, they
promised to resolve the money dispute by March.
	   After the summit, the Western Europeans met with leaders from
Cyprus and 10 Eastern European countries with which membership
talks began this fall.
	   They assured them that their ambitious expansion plan remains on
track but set no entry dates. These depend on how well the
candidates get themselves in shape for membership.
	   The first newcomers will probably not join until at least 2004.
	   The summit did not end a dispute over how to finance expansion.
Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark seek
a spending freeze, keeping outlays at 85 billion European currency
units (about dlrs 100 billion) in the 2000-2006 period.
	   But Spain and other southerners fear losing aid money to poorer
newcomers and want outlays at least to rise in line with economic
growth, adding some dlrs 24 billion to the EU budget by 2006.
	   The leaders pledged to craft ``an appropriate financial
framework'' combining solidarity with austerity.
	   On another contentious issue, they agreed to take another look
at an impending tax-free shopping ban, but stopped short of
granting a reprieve for the perk that lets millions of travelers
snap up liquor, tobacco and other bargains.
	   Tax-free shopping for travel within the EU is due to end within
six months or so but France, Germany and Britain and others would
like it to continue to save jobs. Critics say there is no need for
duty-free shops in an EU without borders.
	   The leaders also recommitted themselves to fight joblessness
through ``quantified targets and deadlines,'' expanding an
employment strategy launched last year.
	   The leaders pledged to pursue a credible European defense to
ease their reliance on the United States. The impetus to that was a
declaration this month by France and Britain _ Western Europe's
only nuclear powers _ that the EU must be able to act on its own
with a ``credible military force'' within the NATO framework.
	   Complicating the money dispute is that Germany and other
northerners complain that they already pay too much. German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose country still pays for
absorbing East Germany, made it clear that Europe's enlargement
problems are not going to be solved with a German checkbook.
	   In a related issue, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he
will not give up an annual rebate that Britain has been getting
since 1984 for its net payments.
	   Britain's net payment to the EU is some dlrs 8 billion, half of
which is refunded.
	   Still, Blair sided with Schroeder, telling reporters: ``It is
obvious ... that enlargement will mean additional expenditure. We
entirely understand the problems Germany has.''
	   Eighty percent of the EU's budget goes to farm subsidies and aid
for poor regions. Taking on half a dozen poor Eastern European
countries and millions of uneconomical farmers would break the
budget unless serious reforms are undertaken.
	   ``All around the table realized the historic need to come to a
deal,'' said Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok on the expansion issue.
``If this bogs down you'll see a serious crisis situation, and that
you cannot do to people whose expectations of Europe we have
raised.''

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hard-line Arabs opposed to Palestinian
peace deals with Israel reaffirmed their allegiance to a
Palestinian charter that calls for Israel's destruction.
	   ``This charter was written in blood, born in blood and will be
protected with blood,'' Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla, group said.
	   He was one of the 300 participants at a conference called to
voice opposition to a historic meeting on Monday of the Palestinian
National Council to expunge anti-Israeli sections from the
Palestinian National Charter.
	   The sanitizing of the charter is in line with the Wye River
accord signed in October by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The PNC meeting in Gaza
City is expected to be attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Ramada Abdullah Shallah of Islamic Jihad told reporters that
Clinton is coming only to confirm ``the liquidation of the
Palestinian resistance ... but we tell him that, God willing, this
shall never happen.''
	   ``The people of Palestine are not a herd of sheep that revolve
around Arafat's policies,'' Nayef Hawatmeh of the Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine said.
	   Earlier, speakers at the conference called for the continuation
of armed struggle against Israel until the creation of Palestine.
	   The meeting, which brought together hard-liners from all over
the Arab world to the Youth City sports complex in Damascus, was
the largest gathering of Palestinian opposition leaders in years.
	   Nasrallah called for joining forces in an uprising against the
Jewish state and urged the implementation of the clause in the
Palestinian charter that calls for the destruction of Israel.
	   ``The Palestinian National Charter will live on as long as there
is a knife in a Palestinian woman's hand with which she stabs an
Israeli soldier or settler... as long as there are suicide bombers
in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv... and as long as there is a child who
throws a stone in the face of an Israeli soldier,'' he said.
	   Hezbollah is fighting Israeli troops in occupied south Lebanon.
	   Among the participants at the conference were leaders who figure
high on Israel's list of persons wanted for violence.
	   They include Ahmed Jibril of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, George Habash of the PFLP,
Hawatmeh of the DFLP and Shallah of Islamic Jihad.
	   Among the other militant groups taking part in the conference
were Fateh Uprising and Hamas, which carried out a series of
suicide bombings in Israel in recent years.

Iran condemns proposed change to Palestinian charter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Syria-Palestinian Conference &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran on Saturday condemned the Palestinian
leadership for agreeing to amend a charter that calls for Israel's
destruction, Iranian radio reported.
	   The move will not ``help the Palestinian issue and restore the
historical rights of the Palestinian nation,'' the radio quoted
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid-Reza Asefi as saying.
	   Iran does not recognize Israel and believes it was built on land
belonging to the Palestinians.
	   Asefi said the Palestinian decision to change its charter would
pave the way for the Jewish state to carry on ``further
expansionism and aggression inside Palestine,'' and would help
Israel ``consolidate its illegitimate foundation.''
	   The Palestinian National Council, or parliament, is scheduled to
meet on Monday to nullify those parts of the charter that deny
Israel's right to exist.
	   The amendment is in line with the Wye River accord signed in
October by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The PNC meeting in Gaza City is
expected to be attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton.

Low caste Hindus in Indian city threaten to embrace Islam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KANPUR, India (AP) _ A plan to evict low caste Hindu squatters
from government property has triggered inter religious tensions in
a northern Indian town following threats by the squatters that they
will embrace Islam if they are removed from their homes.
	   The group of 2,500 low caste Hindus, who have formed an
organization, say that as the Hindu nationalist government in power
has no plans to evict Muslim residents from a neighboring slum
built on government land, they will convert to Islam to stall the
eviction. They live in a slum along a railway track in the heart of
Kanpur town, 390 kilometers (240 miles) southeast of the Indian
capital New Delhi.
	   ``All 2,500 of us, women, children and the aged, will convert to
Islam on January 1 next. Ours is a purely retaliatory move against
the local government which is discriminating against us by favoring
our Muslim neighbors,'' said Anil Brahma, president of the
Ambedkarvadi Joint Morcha, named after a prominent low caste leader
who wrote the Indian constitution.
	   The city government has denied any discrimination and says
eviction notices will be sent to the Muslim settlers soon.
	   The threat of conversion has sparked protests in the ruling
Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which governs Uttar
Pradesh state where Kanpur is located, and other Hindu
organizations. Local BJP leaders say the conversion plan is a ploy
of Muslim leaders in the area who have offered protection to the
Hindus if they convert.
	   ``We suspect foul play by Muslim clerics. The conversions must
be stopped,'' said Sadakant Misra, a BJP activist in Kanpur.
	   But the Hindus say they will not be deterred by the protests.
	   ``We have been discriminated against for too long. There is no
point in us remaining Hindus and it is better for us to convert to
Islam,'' said Brahma.
	   Low caste Hindus, also called Dalits, are at the lowest rung of
Hindu society. Traditionally they are looked down upon and are
considered social pariahs. Every now and then, Dalits convert to
other religions like Islam, Christianity and Buddhism in the hope
of receiving equal treatment in the new faith.
	   Local Muslim priests say any conversion will have to be for
ideological and religious reasons and not for material gain.
	   ``There cannot be any precondition for embracing Islam and if
some Muslim leaders have assured them of protection against the
eviction drive after their conversion, it is wrong,'' said Maulana
Abdus Sami, the head cleric of Kanpur.
	   Authorities fear the sparring between Hindus and Muslims could
result in violence and have put police on alert. They are also
talking to members of both communities to diffuse the situation.

Athletes who lost to doped swimmers will miss out on medals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
rejected a bid Saturday to give U.S. and British Olympic swimmers
the medals of East Germans later discredited for taking
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   But Director-General Francois Carrard said the IOC would look
for other ways to recognize the female swimmers who lost to the
East Germans in 1976 and 1980.
	   The IOC Juridical Committee found that it would ``create a lot
of new juridical problems'' if it were to reallocate or withdraw
the medals, change results and redetermine rankings, Carrard said.
	   The panel said a complaint from the U.S. and British Olympic
associations could have caused revisions back as far as the 1976
Montreal Olympics.
	   ``From a legal standpoint, nothing can or will be done, but the
IOC executive board has appointed the four vice presidents to study
further both matters and to determine whether some other form of
solutions in terms of recognition can be found,'' added Carrard.
	   ``Do we have the right to withdraw? These swimmers under the
conditions then prevailing didn't test positive. The juridical
commission thinks this isn't a legal matter, but the matter isn't
closed.''
	   Recent studies have revealed that between 6,000 and 10,000
athletes were covered by systematic doping program that operated in
the former East Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Six former East German doctors and coaches have been convicted
this year on charges of administering steroids to young swimmers
without their knowledge.
	   The U.S. Olympic Committee is seeking ``appropriate medal
recognition'' for swimmers Linda Jezek, Lauri Siering, Camile
Wright and Shirley Babashoff, who lost out to the East Germans in
the women's medley relay at Montreal.
	   The British Olympic Association has filed a petition on behalf
of Sharron Davies, who won the silver medal in the 400-meter
individual medley at the 1980 Moscow games.

Bahrain accepts credentials from new Iranian ambassador
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Bahrain on Saturday officially welcomed
the new Iranian ambassador, formally sealing the normalization of
ties between the two Gulf neighbors after more than two years.
	   Foreign Minister Sheik Mohammed bin Mubarak Al Khalifa received
the credentials of Iranian Ambassador Mohammed Jalal Firouznia, the
official Gulf News Agency said without elaborating.
	   Ties between the two countries were strained in July 1996 when
Bahrain accused Iran of orchestrating a coup plot by Shiite Muslims
to topple the island's ruling family, a member of the mainstream
Sunni sect of Islam.
	   Bahrain recalled its ambassador in protest, and Iran did the
same while denying a hand in the alleged plot.
	   Sheik Mohammed bin Mubarak Al Khalifa said earlier that ties
improved following the unscheduled visit by Iran's former
president, Ali Rafsanjani, to Bahrain in March.
	   Last September, Sheik Mohammed said the two countries would
exchange ambassador soon.
	   Iran, the world's only Shiite-governed nation, styles itself as
the protector of the sect the world over.
	   In Bahrain, Shiites form a slight majority among the island's
400,000 people. Shiites have been waging a campaign of violence
since December 1994 for political and social reforms. More than 40
people have been reportedly killed in the unrest.

EU seeks compromise on trade talks with South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from EU negotiator, Portuguese prime
minister
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ On an appeal from President Nelson
Mandela, European Union leaders endorsed a compromise Saturday to
resolve a dispute over wine labels threatening to derail a sweeping
trade deal with South Africa.
	   Four years of tortuous negotiations have left the EU and South
Africa close to a market-opening agreement that would phase out
duties on 90 percent of their dlrs 19 billion-a-year two-way trade.
	   But efforts to finalize the deal are snagged on Spanish and
Portuguese insistence that South African vintners stop calling
their fortified wines sherry or port.
	   The EU's chief negotiator Philip Lowe said the Union would allow
South Africa to continue using the names in domestic and regional
markets for at least 13 years, pending a review. The EU also
offered to let in more South African wine imports.
	   In return, the EU seeks a pledge that South Africa recognize in
principle that port and sherry are exclusively European terms.
	   Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said he hoped the
latest offer could still lead to a deal by the year's end. ``With
good will all round we can reach an agreement,'' he said.

Cairo court sentences three brothers to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A Cairo criminal court on Saturday sentenced
three brothers to death for killing a teen-ager with daggers and
machetes then licking his blood in front of bystanders, court
sources said.
	   Reading out the verdict during a five-minute session at the
Criminal Court, Judge Wasfy Nashed said the three men deserved the
severest punishment ``but the law does not have a stronger
punishment than a death sentence.''
	   In Egypt, the verdict and sentencing are announced
simultaneously. Executions are usually by hanging.
	   It was not clear if the three men plan to appeal.
	   The brothers, Omar, Abu Bakr and Osman el-Sayed, stabbed to
death 19-year old Khaled Mohammed on a street in a poor Cairo
neighborhood in June 1997.
	   Then they cut his flesh with daggers and machetes and licked the
blood from his body while threatening stunned bystanders with the
same fate.
	   Police said the brothers, who were wanted for several other
unspecified crimes, were seeking revenge against Mohammed whose
father had reported their two other brothers to police for robbing
his apartment.
	   Their sister, the only family member to attend Saturday's court
session, wailed after the death sentences were announced, court
officials said. They spoke on customary condition of anonymity.

Fighting in southern town claims 20 lives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Fighting erupted Saturday between
rival clans in Somalia's key southern port of Kismayo, and
unconfirmed reports from the town said as many as 20 people were
killed and 40 wounded.
	   The battles between forces loyal to Gen. Mohamed Said Hirsi of
the Majerten clan and those led by Gen. Ahmed Warsameh of the
Marehan clan, erupted on the outskirts of Kismayo, with artillery
and light weapons exchanges, according to an official in Mogadishu
and witness reports.
	   Clashes between the rival militias had flared in November, but
had subsided for several weeks.
	   Witnesses, reached by VHF radio, said businesses remained closed
after shelling reached downtown Kismayo.
	   A Marehan spokesman in Mogadishu, Ibrahim Jama Howleh, told
reporters Saturday that forces loyal to Hirsi _ better known as
Morgan _ who controls Kismayo, had begun the offensive Saturday by
shelling Marehan militia bases just outside the town.
	   Howleh said the Marehan forces, who are backed by warlord
Hussein Mohamed Aidid, repelled the attack, siezing 21 prisoners,
80 assault rifles and three gun-mounted pickup trucks, known as
battle wagons. A fourth battle wagon was neutralized, he said.
	   Morgan supporters in Kismayo gave a contradictory account of
events, saying his forces had emerged victorious Saturday, pushing
the Marehan forces to the village of Gobwein, about 9 kilometers (6
miles) north of Kismayo.
	   Somalia has lacked a central government since the ouster of
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Rival clan-based militia have
since divided the country into armed fiefdoms.
	   Aidid's late father, Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid, took control of
Kismayo at the beginning of 1992.
	   Forces led by Morgan captured the port in 1993 but have failed
to gain control of the hinterland beyond.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A French U.N. official kidnapped in southern
Russia more than 10 months ago was set free today and flown to
Moscow, Russian news reports said.
	   Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the regional office of the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees in North Ossetia, was seized by
three masked gunmen in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz on Jan.
29.
	   Cochetel was freed in an operation conducted by the Russian
Interior Ministry and the regional security forces of the north
Caucasus, Russian news agencies said. Two security officers were
slightly injured during the mission, the reports said.
	   Cochetel was flown aboard a chartered jet to Moscow, where he
was greeted at the airport by French Ambassador Hubert Colin de
Verdiere and U.N. officials. He was scheduled to be flown later to
Geneva aboard a special plane, NTV television reported.
	   Speaking briefly to reporters, Cochetel thanked President Boris
Yeltsin and other officials who made his release possible. ``It is
the first time people have risked their lives for me,'' he said,
appearing tired, but in good health.
	   It was unclear where Cochetel was held, in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya or in North Ossetia. ``He was liberated on the
border,'' Alexander Dzasokhov, the president of North Ossetia, told
NTV television.
	   French President Jacques Chirac spoke to Yeltsin by telephone
and thanked him for Russia's part in freeing Cochetel, the Kremlin
press service said.
	   His release came four days after the severed heads of four
foreign hostages were found in Chechnya when a government rescue
attempt apparently went wrong. Chechen security forces are still
searching for the men's bodies.
	   Chechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating the killings
and was apparently kidnapped Thursday, was also released today,
Interfax said.
	   Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to
Chechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news
reports said.
	   Tagirov was investigating the deaths Britons Peter Kennedy,
Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand.
They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   Their heads were found Tuesday on a highway about 25 miles west
of Grozny.
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are
mostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held
captive.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hard-line Arabs opposed to Palestinian
peace deals with Israel reaffirmed their allegiance Saturday to a
Palestinian charter that calls for Israel's destruction.
	   ``This charter was written in blood, born in blood and will be
protected with blood,'' said Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla group, which is fighting Israeli
troops in occupied south Lebanon.
	   He was one of the 300 participants at a conference called to
voice opposition to a historic meeting on Monday of the Palestinian
National Council to expunge anti-Israeli sections from the
Palestinian National Charter.
	   The sanitizing of the charter is in line with the Wye River
accord signed in October by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The PNC meeting in Gaza
City was expected to be attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Ramada Abdullah Shallah of Islamic Jihad told reporters that
Clinton is coming only to confirm ``the liquidation of the
Palestinian resistance ... but we tell him that, God willing, this
shall never happen.''
	   ``The people of Palestine are not a herd of sheep that revolve
around Arafat's policies,'' said Nayef Hawatmeh of the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
	   Earlier, speakers at the conference called for the continuation
of armed struggle against Israel until a Palestinian state is
created.
	   The meeting, which brought hard-liners from all over the Arab
world to the Youth City sports complex in Damascus, was the largest
gathering of Palestinian opposition leaders in years.
	   Nasrallah called for joining forces in an uprising against the
Jewish state and urged the implementation of the clause in the
Palestinian charter that calls for the destruction of Israel.
	   ``The Palestinian National Charter will live on as long as there
is a knife in a Palestinian woman's hand with which she stabs an
Israeli soldier or settler ... as long as there are suicide bombers
in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv ... and as long as there is a child who
throws a stone in the face of an Israeli soldier,'' he said.
	   Among the participants at the conference were leaders who figure
high on Israel's list of persons wanted for violence.
	   They include Ahmed Jibril of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, George Habash of the PFLP,
Hawatmeh of the DFLP and Shallah of Islamic Jihad.
	   Among the other militant groups taking part in the conference
were Fateh Uprising and Hamas, which has carried out a series of
suicide bombings in Israel in recent years.

Langen's hot streak in bob continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALTENBERG, Germany (AP) _ Christoph Langen's dominance in
bobsledding remained unbroken Saturday at the World Cup races as
the Olympic champion led a German sweep in the four-man event.
	   The German pilot, who guided the winning doubles sled Friday,
has captured the last four World Cup races. He opened the season
with two second place finishes at Calgary.
	   ``I don't know how long this will go on _ the distances between
the other teams are very small. I'm just thinking from race to
race,'' Langen said.
	   Langen and his team of Sven Ruehr, Marco Jakobs and Thomas
Platzer won the race in a combined time of one minute, 51.72
seconds in temperatures slightly above freezing.
	   Harald Czudaj piloted the second-place sled in 1:52.02 on his
home course and Calgary winner Andre Lange the third in 1:52.21.
	   Langen roared to the best time in both heats, topping his first
run of 55.88 seconds by .04 seconds on the sled's second run.
	   ``The second heat was a little off, but the good time is thanks
to the material experts that work on my sled,'' said Langen.
	   The Germans, with Langen at the top, also hold the top three
places in the four-man bob overall standings after three of seven
World Cup races.
	   Canada's Pierre Lueders, Olympic champion in doubles who beat
Langen at Calgary in his event, guided the 10th-place team in
1:53.21. On the sled were Kent Leblanc, Matt Hindle and Ben Hindle.
	   The top Americans were the ninth place team of Brian Shimer,
Paul Wise, Paul Jovanovic and Mike Kohn, whose combined time was
1:53.05.

Acquitted Mikhailov sent back to Russia, officials say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A wealthy Russian businessman and alleged mafia
boss has been sent back to Russia less than a day after he was
acquitted of charges that he belonged to a criminal organization,
officials said.
	   Pascal Di Camillo, Geneva police spokesman, said Mikhailov was
sent back to Moscow Saturday afternoon on the instruction of Swiss
officials. Mikailov's lawyer Pascal Maurer said it was a ``covert
explusion.''
	   Citing insufficient evidence, a Swiss court on Friday cleared
Sergei Mikhailov, who had been jailed in Switzerland for two years,
of the criminal organization charge.
	   Mikhailov, 40, was also cleared of charges that he forged
documents, but he was found guilty of a lesser charge _ that he
violated strict Swiss property laws restricting foreign ownership
by buying a villa near Geneva.
	   The judge and jury took into consideration the fact he had spent
two years in custody and so imposed no sentence.
	   The surprise outcome was a blow to Geneva prosecutors, who had
said that Mikhailov posed a threat to western society and should be
jailed. He had faced a maximum 7 1/2 years in jail if found guilty.
	   The prosecution said Mikhailov is the leader of the Russian
Solntsevskaya mafia organization.
	   He was arrested in Switzerland in 1996 on charges that included
the more serious one of money laundering. That was dropped because
of the problems of gathering evidence in Russia.
	   He consistently protested his innocence, although conceded that
he was ``very, very rich.''
	   The trial lasted two weeks under unprecedented security, with
some of the 90 witnesses under police protection. Those most at
risk were allowed to testify by video from an adjacent room to
protect their identity.
	   Mikhailov was brought to the court each day in a bulletproof
vest and armored vehicle.

Athletes who lost to doped swimmers will miss out on medals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
rejected a bid Saturday to give U.S. and British Olympic swimmers
the medals of East Germans later discredited for taking
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   But Director-General Francois Carrard said the IOC would look
for other ways to recognize the female swimmers who lost to the
East Germans in 1976 and 1980.
	   The IOC Juridical Committee found that it would ``create a lot
of new juridical problems'' if it were to reallocate or withdraw
the medals, change results and redetermine rankings, Carrard said.
	   The panel said a complaint from the U.S. and British Olympic
associations could have caused revisions back as far as the 1976
Montreal Olympics.
	   ``From a legal standpoint, nothing can or will be done, but the
IOC executive board has appointed the four vice presidents to study
further both matters and to determine whether some other form of
solutions in terms of recognition can be found,'' added Carrard.
	   ``Do we have the right to withdraw? These swimmers under the
conditions then prevailing didn't test positive. The juridical
commission thinks this isn't a legal matter, but the matter isn't
closed.''
	   Recent studies have revealed that between 6,000 and 10,000
athletes were covered by systematic doping program that operated in
the former East Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Six former East German doctors and coaches have been convicted
this year on charges of administering steroids to young swimmers
without their knowledge.
	   The U.S. Olympic Committee is seeking ``appropriate medal
recognition'' for swimmers Linda Jezek, Lauri Siering, Camile
Wright and Shirley Babashoff, who lost out to the East Germans in
the women's medley relay at Montreal.
	   The British Olympic Association has filed a petition on behalf
of Sharron Davies, who won the silver medal in the 400-meter
individual medley at the 1980 Moscow games.

Japan prepares to nationalize ailing bank

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese financial authorities gave an ailing major
bank until Sunday to place itself under government control _ or
face forced nationalization, a bank official said.
	   The Financial Supervisory Agency has judged Nippon Credit Bank
Ltd. to be insolvent due to at least 3.2 trillion yen (dlrs 27
billion) in unrecoverable or risky loans and massive losses on the
stock market, a bank official said Saturday.
	   The agency, which oversees Japan's finance industry, formally
asked bank President Shigeoki Togo to place Nippon Credit under
government control by midday Sunday, said the official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   If the bank rejects the request, Nippon Credit will likely be
taken over on the orders of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi under new
financial reform legislation passed in October, media reports said.
	   Nippon Credit would be the second big Japanese bank to be
nationalized in three months, following the takeover of the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. in October.
	   Nippon Credit's demise is seen as a defeat for once powerful the
Ministry of Finance, which tried to engineer a bailout by pressing
other banks to inject new capital into the failing lender.
	   The ministry is now widely blamed for letting Nippon Credit and
Japan's other large banks get into trouble by pouring money into
the over-inflated land market of the 1980s. The market's collapse
left Japanese banks with an estimated one trillion dollars in
soured loans, which they still struggle to write off.
	   The government plans to use public money to keep the
nationalized banks operating and write off their bad debt while it
seeks private sector buyers for the institutions' viable
operations.
	   Government takeover of Nippon Credit was widely expected after
merger talks collapsed between the bank and a suitor, Chuo Trust
and Banking Co. Chuo Trust's name has emerged as the most likely
buyer for Nippon Credit's healthy operations.
	   Britain's Gartmore Investment Management PLC will take over NCG
Investment Trust Management Co., its joint venture with the
collapsing bank, Kyodo reported.
	   NCG spokesman Tetsuo Kubo said Gartmore will protect NCG clients
from losses but hasn't decided to take over the joint venture.
	   After meeting financial authorities at the Prime Minister's
Office, bank President Togo called an emergency board meeting to
discuss the government's request.
	   A bank spokesman said the meeting focused on ways to prevent the
nationalization from damaging corporate and individual customers
when business resumed Monday. He denied Kyodo report that the bank
executives have decided to voluntarily accept nationalization.
	   Bank executives who oppose the nationalization argued that the
Financial Supervisory Agency's bad loan assessment standards are
too strict to be justified, Kyodo reported.
	   Executives may also be resisting a government takeover because
the law requires the top management of a nationalized bank to
resign.
	   Nippon Credit, with 2,000 employees, was among the world's top
50 banks in 1997, according to Fortune magazine, with assets
totaling 12.3 trillion yen (dlrs 106 billion).
	   Nippon Credit is one of Japan's three so-called long-term credit
banks, designed to finance the rebuilding of Japanese industry
after World War II by providing companies with long-term, low-cost
loans. But they have failed to find a new role as deregulation of
the financial industry has allowed more companies to raise money
directly from financial markets.
	   Under its restructuring efforts over the past two years, Nippon
Credit withdrew from overseas operations, slashed employees and
their salaries and received financial support from the Bank of
Japan and other commercial banks. It announced a broad alliance
with bankers Trust of the United States last year.

Fighting in southern town claims 20 lives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Fighting erupted Saturday between
rival clans in Somalia's key southern port of Kismayo, and
unconfirmed reports from the town said as many as 20 people were
killed and 40 wounded.
	   The battles between forces loyal to Gen. Mohamed Said Hirsi of
the Majerten clan and those led by Gen. Ahmed Warsameh of the
Marehan clan, erupted on the outskirts of Kismayo, with artillery
and light weapons exchanges, according to an official in Mogadishu
and witness reports.
	   Clashes between the rival militias had flared in November, but
had subsided for several weeks.
	   Witnesses, reached by VHF radio, said businesses remained closed
after shelling reached downtown Kismayo.
	   A Marehan spokesman in Mogadishu, Ibrahim Jama Howleh, told
reporters Saturday that forces loyal to Hirsi _ better known as
Morgan _ who controls Kismayo, had begun the offensive Saturday by
shelling Marehan militia bases just outside the town.
	   Howleh said the Marehan forces, who are backed by warlord
Hussein Mohamed Aidid, repelled the attack, siezing 21 prisoners,
80 assault rifles and three gun-mounted pickup trucks, known as
battle wagons. A fourth battle wagon was neutralized, he said.
	   Morgan supporters in Kismayo gave a contradictory account of
events, saying his forces had emerged victorious Saturday, pushing
the Marehan forces to the village of Gobwein, about 9 kilometers (6
miles) north of Kismayo.
	   Somalia has lacked a central government since the ouster of
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Rival clan-based militia have
since divided the country into armed fiefdoms.
	   Aidid's late father, Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid, took control of
Kismayo at the beginning of 1992.
	   Forces led by Morgan captured the port in 1993 but have failed
to gain control of the hinterland beyond.

Germany's environmentalist Greens elect new party leadership duo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ The environmentalist Greens on Saturday
set a new first in German politics, electing two women as its
leadership duo at a party convention in Leipzig.
	   Gunda Roestel, 36, and a party leader since 1996, was reelected
with 537 votes, 72 against and 31 abstentions by the 640 delegates
present.
	   Antje Radcke, 38, received 479 votes, with 98 against and 63
abstentions to become Roestel's new party ``spokesperson'' partner,

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Furious villagers in northern
Bangladesh Saturday hacked to death 11 activists of an outlawed
Communist group who attacked their village and killed a prominent
member of their community, police said.
	   Police officer Choudhury Abdul Halim said 17 men attacked and
killed Zakir Hossain while he was eating his breakfast in at
Rajshahi village, 190 kilometers (120 miles) northwest of the
national capital, Dhaka.
	   This infuriated the villagers who chased the attackers heavily
outnumbering them. The communists tried to escape by crossing a
nearby river, but the villagers caught them and attacked them with
knives.
	   Eight of them died on the spot and three died on the way to the
hospital. Six of the outlaws managed to escape, witnesses said.

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian police helped quell
anti-Israel protests on Saturday, hours before U.S. President Bill
Clinton is to arrive in the region _ a sign of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's determination to smooth the visit.
	   In Palestinian-administered Bethlehem, Palestinian protesters
stoned Israeli soldiers guarding the entrance of the city.
	   The troops _ positioned below a Palestinian banner declaring
``Bill Clinton: Welcome to Palestine'' _ responded with tear gas
and rubber bullets. The Palestinians see President Clinton's visit
as a mark of recognition for the independent state which they
intend to declare in the coming year.
	   A few minutes before the fighting broke out, a family set up
Christmas decorations on a balcony directly above the banner.
	   Palestinian police later moved in to contain the protesters.
Clinton is to light a Christmas tree in the town believed to be
where Jesus was born on Monday.
	   The visit was meant to celebrate the U.S.-brokered agreement
achieved at Wye River in October; instead, Clinton will now try to
salvage it.
	   The Palestinians are angry that Israel refuses to release
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities and has instead
released mostly common criminals to meet its prisoner release
commitments.
	   The Israelis accuse the Palestinian Authority of being behind
the wave of violence that broke out last month over prisoner
releases.
	   Two Palestinian protesters killed in clashes Friday in the
Palestinian-administered town of Qalqilya were buried Sunday.
	   Mohammed Amer, 18, was buried at his home village of Qibebah.
About 500 mourners attended the funeral.
	   Approximately 10,000 people attended the funeral of Kamal Adwan,
21, in Qalqilya.
	   The mourners shouted ``Revenge!'' and Adwan's father, Mansour,
beseeched them not to offer condolences: ``My son is in paradise,
he has done his duty for the homeland.''

Japan wins Asian Games swim meet

 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from China head coach, details &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's swim team, humiliated by the
steroid-fueled Chinese four years ago, surpassed the world swim
power as champion of Asia on Saturday.
	   Japan beat a Chinese team without several top stars 15-13 in the
gold medal count, bouncing back from a 23-5 trouncing in Hiroshima
in 1994.
	   But China's head coach Zhang Xiong refused to see the dark side,
and even refused to accept defeat.
	   ``I don't see this as a loss,'' Zhang protested. ``Taking two
less golds than Japan is not a loss.''
	   He said Japan was weaker than he expected while ``we were a
little better than we figured.''
	   Despite Zhang's optimism, Masato Hirano sealed Japan's victory
with a win in the 1,500-meter freestyle, the last of 32 events.
	   Not even a gold from former drug offender Xiong Guoming, who won
four golds in 1994 before he and six other Chinese swimmers were
banned for positive tests, could stem the Japanese tide.
	   Before Saturday's final session, leading Chinese coach Han
Mingyan admitted he had underestimated the Japanese, even if the
view was not shared by Zhang.
	   Han coaches world 400 medley record-holder and dual world
champion Chen Yan, who failed to get a gold and was hit by a
stomach ailment. Han suggested that poor preparation was the reason
for China's failure to win the gold count.
	   ``We have underestimated our Japanese rivals, and they are
stronger than expected,'' said Han. ``I introduced a rather
conservative training method for Chen in preparation for the games.
I thought we didn't have to push too hard. We will never let this
happen again.''
	   Japan's Mai Nakamura, second in the 200-meter backstroke
Saturday, said the team had worked hard to face China at this meet
following the disaster in 1994.
	   ``This time we set the goal of beating China and we've achieved
the goal,'' Nakamura said.
	   Xiong, one of the main figures in China's worst drugs scandal,
was back in winning form Saturday. He joined teammate Fu Yong in
returning to the games with a gold medal after a positive test at
Hiroshima, and helped China briefly level the gold standings at
12-12 through 26 events.
	   After a poor start to the meet, including a night with no golds,
Chinese officials marshaled their troops into the stands, where
they stood Friday and Saturday waving tiny red flags and cheering
their teammates.
	   Xiong turned and waved to his compatriots after his 200 medley
win and pointed at the scoreboard. His time showed 2 minutes, 3.34
seconds, an Asian Games record. Yoshimi finished in 2:04.93, with
China's Xie Xufeng taking bronze in 2:05.45.
	   But Japan went back ahead when Tomoko Hagiwara won the women's
200 backstroke, and then the men's 4x100 medley team gave it a
two-gold lead.
	   China's Shan Ying added a 50 freestyle gold to her earlier 100
triumph, narrowing the gap to one again.
	   Shan clocked 25.88 seconds to edge compatriot Han Xue and
Japan's Sumika Minamoto.
	   But Hirano's 1,500 freestyle triumph sealed the meet.
	   The opening event gave a sixth country a chance to share in the
swim gold medals.
	   Cho Hee-yeon of South Korea was an easy winner of the women's
200-meter butterfly, clocking 2:11.34. Japan's Hitomi Kashima held
a slight advantage turning through the 100-meter mark but faded
into third in 2:13.26. China's Ruan Yi won silver.
	   Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand also finished with one gold each
in the pool.

	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon Saturday, firing missiles and
bullets, Lebanese security officials said.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties. There was also no
word on what prompted the attack.
	   The officials said two Israeli planes struck suspected positions
of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group in the hills northeast of the
Israeli-occupied zone at 12:40 p.m. (1040 GMT).
	   The jets fired two rockets and strafed the Jabal al-Rafih
mountain, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the occupied zone, said
the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Nearly two hours later, two Israeli warplanes flew low over
suspected Hezbollah bases in the western Bekaa Valley, but they did
not attack, officials said.
	   Anti-aircraft guns of the Lebanese army and Hezbollah fired at
the jets but missed, the officials added.
	   On Thursday, Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier over
Beirut for a second day, prompting Lebanon to seek U.N. help in
ending what the local media called the ``sonic bombardment'' of the
Lebanese capital.
	   Eight supersonic booms caused by low-flying jets rattled windows
of apartment buildings in Beirut and sent panicky residents
scurrying for cover.
	   The Israeli flights over Beirut came amid Israeli threats to hit
Lebanese power plants to retaliate for Hezbollah attacks that
killed seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon last month.
	   The Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is fighting to
oust the 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese
militiamen of the South Lebanon Army from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the 440-square-mile (1,100-square-kilometer) zone
in 1985 to shield its northern towns from cross-border guerrilla
attacks.

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan
accused the government Saturday of political harassment after his
wife's shipment of tiles was confiscated by Pakistani customs
authority.
	   British-born Jemima Khan, the daughter of the late British
millionaire businessman James Goldsmith, was sending 300 tiles to
her mother in London when the package was seized by the customs
authorities earlier this week, Pakistani officials said.
	   The tiles will be examined by Pakistan's archeological experts
to determine whether they are antiques, said Shahid Rahim, a
customs official.
	   Exporting antiques from Pakistan is illegal and carries a fine
or jail sentence or both.
	   ''The Customs do not have expertise to check whether they are
antiques,'' Rahim said. ``We will send them to the archeological
department to confirm this.''
	   Khan's political party, called the Movement for Justice, has
been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
	   Party spokesman Raja Waqarullah Khan said that Ms. Khan bought
the tiles for 30,320 rupees (dlrs 650) at a store in Islamabad.
	   ''It is harassment of political opponents by the government. . .
Jemima has no connection with any smuggler,'' said Khan. ''Jemima
has a receipt for the purchase and has already paid duty.''

Japan prepares to nationalize ailing bank

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese financial authorities gave an ailing major
bank until Sunday to place itself under government control _ or
face forced nationalization, a bank official said.
	   The Financial Supervisory Agency has judged Nippon Credit Bank
Ltd. to be insolvent due to at least 3.2 trillion yen (dlrs 27
billion) in unrecoverable or risky loans and massive losses on the
stock market, a bank official said Saturday.
	   The agency, which oversees Japan's finance industry, formally
asked bank President Shigeoki Togo to agree to place Nippon Credit
under government control by midday Sunday, said the official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   If the bank rejects the request, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
will likely order its takeover Sunday using new financial reform
legislation passed in October, media reports said.
	   Nippon Credit would be the second big Japanese bank to be
nationalized in three months, following the takeover of the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. in October.
	   Nippon Credit's demise is seen as a defeat for once powerful the
Ministry of Finance, which tried to engineer a bailout by pressing
other banks to inject new capital into the failing lender.
	   The ministry is now widely blamed for letting Nippon Credit and
Japan's other large banks get into trouble by pouring money into
the over-inflated land market of the 1980s. The market's collapse
left Japanese banks with an estimated one trillion dollars in
soured loans, which they still struggle to write off.
	   The government plans to use public money to keep the
nationalized banks operating and write off their bad debt while it
seeks private sector buyers for the institutions' viable
operations.
	   Government takeover of Nippon Credit was widely expected after
merger talks collapsed between the bank and a suitor, Chuo Trust
and Banking Co. Chuo Trust's name has emerged as the most likely
buyer for Nippon Credit's healthy operations.
	   Britain's Gartmore Investment Management PLC will take over NCG
Investment Trust Management Co., its joint venture with the
collapsing bank, Kyodo reported.
	   NCG spokesman Tetsuo Kubo said Gartmore will protect NCG clients
from losses but hasn't decided to take over the joint venture.
	   After meeting financial authorities at the Prime Minister's
Office, bank President Togo called an emergency board meeting to
discuss the government's request.
	   A bank spokesman said the meeting focused on ways to prevent the
nationalization from damaging corporate and individual customers
when business resumed Monday. He denied Kyodo report that the bank
executives have decided to voluntarily accept nationalization.
	   Bank executives who oppose the nationalization argued that the
Financial Supervisory Agency's bad loan assessment standards are
too strict to be justified, Kyodo reported.
	   Executives may also be resisting a government takeover because
the law requires the top management of a nationalized bank to

	   Nippon Credit, with 2,000 employees, was among the world's top
50 banks in 1997, according to Fortune magazine, with assets
totaling 12.3 trillion yen (dlrs 106 billion).
	   Nippon Credit is one of Japan's three so-called long-term credit
banks, designed to finance the rebuilding of Japanese industry
after World War II by providing companies with long-term, low-cost
loans. But they have failed to find a new role as deregulation of
the financial industry has allowed more companies to raise money
directly from financial markets.
	   Under its restructuring efforts over the past two years, Nippon
Credit withdrew from overseas operations, slashed employees and
their salaries and received financial support from the Bank of
Japan and other commercial banks. It announced a broad alliance
with bankers Trust of the United States last year.

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian police helped quell
anti-Israel protests on Saturday, hours before U.S. President Bill
Clinton was to arrive in the region _ a sign of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's determination to smooth the visit.
	   In Palestinian-administered Bethlehem, Palestinian protesters
stoned Israeli soldiers guarding the entrance to the city.
	   The troops _ positioned below a banner declaring ``Bill Clinton:
Welcome to Palestine'' _ responded with tear gas and rubber
bullets. The Palestinians see Clinton's visit as a mark of
recognition of the independent state which they intend to declare
in the coming year.
	   A few minutes before the fighting broke out, a family set up
Christmas decorations on a balcony directly above the banner.
	   Palestinian police later moved in to contain the protesters.
Clinton was to light a Christmas tree Monday in the town believed
to be where Jesus was born.
	   The visit was meant to celebrate the U.S.-brokered agreement
achieved at Wye River in October; instead, Clinton will be trying
to salvage it.
	   The Palestinians are angry that Israel refuses to release
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities and has instead
freed mostly common criminals to meet its prisoner release
commitments.
	   The Israelis accuse the Palestinian Authority of being behind
the wave of violence that broke out last month over prisoner
releases.
	   Two Palestinian protesters killed in clashes Friday in the
Palestinian-administered town of Qalqilya were buried Sunday.
	   Mohammed Amer, 18, was buried at his home village of Qibebah.
About 500 mourners attended the funeral.
	   Approximately 10,000 people attended the funeral of Kamal Adwan,
21, in Qalqilya.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin launched an impassioned
defense of Russia's five-year-old Constitution on Saturday, saying
it acted as a barrier to those who wanted to return the country to
its Communist past.
	   The Communist-led opposition has been calling increasingly
insistently for changes in the Constitution, which it criticizes
for allowing strong presidential powers to the detriment of other
branches of government.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said in October that
Yeltsin had agreed to have an expert commission consider changes to
the Constitution. On Saturday, however, the president urged extreme
caution in modifying the document, so that ``the foundations of
Russia's legal structure would not be destroyed.''
	   The Constitution ``stands in the way of those who sow enmity and
national dissension, those who cannot abide a free press, who try
to deny us our rights to private property and the free market,''
Yeltsin told legislators, government officials and other
dignitaries at a Kremlin reception.
	   Yeltsin looked fit after close to three weeks' convalescence
following a bout with pneumonia. He spoke strongly, clearly, and
with feeling.
	   ``(The Constitution) has helped preserve stability more than
once over these past five years. It has led us out of political
crises more than once. And it has upheld citizens' rights and
freedoms more than once,'' he said in a speech broadcast in part on
Russian television. The president made many of the same points in a
radio address that aired Saturday morning.
	   The Constitution was passed by referendum on December 12, 1993.
Yeltsin effectively designed the document for himself, putting the
president in a position to call all the shots, and giving little
real power to parliament or the prime minister.
	   Yeltsin's recent series of illnesses, his general retreat from
public view since an economic crisis hit in mid-August, and a clear
transfer of the reins of government to Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov have prompted speculation that the time might be ripe for
constitutional amendments.
	   Yet Yeltsin made it clear Saturday that he would not accept a
big increase in the parliament's authority.
	   ``They are calling for vesting parliament with all possible
powers. They are effectively proposing that the country revert to
being a republic of soviets,'' Yeltsin said, referring to the
councils that governed the Soviet Union along with the Communist
Party.

<TEXT>
	   DOBBIACO, Italy (AP) _ Bjorn Daehlie picked up his 42nd career
Cross Country World Cup victory Saturday, winning a 10-kilometer
(6.2-mile) freestyle race by nearly 15 seconds.
	   The Norwegian, owner of a record eight Winter Olympics gold
medals, had the top time at each of the checkpoints and finished in
22 minutes, 50.7 seconds.
	   Austria's Mikhail Botwinov was second in 23:05.3, half a second
faster than countryman Alos Stadlober.
	   ``I really wanted this first win of the season,'' Daehlie said.
``It's always tough to stay No. 1 for a long time.''
	   Katerina Neumannova of the Czech Republic won the women's
5-kilometer (3.1-mile) freestyle in 12:52.1 to extend her lead in
the World Cup standings.
	   She finished 11.5 seconds ahead of Sweden's Antonina Ordina at
this Dolomites resort, which had not hosted a World Cup race since
1993.
	   Daehlie gained significant ground in the overall season
standings, moving into second place behind Sweden's Mathias
Fredriksson, who was fifth Saturday in 23:12.2.
	   Frederiksson leads with 195 points, 15 ahead of Daehlie. Per
Elofsson of Sweden is next with 152 points. Elofsson finished
fourth in Saturday's race, clocking 23:08.6.
	   Neumannova's second win of the season pushed her up to 240 World
Cup points, comfortably ahead of Italy's Stefania Belmondo, who has
138 points after arriving fifth Saturday in 13:10.8. They each won
a silver and bronze medals at the Nagano Olympics in February.
	   ``The course was fast, which is perfect for me,'' Neumannova
said. ``I'm not thinking about the World Cup lead right now,
because I want to aim for success over the long haul.''
	   Russia's Nina Gavriljuk was third Saturday in 13:06.1, with
Kristina Smigun of Estonia fourth in 13:08.7.

Ukraine's foreign trade deficit rises to dlrs 1.69 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's negative foreign trade balance
reached dlrs 1.69 billion in the first 10 months of this year, the
State Statistics Committee said Saturday.
	   Ukrainian exports totaled dlrs 9.92 billion in January-October
1998, while imports amounted to dlrs 11.61 billion, it said.
	   The foreign trade deficit, which has been increasing steadily
during the year, was further boosted by the economic crisis in
neighboring Russia, Ukraine's major trade partner.
	   Moscow accounted for 23.5 percent of Ukraine's exports and 47.9
percent of the imports over the first 10 months of 1998, the
committee said.
	   Ukraine also delivered 6.2 percent of its exports to China, 5.7
percent to Turkey and 5.1 percent to Germany.
	   Germany accounted for 8.8 percent of Ukraine's imports, followed
by the United States with 4.3 percent and Poland with 3.4 percent,
the committee said.

Fans overwhelm soccer stadium; Japan wins battle in the pool
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with swimming, weightlifting, other late medals &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Host Thailand captured three gold
medals to cheer about Saturday, but thousands of fans suffered a
double blow _ they couldn't get in to see their soccer team, and
then it lost.
	   Both setbacks led to a bit of bottle throwing, and some of those
without tickets tried to climb the fences. Police told them to go
home and watch on television, and a giant TV screen was set up
outside the stadium too.
	   But reaction at the end of Qatar's 2-1 victory was fairly mild
since both teams advanced to the quarterfinals anyway. Meanwhile,
the Thais won two golds at the Southeast Asian sport of sepak
takraw _ a no-hands version of volleyball involving some highly
athletic kicking of a small rattan ball. They also won a gold in
bowling.
	   For China's women's weightlifters, it was business as usual _
another day, another world record and another gold medal. With one
day left in the women's competition, Wei Xiangying became the
latest record-breaker, winning the 75-kilogram division with an
Asian record total of 242.5 kilograms and a world record snatch of
115.
	   Hers was one of nine Chinese gold medals for the day, lifting
China's total to 70 after six full days of competition.
	   Japan was well behind with 26, but had the satisfaction of
winning the overall battle in the swimming pool with 15 golds to
China's 13. In the last games in Hiroshima in 1994, China trounced
the Japanese 23-5, but seven of its swimmers were caught for using
steroids.
	   On swimming's final day here, Japan had victories from Tomoko
Hagiwara in the women's 200-meter backstroke, the men's 4x100
medley team and _ the clincher _ Masato Hirano in the 1,500-meter
freestyle, the last of 32 events.
	   For China, Xiong Quoming, one of the seven caught for doping in
1994, won the men's 200-meter medley, and Shan Ying added a
50-meter freestyle gold to her earlier 100 triumph.
	   ``This time we set the goal of beating China and we've achieved
the goal,'' said Japan's Mai Nakamura, second in the 200-meter
backstroke Saturday.
	   But China's head coach Zhang Xiong insisted, ``I don't see this
as a loss. Taking two less golds than Japan is not a loss.''
	   South Korea was two behind the Japanese with 24 golds after
swimmer Cho Hee-yeon's victory in the women's 200-meter butterfly,
the Koreans' triumph over Japan in the men's tennis team final, and
a 1-2 finish in men's epee fencing.
	   Kazakstan had 12 with Andrey Makarov's victory in 94-kilogram
division men's weightlifting.
	   Taiwan won three bowling gold medals _ men's and women's teams
and women's trios, and had 11 golds, followed by the 10 of
Thailand, which won men's bowling trios.
	   Thai fans went into frenzied celebrations after the host sepak
takraw teams beat Myanmar 15-6, 15-13; 15-5, 15-9; 15-2, 15-4 for
the women's gold medal, and then beat archrival Malaysia 15-9,
15-3; 15-3, 15-5; 15-5, 15-5 for the men's.
	   But for an estimated 80,000 Thais, attention was focused on
trying to get into the 60,000-seat Rajamangala National Stadium for
Thailand's soccer game against Qatar.
	   One person was slightly hurt in the jostling but did not require
hospital treatment, said Torpong Sewarmra, a spokesman for Asian
Games organizers.
	   Some people threw plastic bottles of water at police; others
tried clambering over stadium fences and were repelled by police,
he said.
	   People also threw bottles, cans and shoes that members of the
crowd lost in the crush at a ticketing booth that shut down at 8
a.m., having sold out, said Nop Beaugot, who traveled 30 kilometers
(18 miles) by bus in hopes of seeing the match.
	   Advancing along with the Thais and Qatar to the quarterfinals
were Iran and China. Iran beat the Chinese 2-1 Saturday in their
final second-round game. In the quarters, they will join Kuwait,
South Korea, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.
	   Pakistan's Zarak Jehan beat compatriot Amjad Khan, the
18-year-old Pakistan Open champion, 1-9, 9-0, 6-9, 9-7, 9-3 for the
gold medal in squash, making its Asian Games debut.
	   Malaysia's Nicol David, the top seed, beat Hong Kong's Chiu
Wing-yin 9-3, 9-1, 9-6 for the women's gold in the sport, one of
the few in these games where China has not won a medal.
	   China beat South Korea for the men's team gold in table tennis,
and swept all four of the day's gold medals in shooting. It also
triumphed over Japan and South Korea in the rhythmic gymnastics
team event.

Acquitted Mikhailov sent back to Russia, officials say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new details, quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A wealthy Russian businessman and alleged mafia
boss has been sent back to Russia less than a day after he was
acquitted of charges that he belonged to a criminal organization,
officials said.
	   Geneva police said Mikhailov was sent back to Moscow Saturday
afternoon because his passport had expired and he lacked valid
identity papers.
	   Mikailov's lawyer Pascal Maurer said it was a ``disguised
extradition and against the law'' because Russia hadn't asked for
his return.
	   Pascal Di Camillo, Geneva police spokesman, said Mikhailov
agreed to go and was sent back to Moscow aboard an Aeroflot
jetliner and that he had a safe-conduct pass from Russian
authorities.
	   But Maurer said he faces threats in his country and didn't want
to return, but to go instead to Hungary.
	   Citing insufficient evidence, a Swiss court on Friday cleared
Sergei Mikhailov, who had been jailed in Switzerland for two years,
of the criminal organization charge.
	   Mikhailov, 40, was also cleared of charges that he forged
documents, but he was found guilty of a lesser charge _ that he
violated strict Swiss property laws restricting foreign ownership
by buying a villa near Geneva.
	   The judge and jury took into consideration the fact he had spent
two years in custody and so imposed no sentence, but he was sent
back to prison to spend the night.
	   Maurer protested that he had been unable to see Mikailov after
the verdict.
	   ``Because he didnt' call us, we got worried. But we ran into a
brick wall,'' Maurer said. He said the Geneva authorities had a
``disgraceful attitude'' in view of the verdict.
	   The surprise outcome was a blow to Geneva prosecutors, who had
said that Mikhailov posed a threat to western society and should be
jailed. He had faced a maximum 7 1/2 years in jail if found guilty.
	   The prosecution said Mikhailov is the leader of the Russian
Solntsevskaya mafia organization.
	   He was arrested in Switzerland in 1996 on charges that included
the more serious one of money laundering. That was dropped because
of the problems of gathering evidence in Russia.
	   He consistently protested his innocence, although conceded that
he was ``very, very rich.''
	   The trial lasted two weeks under unprecedented security, with
some of the 90 witnesses under police protection. Those most at
risk were allowed to testify by video from an adjacent room to
protect their identity.
	   Mikhailov was brought to the court each day in a bulletproof
vest and armored vehicle.

South Africans press for victory against West Indies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tea scores &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies, on 87 for
seven, needing 320 to win, were teetering on the brink of defeat
Saturday at tea on the third day of the second test against South
Africa.
	   In a poor batting display, even taking into account the vagaries
of a pitch that has never been conducive to strokemaking, the
tourists crumbled before the fiery pace of Allan Donald and the
tight fielding of the whole South African team.
	   Donald, struck on the helmet by Curtly Ambrose during his
innings, responded in the best possible way, snatching three
wickets as South Africa pressed for victory.
	   The home team was dismissed for 195 in their second innings just
before lunch, and the West Indies were already struggling on four
for one wicket at that break. Ambrose took four of the five South
African wickets to fall in the morning session in a very hostile
spell. His victims included the two men not out overnight, Shaun
Pollock and Jonty Rhodes. Pollock added just two to his 40, before
falling, caught by Mervyn Dillon at mid-on off a very injudicious
attempted pull. Rhodes batted well, before dragging another poor
pull shot down onto his stumps.
	   Pat Symcox and Allan Donald again provided some resistance after
Mark Boucher simply guided a short ball from Ambrose into Carl
Hooper's hands at second slip. Symcox was the first to go, fending
a throat-high bouncer from Ambrose to a grateful Clayton Lambert at
short leg.
	   Donald survived a torrid period, and was even struck hard on the
helmet by Ambrose. He was eventually bowled by Walsh for 11.
	   Donald struck immediately for South Africa, having Lambert
caught behind for two by wicketkeeper Boucher off an atrocious hook
shot. After the lunch break, the sorry tale continued: Jacques
Kallis had Ridley Jacobs trapped leg before for 22, Shaun Pollock
contriuted with one wicket, and poor running between the wickets
saw the end of Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Nixon McLean, run out for
one off his first ball. Donald's other two wickets were Stuart
Williams, leg before, and Floyd Reifer, caught by Darryll Cullinan
at first slip.

<TEXT>
	   NAGANO, Japan (AP) _ Olympic gold medalist Catriona LeMay Doan
showed Saturday that she remains dominant by winning the 500- and
1,000-meter titles in the first round of the Nagano World Cup
speedskating competition.
	   Last season she was formidable, maybe even invincible. She
captured the Olympic gold in the 500 meters and also the bronze in
the 1,000 meters at Nagano in February. In March, she won the
season World Cup titles in the 500 and 1,000 meters.
	   On Saturday, the 27-year-old LeMay Doan overcame a slow start
with a solid final lap of the 500 meters to take her first World
Cup victory for the 1998-1999 season in 38.67 seconds, or 0.50
second faster than second-place Eriko Sanmiya of Japan. Svetlana
Zhurova of Russia was third in 39.19 seconds.
	   In the afternoon, LeMay Doan triumphed in the 1,000 meters in 1
minute, 18.07 seconds, again ahead of Sanmiya, this time with a
margin of 0.42 second.
	   ``I really wasn't happy with the 500 meters,'' she said.
``Sometimes you just have to get through the first race of the
year. Then it's over and you go from there. I was very happy with
my 1,000 meters. It was a very good race for me.
	   ``You go into every race being positive. I think my biggest goal
tomorrow is to have much better 500 meters and be more relaxed. If
that brings me more golds, it'll be great.''
	   LeMay Doan revealed a secret of Canadian supremacy in winning
four medals Saturday.
	   After the Nagano Olympics and the season's final World Cup in
March, she said the Canadians started to train again at the
beginning of May. ``So, it was about six to seven weeks that we had
rest and this was the first year that I did no activity. We golfed
but had no training at all.
	   ``And the training in the summer had more volume than ever, much
more training as part of a four-year plan. But I think six to seven
weeks of rest is very good for the body and mind.
	   ``We train more this year and next year so that two years
afterwards we'll just work on speed. We look towards the next
Olympics and a lot of people take post-Olympic year easy... We want
to do it differently.''
	   Also on Saturday, world-record holder Hiroyasu Shimizu, also an
Olympic champion, won a gold for host Japan in his specialty, the
men's 500 meters, before a capacity crowd of 5,500 at the M-Wave
Arena.
	   A fourth gold at stake, the men's 1,000-meter title, went to
Olympic silver medalist Jan Bos of the Netherlands.
	   In all, Japan also bagged four medals, while Bos also won the
bronze in the 500 meters. The United States, Germany and Russia
each had a bronze medal.
	   Two bronze medals were awarded in the women's 1,000 meters as
Olympic silver medalist Chris Witty of the United States and
Monique Garbrecht of Germany were tied for third at 1 minute, 18.63
seconds.
	   Another round of the women's and men's competition also in the
500 and 1,000 meters takes place on the second and final day.
	   The two-day competition is the first of five sprint speedskating
World Cups scheduled for the 1998-1999 season.
	   The first two of another five speedskating World Cups for 1,500
meters and longer distances were held in Europe last month.
	   Shimizu, the first Japanese ever to win a speedskating gold,
overcame his shaky physical condition to outrace Jeremy Wotherspoon
of Canada in 35.40, or 0.64 seconds faster than the second-place
Canadian.
	   ``According to newspaper reports, I'm suffering from a cold,''
Shimizu said jokingly in a voice that sounded like he had a stuffed
nose. ``Yet, I was faster than a number of hopefuls from abroad
because, I think, you'll need quite a few days to get over with jet
lag.''
	   Shimizu set his world record of 34.82 at a world championship in
Calgary in March.
	   Bos won the 1,000 meters in 1:11.29, followed by Junichi Inoue
of Japan, who finished in 1:11.70. Wotherspoon placed third in
1:11.82.
	   ``I think my 500-meter lap time could've been faster. But it was
my first race of the year, so I'm not too much concerned about
it,'' said the 23-year-old Bos. ``We'll have to wait and see what
happens tomorrow.''

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development
announced Saturday it was lending Tunisia 35 million dinar (dlrs
115.89 million) for an agricultural project.
	   The Kuwait-based fund said the money would provide for the
construction of roads for the scheme and agricultural equipment,
the Kuwait News Agency reported.
	   The loan agreement, which was signed Thursday, sets interest at
4.5 percent, repayable over 22 years with a five-year grace period,
the news agency reported.
	   The loan raises the total of funds extended to Tunisia by the
fund to 280.7 million dinars (dlrs 929.47 million).
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Newsweek is to publish an Arabic version of its
newsmagazine, a representative of the Arabic publishers said
Saturday.
	   Mohammad al-Jassem, who will be the editor-in-chief of the
Arabic Newsweek, said Dar Al-Watan publishers of Kuwait signed an
agreement with Newsweek Inc. of New York in Kuwait City on
Saturday.
	   Mohammad al-Jassem, who currently edits the Al-Watan newspaper,
refused to disclose the value of the 5-year renewable contract.
	   The first issue would appear in April or May, al-Jassem told The
Associated Press. The edition will run to 64 pages.
	   Part of the Arabic version would be a translation of the
international edition while other material would be written by Arab
journalists and edited ``according to Newsweek's style,'' al-Jassem
said.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's oil minister has played down a call by
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi for OPEC countries to cease
production during the winter.
	   Sheik Saud al-Sabah said the proposal was ``merely an effort on
the part of some brothers to raise oil prices,'' the Kuwait News
Agency reported Saturday.
	   The minister did not name the Libyan leader. However, Egypt's
official Middle East News Agency has said that Gadhafi made the
call in letters sent to member-states of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
	   Oil prices have fallen to record lows owing to overproduction
and depressed demand in the West, where the winter has been warm,
and in recession-hit Asia.
	   Speaking at a ceremony to lay the foundation stone of the Oil
Ministry building, Sheik Saud said Kuwait was still better off than
other oil producers, which had much larger populations.
	   The small Gulf state estimates it will have a net deficit for
the current fiscal year of more than 1.92 billion dinars (dlrs 6.35
billion). Kuwait has an estimated population of 2.2 million, of
whom only about 800,000 are Kuwaiti citizens.

Jamaica police form special teams to crack down on smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Special teams of police were deployed
Saturday at air and sea ports in an increased effort to intercept
drugs, weapons and other contraband being smuggled into the
country, police said.
	   Police Commissioner Francis Forbes said officers would also be
on the lookout for suspected members of gangs that he blamed for
several exceptionally brutal murders in recent weeks. The Organized
Crime Unit has targeted five major gangs, he said.
	   Forbes said gang members often leave the capital to ``cool out''
in the country after committing crimes. To combat that, spot checks
on highways leading to rural areas will be set up to try to
intercept wanted gang members.
	   Transportation is a problem, however.
	   ``A number of (police) vehicles are down for repairs and this
was one of the issues that was laid on the table in a recent
meeting with the Prime Minister,'' Forbes said.

Keep promises on human rights, activists tell China's leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with report of lawyer for Wang
Youcai detained by police. &QL; 
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Responding to a crackdown on leaders of a
would-be opposition party, a diverse group of 184 dissidents
throughout China released a letter to the nation's leaders on
Saturday urging them to make good on promises to respect human
rights.
	   The letter focused on the case of Wang Youcai, a student leader
in the 1989 democracy demonstrations who is expected to go on trial
soon for subversion for trying to set up an opposition political
party.
	   Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin, veteran dissidents also active in
leading efforts to found the China Democracy Party, were seized on
Nov. 30 and have been accused of endangering state security. Wang
was already in custody when police raided the homes of Xu and Qin
and took them away.
	   The letter, released by New York-based Human Rights in China,
urged President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji to release these
three and other democracy advocates who have been seized in recent
months.
	   It urged them to halt Wang's trial and, failing that, to ensure
that it is open, fair and held in a court that is not under the
direct control of the government or ruling Communist Party.
	   The letter said that China had been making progress in
protecting citizens' rights and applauded China's recent signing of
two key human rights treaties. But it warned that recent arrests of
activists was a setback that produced ``doubts and deep
disappointment.''
	   Among those signing the letter were Xu Liangying, a scientist
who has written articles urging democratic reform, and Ding Zilin
and Jiang Peikun, who have tried to seek redress for the killing of
their 17-year-old son and other victims of the army attack on
unarmed pro-democracy protesters on Tiananmen Square in 1989.
	   Meanwhile, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China reported Saturday that Wang Youcai was having a
difficult time finding a lawyer.
	   Wang Wenjiang, a lawyer from Liaoning province who agreed to
take the case, was detained by police Friday night and released at
noon Saturday after police warned away from the case, the Hong
Kong-based center said, adding that the lawyer was no longer
planning to handle the defense.
	   Under pressure from officials, another lawyer whom Wang's wife,
Hu Jiangxia, tried to hire refused to represent Wang unless he
pleaded guilty, the Information Center said. The court also refused
to allow a friend of Wang's who is a Peking University law
department graduate to defend him, it said.
	   Despite the crackdown on key figures trying to set up the
opposition party, police have not closed off all avenues of
discussion of human rights. Before a gathering of about 15 people
in a small office on Saturday, Ren Wanding, a fellow activist with
Xu and Qin in the Democracy Wall movement of the late 1970s, gave a
speech commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Speaking at the invitation of the China Development Union, a
group holding weekly meetings about social problems, Ren said China
has made progress in expanding personal freedoms in the past 20
years, particularly in allowing people to discuss social problems
privately in their homes.
	   Ren also was active in trying to set up a branch of the would-be
opposition party, but withdrew when police warned him to stop. He,
Xu and Qin all have served long periods in prison.

EU backs Portuguese call for referendum, troop cut in East Timor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ In a decision welcomed as a landmark by
Portugal, European Union leaders Saturday backed calls for a
referendum to decide the fate of East Timor, the former Portuguese
colony occupied by Indonesia since 1975.
	   ``A definitive solution to the East Timor question will not be
possible without free consultation to establish the real will of
the East Timorese people,'' the 15 EU leaders said in statement
after their year-end summit.
	   Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said the statement marked
the first time the EU had backed Lisbon's call for the East
Timorese to vote on whether to opt for independence or remain under
Indonesian rule.
	   Indonesia has resisted such calls for a referendum and maintains
thousands of troops to keep order in the half-island territory.
	   The EU statement also urged Indonesia to bring about a ``real
and substantial reduction'' in troop levels and called for the
establishment of a permanent U.N. presence in East Timor.
	   The leaders repeated a demand that Indonesia release jailed
Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao, and all political prisoners.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 as Portugal prepared to
grant independence, and annexed it the following year. The United
Nations does not recognize Indonesian rule.

Taiwan cleans up in group bowling events at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Taiwan captured three of the four
bowling gold medals at stake Saturday in the Asian Games, winning
in men's and women's five-strong teams and the women's trio events.
The men's trio went to host nation Thailand.
	   ``I'm very excited to win,'' said Taiwan's Wang Yujen, who
scored 1,194 in Taiwan's winning tally of 6,073. South Korea had
6,045 and Japan 5,972. ``There's a lot of pressure because there
are many good bowlers in Taiwan.''
	   Wang's teammates on the top podium included Wu Fu-lung, Cheng
Chao-yu, Lin Han-chen and Chen Chun-fu.
	   The Taiwainese women _ Tseng Su-fen, Chou Miao-lin, Kuo
Shu-chen, Huang Chiung-yao and Ku Hui-chin _ racked up 6,098 points
to South Korea's 6,045 and Japan's 5,613. Tseng, Chou and Kuo also
combined to take the women's trios. Thailand took silver and
Singapore bronze.
	   Thailand's Seri Krausing, Praset Panturat and J. Kritchawat
triumphed in the men's trios with 3,760 points. But Taiwan again
showed its dominance in bowling by taking the silver with 3,696.
The United Arab Emirates was the only non-East Asian country to
figure in the medals, coming up with the men's trios bronze with
3,690 points.

	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Famine in southern Somalia has killed
25 people, mostly children, in the past two weeks, local
authorities said Saturday.
	   Officials in the Middle Juba region, 400 kilometers southwest of
the capital Mogadishu, in south central Somalia, said extensive
periods of flooding and drought had destroyed more than two thirds
of this season's crop harvest, and the floods also attracted
mosquitos and destroyed clean water sources.
	   Subsequently, more than 40 percent of the region's children were
suffering from hunger, malaria, diarrhea and tuberculosis,
according to administration officials in the region.
	   Khadija Ahmed Abukar, a World Health Organization official, said
more than 700,000 Somalis were affected by food shortages in the
south of the country.
	   On Saturday, a ship carrying 750 metric tons of dry foods,
including maize, lentils and porridge for the U.N World Food
Program, and 250 crates of WHO medicines to combat cholera, docked
at the port town of Merca, 100 kilometers (65 miles) south of the
capital Mogadishu.
	   Khadija said the cholera medications were to go to the Bay and
Bakol regions in Middle Juba, west and northwest of Mogadishu,
where several cases have been reported.

Massive show of force at soccer final in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian authorities sent
hundreds of riot police to the country's largest stadium, where
fans at a soccer final were expected to demand the ouster of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Dozens of police vans and two water-cannon trucks were stationed
around the perimeter of the 100,000-seat stadium packed with soccer
fans cheering for their teams from the central states of Perak and
Terengganu.
	   Police stood stiffly at strategic locations around the
glittering stadium, built specially for the 16th Commonwealth Games
in September.
	   No trouble or protests were reported as of 11:00 p.m. (1500
GMT), with the teams from Perak and Terengganu still playing to a
1-1 draw in the second half.
	   Dozens of street protests, some of them violent, erupted in
Malaysia after Mahathir fired his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, on Sept.
20. Since Anwar's sacking and his arrest eighteen days later,
demonstrators have demanded Mahathir's ouster and justice for
Anwar, who calls the charges against him politically motivated.
	   Hundreds of people have been detained in the rallies and police
have warned that they would come down hard on participants in the
banned protests.
	   A number of demonstrations have been scheduled for the past
several weekends, but the turnout has been a fraction of the
several thousand Anwar supporters who had gathered regularly since
his arrest.
	   Anwar is on trial on 10 counts of corruption and illegal sexual
acts. He denies the charges and says they were fabricated because
Mahathir considered his popularity a threat to his 17-year rule.

	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon on Saturday, firing missiles
and bullets, Lebanese security officials said.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties. There also was no
word on what prompted the attack.
	   The officials said two Israeli planes struck suspected positions
of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group in the hills northeast of the
Israeli-occupied zone at 12:40 p.m. (1040 GMT).
	   The jets fired two rockets and strafed the Jabal al-Rafih
mountain, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the occupied zone, said
the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Nearly two hours later, two Israeli warplanes flew low over
suspected Hezbollah bases in the western Bekaa Valley, but they did
not attack, officials said.
	   Anti-aircraft guns of the Lebanese army and Hezbollah fired at
the jets but missed, the officials added.
	   On Thursday, Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier over
Beirut for a second day, prompting Lebanon to seek U.N. help in
ending what the local media called the ``sonic bombardment'' of the
Lebanese capital.
	   Eight supersonic booms caused by low-flying jets rattled windows
of apartment buildings in Beirut and sent panicky residents
scurrying for cover.
	   The Israeli flights over Beirut came amid Israeli threats to hit
Lebanese power plants to retaliate for Hezbollah attacks that
killed seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon last month.
	   The Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is fighting to
oust the 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese
militiamen of the South Lebanon Army from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the 440-square-mile (1,100-square-kilometer) zone
in 1985 to shield its northern towns from cross-border guerrilla
attacks.

IOC official alleges widespread bribery in Olympic selection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with other allegations, details
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ A top IOC official on Saturday made
explosive allegations of widespread Olympic corruption, saying
agents demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver votes in the
selection of host cities.
	   Marc Hodler, a senior member of the International Olympic
Committee executive board, alleged malpractices in the bid
campaigns for the games of 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002.
	   Hodler said a group of four agents, including one IOC member,
have been involved in promising votes for payment. He declined to
identify them.
	   ``The four agents try to make a living out of this,'' he said.
``I missed a chance to be a rich man. Some of the agents do the
following: they say, `I can offer this or that number of votes.'
	   ``The price would be between dlrs 500,000 and dlrs 1 million for
a number of votes, a bloc.''
	   Hodler added that the agents then charge the city winning the
bid ``something like dlrs 3 million to dlrs 5 millon.''
	   Hodler, an 80-year-old Swiss lawyer, said there is one agent who
boasts ``that no city has ever won the Olympic Games without his
help.''
	   ``No one can prove that,'' Hodler said. ``It could be
possible.''
	   He said he believed agents had been buying and selling votes for
the past 10 years.
	   ``There are four agents we know,'' he said. ``One is an IOC
member. He promises he will give enough votes so (the biddding
city) can win.''
	   Asked whether all Olympic votes are tainted, Hodler said, ``I
know of so many times. There is a good chance it is always the
case.''
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated
himself from Hodler's allegations.
	   ``The only official spokeman for the IOC executive board is
(director general) Francois Carrard,'' Samaranch said. ``All the
other comments are personal comments. They are not official
comments.''
	   Hodler's allegations, made to a group of reporters, came as the
IOC continued investigations into alleged financial misconduct by
the Salt Lake City group which won the bid for the 2002 games.
	   Hodler has described as a ``bribe'' the dlrs 500,000 scholarship
fund set up by Salt Lake which benefited the relatives of six IOC
members.
	   It also came as the former minister in charge of Sydney's 2000
Olympic bid revealed he was asked to offer bribes in exchange for
votes. Bruce Baird, the former New South Wales minister, said he
refused.
	   Asked whether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the 1996 games
was clean, Hodler said, ``Certainly not.''
	   John Krimsky, deputy secretary general of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, disputed Hodler's assertion.
	   ``There is no basis for the charges against Atlanta at this
point,'' Krimsky said. ``All these issues should be put to the IOC
review commission.''
	   Hodler also leveled allegations against the head of the Athens
bid which lost to Atlanta in the 1996 vote.
	   Hodler said he overheard Spyros Metaxa, a wealthy Greek
businessman who led the bid, describing Samaranch and IOC members
as ``stupid'' for imposing restrictions on the bidding process.
	   ``For me there is only one purpose: winning the games,'' Hodler
quoted Metaxa as saying. ``I will do whatever is necessary to win
the games _ if it costs me dlrs 100,000, dlrs 10 million or dlrs
100 million.''
	   Hodler said he didn't know of any misconduct in Athens'
successful bid for the 2004 games.
	   Asked whether Sydney's election for the 2000 games was clean,
Hodler said, ``I would be surprised. I know what happened but I
don't want to disclose it.''
	   ``I can't imagine that Sydney is different from the others,'' he
said. ``Sydney pretends it is completely clean, clean, clean.''
	   The committee which won the 1998 games for Nagano ``certainly
had to do things which are not legitimate,'' Hodler said.
	   Hodler contested the argument by the current Salt Lake
organizing committee that it was not directly involved in the
controversial scholarship program and that the onus was on former
bid chief Thomas Welch.
	   ``Yesterday the lawyer of Salt Lake City said, `Everything had
been done by Tom Welch, who is not there any more. We know
nothing.' My experience is that this is not true.''
	   The controversy centers on scholarships _ including tuition
assistance and athlete training programs _ paid to relatives of IOC
members by the Salt Lake bid committee.
	   From 1991 to 1995, the committee _ under the direction of Welch
_ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships to 13 individuals _ six
of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa.
	   The current SLOC president, Frank Joklik, was chairman of the
bid committee at the time. SLOC vice president Dave Johnson was
also a high official on the bid committee.
	   Hodler said the blame shud be on those ``who put pressure'' on
Salt Lake to offer the scholarship funds.
	   ``Nobody blames Salt Lake City,'' he said. ``We blame those
voters who can be bought _ not Salt Lake City. They were a victim.
We should thank them for not paying money _ only scholarships.''
	   Joklik on Saturday denied any payment for votes.
	   ``I don't even know what agents are,'' he said.

Donald bowls South Africa to victory against West Indies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final scores

<TEXT>
	   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's star fast
bowler, Allan Donald, spearheaded South Africa to an easy 178-run
victory over the West Indies at St. George's Park Saturday.
	   Set 320 to win, the tourists folded before the sustained South
African bowling again, and were skittled out for a paltry 141 soon
after tea on only the third day of the match.
	   The West Indies, on 87 for seven at tea, were teetering on the
brink of defeat at tea. In a poor batting display, even taking into
account the vagaries of a pitch that has never been conducive to
strokemaking, the tourists crumbled before the fiery pace of
Donald, and the tight fielding of the whole South African team.
	   Donald, struck on the helmet by Curtly Ambrose during his
innings, responded in the best possible way, snatching five wickets
as South Africa pressed on to victory.
	   The home team was dismissed for 195 in their second innings just
before lunch, and the West Indies were already struggling on four
for one wicket at that break. Ambrose took four of the five South
African wickets to fall in the morning session in a very hostile
spell. His victims included the two men not out overnight, Shaun
Pollock and Jonty Rhodes. Pollock added just two to his 40, before
falling, caught by Mervyn Dillon at mid-on off a very injudicious
attempted pull. Rhodes batted well, before dragging another poor
pull shot down onto his stumps.
	   Pat Symcox and Allan Donald again provided some resistance after
Mark Boucher simply guided a short ball from Ambrose into Carl
Hooper's hands at second slip. Symcox was the first to go, fending
a throat-high bouncer from Ambrose to a grateful Clayton Lambert at
short leg.
	   Donald survived a torrid period, and was even struck hard on the
helmet by Ambrose. He was eventually bowled by Walsh for 11.
	   Donald struck immediately for South Africa, having Lambert
caught behind for two by wicketkeeper Boucher off an atrocious hook
shot. Between lunch and tea, the sorry tale continued: Jacques
Kallis had Ridley Jacobs trapped leg before for 22, Shaun Pollock
contributed with the wicket of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, and poor
running between the wickets saw the end of Hooper, and Nixon
McLean, run out for one off his first ball. Donald's other two
wickets before tea were Stuart Williams, leg before, and Floyd
Reifer, caught by Darryll Cullinan at first slip.
	   After tea, Brian Lara hit out in an attempt to unsettle the
South African bowlers, but in the end he succumbed to the sheer
pace of Donald, mistiming a pull to mid-on. Pollock removed Dillon,
and, in a fitting finale, Donald dismissed his tormentor Ambrose
with a fine short-pitched delivery which the West Indian spooned to
Pollock at third slip.
	   Questioned afterwards, Lara criticised the West Indian batting,
but still believed his team has what it takes to play themselves
back into the five-match series.
	   The next test begins Dec. 26 in Durban.

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian police helped quell
anti-Israel protests on Saturday, hours before U.S. President Bill
Clinton was to arrive in the region _ a sign of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's determination to smooth the visit.
	   In Palestinian-administered Bethlehem, Palestinian protesters
stoned Israeli soldiers guarding the entrance to the city.
	   The troops _ positioned below a banner put up by residents
declaring ``Bill Clinton: Welcome to Palestine'' _ responded with
tear gas and rubber bullets. The Palestinians see Clinton's visit
as a mark of recognition of the independent state which they intend
to declare in the coming year.
	   A few minutes before the fighting broke out, a family set up
Christmas decorations on a balcony directly above the banner.
	   Palestinian police later moved in to contain the protesters.
Clinton was to light a Christmas tree Monday in the town believed
to be where Jesus was born.
	   The visit was meant to celebrate the U.S.-brokered agreement
achieved at Wye River in October; instead, Clinton will be trying
to salvage it.
	   The Palestinians are angry that Israel refuses to release
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities and has instead
freed mostly common criminals to meet its prisoner release
commitments.
	   The Israelis accuse the Palestinian Authority of being behind
the wave of violence that broke out last month over prisoner
releases.
	   Two Palestinian protesters killed in clashes Friday in the
Palestinian-administered town of Qalqilya were buried Saturday.

China's heavy-lifting women break another world record

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For the sixth straight day, a Chinese
woman weightlifter broke a world record and won gold at the Asian
Games Saturday.
	   With one day left in women's weightlifting competition, Wei
Xiangying became the latest record-breaker, winning the 75-kilogram
division with an Asian record total of 242.5 kilograms and a world
record snatch of 115.
	   China's Zhao La had held both the old records _ 111.5 in the
snatch and 240 in total.
	   South Korea's Kim Soon-hee and Myanmar's Aye Mon Khin both
lifted a total of 230, but Kim won the bronze because of her
lighter body weight.
	   Wei's winning margin came from the snatch, well ahead of Kim's
102.5 and Aye Mon Khin's 100. In the jerk, Kim matched Wei's 127.5,
and Aye Mon Kim beat it with a 130 lift.
	   Kim unsuccessfully tried for a world record 145 jerk on her
final attempt for gold.
	   Wei, a 19-year-old from Liaoning province, progressed from 107.5
to 112.5 and 115 in her three attempts in the snatch.
	   While all of China's women gold medalists here have broken world
records, Sun Tianni did the most thorough job Friday, setting marks
in snatch, jerk and total. Her 245 total in the 69-kilogram
division beat the winning total of 242.5 in Saturday's 75-kilogram
competition.
	   In the men's 94-kilogram division, China failed to win, place or
show, with their best performance coming from 23-year-old Qin
Guang, who came in second to South Korea's Chun Yong-sung in the
jerk.
	   The men's gold medalist was Kazakstan's Andrey Makarov with a
385 total, which came from a 180 first place in the snatch, and a
third-ranking 205 in the jerk.
	   Makarov's snatch and total marks bested previous records held by
China's Ma Yanfei.
	   The silver went to Iran's Kourosh Bagheri-Kolah, whose
second-place 175 in the snatch combined with a fifth-place 202.5 in
the jerk to give him a 377.5 total.
	   Chun made up for a fifth place 162.5 in the snatch with a
confident-looking 210 in the jerk, giving him a 372.5 total. He
failed on his final attempt at 217.5.
	   Chun's Asian record jerk attempt surpassed the previous mark
held by China's Qin Guang.
	   One of the few moments of drama in the competition came when
Slavik Nyu _ Makarov's teammate from Kazakhstan _ failed to beat
the clock on his final attempt, losing a chance at 210 which could
have given him the silver if successful. (gp-tjh)

Srebrenica Muslims found guilty of murder

<TEXT>
	   BIJELJINA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In a retrial demanded by
international mediators, a Bosnian Serb court Saturday sentenced
three Muslims to a total of 51 years in prison for murder.
	   Two of the men were sentenced to 20 years in prison each, the
third was given an 11-year sentence. Four other Muslims were
charged with illegal possession of weapons and sentenced to one
year in prison each.
	   The verdict differed only slightly from the initial trial last
year, when all three men charged with murder were given 20-year
prison terms. International officials, however, called the 1997
trial a sham and insisted the seven Muslims be tried again.
	   International officials who monitored Saturday's trial made no
immediate comment.
	   The men claimed to have escaped from a massacre of thousands of
Muslim men when Bosnian Serbs captured the town of Srebrenica,
south of Zvornik, in July 1995. They said they survived months in
the wild, and claimed they surrendered when they spotted U.S.
soldiers patrolling the former front line in May 1996.
	   The U.S. troops noted some of the men were wearing military
uniforms, carrying weapons and had recent haircuts, and handed them
over to a Bosnian Serb police. They were held for a year before the
first trial opened.
	   Saturday's ruling stunned the defense lawyers, who plan to
appeal the ruling to a supreme court.
	   ``This is a catastrophe. There is no evidence of a murder,''
said Bakir Pasic a defense lawyer. ``There are no bodies of those
murdered.''
	   According to Pasic, the court based its ruling on a report that
four Serbs went missing and were never found, without any
substantial evidence linking their disappearance to the Muslims.
	   Some remains found in the woods were used as evidence, but the
court refused a doctor's request that forensics be used to identify
them.
	   All three men sentenced to extended prison terms _ Nedzad Hasic,
Ahmo Harbas and Behudin Husic _ were found guilty of murdering
unidentified persons. They announced they were staging a hunger
strike in protest of the court's decision.
	   The other four were let go, as the judge ruled they had already
served a year in prison.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A French United Nations official who was kidnapped
in southern Russia more than 10 months ago was set free Saturday
and flown to Moscow, the first stop on his journey back to U.N.
headquarters in Geneva.
	   Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in the North Ossetia region, was seized
by three masked gunmen in the regional capital Vladikavkaz on Jan.
29.
	   Cochetel was freed about two minutes into the predawn operation,
but a longer firefight erupted between the kidnappers and Russian
security forces, the Interfax news agency said. Cochetel was
unharmed, but he said three of the kidnappers had been killed,
Interfax reported.
	   Two security officers were slightly injured during the
operation, Interior Ministry spokesman Alexander Mikhailov said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. No ransom was paid for
Cochetel's release, Mikhailov said.
	   Cochetel was flown aboard a chartered jet to Moscow, where he
was met by French Ambassador Hubert Colin de Verdiere and U.N.
officials. He was to leave Saturday evening for Geneva, where his
family and colleagues were awaiting him at U.N. headquarters, said
Vera Sobolyeva, UNHCR spokeswoman in Moscow.
	   Speaking briefly to reporters, Cochetel thanked Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and other officials who made his release
possible.
	   ``It is the first time people have risked their lives for me,''
said Cochetel, who had grown a bushy beard during his more than 10
months in captivity.
	   Cochetel said that for the first two months, ``there was a lot
of violence, they were interrogating me and that was all very
serious,'' Interfax reported.
	   He said that for the past several months, he had been kept
almost completely in the dark.
	   ``Twenty minutes of daylight every single day, that's very
hard,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   He called for his kidnappers to be brought to justice.
	   ``I know who is responsible for my kidnapping,'' Cochetel said,
according to Interfax. ``I believe there must be a court trial. If
there is no trial, the process of kidnapping people will
continue.''
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are
mostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held
captive.
	   Cochetel's release came four days after the severed heads of
four murdered foreign hostages were found in Chechnya. The four _
Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and
Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ were killed after a government rescue
attempt apparently went wrong.
	   Chechnya's top prosecutor Mansur Tagirov, who was investigating
the killings and was apparently kidnapped Thursday, was also
released Saturday, Interfax said.
	   At UNHCR's Moscow office, Sobolyeva celebrated Cochetel's
release by tearing down the ``Free Vincent!'' poster that has hung
over her desk since the kidnapping.
	   ``We couldn't imagine a better Christmas present than to have
him back,'' UNHCR spokesman Judith Kumin said in Geneva. ``He's had
a shower and is beginning to unwind from a year's ordeal.''
	   French President Jacques Chirac spoke to Yeltsin by telephone
and thanked him for Russia's part in freeing Cochetel, the Kremlin
press service said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A French United Nations official who was kidnapped
in southern Russia more than 10 months ago was set free Saturday
and flown to Moscow, the first stop on his journey back to U.N.
headquarters in Geneva.
	   Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in the North Ossetia region, was seized
by three masked gunmen in the regional capital Vladikavkaz on Jan.
29.
	   Cochetel was freed about two minutes into the predawn operation,
but a longer firefight erupted between the kidnappers and Russian
security forces, the Interfax news agency said. Cochetel was
unharmed, but he said three of the kidnappers had been killed,
Interfax reported.
	   Two security officers were slightly injured during the
operation, Interior Ministry spokesman Alexander Mikhailov said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. No ransom was paid for
Cochetel's release, Mikhailov said.
	   Cochetel was flown aboard a chartered jet to Moscow, where he
was met by French Ambassador Hubert Colin de Verdiere and U.N.
officials. He was to leave Saturday evening for Geneva, where his
family and colleagues were awaiting him at U.N. headquarters, said
Vera Sobolyeva, UNHCR spokeswoman in Moscow.
	   Speaking briefly to reporters, Cochetel thanked Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and other officials who made his release
possible.
	   ``It is the first time people have risked their lives for me,''
said Cochetel, who had grown a bushy beard during his more than 10
months in captivity.
	   Cochetel said that for the first two months, ``there was a lot
of violence, they were interrogating me and that was all very
serious,'' Interfax reported.
	   He said that for the past several months, he had been kept
almost completely in the dark.
	   ``Twenty minutes of daylight every single day, that's very
hard,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   He called for his kidnappers to be brought to justice.
	   ``I know who is responsible for my kidnapping,'' Cochetel said,
according to Interfax. ``I believe there must be a court trial. If
there is no trial, the process of kidnapping people will
continue.''
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are
mostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held
captive.
	   Cochetel's release came four days after the severed heads of
four murdered foreign hostages were found in Chechnya. The four _
Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and
Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ were killed after a government rescue
attempt apparently went wrong.
	   Chechnya's top prosecutor Mansur Tagirov, who was investigating
the killings and was apparently kidnapped Thursday, was also
released Saturday, Interfax said.
	   At UNHCR's Moscow office, Sobolyeva celebrated Cochetel's
release by tearing down the ``Free Vincent!'' poster that has hung
over her desk since the kidnapping.
	   ``We couldn't imagine a better Christmas present than to have
him back,'' UNHCR spokesman Judith Kumin said in Geneva. ``He's had
a shower and is beginning to unwind from a year's ordeal.''
	   French President Jacques Chirac spoke to Yeltsin by telephone
and thanked him for Russia's part in freeing Cochetel, the Kremlin
press service said.

Davies pleased she may get some recognition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Former British Olympian Sharron Davies
isn't going to get her gold medal. But at least she and others may
get official recognition that they were robbed of gold.
	   The International Olympic Committee Saturday rejected a proposal
to give U.S. and British swimmers the medals won by drug-enhanced
East Germans.
	   But Director-General Francois Carrard said the IOC would find
another way to compensate the female swimmers who lost out to the
East Germans.
	   Davies, the 1980 Olympics silver medalist in the 400 individual
medley behind East Germany's Petra Schneider, said Saturday she
didn't expect the gold.
	   ``I am not surprised at the decision, it was what I expected
from speaking with British Olympic officials,'' said Davies,
working Saturday as a television commentator at the European
short-course championships in Sheffield.
	   ``My aim was not to get the gold medal, that's not what I wanted
_ but official recognition in some way of what happened then,'' she
said.
	   ``In that I'm pleased because it looks as though the IOC are
going to do something, perhaps at their big drugs conference next
February.
	   ``I think they might asterisk in the record books all those
performances from 1976 and 1980 which have later been shown to have
been down to drugs.
	   ``That would give me great satisfaction because for future years
it would be official recognition that what went on was cheating.
	   ``I certainly don't want to take medals away from anybody and
the East German swimmers are paying the price in ill-health. But it
was not them, it was the system.''

Ukraine's parliament raises taxes on imported alcoholic drinks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament has moved to support
domestic alcohol producers by sharply raising tax rates on imported
alcoholic beverages and by cutting the taxes imposed on Ukrainian
producers, according to a news report Saturday.
	   In a law approved on Friday, lawmakers increased by at least 50
percent the taxes imposed on imported ethyl alcohol, as well as on
beer and various types of wine, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Simultaneously, parliament lowered by up to 50 percent the taxes
to be paid by Ukrainian producers of the same beverages.
	   The law, which has to be signed by President Leonid Kuchma
within 15 days to become effective, would favor Ukrainian alcohol
manufacturers. They have complained that taxes are so high, they
cannot pay them without being forced to go out of business.
	   Ukrainian leaders have been trying for the last two years to
impose effective control over domestic alcohol and tobacco
production in an attempt to raise much-needed budget revenues.
	   Alcohol taxes have been changed several times this year, but the
measures so far have failed to curtail a widespread black-market
trade in the goods.

New Muslim-Croat government appointed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The parliament of Bosnia's
Muslim-Croat federation on Saturday approved a new government,
media reported.
	   The new government has a two-year mandate and consists of 14
ministers, two without portfolio, led by Prime Minister Edhem
Bicakcic, state-run Bosnian news agency Onasa reported.
	   At its Friday's session, parliament appointed Ejup Ganic, a
Muslim, and Ivo Andric-Luzanski, a Croat, president and
vice-president, respectively of the Muslim-Croat half of the
country.
	   Under international pressure, Bosnian officials took almost
three months to implement some parts of the Bosnian September's
general elections, including the federation cabinet.
	   The approval of the new government comes just days before the an
international council charged with implementing the peace in Bosnia
is to meet in Madrid, Spain to discuss a peace progress in Bosnia.
	   The Madrid conference, to be held Dec. 15-16 is yet another
attempt by the international community to stabilize the political
and economic situation in post-war Bosnia.
	   Following the 1992-95 civil war, international powers divided
Bosnia into the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb republic, and
deployed a NATO-led peace force to ensure stability.

Press: six killed at fake road block, two kidnap victims dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Eight people were killed in two days of
violence around Algeria and the tortured body of a young soldier
was found, the press reported Saturday.
	   Six people, including at least one policeman, were killed
Wednesday at a fake roadblock set up in an isolated bend in the
road at Maamar, a village near Tizi Ouzou, capital of the Kabyle
region about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Algiers.
	   Some 20 armed men reportedly set up the road block -- a
technique used frequently by armed groups since the start of an
Islamic insurgency in 1992.
	   A school bus and two cars, all burned, were still at the site
two days later, according to the privately-owned paper Liberte.
There was no mention of whether children were among the victims.
	   On Thursday, the tortured body of a young soldier kidnapped a
day earlier was found in Maamar. The victim's throat was slit and
his genitals crushed, the papers said, quoting family members.
	   The body of another kidnap victim, a local chief of Kadiria,
near Bouira, 120 kms (75 miles) east of the capital, was found on
Friday, Liberte and other papers reported. The official was
kidnapped at the end of November.
	   Daily violence has been a part of life in Algeria since the army
canceled 1992 legislative elections that a now-banned Muslim
fundamentalist party, the Islamic Salvation Front, was poised to
win. The move triggered the insurgency.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed in the violence.

Widhoezl leaps to ski jump win in dangerous fog
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OBERHOF, Germany (AP) _ Austria's Andreas Widhoelzl leaped to
victory Saturday at a Ski Jumping World Cup cut to one dangerous
attempt because of thick fog and gusting winds.
	   Widhoelzl soared 127.5 meters and was awarded 130.5 points to
beat the overall World Cup leader, Martin Schmitt, after the second
jump was cancelled.
	   The German leaped 122 meters for 120.6 points.
	   Many competitors complained about the dangerous conditions after
going airborne in fog so thick they were a blur to spectators and
TV cameras.
	   ``That was pushing the borders of the acceptable,'' said
Schmitt, who has dominated this season with four World Cup event
triumphs.
	   ``I'm doubly happy. I came down in one piece and made a good
jump. But I could by laying in the hospital,'' said Schmitt, who
landed headfirst Friday during a practice leap.
	   Germany's Sven Hannawald took third with a jump of 119.7 and
121.5 meters, followed by Austrians Wolfgang Loitzl and Stefan
Horngacher.
	   ``It was totally difficult today, right on the border. One
almost couldn't see where you were jumping,'' said Hornbacher.
	   Kazuyoshi Funaki of Japan, the double gold medal winner at
Nagano, finished 15th. He remains third in the overall standings
with 346 points, behind Schmitt at 540 and Finland's Janne Ahonen
at 408.
	   The triumph of Widhoelzl, double bronze winner at Nagano,
snapped a winless streak of 12 events for the Austrian jumpers.
	   ``I was surprised myself because I haven't been able to bring my
training performances into competition,'' said Widhoelzl, who
agreed the second jump should have been cancelled because of
conditions.
	   Some competitors, such as Germany's Dieter Thoma, had announced
they would drop out of the event even before the second attempt was
officially cancelled. The tour veteran finished 20th with a leap of
102 meters.
	   ``That was flying blind. I've already had one bad accident in
fog and don't have to do that to myself again,'' Thoma said.
	   The ski jumping World Cup will continue Sunday at Oberhof, where
rain is also predicted.
	   German coach Reinhard Hess described the event as ``without
worth'' because of the irregular conditions.

Regional governors to restrict shipments of food
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two Russian governors who fear winter food
shortages in their territories are defying federal law by banning
food shipments to other areas of the country, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   The governors of Krasnoyarsk and Kemerovo in Siberia will impose
the restrictions next week, the English-language Moscow Times said.
	   Krasnoyarsk Gov. Alexander Lebed signed an order Wednesday
making it virtually impossible to take dairy products, meat,
poultry, fish and vegetables out of the region after next Tuesday,
the report said.
	   Aman Tuleyev of Kemerovo was expected to sign an order on Monday
banning meat shipments. The paper said neither man expected Moscow
to take action to block their decrees.
	   The paper said the moves were a sign of the growing power and
independence of local governors, the report said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A French United Nations official who was kidnapped
in southern Russia more than 10 months ago was set free Saturday
and flown to U.N. headquarters in Geneva.
	   Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in the North Ossetia region, was seized
by three masked gunmen in the regional capital Vladikavkaz on Jan.
29.
	   Cochetel was freed about two minutes into the predawn operation
on the border between the republics of Chechnya and Ingushetia, but
a longer firefight broke out between the kidnappers and Russian
security forces, the Interfax news agency said. Cochetel was
unharmed, but he said three of the kidnappers had been killed.
	   In footage of the operation broadcast by Russia's NTV television
station, Cochetel was shown lying face-down, hand-cuffed, behind a
white van. Russian security officers in masks and camouflage stood
over him protectively, then dragged him away as gunfire erupted and
bullets bounced off the van.
	   Two security officers were slightly injured during the
operation, Interior Ministry spokesman Alexander Mikhailov said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. No ransom was paid for
Cochetel's release, Mikhailov said.
	   Cochetel was flown aboard a chartered jet to Moscow, where he
was met by French Ambassador Hubert Colin de Verdiere and U.N.
officials. He left Saturday evening for Geneva, where his family
and colleagues were awaiting him at U.N. headquarters, said Vera
Sobolyeva, UNHCR spokeswoman in Moscow.

Guyana cancels work permit for Islamic cleric because of U.S.
</HEADLINE>
warning &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT WILKINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyana has canceled the work permit
for an Islamic cleric jailed in the United States for the past 18
months because of secret evidence allegedly linking him to Mideast
terrorists.
	   The decision probably means that Mazen Al-Naijar, a former
professor at the University of South Florida and the leader of a
Tampa mosque, will remain in jail until another country agrees to
take him.
	   U.S. authorities accused Al-Naijar of having links to a Mideast
terrorist group and the Immigration and Naturalization Service
ordered him deported, but so far no country has agreed to accept
him.
	   Al-Naijar denies the accusations and says he is a peaceful
advocate of Palestinian rights.
	   Al-Naijar has been jailed under a law that allows alleged
terrorists to be held without their being allowed to see the
evidence against them.
	   The Central Islamic Organization of Guyana won a work permit to
allow Al-Naijar to come to the South American country for a year to
teach, but Prime Minister Sam Hinds said Saturday that the permit
for Al-Naijar and his family had been revoked because of the
accusations against him in the United States.

Taiwan hands Japan worst-ever Asian Games basketball defeat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan, the bronze medalist four years
ago in Hiroshima, failed Saturday to reach the Asian Games final
eight for the first time, crashing out in a 72-63 loss Saturday to
Taiwan.
	   Japan, which left four world championship starters at home due
to injuries, suffered two straight defeats in Group B, also losing
54-53 to United Arab Emirates.
	   Makoto Hasegawa was the match high-scorer with 26 points, but he
lacked the support that Taiwan's top shooter, Cheng Chi-lung, with
19, got from this teammates, who dominated under the baskets.
	   Japan led 40-35 in the first half and trailed 63-57 when Taiwan
used a 13-3 run to take over the lead with only three minutes left.
Japan tried and failed to come back with a series of missed
three-pointers.
	   The defeat marked the first time the Japanese men's team has
been edged out of the top eight at the Asian Games.
	   Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates advance to the second round
starting Monday.
	   In the other men's match Saturday, defending champion China blew
apart host nation Thailand, 114-53, for a second Group A win. But
Thailand still made it to the top eight, after beating Hong Kong
77-64 on Thursday.
	   Other second-round qualifiers are South Korea and Iran from
Group B and the Philippines and Kazakstan from Group D.
	   In women's basketball, defending champion South Korea beat
Kazakstan 70-51 to ensure a semifinal berth. After being tied at 42
and 44, the South Koreans broke away with a 15-3 run to take their
second consecutive group victory.
	   June Sun-min scored a game-high 22 points and Chun Joo-weon and
Yoo Young-joo added 12 and 10 respectively for the winners.

Athletes who lost to doped swimmers will miss out on medals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS react from Sharron Davies in last 6 grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
rejected a bid Saturday to give U.S. and British Olympic swimmers
the medals of East Germans later discredited for taking
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   But Director-General Francois Carrard said the IOC would look
for other ways to recognize the female swimmers who lost to the
East Germans in 1976 and 1980.
	   The IOC Juridical Committee found that it would ``create a lot
of new juridical problems'' if it were to reallocate or withdraw
the medals, change results and redetermine rankings, Carrard said.
	   The panel said a complaint from the U.S. and British Olympic
associations could have caused revisions back as far as the 1976
Montreal Olympics.
	   ``From a legal standpoint, nothing can or will be done, but the
IOC executive board has appointed the four vice presidents to study
further both matters and to determine whether some other form of
solutions in terms of recognition can be found,'' added Carrard.
	   ``Do we have the right to withdraw? These swimmers under the
conditions then prevailing didn't test positive. The juridical
commission thinks this isn't a legal matter, but the matter isn't
closed.''
	   Recent studies have revealed that between 6,000 and 10,000
athletes were covered by systematic doping program that operated in
the former East Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Six former East German doctors and coaches have been convicted
this year on charges of administering steroids to young swimmers
without their knowledge.
	   The U.S. Olympic Committee is seeking ``appropriate medal
recognition'' for swimmers Linda Jezek, Lauri Siering, Camile
Wright and Shirley Babashoff, who lost out to the East Germans in
the women's medley relay at Montreal.
	   The British Olympic Association has filed a petition on behalf
of Sharron Davies, who won the silver medal in the 400-meter
individual medley at the 1980 Moscow games.
	   Davies, speaking Saturday at the European short-course
championships in Sheffield, England, said getting recognition of
her situation would be almost as good as gold.
	   ``My aim was not to get the gold medal, that's not what I wanted
_ but official recognition in some way of what happened then,''
Davies said.
	   ``In that I'm pleased because it looks as though the IOC are
going to do something, perhaps at their big drugs conference next
February.
	   ``I think they might asterisk in the record books all those
performances from 1976 and 1980 which have later been shown to have
been down to drugs.
	   ``That would give me great satisfaction because for future years
it would be official recognition that what went on was cheating.
	   ``I certainly don't want to take medals away from anybody and
the East German swimmers are paying the price in ill-health. But it
was not them, it was the system.''

Russian businessman sent back to Russia after acquittal on mob
</HEADLINE>
charge &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A wealthy Russian businessman was sent back to
Russia Saturday after he was acquitted of charges in Switzerland
that he belonged to a criminal organization.
	   Geneva police said Sergei Mikhailov was sent back to Moscow
because his passport had expired and he lacked valid identification
papers.
	   But Mikailov's lawyer, Pascal Maurer, said it was a ``disguised
extradition and against the law'' because Russia hadn't asked for
his return.
	   Geneva police spokesman Pascal Di Camillo said Mikhailov agreed
to go and had a safe-conduct pass from Russian authorities. He said
Mikhailov returned aboard an Aeroflot jetliner.
	   Maurer said Mikhailov faces threats in Russia and wanted to go
to Hungary instead of returning to Russia.
	   Citing insufficient evidence, a Swiss court Friday cleared
Mikhailov of the criminal organization charge. The prosecution
accused Mikhailov of being the leader of the Russian Solntsevskaya
mafia organization.
	   Mikhailov, 40, also was cleared of charges that he forged
documents.
	   But he was found guilty of the lesser charge of violating strict
Swiss property laws restricting foreign ownership by buying a villa
near Geneva. The judge and jury took into consideration the fact he
had spent two years in jail and imposed no sentence. However, he
was sent back to prison to spend the night.
	   If he had been found guilty, Mikhailov would have faced a
maximum of 7{ years in jail. He was arrested in Switzerland in
1996, and has said he was innocent.
	   The two-week trial required unprecedented security, with some of
the 90 witnesses under police protection. Those most at risk were
allowed to testify by video from an adjacent room to protect their
identity.

Italy tests fruitcakes nationwide after activists send two poisoned
</HEADLINE>
panettone &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By ELLEN KNICKMEYER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's government checked samples of two popular
brands of Christmas cakes from stores nationwide Saturday, weighing
a precautionary recall after animal-rights activists claimed to
have injected them with rat poison.
	   Tests on Friday found poison in two cakes sent to the Bologna
and Florence offices of Italy's ANSA news service. Notes with the
cakes said the Animal Liberation Front was poisoning the cakes to
protest genetic engineering.
	   Both brands of panettone _ Motta and Alemagna _ are made by
Nestle Italia. There was no word of any more poisoned cakes by
Saturday.
	   ``We believe that there are no other poisoned panettone
around,'' Bologna Prosecutor Lucia Mustia said. ``All the same, we
ask that people check the cakes to search for possible syringe
holes.''
	   Panettone _ yeast cakes laden with fruits and nuts _ are to
Italian Christmases what fruitcakes and plum pudding are to the
holiday in America and Britain.
	   Many Italians out and about on the streets of Rome on Saturday
said they wouldn't be buying the Christmas cakes this year _ or at
least not the targeted brands.
	   ``I've already eaten my Motta panettone that I bought about 10
days ago _ but I wouldn't buy another one,'' said Anna Fava, a
homemaker. ``My husband is very brave, saying that he would!''
	   ``It's a tradition,'' 19-year-old student Angela Mattea said.
``My parents will probably buy one despite what has been written in
the papers.''
	   Stores and store chains were making individual decisions on
whether to pull the brands or not. Consumer confusion about which
brands were targeted meant sales of all Christmas cakes were down,
some merchants said.
	   Newspaper ads by Nestle on Saturday declared the act ``hit at
one of the Christmas symbols dearest to Italians.'' Nestle
suspended production at its plant in Verona through Monday.
	   ``This is an act that could have grave consequences for these
noted brands of panettone and graver for our employees,'' said
executive Yves Barbieux, estimating damages so far in the scare at
dlrs 30 million or more.
	   Barbieux says the multinational does not use genetically
engineered materials in any of the products it sells in Italy.
	   Authorities said they would question members of the
animal-rights group.
	   Health Minister Rosy Bindi said the government was prepared to
take whatever steps might prove warranted, including a possible
precautionary recall if necessary. Asked by reporters whether she
would have panettone on her Christmas table, she said she would
wait for the results of the nationwide checks.
	   ``I'll buy it if all Italians buy them _ meaning that, if we are
reassured regarding the safety, than it's clear the minister of
health will eat panettone too.''

IOC official alleges widespread bribery in Olympic selection

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further Hodler allegations that 5-7 percent of
IOC members are corrupt; new IOC statement

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ A top IOC official on Saturday made
explosive allegations of widespread Olympic corruption, saying
agents demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver votes in the
selection of host cities.
	   Marc Hodler, a senior member of the International Olympic
Committee executive board, alleged malpractices in the bid
campaigns for the games of 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002.
	   In unprecedented allegations by an IOC official, Hodler said he
believed 5 to 7 percent of IOC members have solicited bribes. There
are currently 115 IOC members.
	   Hodler said a group of four agents, including one IOC member,
have been involved in promising votes for payment. He declined to
identify them.
	   ``The four agents try to make a living out of this,'' he said.
``I missed a chance to be a rich man. Some of the agents do the
following: they say, `I can offer this or that number of votes.'
	   ``The price would be between dlrs 500,000 and dlrs 1 million for
a number of votes, a bloc.''
	   Hodler added that the agents then charge the city winning the
bid ``something like dlrs 3 million to dlrs 5 millon.''
	   Hodler, an 80-year-old Swiss lawyer, said there is one agent who
boasts ``that no city has ever won the Olympic Games without his
help.''
	   ``No one can prove that,'' Hodler said. ``It could be
possible.''
	   He said he believed agents had been buying and selling votes for
the past 10 years.
	   ``There are four agents we know,'' he said. ``One is an IOC
member. He promises he will give enough votes so (the biddding
city) can win.''
	   Asked whether all Olympic votes are tainted, Hodler said, ``I
know of so many times. There is a good chance it is always the
case.''
	   ``To my knowledge, there has always, always been a certain part
of the vote given to corruption,'' he said.
	   Hodler said losing cities have told him there is a list of IOC
members who can be bought.
	   Hodler said he hasn't seen the list.
	   ``What I got is the number of people that clearly, regularly
asked for financial support,'' he said.
	   How many members were involved?
	   ``For me, I always said it is about 5 to 7 percent of the
membership,'' he said.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who has led the Olympic
movement since 1980, immediately disassociated himself from
Hodler's allegations.
	   ``The only official spokeman for the IOC executive board is
(director general) Francois Carrard,'' Samaranch said. ``All the
other comments are personal comments. They are not official
comments.''
	   Later, the IOC put out a written statement saying the
``executive board disassociated itself from allegations made by one
of its members with the Olympic bid process.''
	   Hodler's allegations, made to a group of reporters, came as the
IOC continued investigations into alleged financial misconduct by
the Salt Lake City group which won the bid for the 2002 games.
	   Hodler has described as a ``bribe'' the dlrs 500,000 scholarship
fund set up by Salt Lake which benefited the relatives of six IOC
members.
	   It also came as the former minister in charge of Sydney's 2000
Olympic bid revealed he was asked to offer bribes in exchange for
votes. Bruce Baird, the former New South Wales minister, said he
refused.
	   Asked whether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the 1996 games
was clean, Hodler said, ``Certainly not.''
	   John Krimsky, deputy secretary general of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, disputed Hodler's assertion.
	   ``There is no basis for the charges against Atlanta at this
point,'' Krimsky said. ``All these issues should be put to the IOC
review commission.''
	   Hodler also leveled allegations against the head of the Athens
bid which lost to Atlanta in the 1996 vote.
	   Hodler said he overheard Spyros Metaxa, a wealthy Greek
businessman who led the bid, describing Samaranch and IOC members
as ``stupid'' for imposing restrictions on the bidding process.
	   ``For me there is only one purpose: winning the games,'' Hodler
quoted Metaxa as saying. ``I will do whatever is necessary to win
the games _ if it costs me dlrs 100,000, dlrs 10 million or dlrs
100 million.''
	   Hodler said he didn't know of any misconduct in Athens'
successful bid for the 2004 games.
	   Asked whether Sydney's election for the 2000 games was clean,
Hodler said, ``I would be surprised. I know what happened but I
don't want to disclose it.''
	   ``I can't imagine that Sydney is different from the others,'' he
said. ``Sydney pretends it is completely clean, clean, clean.''
	   The committee which won the 1998 games for Nagano ``certainly
had to do things which are not legitimate,'' Hodler said.
	   Hodler contested the argument by the current Salt Lake
organizing committee that it was not directly involved in the
controversial scholarship program and that the onus was on former
bid chief Thomas Welch.
	   ``Yesterday the lawyer of Salt Lake City said, `Everything had
been done by Tom Welch, who is not there any more. We know
nothing.' My experience is that this is not true.''
	   The controversy centers on scholarships _ including tuition
assistance and athlete training programs _ paid to relatives of IOC
members by the Salt Lake bid committee.
	   From 1991 to 1995, the committee _ under the direction of Welch
_ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships to 13 individuals _ six
of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa.
	   The current SLOC president, Frank Joklik, was chairman of the
bid committee at the time. SLOC vice president Dave Johnson was
also a high official on the bid committee.
	   Hodler said the blame shud be on those ``who put pressure'' on
Salt Lake to offer the scholarship funds.
	   ``Nobody blames Salt Lake City,'' he said. ``We blame those
voters who can be bought _ not Salt Lake City. They were a victim.
We should thank them for not paying money _ only scholarships.''
	   Joklik on Saturday denied any payment for votes.
	   ``I don't even know what agents are,'' he said.

DiMaggio awakens from coma but outlook poor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with DiMaggio's condition dramatically
improving. No pickup.

	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio's condition dramatically
improved Saturday after doctors changed the way they administered
an antibiotic, allowing the baseball great to sit up in bed a day
after he slipped into a coma.
	   ``It's an unbelievable improvement,'' Dr. Earl Barron said
Saturday morning. ``He was awake and he was talking to us. ... He
is back to where he was on Thanksgiving Day.''
	   He said doctors were considering upgrading DiMaggio's condition
from critical to serious. He said DiMaggio's temperature and white
blood cell count both dropped dramatically.
	   The improvement was credited to a decision to give him the
antibiotic Rifampin intravenously instead of orally to fight his
lung infection.
	   ``He said `Hello,''' said an exuberant Barron.
	   Barron cautioned that DiMaggio was far from cured.
	   ``If we can stay on top of it and keep on top of it, I think he
will survive,'' Barron said. ``We have to temper that with a man
who is 84 years old and has had several serious infections.''
	   The decision to administer the antibiotic through an IV came
when doctors realized that the medicine was not being absorbed into
the bloodstream.
	   ``If this discovery had not been made we would not be talking
about a live person,'' Barron said.
	   DiMaggio's recovery began Friday when he surprised physicians by
awakening from a worrisome coma.
	   DiMaggio's family _ including his brother, Dom; grandchildren
Kathy and Paula; and longtime friend and lawyer Morris Engelberg _
had been spending time at his bedside.
	   ``We're near the end,'' Engelberg said when conditions looked
bleak.
	   The family signed a ``do not resuscitate'' order.
	   DiMaggio underwent surgery for lung cancer on Oct. 14. Since
then, he has had serious setbacks and stunning improvements _ his
doctor characterized them last week as ``two steps forward and one
back.''
	   Fluid was drained from his lungs several times and his blood
pressure dropped so rapidly on Nov. 16 that a Catholic priest was
summoned to administer last rites.
	   Since then DiMaggio's blood pressure and heart and kidney
functions have remained good, but pneumonia persisted. On Saturday,
Barron said the most recent lung scan showed improvement by 50
percent.
	   In 13 seasons with the New York Yankees, DiMaggio played in 11
All-Star games and 10 World Series.
	   His 56-game hitting streak in 1941 is still a record, and his
marriage to Marilyn Monroe in 1954 elevated his place in American
culture. He was voted into the Hall of Fame in 1955, four years
after his retirement, and in 1969 was chosen as the greatest living
baseball player.
	   His last public appearance was Sept. 27, when he was honored at
Yankee Stadium and given replicas of nine championship rings that
were stolen from him three decades ago. The Yankees had wanted him
to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at this year's World
Series, but by then he was in the hospital just north of Miami.

 &UR; U.S. Secretary of Defense postpones trip to Germany &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen has
postponed on short notice a planned two-day visit to Germany the
defense ministry in Bonn said Saturday.
	   A ministry statement said Cohen had contacted German Defense
Minister Rudolf Scharping by telephone to say he had special
commitments involving the Middle East trip of President Bill
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   Cohen now intends to visit Germany in February, the statement
said.
	   The U.S. defense chief had been expected to arrive in Bonn on
Sunday for talks with Scharping and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on
Monday.
	   He had also been scheduled to give a speech to students at the
Marshall Center in Garmisch-Partenkirchen on Tuesday, before
traveling to Brussels for a Thursday meeting of NATO chiefs.

China, Ukraine sign trade deals, smooth over Taiwan spat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China will buy Ukrainian generators for its giant
Three Gorges Dam project, Ukraine's foreign minister said Saturday,
indicating the two countries have settled a dispute about his
government's contacts with Taiwan.
	   The two sides also signed a deal to collaborate on upgrading
Chinese airliners and discussed cooperation in farming and other
areas, said Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk. He would not provide
details about the deals.
	   Tarasyuk affirmed Ukraine's support for the ``one China''
principle, which recognizes Taiwan as a province of the mainland.
	   Beijing protested angrily in 1996 when then-Premier Lien Chan of
Taiwan visited Ukraine. Beijing insists the island, ruled by the
rival Nationalist government, has no right to conduct foreign
relations.
	   ``We continue to conduct trade cooperation with Taiwan. But this
kind of cooperation has no official content,'' Tarasyuk told
reporters in the middle of a five-day visit.
	   The foreign minister also emphasized Ukraine's interest in trade
with China, but hinted at possible frictions over trade barriers.
	   Ukraine's trade with China in 1997 amounted to $1.25 billion,
but has fallen by 30 percent so far this year, Tarasyuk said. He
blamed growing Chinese trade barriers to imports of Ukrainian
fertilizer and other goods, but did not say whether the two sides
had discussed the issue.

Kazak health authorities alarmed by rise in tuberculosis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kazak health authorities have raised the alarm
over a persistent increase in tuberculosis cases, declaring a TB
epidemic in five counties where one in 1,000 people has contracted
the disease, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Saturday.
	   Kazakstan has the highest tuberculosis rate among the former
Soviet republics. Although the country has long had a high rate of
tuberculosis, the situation has worsened due to the economic
hardships that followed the 1991 Soviet breakup.
	   According to Kazakstan's Ministry of Health, the incidence of TB
grew 30 percent in 1992-97, rising from 64.2 cases per 100,000
people to 91.3 per 100,000. It said that the disease had caused 3.2
times more deaths in 1997 than five years earlier: 37.7 per 100,000
people.
	   Russia's tuberculosis rate has also been rising by an alarming
rate since 1991, and is especially high among prison inmates, who
are 50 times more likely than the general public to be infected.
Medical officials say tuberculosis affects 73 out of every 100,000
people in Russia
	   Kazak doctors blame the increase in tuberculosis on the
country's economic crisis, a sharp drop in the standard of living
for most of the population, and inadequate preventive measures,
ITAR-Tass said.

Nobel peace laureates differ over disarmament in Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ With the Irish Republican Army
resistant to laying down its weapons, Northern Ireland's Nobel
Peace Prize winners John Hume and David Trimble differed Saturday
over the importance of disarmament to the troubled peace process.
	   Hume and Trimble, who received the prize on Thursday for their
efforts in working out a peace accord, spoke at a seminar one day
after the IRA inidcated it was not prepared to start disarming, as
called for in the agreement.
	   Trimble said the development was worrisome and said disarmanent
by both republican and unionist paramilitaries was critical to show
that their commitment to the peace process was ''anything more than
tactical, anything more than skin-deep.''
	   Trimble is leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, the largest
party supporting the majority Protestant position that Northern
Ireland should remain a part of the United Kingdom.
	   Hume, head of the largely Roman Catholic Social Democratic and
Labor Party, said placing emphasis on disarmanent was ''a
distraction.''
	   ''The real issue about weapons is if they have stopped being
used,'' he said, adding that even if the IRA and other
paramilitaries turned in weapons, that would not necessarily end
suspicions.
	   ''I have no doubt that certain parties with loud voces would
'How do we know they've given us all their weapons'?'' he said.
	   The IRA previously has dismissed calls to begin destroying its
stockpiled arms. Trimble, in his prize-acceptance speech,
emphasized that Protestants would not permit the IRA-allied Sinn
Fein party to enter any new administration for Northern Ireland
without concrete evidence that the IRA had really renounced
violence.
	   In Stockholm, Trimble said he would be flexible about
circumstances for the IRA turning in weapons and would not demand
they be turned in to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which the IRA
would certainly regards as humiliating.
	   His only condition for disarmament, he said, was ''whatever is
done, there's got to be a television camera there.''
	   Despite the latest snag in the process, both Hume and Trimble
expressed confidence in the accord's ultimate success.
	   Because the accord was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum,
''opposing the agreement is opposing the will of the people and
that weakens (the paramilitaries) substantially,'' he said.
	   The paramilitaries eventually ''will find themselves obliged to
fulfill this part of the agreement,'' Trimble agreed.

Srebrenica Muslims found guilty of murder

<TEXT>
	   BIJELJINA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In a retrial demanded by
international mediators, a Bosnian Serb court Saturday sentenced
three Muslims to a total of 51 years in prison for murder.
	   Two of the men were found guilty of three counts of murder and
sentenced to 20 years in prison each, the third was given an
11-year sentence for one count of murder.
	   The verdict differed only slightly from the initial trial last
year, when all three men were given 20-year prison terms.
International officials, however, called the 1997 trial a sham and
insisted the three Muslims be tried again.
	   International officials who monitored Saturday's trial made no
immediate comment.
	   The three men were part of a group of seven, who claimed to have
escaped from a massacre of thousands of Muslim men when Bosnian
Serbs captured the town of Srebrenica, south of Zvornik, in July
1995. They said they survived months in the wild, and claimed they
surrendered when they spotted U.S. soldiers patrolling the former
front line in May 1996.
	   The U.S. troops noted some of the men were wearing military
uniforms, carrying weapons and had recent haircuts, and handed them
over to a Bosnian Serb police. They were held for a year before the
first trial opened.
	   The other four men were found guilty of illegal possession of
weapons at the 1997 trial were not retried this year.
	   Saturday's ruling stunned the defense lawyers, who plan to
appeal the ruling to a Bosnian Serb supreme court.
	   ``This is a catastrophe. There is no evidence of a murder,''
said Bakir Pasic, a defense lawyer. ``There are no bodies of those
murdered.''
	   According to Pasic, the court based its ruling on a report that
four Serbs from the Zvornik area went missing and were never found,
without any substantial evidence linking their disappearance to the
Muslims.
	   Some remains found in the woods were used as evidence, but the
court refused a doctor's request that forensics be used to identify
them.
	   The three men convicted _ Nedzad Hasic, Ahmo Harbas and Behudin
Husic _ announced they were staging a hunger strike in protest of
the court's decision.

Pisa's people hold their breath as work begins on leaning tower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PISA, Italy (AP) _ The moment of truth has finally arrived:
After nearly a decade of delays, work has begun to ensure the famed
Leaning Tower of Pisa does not topple over.
	   But residents whose livelihoods depend on the hordes of tourists
who flock to Pisa for a view of the tower are holding their breath
_ hoping nothing will go wrong to jeopardize their future.
	   ``After all these years of study upon study, I just hope they
have chosen the best procedure,'' Fabio Magagnini, a taxi driver,
said Saturday. ``Around town everyone is saying, `Let's hope they
don't make it fall.'''
	   According to an ambitious _ and risky _ plan, the 12th-century
tower will be straightened by a half-degree, enough to stabilize
the tower but not enough for the naked eye to detect.
	   If the project succeeds, as the international committee that
devised the plan predicts, tourists might soon be allowed to again
make the dizzying climb up the tower's spiral staircase.
	   Visits to the interior of the tower were banned in 1990 for fear
the monument would collapse.
	   The first phase of the project, meant to safeguard the tower for
centuries to come, foresees the attachment of two sets of steel
``suspenders.''
	   On Saturday, a huge crane raised a 50-millimeter (2-inch) thick
and 103-meter (340-foot) long cable above the tower. Workers
attached it to a giant hook fixed to the tower at a height of 26
meters (86 feet), on the third of its eight stories of arches.
	   The cables are anchored to giant winches dug into the ground
about 100 meters (yards) from the tower.
	   John Burland, a professor of Soil Mechanics in London and member
of the project's committee, said the suspenders were a precaution
to steady the tower in case it unexpectedly teetered.
	   Once the cables are in place, which should be just before
Christmas, workers will start gradually removing about 20
centimeters (8 inches) of soil from underneath the tower to allow
it to settle better and lean less. It now leans 6 degrees _ four
meters (13 feet) off the perpendicular.
	   If the digging threatens to make the tower wobbly, the
suspenders would be pulled tight to hold it.
	   Burland said the chances of this happening were virtually nil.
	   The entire project is expected to take from seven to nine
months.
	   If all goes well, both the suspenders and the 9.3 tons of iron
slabs now attached to the tower to counter its lean will be
removed.
	   But what if thing don't go well and the tower topples?
	   ``If we did nothing that would happen,'' Burland said. ``The
worst we could do is do nothing.''
	   ``We considered all the projects that had been suggested over
the previous years and this is the only one that satisfied us. It
is the only one that can be implemented without damaging the
tower,'' he said.
	   Local residents weary of years of nondecisions are trying hard
to buy into the experts' optimism.
	   ``I hope the tower can be reopened again. But if it collapses,
we might as well all go home,'' said Laura Frangioli, 30, whose
family has owned a souvenir stand in front of the tower since she
was born.
	   Construction of the 55-meter (180-foot) high tower began in
1173. The soil underneath it gave way when it was just 10.5 meters
(34 feet) high, starting on its centuries-long tilt. Architects
compensated, managing to complete it around 1350.
	   Galileo is said to have used the tower to test his theories on
falling bodies.
	   So it's no wonder that engineers haven't even suggested
straightening it completely.
	   ``It is feasible technically, but it would be silly,'' said
Burland. ``Pisans don't want a straight tower, they want the
Leaning Tower of Pisa.''

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders failed Saturday to
narrow a rift between rich and poorer members over how to pay for
ambitious EU plans to almost double its membership by expanding
eastward.
	   Leaders insisted the split won't delay expansion and, in public
at least, frontrunners among the former-East bloc candidates seemed
reassured they would be allowed in early next decade.
	   ``We've finished ... with more optimism than before,'' said
Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek. ``There was no voice
against enlargement, and nobody said the process should be
delayed.''
	   At the heart of the debate is determination by Germany and other
rich EU nations to limit the amount they have to pay to help bring
the newcomers' post-communist economies up to Western standards.
	   ``Germany does not have unlimited resources,'' said Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder. ``Solidarity cannot be a one-way street.''
	   Backed by Britain, France and others, Germany wants to the keep
EU spending at it's current level of dlrs 100 billion a year.
	   Opposing the freeze are Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland _
the EU's poorest members _ who fear the EU aid that has played a
vital role in boosting their economies will be diverted eastward
unless the budget is substantially increased.
	   After two-days of talks dominated by the budget wrangle, the
only thing the leaders could agree on was to reaffirm March 1999 as
the deadline for wrapping up a deal.
	   ``Negotiations will continue ... they will be the most difficult
that Portugal has faced within the EU,'' said Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres.
	   Gathered in the Hofburg Imperial Palace from where Austria's
Habsburg emperors once ruled much of Eastern Europe, EU leaders
played down fears enlargement will be delayed if they can't clinch
an agreement by the time they meet next March in Brussels, Belgium.
	   ``We have absolutely to de-dramatize this question of dates,''
said EU Commission President Jacques Santer. ``This is an
irreversible process, everybody wants enlargement.''
	   Nevertheless the EU refused again to set target dates for the
expansion. ``We can't yet set a date, but it will be soon,'' said
French President Jacques Chirac. ``They should join as soon as
possible, but it poses economic problems. It's really not in their
interest to go too fast.''
	   The EU started formal membership talks this autumn with Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus. Czech
Prime Minister Milos Zeman said his country hoped to join by 2004,
Slovenia's Drnovsek mentioned 2002.
	   Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Bulgaria were told in
March they need more time to prepare for membership, but EU Foreign
Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek said leaders could likely
decide a year from now to add some of them to the frontrunner list.
	   Complicating the EU preparations for expansion is French
resistance to cuts in the EU's dlrs 44 billion farm subsidy-budget,
which are needed if the entry of Poland's 4 million farmers is not
to cause overload.
	   The EU summit presented a more united front on other issues.
	   There was broad support for Franco-British proposals to develop
a common European defense capability within NATO that would allow
the EU to tackle regional crises like those in Bosnia and Kosovo
without having to rely on American help.
	   ``We have decided to to move closer on defense ... toward a
strong European identity on security policy,'' said Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima, who chaired the meeting.
	   The leaders also drew up preparations for ``employment pact'' to
coordinate policies for getting the EU's 16.6 million jobless back
to work, perhaps by setting job-creation targets.
	   ``There's a need for more precise objectives,'' said French
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. ``We must set out better guidelines
for employment.''

Fighting high infant death rate, Turkey taking birth control

lessons door to door &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's Health Ministry plans to send out
volunteers to teach sex education door to door, the Yeni Yuzyil
daily reported Saturday.
	   The volunteers will distribute information on contraception and
basic tenets of reproductive health in 21 provinces, mainly to
women.
	   The protocol for the roughly dlrs 12 million outreach program
was signed Friday. It is supported by the U.S.-based Willows
Foundation, the report said.
	   Past attempts by the government to increase awareness of
contraceptive methods have failed, especially in the traditional
and poverty-stricken southeast.
	   The infant mortality rate is over 10 times higher in Turkey's
southeast than in developed countries, with 80 to 100 babies out of
1,000 dying each year due to repeated pregnancies and lack of
medical care.
	   According to UNICEF, Turkey's annual population growth rate
between 1980 and 1996 is approximately of 2.1 percent, more than
twice that of the United States and four times the growth rate of
France.

Two to appear in court on federal fraud charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ A former government
official and a contractor will appear in court Wednesday to face
federal charges of bribery, conspiracy and fraud involving
hurricane relief funds.
	   Former Public Works Commissioner Ann Abramson and St. Croix
contractor Berthill Thomas were named in a 10-count indictment.
They were accused of conspiring to give Abramson a dlrs 6,500
kickback for ensuring that Thomas got a contract for repairing a
roof at the Department of Finance office in St. Thomas that was
damaged by Hurricane Marilyn in 1995.
	   They are also charged with submitting false invoices for the
repair work.
	   Both face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of
dlrs 250,000.

EU seeks wine compromise in trade talks with South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Portuguese prime minister, ADDS
that South African officials could not immediately be reached for
comment. &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ In a dispute with South Africa over wine
labels, European Union leaders endorsed a compromise Saturday that
would allow South African vintners to keep using the names
``sherry'' and ``port'' in their home market.
	   Four years of tortuous negotiations have brought the EU and
South Africa close to a market-opening agreement that would phase
out duties on 90 percent of their dlrs 19 billion-a-year, two-way
trade.
	   But efforts to finalize the deal had snagged on Spanish and
Portuguese objections to South African vintners calling their
fortified wines sherry or port, names derived from Iberian cities.
	   Under the compromise, the Union would allow South Africa to
continue using the names in domestic and regional markets for at
least 13 years, pending a review, EU chief negotiator Philip Lowe
said.
	   The EU also offered to let in more South African wine imports.
In return, the EU wants a pledge that South Africa recognize in
principle that port and sherry are exclusively European terms.
	   South African officials could not immediately be reached for
comment on the proposal.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela had insisted in a letter
to EU leaders last week that vintners in his country be allowed to
use the names for the South African and neighboring markets.
	   ``For the ordinary population, the agreement cannot be concluded
by us surrendering the household names in southern Africa of our
own port and sherry,'' Mandela wrote.
	   South African wine producers say sales of their wine labeled
port or sherry are worth about 750 million rand (dlrs 123 million),
of which 13 percent comes from exports.
	   South Africa claims to have used port and sherry labels for
fortified wines for 300 years but has agreed to stop using the
terms for exports to Europe and phase them out in most other
foreign markets.
	   Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said he hoped the
latest proposal could lead to a deal by the year's end.
	   ``With good will all 'round we can reach an agreement,'' he
said.
	   The deadlock has raised tensions among the EU leaders, who gave
Mandela a pledge in June to wrap up the trade deal by the end of
the year.
	   ``I am really angry. It is ridiculous ... to see the trade
negotiations drag on and on for months,'' Dutch Prime Minister Wim
Kok said.
	   European nations are fiercely protective of their exclusive
claims to ancient wine labels. The Iberians argue only Spain can
produce sherry and only wines from the Portuguese city of Oporto
can be labeled as port.
	   Their stance reflects French insistence this week that a Swiss
village called Champagne stop using its name on wine labels, before
the EU concluded a trade deal with Switzerland.

Palestinians quell violence ahead of Clinton visit

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Fluttering over Bethlehem's Manger
Square, the U.S. red, white and blue jostles the Palestinian red,
white, black and green. Atop Jerusalem telephone poles, the Stars
and Stripes gently lap Israel's Star of David.
	   Roads were ready Saturday for the presidential motorcade in
Israel and the Palestinian areas _ but Bill Clinton faces a bumpy
ride, with violence dogging Mideast peace efforts hours before his
plane lands.
	   Residents of Bethlehem strung a banner across the entrance to
their city reading ``Bill Clinton: Welcome to Palestine,'' a marked
reminder that the Palestinians hope to declare statehood by May _ a
plan Israel says would kill chances for peace.
	   Above the bannner, a family decorated their balcony for
Christmas _ on Monday, Clinton is to light the Palestinian-grown
Christmas tree in Manger Square up the street.
	   Minutes later, masked Palestinian youths chanting ``Long Live
Palestine!'' marched towards Israeli troops guarding the entrance
to the city, and began lobbing stones and firebombs.
	   The family retreated into their apartment; the troops responded
with rubber bullets and soon, the banner welcoming Clinton was
enveloped in wisps of tear gas.
	   Seven Palestinians were injured in the clash before Palestinian
police quelled the riot.
	   That was a sign of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
determination to smooth the Clinton visit _ Palestinian
authorities, while disclaiming responsibility for the recent
upsurge in violence, have done little to contain it.
	   Clinton's visit was meant to celebrate the U.S.-brokered
agreement achieved at Wye River in October; instead, Clinton will
now try to salvage it.
	   The Palestinians are angry that Israel refuses to release
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities and has instead
released mostly common criminals to meet its prisoner release
commitments.
	   Two Palestinian protesters killed in clashes Friday in the
Palestinian-administered town of Qalqilya were buried Sunday.
	   The release of the prisoners ``would be a real indication Israel
is implementing the Wye Memorandum,'' Arafat said in Gaza after
discussing the prisoners issue with Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawmeh.
	   Palestinians aiming their slingshots at Israeli troops in
Bethlehem said they were not opposed to the Clinton visit.
	   ``I'm protesting by throwing stones so that my brother will be
released from prison,'' said 18-year-old Khaled Dakakta, slingshot
in hand. ``This is not timed for Clinton ... but we will not stop
until they will be free.''
	   The highlight of the visit will be Clinton's attendance at a
meeting of the Palestine National Council on Monday evening,
intended to abrogate clauses in the Palestinian charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from
hard-liners who may bring down his government unless he scraps Wye,
has said he will not go ahead with a planned withdrawal from
further West Bank territory unless the offending passages are
abrogated in a clear-cut vote.
	   Arafat says that ``affirmation'' is enough. Asked what that
means, he said Saturday that ``we are not in need of a vote.''
	   Although he likely has a majority behind him, Arafat may be
backing off a vote because he lacks the numbers to get the required
two-thirds quorum of the 600-member PNC to attend Monday's meeting.
	   On Saturday, 104 rejectionists said they would not attend the
meeting on principle; Israel has refused to allow some other PNC
members into Gaza.
	   Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said that there would no
assessment of whether there was a quorum.
	   Arafat said he had accepted a U.S. proposal for a trilateral
meeting after the PNC meet _ but that Israel had yet to respond.
	   Netanyahu is unlikely to attend such a meeting unless he is
satisfied with the PNC results.
	   In a pamphlet published Saturday, the militant Islamic group
Hamas dismissed Clinton as ``an enemy of the Arabs'' who is
arriving to ``personally supervise in the direst way the
destruction of the Palestinian charter.''
	   Hamas warned Arafat to release its leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin,
from house arrest by Dec. 25 _ otherwise it would carry out attacks
against Israel.
	   After Saturday's rioting, Bethlehem residents returned to
preparing for Clinton's visit _ and for Christmas. Municipal
workers used a cherry picker to attach tinsel and colored bulbs
	   Locals shopping for presents mingled with U.S. agents securing
the site.
	   ``I wish that Mr. Clinton could make Netanyahu release our
prisoners and move forward with the peace process,'' said one
shopper, Georgina Khoury.
	   For Halil Tamari, Clinton's presence was symbol enough.
	   ``It's a dream come true that the leader of the world, the
leader of the United states is visiting the country now called
Palestine,'' he said.

Manchester United back on top despite draw; Chelsea draws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ There's a new leader in English soccer, and it's a
familiar name: Manchester United.
	   The world's richest club, Manchester United got a 2-2 draw
Saturday at Tottenham, but United should have had a victory as it
blew a 2-0 lead on two headers in the last 20 minutes by
Tottenham's Sol Campbell.
	   United played the last 50 minutes a man short after Gary Neville
picked up his second yellow card.
	   Chelsea also blew its chance to move to the top of English
soccer for the first time since 1989, drawing 2-2 with Derby when
substitute Dean Sturridge scored in second-half injury time to
equalize for the Rams.
	   Manchester United leads with 30 points, ahead of Aston Villa on
goal difference, also with 30. Villa, the leaders all season, could
regain the No. 1 spot in its home match Sunday with Arsenal.
	   Chelsea holds third place with 29 points followed by
Middlesbrough (27), Leeds (26), Arsenal (26), West Ham (26) and
Leicester (24).
	   Middlesbrough, promoted back to the Premier League this season,
won 1-0 at home over West Ham and dominated the match with the
winner from Brian Deane in the 40th.
	   In other Premier League games Saturday: Blackburn 0, Newcastle
0; Everton 1, Southampton 0; Leicester 3, Nottingham Forest 1;
Sheffield Wednesday 3, Charlton 0.
	   On Sunday, Aston Villa and Arsenal square off with Liverpool
playing at Wimbledon. In Monday's only match, Leeds plays host to

Poiree, Forsberg win in Biathlon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOCHFILZEN, Austria (AP) _ France's Raphael Poiree Saturday won
a biathlon 10-kilometer-sprint World Cup event, holding off Olympic
champion Ole Einar Bjoerndalen easily with perfect shooting.
	   The overall World Cup leader, Sweden's Magdalena Forsberg, edged
France's Corinne Niogret by 12.7 seconds to win a women's 12.5
kilometer event.
	   Poiree, who won silver to the Norwegian's Olympic gold, took
advantage of his rival's several misses to beat Bjoerndalen. He
finished in 33 minutes 43.5 seconds to 34:31.8.
	   The triumph pulled Poiree even with Bjoerndalen at 56 points in
the overall standings after two events.
	   Germany's Sven Fischer was third in 34:38.3 followed by Norway's
Halvard Hanevold at 34:39.8.
	   Forsberg continued to lead the overall standings over Niogret
with 60 to 52 points.
	   The Swede finished in 32:47.0 while Niogret was at 32:59.7.
Third went to Germany's Simone Greiner-Petter-Memm at 33:19.1 and
Norway's Ann Elen Skjelbreid at 33:32.7.

Palestinians quell violence ahead of Clinton visit

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Fluttering over Bethlehem's Manger
Square, the U.S. red, white and blue jostles the Palestinian red,
white, black and green. Atop Jerusalem telephone poles, the Stars
and Stripes gently lap Israel's Star of David.
	   Roads were ready Saturday for the presidential motorcade in
Israel and the Palestinian areas _ but Bill Clinton faces a bumpy
ride, with violence dogging Mideast peace efforts hours before his
plane lands.
	   Residents of Bethlehem strung a banner across the entrance to
their city reading ``Bill Clinton: Welcome to Palestine,'' a marked
reminder that the Palestinians hope to declare statehood by May _ a
plan Israel says would kill chances for peace.
	   Above the bannner, a family decorated their balcony for
Christmas _ on Monday, Clinton is to light the Palestinian-grown
Christmas tree in Manger Square up the street.
	   Minutes later, masked Palestinian youths chanting ``Long Live
Palestine!'' marched towards Israeli troops guarding the entrance
to the city, and began lobbing stones and firebombs.
	   The family retreated into their apartment; the troops responded
with rubber bullets and soon, the banner welcoming Clinton was
enveloped in wisps of tear gas.
	   Seven Palestinians were injured in the clash before Palestinian
police quelled the riot.
	   That was a sign of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
determination to smooth the Clinton visit _ Palestinian
authorities, while disclaiming responsibility for the recent
upsurge in violence, have done little to contain it.
	   Clinton's visit was meant to celebrate the U.S.-brokered
agreement achieved at Wye River in October; instead, Clinton will
now try to salvage it.
	   The Palestinians are angry that Israel refuses to release
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities and has instead
released mostly common criminals to meet its prisoner release
commitments.
	   Two Palestinian protesters killed in clashes Friday in the
Palestinian-administered town of Qalqilya were buried Sunday.
	   Approximately 10,000 people attended the funeral of Kamal Adwan,
21, in Qalqilya. Some carried Palestinian flags and chanted
``Revenge!''; others chanted ``No sacrifice is too great for the
prisoners.''

Niccum and McClain continue ominating in doubles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIGULDA, Latvia (AP) _ Christian Niccum and Matt McClain
continued their domination of World Cup luge racing Saturday by
winning their second event of the season and extending the overall
lead.
	   The duo were part of a gold-silver effort for U.S. doubles teams
as Olympic bronze-medal winners Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin
took second in a repeat performance from the opening World Cup race
at Igls, Austria.
	   Olympic gold medalist Silke Kraushaar similarly lead a German
1-2 finish in the women's singles ahead of Sylke Otto.
	   ``We have to succeed,'' said Niccum after teaming with McClain
for their third career World Cup win after taking four world junior
titles. ``We have good coaches, good support and sponsorship.
Everything right now is working for us. We have no choice but to do
well. And there's no pressure. We just get on the sled and go.''
	   Niccum and McClain, both 20, took the opening-run lead over
Grimmette and Martin and held on for victory by a scant .004 of a
second.
	   The American team was poised for a medal sweep with Olympic
silver medalists Chris Thorpe and Gordy Sheer third. But they hit
the right wall just below the start in the second leg and drifted
back to fifth place.
	   The winners were timed in 43.638 and 43.441 seconds for a
two-heat total of 1 minute, 27.079 seconds. They are atop the
standings with 260 World Cup points.
	   Grimmette and Martin are third overall with 212 points. Austrian
cousins Tobias and Markus Schiegl were the beneficiaries of the
error by Thorpe and Sheer and grabbed third. They are second
overall with 216 points.
	   Kraushaar's winning time was 1:27.102. Angelika Neuner of
Austria was third behind Otto, who leads the overall standings.
	   Erin Warren was the leading American (12th).

Iraqi minister says U.N. can enter Baath offices on condition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with minister on Baath Party offices inspection;
no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi Cabinet minister intervened
Saturday in the dispute over a U.N. bid to inspect the Baath Party
offices, saying such an inspection could take place if the owners
granted permission.
	   The offices of the ruling party that 12 U.N. inspectors tried to
enter Wednesday was a ``private house,'' Culture and Information
Minister Humam Abdel Khaliq told reporters.
	   ``Just like a house, if the owner allows them in, we (the
government) have no objection.''
	   A Baath Party official denied the inspectors' access to the
building in the Adhamiya district of Baghdad, saying they had to
submit a written request for what they were seeking. On Thursday, a
party leader, Latif Nsayyif Jassim, said the inspectors would never
be allowed to enter as the offices did not contain materials
relevant to their search.
	   Chief U.N. inspector Richard Butler accused the Iraqis of
blocking an ``absolutely legal'' inspection and said the offices
contained ``materials of significance.''
	   Speaking at the Journalists' Association in Baghdad, Khaliq said
the party offices did not belong to the government.
	   ``We have no say if (the inspectors) can enter or not,'' he
said.
	   His remarks were seen as as a government bid to distance itself
from the Baath Party's refusal to let the inspectors enter.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen has said that Iraq's denial
of access created a ``very serious situation,'' which could prompt
a no-notice military attack by the United States.
	   Meanwhile, U.N. inspectors in at least five vehicles went out
into the field Saturday for one of their last missions in the
current round of searches for Iraq's illegal weapons.
	   U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross refused to reveal the
inspectors' destinations, saying only they were conducting ``their
normal daily duties.''
	   Unconfirmed reports said the teams would visit sensitive sites
such as the defense industry's headquarters or offices related to
national security.
	   Neither the United Nations nor the Iraqi government would
comment on the report.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear programs and long-range missiles.
Until then, the U.N. Security Council will not lift an oil embargo
and other sanctions it imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   This week's searches, which are expected to end Monday, have
been the most intensive since Iraq allowed the inspectors to resume
work last month.
	   Iraq began curbing the inspections in August and blocked their
activities completely in October. However on Nov. 14, as the United
States and Britain began to prepare air strikes on Iraq, the
Baghdad government backed down and pledged full cooperation.
	   Chief inspector Butler is scheduled to file a report on Iraqi
cooperation to the U.N. secretary-general early next week.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A wealthy Russian businessman and alleged mafia
boss was returned to Moscow on Saturday, less than a day after he
was acquitted of charges that he belonged to a criminal
organization.
	   Geneva police said Sergei Mikhailov was sent back to Moscow
because his passport had expired and he lacked valid identity
papers.
	   Mikhailov's lawyer Pascal Maurer said it was a ``disguised
extradition and against the law'' because Russia hadn't asked for
his return.
	   Pascal Di Camillo, Geneva police spokesman, said Mikhailov
agreed to go and was sent back to Moscow aboard an Aeroflot
jetliner and that he had a safe-conduct pass from Russian
authorities.
	   But Maurer said he faces threats in his country and didn't want
to return, but to go instead to Hungary.
	   Citing insufficient evidence, a Swiss court on Friday cleared
Sergei Mikhailov, who had been jailed in Switzerland for two years,
of the criminal organization charge.
	   Mikhailov, 40, was also cleared of charges that he forged
documents, but he was found guilty of a lesser charge _ that he
violated strict Swiss property laws restricting foreign ownership
by buying a villa near Geneva.
	   Mikhailov told reporters at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport that
his trial had been ``absolutely just.''
	   ``I think it has great significance for the further business of
Russian businessmen abroad, because Russian businessmen,
journalists and various other groups of specialists were written
off as criminals and it became difficult to enter foreign
countries,'' Mikhailov said.
	   ``I think the trial provided pretty clear proof that Russians
are not just criminals; they can be businessmen who with their
abilities can help develop Russia's economy.''

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's culture minister is developing a new
concept for a Holocaust memorial in Berlin to remember victims of
the Nazis, Der Spiegel newsmagazine said Saturday.
	   In a report that is to appear in its Monday editions, Spiegel
said Culture Minister Michael Naumann favors a memorial with
changing exhibits that can be expanded through a ``Garden of
Reflection.''
	   A government spokesman in Bonn confirmed that Naumann was
working on a Holocaust memorial proposal, but said he couldn't
provide details because it was still incomplete.
	   According to the Hamburg-based Spiegel, Naumann wants to
coordinate the memorial proposal with the Holocaust Museum in
Washington, D.C., the Israeli memorial Yad Vashem and the Leo Baeck
Institute in New York.
	   Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl had favored a cemetery-like
monument design of 2,500 concrete pillars to be built in the heart
of Berlin, but Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, a member of Kohl's Christian
Democrats, is against the idea.
	   Diepgen wants to combine Steven Spielberg's archive of filmed
interviews of Holocaust survivors with the Topography of Terror, an
exhibit of Third Reich documents and photographs situated in the
cellar of the former Gestapo and the SS headquarters, where Nazis
tortured political prisoners.
	   Spiegel said the new center-left government is expected to have
its proposal for the memorial ready for a parliament decision the
middle of next year.
	   Plans for a national Holocaust memorial have been in contention
for 10 years, with politicians and intellectuals arguing over
whether a single, giant sculpture could adequately represent an
atrocity of such magnitude. Eleven million people were killed in
the Holocaust, 6 million of them Jews.

Iraqi minister says U.N. can enter Baath offices on condition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with minister on Baath Party
offices inspection; no pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi Cabinet minister intervened
Saturday in the dispute over a U.N. bid to inspect the Baath Party
offices, saying such an inspection could take place if the owners
granted permission.
	   The offices of the ruling party that 12 U.N. inspectors tried to
enter Wednesday was a ``private house,'' Culture and Information
Minister Humam Abdel Khaliq told reporters. ``Just like a house, if
the owner allows them in, we have no objection.''
	   A Baath Party official denied access to the building in the
Adhamiya district of Baghdad, saying they had to submit a written
request for what they were seeking. On Thursday, a party leader,
Latif Nsayyif Jassim, said the inspectors would never be allowed in
because the offices did not contain materials relevant to their
search.
	   Chief U.N. inspector Richard Butler accused the Iraqis of
blocking an ``absolutely legal'' inspection and said the offices
contained ``materials of significance.''
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs and long-range
missiles. Until then, the U.N. Security Council will not lift an
oil embargo and other sanctions it imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990, an invasion that triggered the Gulf War.
	   This week's searches, which are expected to end Monday, have
been the most intensive since Iraq allowed the inspectors to resume
work last month.
	   Iraq began curbing the inspections in August and blocked their
activities completely in October. However on Nov. 14, as the United
States and Britain prepared airstrikes on Iraq, the Baghdad
government backed down and pledged full cooperation.
	   Butler is scheduled to file a report on Iraqi cooperation to the
U.N. secretary-general early next week.
	   Speaking at the Journalists' Association in Baghdad, Khaliq said
the party offices did not belong to the government.
	   ``We have no say if (the inspectors) can enter or not,'' he
said.
	   His remarks were seen as as a government bid to distance itself
from the Baath Party's refusal to let the inspectors enter.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen has said that Iraq's denial
of access created a ``very serious situation,'' which could prompt
a no-notice military attack by the United States.
	   Meanwhile, U.N. inspectors in at least five vehicles went out
into the field Saturday for one of their last missions in the
current round of searches for illegal weapons.
	   U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross refused to reveal the
inspectors' destinations, saying only they were conducting ``their
normal daily duties.''
	   Unconfirmed reports said the teams would visit sensitive sites
such as the defense industry's headquarters or offices related to
national security.
	   Neither the United Nations nor the Iraqi government would
comment on the report.

Athletes who lost to doped swimmers will miss out on medals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS IOC ruling out any medals or other form or recognition &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
ruled out a bid Saturday to give U.S. and British Olympic swimmers
the medals _ or other forms or recognition _ of East Germans later
discredited for taking performance-enhancing drugs.
	   In a final ruling, the IOC executive board also rejected other
compensatory recognition that might have included certificates or
marking records with asterisks.
	   ``There is no legal basis to withdraw the medals or present
medals to other athletes,'' said IOC Director-General Francois
Carrard. ``Unfortunately, there are too many variables to attempt
to redraw Olympic history.''
	   Carrard said the IOC felt the only solution ``in the interest of
fair play'' would see athletes accused of using drugs donate their
medals to the Olympic museum.
	   He did not rule out athletes handing over their medals to beaten
competitors. When pressed, he said there would be no certificates
or other kinds of recognition.
	   ``The IOC expresses its regret to those athletes who competed in
good faith and could have been victimized by those who did not,'
Carrard said.
	   The IOC Juridical Committee found that it would ``create a lot
of new juridical problems'' if it were to reallocate or withdraw
the medals, change results and redetermine rankings, Carrard said.
	   The panel said a complaint from the U.S. and British Olympic
associations could have caused revisions back as far as the 1976
Montreal Olympics.
	   Dick Schultz, Executive Director of the U.S. Olympic Committee,
was disappointed and surprised the IOC issue a final ruling in just
one day.
	   ``We're very disappointed,'' he said. ``We had hoped there would
be at least some special recognition. The depth of our
disappointment is that there isn't any recognition of those
athletes.''
	   ``In one day,'' he added. ``I thought they might take a little
more time.''
	   Schultz said the USOC, which filed a petition on behalf of its
1976 swim team, said it might organize its own recognition
ceremony.
	   Recent studies have revealed that between 6,000 and 10,000
athletes were covered by systematic doping program that operated in
the former East Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Six former East German doctors and coaches have been convicted
this year on charges of administering steroids to young swimmers
without their knowledge.
	   The U.S. Olympic Committee was seeking ``appropriate medal
recognition'' for swimmers Linda Jezek, Lauri Siering, Camile
Wright and Shirley Babashoff, who lost out to the East Germans in
the women's medley relay at Montreal.
	   The British Olympic Association has filed a petition on behalf
of Sharron Davies, who won the silver medal in the 400-meter
individual medley at the 1980 Moscow Games.
	   Davies, speaking Saturday at the European short-course
championships in Sheffield, England, said getting recognition of
her situation would be almost as good as gold.
	   ``My aim was not to get the gold medal, that's not what I wanted
_ but official recognition in some way of what happened then,''
Davies said.
	   ``I certainly don't want to take medals away from anybody and
the East German swimmers are paying the price in ill-health. But it
was not them, it was the system.''

Chechen president calls up army reserves to fight crime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of Chechnya ordered a partial call-up
of army reserves on Saturday night in an effort to fight the crime
wave washing over the breakaway region in southern Russia, Russian
news agencies reported.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov intends ``to start a real
fight against crime, which has assumed proportions threatening the
state,'' Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev told Chechen
television, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``How many people must the bandits kill to make us lose our
patience and declare a real war on them?,'' Interfax quoted
Atgeriyev as saying. He said that those responsible for murdering
three Britons and a New Zealander in Chechnya last week must be
brought to justice.
	   It was unclear how many reservists were being called up. They
were instructed to report for duty on Sunday morning.
	   The announcement came on the same day as Russian security forces
freed a kidnapped Frenchman working for the U.N. refugee agency
after more than 10 months in captivity. Also Saturday, Chechen
Prosecutor-General Mansur Tagirov was released after apparently
being taken captive on Thursday.
	   At the time of his abduction, Tagirov was investigating the
deaths of the three Britons and the New Zealander: Peter Kennedy,
Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of Britain and Stanley Shaw of New
Zealand.
	   Gunmen abducted the four in Grozny at the beginning of October.
The four were beheaded, apparently after a botched attempt by
Russian security services to free them.
	   Atgeriyev said Friday that authorities had arrested a man who
has confessed to kidnapping the four foreigners. Chechen security
forces were still searching Friday for additional suspects as well
as the the bodies of the four foreigners. Only their severed heads
have been recovered.
	   Since Chechnya's two year independence war with Russia ended in
1996, the Caucasus region has been awash in violence as feuding
gangs wage bloody turf wars. Hundreds of people have been
kidnapped, mostly for ransom.

Chechen president calls up army reserves to fight crime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of Chechnya ordered a partial call-up
of army reserves on Saturday night in an effort to fight the crime
wave washing over the breakaway region in southern Russia, Russian
news agencies reported.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov intends ``to start a real
fight against crime, which has assumed proportions threatening the
state,'' Deputy Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev told Chechen
television, according to the Interfax news agency.

Row breaks out over ski bribery allegations
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The head of the family behind the
Fiat car company handed out free vans to secure votes to bring the
1997 skiing World Championships to an Italian Alpine resort, an
executive board member of the International Olympic Committee
claimed Saturday.
	   Marc Hodler, 80, the former head of the International Ski
Federation, said Gianni Agnelli had given cars to 19 small nations
during the campaign which led to the selection of the Italian
resort of Sestrieres.
	   He indicated the move had his tacit blessing as it thwarted the
efforts of an unnamed agent to sell the votes of the small
countries to the highest bidder.
	   Fiat issued a statement rejecting the allegations as
``completely false.''
	   The IOC disassociated itself from Hodler's allegations.
	   ``We are extremely sorry if these statements have caused pain
and embarrassment to the Agnelli family and Fiat,'' said IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch in a statement.
	   Holder's comments on the ski championships came as part of a
series of explosive allegations in which he charged that the IOC
movement was riddled with corruption, with agents demanding up to
dlrs 1 million to deliver votes.
	   The voting for the ski championships took place in Budapest in
1992. Sestrieres was up against the Swiss resort of Laax and
Garmisch Partenkirchen in Germany.
	   The Agnelli family owns Fiat and holds major interests in hotels
and real estate in Sestrieres. It also controls the company which
runs the ski lifts and cable ways in the area west of Turin and
neighboring France.
	   Hodler alleged that one of the other bidders paid out 800,000
Swiss francs (dlrs 615,000) to a lawyer from Luxembourg who
promised to deliver a package of 19 votes in exchange.
	   But the city _ which was not named _ only received three votes.
	   The reason, said Hodler, was that the 19 countries in question
had in the meantime been lured away by Agnelli's offer of a van.
	   ``They had paid 800,000 francs for nothing,'' said Hodler.
	   He voiced some sympathy for the predicament of the small
nations, saying they needed transport for the teams and equipment
and didn't enjoy dozens of free cars from sponsors as did big ski
nations like Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
	   ``I couldn't tell Mr. Agnelli that you aren't allowed to give
cars to the small nations who never have the chance to receive one
car free of charge.''
	   ``I have officially thanked Gianni Agnelli for having killed
agencies in skiing,'' he said.
	   The IOC statement later said that Hodler himself felt there had
been ``regrettable misunderstanding over his comments'' and he had
always ``commended the great services rendered by the Agnelli
family to the International Ski Federation and its sport.''
	   IOC director-general Francois Carrard said Hodler had approved
the IOC statement. Asked if this was the case, Hodler said he had
no comment.
	   ``Our behavior has always rigorously conformed with that laid
out in our contract as the official sponsor of the International
Ski Federation,'' said Fiat.
	   Marco San Pietro, representative of the bid by Turin for 2006
Winter Games said although Agnelli was supporting its bid, no
vehicles were being handed out.

Iraqi minister says U.N. can enter Baath offices on condition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with number of inspections on Saturday grafs
10-12; DELETES extra `as' graf 8, grafs speculating where
inspectors would go; no pickup &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi Cabinet minister intervened
Saturday in the dispute over a U.N. bid to inspect the Baath Party
offices, saying such an inspection could take place if the owners
granted permission.
	   The offices of the ruling party that 12 U.N. inspectors tried to
enter Wednesday was a ``private house,'' Culture and Information
Minister Humam Abdel Khaliq told reporters.
	   ``Just like a house, if the owner allows them in, we (the
government) have no objection.''
	   A Baath Party official denied the inspectors' access to the
building in the Adhamiya district of Baghdad, saying they had to
submit a written request for what they were seeking. On Thursday, a
party leader, Latif Nsayyif Jassim, said the inspectors would never
be allowed to enter as the offices did not contain materials
relevant to their search.
	   Chief U.N. inspector Richard Butler accused the Iraqis of
blocking an ``absolutely legal'' inspection and said the offices
contained ``materials of significance.''
	   Speaking at the Journalists' Association in Baghdad, Khaliq said
the party offices did not belong to the government.
	   ``We have no say if (the inspectors) can enter or not,'' he
said.
	   His remarks were seen as a government bid to distance itself
from the Baath Party's refusal to let the inspectors enter.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen has said that Iraq's denial
of access created a ``very serious situation,'' which could prompt
a no-notice military attack by the United States.
	   Meanwhile, 11 teams of U.N. inspectors searched 24 sites in Iraq
on Saturday, the head of the National Monitoring Directorate, Gen.
Hussam Mohammed Amin, reported.
	   The general did not identify the sites, but witnesses saw a
number of U.N. inspectors' vehicles outside the Iraqi Military
Industry Commission in Baghdad.
	   U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross refused earlier to say where the
inspectors were headed or how many teams were conducting searches.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear programs and long-range missiles.
Until then, the U.N. Security Council will not lift an oil embargo
and other sanctions it imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   This week's searches, which are expected to end Monday, have
been the most intensive since Iraq allowed the inspectors to resume
work last month.
	   Iraq began curbing the inspections in August and blocked their
activities completely in October. However on Nov. 14, as the United
States and Britain began to prepare air strikes on Iraq, the
Baghdad government backed down and pledged full cooperation.
	   Chief inspector Butler is scheduled to file a report on Iraqi
cooperation to the U.N. secretary-general early next week.

IOC official alleges widespread bribery in Olympic selection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with allegations against Italy in grafs 19-21; new IOC
reaction in 25th graf; Hodler proposal in grafs 26-29
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ A top IOC official on Saturday made
explosive allegations of widespread Olympic corruption, saying
agents demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver votes in the
selection of host cities.
	   Marc Hodler, a senior member of the International Olympic
Committee executive board, alleged malpractices in the bid
campaigns for the games of 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002.
	   In unprecedented allegations by an IOC official, Hodler said he
believed 5 to 7 percent of IOC members have solicited bribes. There
are currently 115 IOC members.
	   Hodler said a group of four agents, including one IOC member,
have been involved in promising votes for payment. He declined to
identify them.
	   ``The four agents try to make a living out of this,'' he said.
``I missed a chance to be a rich man. Some of the agents do the
following: they say, `I can offer this or that number of votes.'
	   ``The price would be between 500,000 dollars and 1 million
dollars for a number of votes, a bloc.''
	   Hodler added that the agents then charge the city winning the
bid ``something like 3 million to 5 million dollars.''
	   Hodler, an 80-year-old Swiss lawyer, said there is one agent who
boasts ``that no city has ever won the Olympic Games without his
help.''
	   ``No one can prove that,'' Hodler said. ``It could be
possible.''
	   He said he believed agents had been buying and selling votes for
the past 10 years.
	   ``There are four agents we know,'' he said. ``One is an IOC
member. He promises he will give enough votes so (the biddding
city) can win.''
	   Asked whether all Olympic votes are tainted, Hodler said, ``I
know of so many times. There is a good chance it is always the
case.''
	   ``To my knowledge, there has always, always been a certain part
of the vote given to corruption,'' he said.
	   Hodler said losing cities have told him there is a list of IOC
members who can be bought.
	   Hodler said he hasn't seen the list.
	   ``What I got is the number of people that clearly, regularly
asked for financial support,'' he said.
	   How many members were involved?
	   ``For me, I always said it is about 5 to 7 percent of the
membership,'' he said.
	   Hodler alleged that an IOC member from Italy is procuring votes
for Turin in the bid for the 2006 winter games, which will be
awarded by the IOC next June.
	   ``An IOC member is selling the Torino bid,'' he said.
	   He declined to identify the member, saying, ``Ask them what they
offered.''
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who has led the Olympic
movement since 1980, immediately disassociated himself from
Hodler's allegations.
	   ``The only official spokeman for the IOC executive board is
(director general) Francois Carrard,'' Samaranch said. ``All the
other comments are personal comments. They are not official
comments.''
	   Later, the IOC put out a written statement saying the
``executive board disassociated itself from allegations made by one
of its members with the Olympic bid process.''
	   Carrard said, ``These allegations come as a suprise to us. The
IOC executive board was surprised. I can't say more.''
	   Hodler, a former president of the international ski federation,
said he was coming forward with his allegations because he hopes
they will lead to reforms in the Olympic bid process.
	   Hodler said he is proposing that Olympic cities be selected by a
small group, including members of the IOC executive board, rather
than the full IOC membership.
	   He said members should be put under pressure to agree to the
change.
	   ``If he doesn't sign, he admits he's a crook,'' Hodler said.
	   Hodler's allegations, made to a group of reporters, came as the
IOC continued investigations into alleged financial misconduct by
the Salt Lake City group which won the bid for the 2002 games.
	   Hodler has described as a ``bribe'' the dlrs 500,000 scholarship
fund set up by Salt Lake which benefited the relatives of six IOC
members.
	   It also came as the former minister in charge of Sydney's 2000
Olympic bid revealed he was asked to offer bribes in exchange for
votes. Bruce Baird, the former New South Wales minister, said he
refused.
	   Asked whether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the 1996 games
was clean, Hodler said, ``Certainly not.''
	   John Krimsky, deputy secretary general of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, disputed Hodler's assertion.
	   ``There is no basis for the charges against Atlanta at this
point,'' Krimsky said. ``All these issues should be put to the IOC
review commission.''
	   Hodler also leveled allegations against the head of the Athens
bid which lost to Atlanta in the 1996 vote.
	   Hodler said he overheard Spyros Metaxa, a wealthy Greek
businessman who led the bid, describing Samaranch and IOC members
as ``stupid'' for imposing restrictions on the bidding process.
	   ``For me there is only one purpose: winning the games,'' Hodler
quoted Metaxa as saying. ``I will do whatever is necessary to win
the games _ if it costs me dlrs 100,000, dlrs 10 million or dlrs
100 million.''
	   Hodler said he didn't know of any misconduct in Athens'
successful bid for the 2004 games.
	   Asked whether Sydney's election for the 2000 games was clean,
Hodler said, ``I would be surprised. I know what happened but I
don't want to disclose it.''
	   ``I can't imagine that Sydney is different from the others,'' he
said. ``Sydney pretends it is completely clean, clean, clean.''
	   The committee which won the 1998 games for Nagano ``certainly
had to do things which are not legitimate,'' Hodler said.
	   Hodler contested the argument by the current Salt Lake
organizing committee that it was not directly involved in the
controversial scholarship program and that the onus was on former
bid chief Thomas Welch.
	   ``Yesterday the lawyer of Salt Lake City said, `Everything had
been done by Tom Welch, who is not there any more. We know
nothing.' My experience is that this is not true.''
	   The controversy centers on scholarships _ including tuition
assistance and athlete training programs _ paid to relatives of IOC
members by the Salt Lake bid committee.
	   From 1991 to 1995, the committee _ under the direction of Welch
_ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships to 13 individuals _ six
of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa.
	   The current SLOC president, Frank Joklik, was chairman of the
bid committee at the time. SLOC vice president Dave Johnson was
also a high official on the bid committee.
	   Hodler said the blame shud be on those ``who put pressure'' on
Salt Lake to offer the scholarship funds.
	   ``Nobody blames Salt Lake City,'' he said. ``We blame those
voters who can be bought _ not Salt Lake City. They were a victim.
We should thank them for not paying money _ only scholarships.''
	   Joklik on Saturday denied any payment for votes.
	   ``I don't even know what agents are,'' he said.

World Council of Churches approves strategy to seek Christian
</HEADLINE>
unity &QL; 
 &UR; By RICHARD N. OSTLING &QC; 
 &UR; AP Religion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The assembly of the World Council of
Churches endorsed work Saturday that would aim for the
establishment of a broad new ``forum'' including Catholics,
Pentecostals, Evangelicals and indigenous Third World churches that
are not members of the council.
	   Potentially, the forum could be one of the most important steps
toward Christian unity since the formation of the WCC itself 50
years ago.
	   The 960 Protestant and Orthodox delegates from 112 nations made
the decision after defeating a German bid to gut the proposal, and
despite warnings that the new entity would weaken the WCC itself.
	   The assembly also tackled the WCC's internal tensions,
establishing a commission to deal with walkouts, boycotts, and
complaints from Orthodox churches that think the WCC is
increasingly run by Western Protestant liberals.
	   The delegates also voted to form a ``joint working group'' with
world Pentecostalism that would parallel the contact it maintains
with the Roman Catholic Church.
	   The idea of the broadest possible ``forum of Christian churches
and ecumenical organizations'' emerged early this year from the
WCC's self-examination of its progress and problems. The WCC
currently encompasses some 350 to 450 million believers, which
means the vast majority of Christians worldwide are outside its
ranks and unlikely to join any time soon.
	   WCC leaders decided it was time to seek a more comprehensive
vehicle to express unity among all Christians.
	   As for defining ``Christian,'' the WCC plan limits participation
to those ``confessing the Lord Jesus Christ as God and Savior
according to the Scriptures and seeking to fulfill together the
common calling to the glory of the one God, Father, Son and Holy
Spirit.''
	   Such language apparently reflected Orthodox opposition to
involvement by groups like the Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses that
consider themselves Christian but reject classical definitions of
Jesus Christ as God.
	   The WCC, a controversial organization in some circles, will not
organize the forum project. Rather, it plans to participate
alongside leaders of Roman Catholics, Pentecostal and Evangelical
organizations, indigenous groups in Africa and elsewhere, the
``Christian world communions'' such as the international bodies of
Anglicans, Baptists, Lutherans and Methodists, national church
councils and other organizations interested in ecumenical
discussions.
	   The plan is purposely vague at this point, but essentially it
involves informal get-togethers of perhaps 150 to 250 international
Christian leaders with no fixed agenda, no pronouncements on
political or other controversies, and no bureaucracy managing
programs between meetings. In other words, not the WCC. Proponents
hope the first such meeting will occur as soon as 2001.
	   A pivotal question at this early stage is whether the Vatican
will take an active part. The WCC sent basic information on the
plan and Rome has already sent a reply.
	   That letter has not been made public, said Bishop Mario Conti of
Aberdeen, Scotland, leader of the 23 official Catholic observers
here.
	   But he said generally the Vatican wants more information on the
basis for membership and whether the forum would work against the
WCC or do what the WCC itself is really incapable of doing.
	   Speaking personally, Conti expressed reservations. ``One road to
unity is that if there's to be a major reunion it's through an
ecumenical council,'' meaning a formal gathering of bishops
including the Pope.
	   ``Another route would be a great jamboree, what one English
paper called a fun fair in referring to this assembly. I would say
the whole question has to be articulated much more clearly,'' he
said.
	   There was considerably more clarity on the WCC's Orthodox plan.
The Orthodox demanded a special commission to hear their complaints
and to investigate a thorough overhaul of the WCC. They got it,
with some Protestant grumbling but no real difficulty.
	   On Sunday the assembly celebrates the WCC's 50 years of life,
with South Africa's President Nelson Mandela as the star speaker.
The meeting concludes Monday with action on public issues,
including international debt and the status of Jerusalem.

Turkey disappointed by no change in EU stance on candidacy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey expressed disappointment Saturday
that a European Union summit had produced no signs the 15-member
bloc was getting any closer to admitting Turkey. It said it would
stick to its policy of only limited dialogue with the EU.
	   EU leaders held a two-day summit in Vienna, where talks focused
on how to pay for an upcoming round of EU enlargement.
	   The final, 50-page statement issued Saturday accorded one
paragraph to relations with Turkey, underlining ``the great
importance it attaches to the further development of relations
between the EU and Turkey, taking forward the European strategy to
prepare Turkey for membership.''
	   Turkey refused to attend the summit and said this week it
expected a formal and legal acknowledgment of its candidacy.
	   Foreign Ministry Spokesman Necati Uktan told reporters Saturday
that since Turkey's position had not been clarified, it would
continue in its policy of rejecting dialogue with the EU on the
very issues cited by the union as blocking its candidacy: its
difficult relations with Greece, the division of Cyprus between
Turkish and Greek Cypriot republics, and Turkey's poor human rights
record.
	   Turkey lost out in the first round of enlargement talks at the
Luxembourg Summit last year. Cyprus and 10 Eastern European
countries were admitted.
	   Ever since, its position as a only potential candidate has
angered the Turks, who say they are being discriminated against as
Muslims trying to join a Christian club.
	   A recent EU progress report on candidate countries, which
included Turkey, had led Ankara to hope for a change of the EU's
position.

	   Add details of English Premier League games:
 &UR; Blackburn 0, Newcastle 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Blackburn's Jeff Kenna missed a chance to give new coach Brian
Kidd a win in his first official game when his penalty kick went
off the post. Kenna also missed a penalty kick against Newcastle
earlier this month in a League Cup match. In truth, the 0-0 draw
was about right in a drab match as Blackburn stayed in 18th place _
two off the bottom.
 &UR; Derby 2, Chelsea 2 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Horacio Carbonari gave Derby a 1-0 lead in the 26th, but Chelsea
_ unbeaten in the league since a loss in the season-opener _
rallied with goals by Tore Andre Flo (55) and Gustavo Poyet (59)
and looked set to move into first place. But substitute Dean
Sturridge scored in second-half injury time to equalize.
 &UR; Everton 1, Southampton 0 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Ibrahima Bakayoko scored in the 31st as Everton picked up a
victory as the Merseysiders moved near the middle of the table. The
Ivory Coast striker has blossomed since Duncan Ferguson was sold to
Newcastle last month. Southampton stayed in last place and looks
doomed to relegation.
 &UR; Leicester 3, Nottingham Forest 1 (1-1) &QC; 
	   Pierre Van Hooijdonk gave Forest a 1-0 lead in the 14th, his
third goal since re-joining the club. But Emile Heskey tied in the
43rd and Matt Elliott gave Leicester a 2-1 lead on a penalty in the
55th. Three minutes later, Van Hooijkonk got a red card for violent
conduct, setting the stage for Steve Guppy's winner in the 75th.
 &UR; Middlesbrough 1, West Ham 0 (1-0) &QC; 
	   This was Paul Gascoigne's best game since returning from drug
and alcohol treatment. Gascoigne commanded midfield and _ after
blowing several leads in recent games _ Middlesbrough held on after
Brian Deane's strike in the 40th. Boro holds fourth place with 27
points.
 &UR; Sheffield Wednesday 3, Charlton 0 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Andy Booth (13), Benito Carbone (64) and Petter Rudi (77) scored
for Wednesday as Charlton _ promoted this season to the Premier
League _ suffered its seventh straight game without a victory.
 &UR; Tottenham 2, Manchester United 2 (2-0) &QC; 
	   This game was as hard-fought as any all season. Norway's Ole
Gunnar Solskjaer gave United a 2-0 lead on goals in the first 18
minutes. United was forced to play the last 50 minutes a man short
after Gary Neville picked up his second yellow card. It proved too
much as Sol Campbell scored on headers in the 70th and 90th to
equalize.

Libyan oil minister calls for `drastic' cut in production
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya's oil minister said Saturday that
``drastic measures'' must be taken to reduce output by
oil-producing countries to stem the fall in world prices.
	   Producers should cooperate with the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to boost prices, the Libyan minister, Abdalla
Salem El-Badri, told reporters at a regional oil meeting.
	   ``Efforts are needed to stop that decline. Unless quick and
drastic measures are taken immediately to reduce the reserve and
make further cuts the situation will worsen,'' he said.
	   El-Badri is the chairman of the 11-member Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is holding its one-day annual
conference here.
	   The focus of the conference this year is the record low prices
caused by a slump in demand in recession-hit Asia and warmer than
usual winters in the West. The losses are battering the economies
of petroleum dependent countries, especially Libya and the Gulf
states.
	   OAPEC includes the Arab OPEC members, Saudi Arabia, United Arab
Emirates, Qatar, Libya, Kuwait, Iraq and Algeria. Its non-OPEC
members are Oman, Egypt and Syria.
	   El-Badri said OPEC has lost dlrs 56 billion so far during the
price crisis, which has seen the January futures contracts for
Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fall to a record low of
dlrs 9.92 a barrel.
	   El-Badri made no mention of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's call
on Thursday for a complete production halt by OPEC nations during
the winter.
	   When asked whether OPEC members Venezuela and Iran were to blame
for OPEC's lack of progress in implementing further cuts, El-Badri
replied: ``I'm not accusing anyone, but the problem exists, and
every country is affected by it.''
	   He said that oil producers are suffering because the raw
materials and equipment they import are expensive, while oil is
selling very cheaply.
	   ``This equation is unjust,'' he said. ``It harms the producers.
They have to wake up and know there is a danger, because it affects
their people and there will be social catastrophes very soon.''
	   Last month, El-Badri called for an additional 1 million to 1.5
million barrels a day OPEC production cut, but ministers failed to
act on the measure.
	   On Wednesday, Gulf Arab OPEC states unilaterally decided to
extend until the end of 1999 a one-year cut in oil production
agreed upon by OPEC and non-OPEC members.
	   Under the agreement, which is scheduled to end in June, OPEC is
reducing its production by 2.6 million barrels a day and non-OPEC
members are cutting output by 700,000 barrels a day.

Mexicans celebrate anniversary of Virgin of Guadalupe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ With dancing, song and devotions, hundreds of
thousands of Mexicans gathered Saturday to mark the 467th
anniversary of the apparition of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's
version of the Virgin Mary.
	   Millions of worshipers have passed through Mexico City's
Basilica of Guadalupe in the last four days, just weeks before Pope
John Paul II is scheduled to visit the shrine on a hilltop where
the Virgin appeared to Indian farmer Juan Diego in 1531.
	   ``This day honors the Mother of Mexico,'' Papal Nuncio Justo
Mullor said during a visit to the basilica. Cardinal Norberto
Rivera presided over a Mass to the Virgin.
	   The sheer numbers of faithful were impressive, as were the means
they used to travel to the modern basilica: More than 3 million
worshipers have passed through the basilica in recent days, part of
3,119 separate pilgrimages from all corners of Mexico, said Ricardo
Gerardo Higuera, head of planning for the celebration.
	   At least 27,000 people traveled to the shrine on bicycles, some
from hundreds of miles (kilometers) away. Two hundred and sixty
people fainted, collapsed or were treated for knee injuries during
the pilgrimage, local authorities reported.
	   Many traveled the last yards (meters) to the shrine on their
knees, to fulfill pledges made to the Virgin, in some cases years
ago.
	   Juan Sanchez Miranda, a graying farmer from neighboring Puebla
state, clutched a portrait of the Virgin of Guadalupe as he
struggled up the basilica steps.
	   ``Three years ago, I got drunk and fought with my children, and
they all left,'' Sanchez Miranda said. He is now reconciled with
his children, who live in New York, he said.
	   ``Now, I haven't drunk for three years,'' he said. ``Faith is
what makes us live.''
	   Other pilgrims danced, beat drums and sang to express their
devotion, in costumes ranging from traditional Indian garb from
several ethnic groups to allegorical and fanciful masks and hats.
	   Pope John Paul II is scheduled to visit Mexico Jan. 22-26, and
will attend masses at the Basilica and other locations.
	   The mixed-race or mestiza Virgin of Guadalupe appeared on a
barren hillside where the Aztecs had worshipped Tonantzin, their
most important goddess, just 10 years after the Spanish conquered
Mexico.
	   In what is referred to as a miracle, the image of the Virgin
appeared on a cloak Juan Diego was wearing, and is preserved in the
basilica.

Minister vows to increase police presence to combat lawlessness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ Home Affairs Minister Velon John
vowed to increase police presence on the streets and use ``creative
ruthlessness'' to combat a spate of violence he blamed largely on
gun battles among gangs.
	   In a televised address Friday night, John said criminals were
also committing robberies in which they sprayed gunfire with ``a
disturbing ease.''
	   In one recent incident mentioned by the minister, a gas station
owner was shot, beaten and robbed by two men dressed in the
uniforms of the island's Special Services Unit, a U.S.-trained
detachment of the police force.
	   In response to such incidents, John said police would be more
visible and would carry out operations that might inconvenience the
public.
	   ``But that is a small price to pay to rid the country of the
parasites that prey on the sinews and blood of the nation,'' he
said.

Kaiserslautern's amazing run continues with last-minute shot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ FC Kaiserslautern again pulled out a dramatic
victory Saturday, this time on Egyptian defender Hany Ramzy's
last-gasp goal that extended a Bundesliga winning streak to seven
matches.
	   Ranzy's 90th-minute goal, one of countless for the Red Devils
this season, allowed Kaiserslautern to creep within two points of
Bundesliga frontrunners Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich.
	   The two top teams face off Sunday.
	   Kaiserslautern, a master of winning ugly, this time seemed to
have complete control of Eintracht Frankfurt in a stellar
performance that could have been a rout.
	   But after Damir Stojak stunned the side by heading in an
equalizer in the 74th minute, Kaiserslautern again had to scramble
and rely on last-minute heroics.
	   Ranzy, an oft-critized player, snuck unnoticed down the sideline
in the waning seconds. Before the Frankfurt players woke up, he
sent the gamewinner flying into the net on one fluid kick off a
long pass.
	   ``I'm speechless,'' said Frankfurt interim trainer Bernhard
Lippert. ``We fought and played so hard in the second half.''
	   Kaiserslautern rival 1860 Munich, didn't fare as well as the
side let Schalke roar back from 0-2 down to salvage a 2-2 draw on a
last-minute own goal.
	   The result allowed the Red Devils to charge past them in the
table to third.
	   Michael Ballack, a rising star, shot Kaiserslautern into the
lead in the fourth minute. He stole the ball from a defender, faked
past two more Frankfurt players then capped his performance by
tunneling the goalie.
	   The amazing run of Kaiserslautern, whose player potential seems
unequal to its on-field success, continued with Ransy's goal.
	   The Red Devils burst from the second division last season to
steal away the Bundesliga title. This season, to most Germans'
amazement, the south Germany side strolled into the Champions
League quarterfinals.
	   Since Swiss midfielder Ciriaco Sforza dropped back to libero to
shore up a shaky defense, Kaiserslautern has been unbeatable: 10
wins and a draw in league and international play.
	   In other matches, Wolfsburg beat Duisburg 4-2, Werder Bremen and
VfB Stuttgart drew 2-2, Rostock beat Bochum 3-0 for a badly-needed
win and Freiburg edged Nuremberg 1-0.
	   On Friday, Hertha Berlin won its third straight with a 4-0
blasting of Hamburg and Borussia Dortmund's rise to the top stalled
again with a 1-1 draw against Moenchengladbach.
	   Schalke's prowress has returned as players come back from
injury, including UEFA Cup hero Marc Wilmonts.
	   The Belgium international sent a hard cross flying into the box
in the 89th minute, which Schalke player Marco Kurz accidentally
shouldered into the net in a duel with striker Martin Max.
	   That capped a furious second-half comeback by Schalke, with Sven
Kmetsch scoring the team's first goal. Markus Schroth in the 45th
and Harald Cerny in the 48th minute had given 1860 the lead.
	   Striker Fredi Bobic, booed by Stuttgart fans last weeks, fired a
69th goal that lifted his team to the 2-2 draw at Bremen.
	   Thomas Schneider had put Stuttgart up in the 21st minute, but a
lethargic Bremen side came alive for two sudden goals by Bernhard
Trares in the 62nd and Marco Bode three minutes later.
	   Oliver Neuville scored twice as Rostock, the league's only East
German team, picked up a badly needed win against Bochum.

Russian SU-33's exhibited at air show in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGALORE, India (AP) _ Thousands of spectators watched as an
Su-33 fighter jet flew overhead in the first international
exhibition of the Russian made aircraft outside Russia on Saturday.
	   The jets made several combat maneuvers, turns, loops, rolls and
tail slides, thrilling the crowd that had gathered to watch the
Aero India 98 air show at the Yehalanka Air Force station in the
southern city Bangalore.
	   The Indian government has contracted to buy 40 Sukhoi Su-30 jets
from Russia for dlrs 1.8 billion. Eight have already arrived in
India and the rest are expected to be delivered by the year 2000.
	   Alexander Barkovai, deputy general designer at the Sukhoi Design
Bureau said his country was keen to sell Su-33 versions of the
aircraft to India as well. The Su-33 were introduced into the
Russian combat inventory in August 1998.
	   India's Sukhoi Su-30 fighters are capable of delivering nuclear
weapons to neighboring Pakistan and deep into China, but their
range and flight time will be substantially enhanced when India
takes delivery of six Ilyushin Il-78 refueling tankers ordered from
Russia early this year.
	   India is among the biggest customers of the Russia's weapons
industry.

Policeman killed, 3 others wounded in clash with drug dealers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi drug dealers opened fire on
police in a raid Saturday, killing one officer and wounding three
others, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
	   The fire fight ended with the police arresting nine drug
traffickers in Tabuk, 1,310 kilometers (812 miles) northwest of the
Saudi capital of Riyadh, the agency said.
	   The agency said the dealers ``resisted the security men during
the raid by opening fire, forcing the raiding force to retaliate.''
	   Citing an unnamed official, the agency said Captain Mohammed
Abdel-Rahman al-Naqidan was killed in the clash. Three other
policemen were wounded and rushed to hospital.
	   The agency did not say what kind of drugs were involved nor if
any dealers were wounded.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for drug
trafficking and executions are carried out with a sword in public.

	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Milos Milosevic of Croatia, Martina
Moravcova of Slovakia and the Netherlands' 4x50 men's relay set
world marks Saturday, the second day of the European short-course
swim championships.
	   Milosevic swam 23.30 seconds to win the 50-meter butterfly,
breaking the old world record of 23.35 set by Russian Denis
Pankratov.
	   Moravcova won the 100 individual medley in 1:00.43, topping the
old record of 1:00.60 by China's Xiaowen Hu Chn. Moracvoca also set
a European record of 57.72 in winning the 100-meter butterfly.
	   The other mark went to the Dutch men, clocking a world-best time
of 1:26.99 in the 4x50.
	   Inge DeBruijn of the Netherlands also got a European record in
the 50 freestyle with a time of 24.38 in the prelims. DeBruijn had
also set a European record of 57.93 in 100 butterfly earlier in the
day, which was later broken by Moravcova.
	   On Friday, Germans Mark Warnecke and Thomas Rupprath set world
records. Warnecke won gold in a record time of 26.70 seconds in the
50-meter breaststroke, and Rupprath clocked 24.13 in winning the
50-meter backstroke.

 &UR; Student convicted of killing 13-year-old friend after dare &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) _ A young man who shot his 13-year-old
friend dead on a dare in January was convicted of manslaughter
Friday and faces up to 40 years in jail.
	   But the jury took only five minutes to decide against convicting
Jerry ``Jay'' Ogden of the more serious charge of second-degree
murder, said juror Dan Halferty. That charge carries a mandatory
life sentence.
	   ``It was difficult because we knew a 19-year-old was going to
jail,'' Halferty said.
	   Ogden, a former special education student who was 18 at the time
of the killing, showed no reaction when the jury delivered its
verdict. But he appeared stunned a short time later as he slouched
in a chair in a courthouse holding cell just before being taken to
prison.
	   The victim, Derek Pitre, was shot through the heart in the
carport of Ogden's Baton Rouge home after a series of dares
involving a baseball bat, a sword and kitchen knives, according to
the testimony of two boys who witnessed the killing.
	   The youths, ages 13 and 14, testified that Ogden got the
.22-caliber rifle after they told him he would not ``take them
out'' with the bat, sword and knives. Ogden loaded the rifle once,
ejected the bullet and loaded the gun again.
	   Pitre repeatedly told Ogden he would never shoot because they
were friends, Joey Peppers, Pitre's stepbrother, and Tony Stokes
told jurors.
	   Ogden replied, ``Are you sure?'' and aimed the gun toward Derek
without using the sights before firing a single shot.
	   Both boys also testified that they thought the shooting was an
accident at first, but later decided that Ogden meant to kill
Derek.
	   Defense attorney Floyd Falcon told jurors they not could find
Ogden guilty of second-degree murder when there was doubt among the
witnesses.
	   But prosecutor Kurt Wall argued that Ogden, who did not testify,
intended to kill or hurt Pitre after the series of dares.
	   ``His bluff was called several times,'' Wall said. ``He painted
himself into a terrible box, and he made a horrible decision that
cost Derek Pitre his life.''
	   The witnesses initial belief that the shooting is easy to
understand, Wall said.
	   ``They didn't want to believe that their friend could do this,
and in their minds, it just had to be an accident,'' he said.
	   The boy's father Greg Pitre, said was disappointed with the
verdict because he wanted Ogden convicted of the more serious
charge. Pitre plans to ask the judge to impose the maximum
manslaughter penalty.
	   Ogden ``has about 50 good years left. He should spend no less
than 30 of those years in prison,'' Pitre said.
	   State District Judge Tony Clayton will sentence Ogden after
reviewing a pre-sentencing report. Ogden had been out of jail on
bond.

Field of buyers for Bossier Medical Center down to one
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSSIER CITY, La. (AP) _ The field of companies in the running
to buy Bossier Medical Center is down to one.
	   Of the two businesses that bid to take over the hospital from
Bossier City's government, Schumpert Health System's proposal the
most attractive, said City Attorney Jimmy Hall.
	   The sale of the 175-bed hospital is not a sure thing.
Negotiations will follow to refine a deal for the Bossier City
Council's consideration. If a majority of council members approve,
the issue could go to voters as early as May 6.
	   This is not the first time the city government has explored
whether to stay in the hospital business. Schumpert's primary
competitor, Willis-Knighton Health System, has attempted many times
since 1994 to buy or lease Bossier Med. But the city rejected its
overtures, and voters never got the chance to decide the issue.
	   Willis-Knighton opened its hospital in Bossier in 1996. Since
then, Bossier Med's earnings have fallen from $3.3 million in 1995
to $785,000 in 1997. That's a 76 percent decrease.
	   The idea of a possible sale came up again June 18, when
Schumpert's parent company, Houston-based Sisters of Charity Health
Care System, requested talks to explore expanding the affiliation
it has had with Bossier Med since 1995. The overture set off a
process resulting in the call for bids.
	   Seven companies requested financial information and other
documents about Bossier Med. Ultimately, only Schumpert and
Universal Health Services, based in King of Prussia, Pa., submitted
proposals. Universal is one of the largest hospital management
companies in the nation and operates Doctors' Hospital in
Shreveport.
	   For now, the city isn't revealing details of either offer. The
Schumpert numbers won't be released unless the council approves a
deal.
	   Bossier City Council member David Jones said the Schumpert and
Universal bids differ significantly in everything from price to the
direction the company wanted to take the hospital.
	   Still, Hall stressed that Schumpert's bid is preliminary. The
company will have an opportunity to refine its offer within 45
days.
	   ``We have to go in and look at the books more closely to make
sure we are paying a fair value for the assets,'' said Schumpert
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Bob Wardwell.
	   Schumpert operates a 601-bed hospital, minor treatment centers
and doctors' clinics in Shreveport and wellness centers on both
sides of the Red River. The company's assets this past fiscal year
were more than $100 million, more than twice as much as Bossier
Med's assets in 1997. Sisters of Charity's assets totaled $1.4
billion in 1997. All three are nonprofit companies, as is
Willis-Knighton.
	   Wardwell said ownership by a large health system should help
solidify Bossier Med's future. Regulatory and economic changes have
made operating a standalone hospital increasingly difficult. A
larger system brings more financial resources as well as insurance
contracts.
	   The move could make Schumpert more competitive against
Willis-Knighton. That could be good for consumers facing spiraling
health-care costs.
	   ``It keeps the competitive forces in play in Bossier City,''
Wardwell said.
	   Willis-Knighton did not bid because the company did not want to
be bound by some of the terms in the city's request for proposals,
spokesman Guy Kinnebrew said.
	   One requirement calls on the buyer to continue operating Bossier
Med as an acute-care hospital with inpatient and outpatient
services for at least five years. The term, Kinnebrew said, would
have forced Willis-Knighton to duplicate services already offered
in its Bossier hospital about a mile away.
	   Making sure Bossier Med remains open as a full-service hospital
and keeps providing jobs in the community is a priority for Jones.
Bossier Med has about 530 full-time employees.

Primakov calls for quick passage of 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov expressed hope
Saturday that the legislature would pass the government's 1999
budget by the end of this month.
	   Primakov said he was open to proposals on modifying the budget
as long as they were aimed at increasing government revenues or
redistributing its expenditures.
	   ``I don't think any strategic concessions are possible,'' he
said in an interview with the ORT television station. ``The budget
is an honest one.''
	   The budget's reception in parliament is a key test for Primakov,
who was appointed in September after the previous government
devalued the ruble and defaulted on some debts, sending the economy
into a free fall.
	   Previous governments have battled the parliament for months to
get the annual budget passed. Yet Primakov may have an easier time
since his Cabinet has wide support in the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma. The Cabinet sent the draft budget to
the Duma on Friday night.
	   The draft budget forecasts revenues of 475 billion rubles (dlrs
22.6 billion at the exchange rate of 21 rubles to one U.S. dollar,
which Primakov said was the basis for the budget), and spending of
575 billion rubles (dlrs 27.38 billion).
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said the expected revenues
would cover all of Russia's domestic expenses _ but not the foreign
debt. So the draft calls for dlrs 7.2 billion in foreign loans, and
provides for repaying only dlrs 9.5 billion in foreign debts next
year, Zadornov said.
	   Primakov said that the government had ``reached an understanding
with the London Club on all fundamental issues and we are now
negotiating debt restructuring with the Paris Club.''
	   The two so-called clubs are groups of creditors holding debts
that Russia inherited from the Soviet Union. Servicing of the
Soviet-era debts makes up about half of what Russia owes next year.

Prime Minister asks university students to stop hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's prime minister on Saturday
called on university students to stop their hunger strike, saying
the government is already meeting some of their demands for better
conditions.
	   Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko said in a message the
students are justified in their requests and that the government
will find a way to meet them. Majko also said he was ready to meet
the students to discuss their demands.
	   Two months ago, he pointed out, the government pledged to invest
about dlrs 70,000 into improving conditions in the dormitories,
known informally as Student City.
	   Late Thursday, 40 students from Tirana university gathered in a
disco in the dormitory complex to stage the strike. Later, students
from Shkodra University, in the northern part of the country joined
in the protest.
	   Also Saturday, Majko sent message to Democratic Party leader
Sali Berisha, commemorating the eighth anniversary the Democratic
Party.
	   ``I hope in the future you and your collaborators will make
those principles on which the Democratic Party was founded eight
years ago into reality,'' Majko said.
	   According to the Information Ministry and the Democratic Party,
Berisha's son was interrogated by police Friday morning in
connection with student the hunger strike. Shkelzen Berisha, 20, is
thought to be a key member of the group organizing the protest
action.
	   Student boycotts and hunger strikes seven years ago were
instrumental in forcing Albania's last communist leader to call
multiparty elections, and the spread of organized student protests
significantly increased pressure on the government.
	   A hunger strike by students in the southern town of Vlora
preceded the failure of the government of Sali Berisha, who was
president of the country from 1992 to 1997. His government lost
power after pyramid schemes collapsed, creating anarchy and chaos.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A French United Nations official, who was held
captive in southern Russia for more than 10 months, was set free by
Russian security forces before dawn Saturday and flown to Geneva
for a reunion with his family and colleagues.
	   Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in the North Ossetia region, was seized
by three masked gunmen in the regional capital Vladikavkaz on Jan.
29.
	   Cochetel was freed about two minutes into the predawn operation
on the border between the republics of Chechnya and Ingushetia, but
a firefight broke out between the kidnappers and Russian security
forces, the Interfax news agency said. Cochetel was unharmed, but
he said three of the kidnappers had been killed.
	   In footage of the operation broadcast by Russia's NTV television
station, Cochetel was shown kneeling and crouching, with his hands
constrained behind his back by metal hand-cuffs, behind a white
van. Russian security officers in masks and camouflage stood over
him protectively, then dragged him away as gunfire erupted and
bullets bounced off the van.

Niccum, McClain lead American 1-2 finish in doubles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIGULDA, Latvia (AP) _ Christian Niccum and Matt McClain
continued their domination of World Cup luge racing Saturday,
winning their second event of the season and extending their
overall lead.
	   The duo led a 1-2 American effort with Olympic bronze-medal
winners Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin finishing second in a
repeat performance from the opening World Cup race at Igls,
Austria.
	   Olympic gold medalist Silke Kraushaar similarly lead a German
1-2 finish in the women's singles ahead of Sylke Otto.
	   ``We have to succeed,'' said Niccum after teaming with McClain
for their third career World Cup win after taking four world junior
titles. ``We have good coaches, good support and sponsorship.
Everything right now is working for us. We have no choice but to do
well. And there's no pressure. We just get on the sled and go.''
	   Niccum and McClain, both 20, took the opening-run lead over
Grimmette and Martin and held on for victory by a scant .004 of a
second.
	   The American team was poised for a medal sweep with Olympic
silver medalists Chris Thorpe and Gordy Sheer third. But they hit
the right wall just below the start in the second leg and drifted
back to fifth place.
	   The winners were timed in 43.638 and 43.441 seconds for a
two-heat total of 1 minute, 27.079 seconds. They are atop the
standings with 260 World Cup points.
	   Grimmette and Martin are third overall with 212 points. Austrian
cousins Tobias and Markus Schiegl were the beneficiaries of the
error by Thorpe and Sheer and grabbed third. They are second
overall with 216 points.
	   Kraushaar's winning time was 1:27.102. Angelika Neuner of
Austria was third behind Otto, who leads the overall standings.

Legion of Doom returns as Flyers reacquire Renberg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ The Philadelphia Flyers reunited their
``Legion of Doom'' line on Saturday, acquiring Mikael Renberg from
the Tampa Bay Lightning in a four-player trade.
	   Renberg, traded to the Lightning in 1997, rejoins Eric Lindros
and John LeClair in Philadelphia. The Flyers also get center
Daymond Langkow and sent forwards Chris Gratton and Mike Sillinger
to the Lightning.
	   The Flyers, scheduled to play at Toronto on Saturday night, have
been searching for a left wing to replace Renberg on the
Lindros-LeClair line since trading him to Tampa Bay with Karl
Dykhuis for selection in the annual North AMerican National Hockey
League Entry Draft.
	   Keith Jones gave the Flyers' first line a boost when he was
acquired from Colorado for Shjon Podein on Nov. 12, but
Philadelphia was still lagging six points behind first-place New
Jersey in the Atlantic Division.

Mexico's Caribbean coastline sold off to hotels and developers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY191-195 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK STEVENSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANCUN, Mexico (AP) _ To get to the 1,000-year-old Temple of the
Scorpion on the clear blue Caribbean Sea, an ordinary Mexican has
to find one of the rare public access paths to the beach and hike
about a mile (1.5 kilometers).
	   A foreign tourist need only step out of one of the luxury hotels
that surround the temple.
	   Needless to say, almost all visitors are foreign. On a recent
afternoon, the only Mexican at the temple was groundskeeper Eduardo
Hernandez, who was repairing a drainage ditch.
	   ``Nobody comes here,'' he said. ``There's no access. They (the
hotels) don't let you walk through their property.''
	   Mexicans are increasingly being cut off from their own Caribbean
coast. This year, the Quintana Roo state government sold off 2.6
miles (4.2 kilometers) of the last 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) of
public beaches to hotel developers, or concessioned them off to
theme park operators who charge prices few Mexicans can pay.
	   Along the 80 miles (130 kilometers) of sand that stretch between
Cancun and Tulum, an area known as the Mayan Riviera, there are
perhaps two public beaches. On the rest, private owners are
building, or hoping to build, exclusive luxury hotels.
	   Of the 550-mile (885-kilometer) Caribbean coast down to Belize,
almost every inch (meter) is privately owned, in large part by
foreigners.
	   Perhaps the most open part is Cancun itself _ where the Temple
of the Scorpion stands. Although most hotels have security guards
who keep undesirables from crossing their property to get to the
beach, a half-dozen small, unkempt public access paths squeeze
between the resorts.
	   ``You can go through the hotels if you're a blue-eyed gringo,
but the darker-skinned you are the less chance they will let you
through,'' said Araceli Dominguez, a member of a local ecologist
group.
	   Even environmentally sensitive areas are being sold off. Sixty
miles (Ninty-five kilometers) south of Cancun, Spanish hotel
developer Grupo Sol Melia this year bought the sea-turtle nesting
ground at Xcacel beach. The beach was a regular stop for
schoolchildren on field trips.
	   ``People used to bring their kids and camp behind the beach
during nesting season,'' said Ivan Granados, a 21-year-old
biologist working at the turtle protection camp there. ``This year,
almost nobody came.''
	   Sol Melia has blocked off the access road and begun cutting palm
trees, but its executives refused to say what kind of hotel they
plan to build.
	   Jose Luis Perez Quintal, the government official who oversaw the
land sales, didn't flinch as he said what Xcacel and the
surrounding coast will become: ``An exclusive zone for people with
high incomes.''
	   Critics accuse the government officials of selling out their
nation.
	   ``It appears there is nothing they won't sell to private
investors,'' said Greenpeace Mexico activist Juan Carlos Cantu.
	   Added opposition-party activist Tulio Arroyo: ``They think land
is under-used if there's no restaurant on it.''
	   Gov. Mario Villanueva knows that Mexicans face discrimination on
their own coast. As mayor of Cancun in the early 1990s, he
temporarily closed a discotheque and a beach resort for denying
entry to Mexicans.
	   He conceded that there are problems with the development, but
defended the state's privatization plan.
	   ``Maybe there should have been better planning to have more
public beaches,'' he told The Associated Press. ``But what good is
a nature reserve if it's not being used?''
	   Construction worker Jaime Rubio, for one, would have used one.
He traveled with his wife and three children from the western city
of Guadalajara, but couldn't afford the dlrs 39-a-person entry fee
to X-Caret _ a mostly fabricated amusement park with snorkeling and
swimming activities in a jungle setting. It would have cost half a
month's wages.
	   ``For Mexicans, this place is no longer accessible,'' he said.
``The dollar rules here.''
	   Two other former government-run beaches were concessioned off to
the operators of X-Caret recently.
	   Environmentalists say the development is destroying the
coastline. A strict zoning law introduced in 1994 was supposed to
limit hotels along the Mayan Riviera to low-rise ecotourism
projects. That law has been largely ignored.
	   Densely packed, seven-story hotels are going up on pristine
beaches, some complete with marinas and jetties in apparent
violation both of zoning laws and of international agreements to
protect the nearby Maya Reef.
	   ``There are people who are building out there without submitting
an environmental impact statement,'' said Silvia Phillip of the
federal attorney general's office for environmental protection.
	   Environmental Secretary Julia Carabias said a few offending
projects _ she couldn't remember how many _ have been temporarily
shut down. But in most cases, the damage already had been done _
like at one hotel project in Puerto Morelos, where bulldozers
filled in several acres of sensitive wetlands near the coast.
	   Over and over again, however, state authorities and developers
like X-Caret claim they are doing more to protect the coast than if
the areas were used by Mexicans. They cite the litter problems at
the few existing public beaches _ which don't even have
wastebaskets or bathrooms.
	   Cantu, the Greenpeace activist, calls those arguments unfair.
``How can you expect Mexicans to protect the sea environment if
they're not even allowed to get to know it?''

	   LYON, France (AP) _ The man blamed for the growing schism within
the far-right National Front said Saturday that he is neither a
``plotter'' nor a ``putschist'' as the party leader who suspended
his membership has said.
	   Bruno Megret reiterated that the extraordinary party congress he
and his followers have called for ``will take place in January''
because they have gathered sufficient signatures.
	   ``Putschists and plotters are those who refuse to apply the
statutes,'' Megret said.
	   He spoke before 1,000 National Front members at a training
session for National Front officials that brought him face-to-face
with one of the top supporters of party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen.
	   The tense session which saw both Megret and Bruno Gollnisch at
the podium quickly transformed into a sort of political rally that
revealed the extent of division within the anti-immigrant party.
	   Megret last week called for an extraordinary unity congress to
heal the growing fracture between himself and Le Pen.
	   Le Pen adamantly refused, fired Megret from his post as general
delegate and on Friday suspended his party membership, along with
that of four Megret allies.
	   Gollnisch, the National Front's secretary general, repeated
claims that Megret is plotting to overthrow Le Pen, who founded the
party a quarter-century ago.
	   ``This is a subversive operation ...,'' Gollnisch told the
crowd, ``an operation aimed at overthrowing Jean-Marie Le Pen.''
	   Gollnisch said that holding an extraordinary congress when the
National Front is in the midst of its campaign for European
parliamentary elections next June is ``an extraordinary idea.''
	   ``I want to kill no one, and I don't want to be killed by
anyone,'' Megret told the group. He was referring to a remark
Friday by Le Pen who compared Megret to Brutus and himself to
Julius Caesar, ``except that me, I pull out my sword and I kill
Brutus before he kills me.''

`Mayan Riviera' largely off-limits to Mayas

<TEXT>
	   X-CARET, Mexico (AP) _ Offering snorkeling and swimming amid a
jungle setting, X-Caret is the most popular theme park along the
stretch of Caribbean known as the Mayan Riviera. But the only Maya
tourists are likely to find there is Ezequiel Chan Noh.
	   The 80-year-old former gum-tree tapper is paid to sit in a hut
in a ``reconstructed'' Maya village in a forgotten corner of the
park _ a mostly fabricated series of rivers, lagoons and caves
meant to represent the natural state of the area.
	   Chan Noh spends his day weaving baskets as the occasional
tourist stumbles upon the ``village,'' usually while looking for
the park exit.
	   ``I worked cutting mahogany until the trees ran out,'' Chan Noh
said. ``I tapped gum trees, now that's all gone.''
	   He remembered a time when little money changed hands in the
area, and most Mayas led self-sufficient lives fishing or farming.
	   ``Now, so much is bought, nothing is made,'' Chan Noh said.
	   The Mayas also once had a history of defending their land: They
fought one of the last major Indian rebellions on the continent,
The Caste War, which wasn't crushed on the Caribbean coast until
the early 1900s.
	   Still, Chan Noh said he's happy to have the relatively
undemanding job at the theme park.
	   Many other Mayas on the Mayan Riviera are not as lucky: They
live crowded into construction camps 25 miles to the north.
	   There, 50 men or more are squeezed into each 20-foot-by-80-foot,
(6-meter-by-25-meter) unventilated tarpaper shack, in hammocks so
pressed together they don't have room to swing, with one toilet for
every 30 men.
	   Most are brought from neighboring Maya states like Yucatan to
live in the camps for as long as two years, while they work in the
building boom that tourism has brought to this sunny stretch of
Mexico.
	   Most of the workers still speak a Maya language, and their
ancestors ruled the area before the arrival of the Spanish.
	   But their dlrs 5-a-day wages don't leave enough to pay the dlrs
39 entry fee for X-Caret, and security guards keep them from
entering the beaches where the temples their ancestors built still
sit.
	   ``They build these poorly made camps, and bring people in to
work in subhuman conditions, and the cost to the company is almost
zero,'' said Tulio Arroyo, a member of the Cancun activist group
Alianza Civica.
	   In the camp, few people were willing to talk as two security
guards waved residents away.
	   ``It's a hard life,'' construction worker Pedro Peech said
before he spotted the guards and fell silent.

 &UR; Different opinions from constituents of next speaker &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Rep. Bob Livingston, the Metairie Republican who takes over as
Speaker of the House next month, is taking a wait-and-see attitude
regarding the possible impeachment or censure of the president.
Some from in and around his New Orleans-area district are more
bold.
	   A sampling of opinions:
	   ``I'm sick of it, but more I'm sick of him,'' said Lavelle
Cannon, a woman in her 50s who was eating dinner at a food court in
Metairie. She believes Clinton should be impeached.
	   ``I think he abused his office,'' she said.
 &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   Liam Doughty, also visiting the mall, and in his early 30s, also
said impeachment is called for.
	   ``I want to see him get impeached. I think that he's liar.''
 &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   Clyde Kerr, a clerk at The Gap said he likes Clinton, but that
does not mean impeachment is not a fit punishment.
	   ``If he's been cited as doing wrong, he should be impeached...I
still like him. He balanced the budget. He's human.''
 &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   Just before Livingston spoke at Saturday's commencement
exercises at Southeastern Louisiana University, he met with alumni
who graduated 50 or more years ago. Among them was Ted Albin of
Livingston, member of the class of '48, who said later in an
interview that he does not want Clinton impeached.
	   ``Too many people have too many skeletons in their closets to be
up there trying to judge,'' Albin said.
	   Marguerite Clement, also of the class of 1948, and from Hammond,
La., also opposed impeachment.
	   ``I just don't think what he's done is impeachable,'' she said.
 &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   Nursing graduate Terri Tillis said the answer was plain and
simple as she was interviewed during SLU commencement exercises at
Hammond.
	   ``Should he be impeached? Yes. He lied.''

Palestinians quell violence ahead of Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian snub to Israeli minister, 10th graf,
Israeli woman injured, 13th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Fluttering over Bethlehem's Manger
Square, the U.S. red, white and blue jostles the Palestinian red,
white, black and green. Atop Jerusalem telephone poles, the Stars
and Stripes gently lap Israel's Star of David.
	   Roads were ready Saturday for the presidential motorcade in
Israel and the Palestinian areas _ but Bill Clinton faces a bumpy
ride, with violence dogging Mideast peace efforts hours before his
plane lands.
	   Residents of Bethlehem strung a banner across the entrance to
their city reading ``Bill Clinton: Welcome to Palestine,'' a marked
reminder that the Palestinians hope to declare statehood by May _ a
plan Israel says would kill chances for peace.
	   Above the banner, a family decorated their balcony for Christmas
_ on Monday, Clinton is to light the Palestinian-grown Christmas
tree in Manger Square up the street.
	   Minutes later, masked Palestinian youths chanting ``Long Live
Palestine!'' marched towards Israeli troops guarding the entrance
to the city, and began lobbing stones and firebombs.
	   The family retreated into their apartment; the troops responded
with rubber bullets and soon, the banner welcoming Clinton was
enveloped in wisps of tear gas.
	   Seven Palestinians were injured in the clash before Palestinian
police quelled the riot. That was a sign of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's determination to smooth the Clinton visit _
Palestinian authorities, while disclaiming responsibility for the
recent upsurge in violence, have done little to contain it.
	   Clinton's visit was meant to celebrate the U.S.-brokered
agreement achieved at Wye River in October; instead, Clinton will
now try to salvage it.
	   The Palestinians are angry that Israel refuses to release
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities and has instead
released mostly common criminals to meet its prisoner release
commitments.
	   The Palestinian Authority refused to allow Israeli Trade and
Industry Minister Natan Sharansky to participate, in the opening
ceremony of a new industrial park at Karni, on the border between
Israel and the Gaza Strip, a source close to Sharansky said.
	   US Secretary of Commerce William Daley and Palestinian Industry
Minister Sadi Kranz will be at the ceremony.
	   Sharansky complained to Daley that the Palestinians were trying
to conceal the fact that Israel contributed 60 million shekels
(dlrs. 14.6 million) in aid for construction of the park, said the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   An Israeli woman was struck in the face by a rock as she drove
past the Palestinian village of Husan, near Bethlehem. She was
taken to a hospital where here injury was described as medium.
	   Two Palestinian protesters killed in clashes Friday in the
Palestinian-administered town of Qalqilya were buried Sunday.
	   Approximately 10,000 people attended the funeral of Kamal Adwan,
21, in Qalqilya. Some carried Palestinian flags and chanted
``Revenge!''; others chanted ``No sacrifice is too great for the
prisoners.''
	   The release of the prisoners ``would be a real indication Israel
is implementing the Wye Memorandum,'' Arafat said in Gaza after
discussing the prisoners issue with Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawmeh.
	   Palestinians aiming their slingshots at Israeli troops in
Bethlehem said they were not opposed to the Clinton visit.
	   ``I'm protesting by throwing stones so that my brother will be
released from prison,'' said 18-year-old Khaled Dakakta, slingshot
in hand. ``This is not timed for Clinton ... but we will not stop
until they will be free.''
	   The highlight of the visit will be Clinton's attendance at a
meeting of the Palestine National Council on Monday evening,
intended to abrogate clauses in the Palestinian charter calling for
Israel's destruction.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from
hard-liners who may bring down his government unless he scraps Wye,
has said he will not go ahead with a planned withdrawal from
further West Bank territory unless the offending passages are
abrogated in a clear-cut vote.
	   Arafat says that ``affirmation'' is enough. Asked what that
means, he said Saturday that ``we are not in need of a vote.''
	   Although he likely has a majority behind him, Arafat may be
backing off a vote because he lacks the numbers to get the required
two-thirds quorum of the 600-member PNC to attend Monday's meeting.
	   On Saturday, 104 rejectionists said they would not attend the
meeting on principle; Israel has refused to allow some other PNC
members into Gaza.
	   Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said that there would no
assessment of whether there was a quorum.
	   Arafat said he had accepted a U.S. proposal for a trilateral
meeting after the PNC meet _ but that Israel had yet to respond.
	   Netanyahu is unlikely to attend such a meeting unless he is
satisfied with the PNC results.
	   In a pamphlet published Saturday, the militant Islamic group
Hamas dismissed Clinton as ``an enemy of the Arabs'' who is
arriving to ``personally supervise in the direst way the
destruction of the Palestinian charter.''
	   Hamas warned Arafat to release its leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin,
from house arrest by Dec. 25 _ otherwise it would carry out attacks
against Israel.
	   After Saturday's rioting, Bethlehem residents returned to
preparing for Clinton's visit _ and for Christmas. Municipal
workers used a cherry picker to attach tinsel and colored bulbs
	   Locals shopping for presents mingled with U.S. agents securing
the site.
	   ``I wish that Mr. Clinton could make Netanyahu release our
prisoners and move forward with the peace process,'' said one
shopper, Georgina Khoury.
	   For Halil Tamari, Clinton's presence was symbol enough.
	   ``It's a dream come true that the leader of the world, the
leader of the United states is visiting the country now called
Palestine,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bordeaux and Marseille continued their domination
of the French first division on Saturday by both recording 3-0 home
wins.
	   A pair of goals by striker Lilian Laslandes guided first-placed
Bordeaux to a win Le Havre.
	   For most its contest against Metz, Marseille played against ten
men after Bruno Rodriguez got a red card in the first half.
	   Tita Camara, Florian Maurice scored first half goals for
Marseille and Jocelyn Gourvennec added a third in the second
period.
	   Bordeaux and Marseille both have 41 points from 18 games, ten
ahead of third-placed Rennes.
	   Paris Saint-Germain's disastrous season continued with a 2-0

Yeltsin cautions against constitutional changes in Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos MOSB101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin passionately defended
Russia's 5-year-old constitution on Saturday, saying it acts as a
barrier to those who want to return the country to its communist
past.
	   The communist-led opposition has been increasingly insistent in
its calls for changes to the constitution, which it criticizes as
allowing strong presidential powers to the detriment of other
branches of government.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said in October that
Yeltsin had agreed to have an expert commission consider changes to
the constitution. On Saturday, however, the president urged extreme
caution in modifying the document, so ``the foundations of Russia's
legal structure would not be destroyed.''
	   The constitution ``stands in the way of those who sow enmity and
national dissension, those who cannot abide a free press, who try
to deny us our rights to private property and the free market,''
Yeltsin told legislators, government officials and other
dignitaries at a Kremlin reception.
	   Yeltsin looked fit after close to three weeks' convalescence
following a bout with pneumonia. He spoke strongly, clearly, and
with feeling.
	   ``(The constitution) has helped preserve stability more than
once over these past five years. It has led us out of political
crises more than once. And it has upheld citizens' rights and
freedoms more than once,'' he said in a speech broadcast in part on
Russian television. The president made many of the same points in a
radio address that aired Saturday morning.
	   The constitution was passed by referendum on December 12, 1993.
Yeltsin effectively designed the document for himself, putting the
president in a position to call all the shots and giving little
real power to parliament or the prime minister.
	   Yeltsin's recent series of illnesses, his general retreat from
public view since an economic crisis hit in mid-August and a clear
transfer of the reins of government to Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov have prompted speculation that it may be time to amend the
constitution.
	   Yet Yeltsin made it clear Saturday that he would not accept a
big increase in the parliament's authority.
	   ``They are calling for vesting parliament with all possible
powers. They are effectively proposing that the country revert to
being a republic of soviets,'' Yeltsin said, referring to the
councils that governed the Soviet Union along with the Communist
Party.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ In a perfect Christmas present for family and
friends, a senior United Nations aid worker arrived home Saturday
after 318 days in the hands of violent kidnappers in southern
Russia.
	   Vincent Cochetel was freed by Russian security forces in a
two-minute commando operation before dawn, which was carried on
television.
	   The 37-year-old French national was said to be emotionally and
physically exhausted but otherwise in good health. He was taken to
hospital for medical checks immediately after his arrival at Geneva
airport.
	   Cochetel headed the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in the North Ossetia region. He was seized by three masked
gunmen in the regional capital Vladikavkaz on Jan. 29.
	   ``All the family is completely overwhelmed,'' said his father,
Alain, who flew in from Paris for a tearful reunion.
	   ``It's the best Christmas present ever,'' sighed his mother,
Madeleine, _ a comment echoed repeatedly by family and colleagues.
	   ``But, Mummy, it isn't even Christmas yet,'' his six-year-old
daughter, Sarah, said when told of the news by her mother,
Florence. The couple also have a seven-year-old daughter Salome.
	   Family members said they alternated between hope and despair in
the ten months without news of Vincent. One of the worst moments
was four days ago when the severed heads of four murdered foreign
hostages were found in Chechnya, they said.
	   The four were apparently killed after a government rescue
attempt went wrong.
	   In footage of the release operation broadcast by Russia's NTV
television station, Cochetel kneeled and crouched behind a white
van, his hands in metal hand-cuffs behind his back.
	   Russian security officers in masks and camouflage stood over him
protectively, then dragged him away as gunfire erupted and bullets
bounced off the van.
	   Cochetel said that for the first two months, ``there was a lot
of violence, they were interrogating me and that was all very
serious,'' Russia's Interfax news agency reported.
	   He said that for the past several months, he had been kept
almost completely in the dark.
	   ``Twenty minutes of daylight every single day, that's very
hard,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   He called for his kidnappers to be brought to justice.
	   ``I know who is responsible for my kidnapping,'' Cochetel said,
according to Interfax. ``I believe there must be a court trial. If
there is no trial, the process of kidnapping people will
continue.''
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are
mostly motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held
captive.
	   Chechnya's top prosecutor Mansur Tagirov, who was investigating
the killings and was apparently kidnapped Thursday, was also
released Saturday, Interfax said.
	   French President Jacques Chirac, who had personally lobbied his
Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin for the release, phoned him to
thank him for Russia's role in the rescue operation.
	   U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, said the
ordeal proved the need for more protection for aid workers in the
world's trouble spots.
	   UNHCR and the French government consistently ruled out paying a
ransom.
	   The family hugged silently when Cochetel stepped off the plane
from Moscow, too overwhelmed to speak, said his father Alain. As
Cochetel left with doctors, he vowed to stay closer to home in
future, he said.
	   Mother Madeleine said he looked very tired, and had aged because
of the stress of captivity.
	   ``Above all, I was struck by his big beard,'' she said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A French U.N. official held captive in southern
Russia for more than 10 months was set free by Russian security
forces Saturday and flown to Geneva for a reunion with his family
and colleagues.
	   Vincent Cochetel, head of the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in the North Ossetia region, was seized
by three masked gunmen on Jan. 29 in the regional capital
Vladikavkaz.
	   He was freed in a predawn operation on the border between the
republics of Chechnya and Ingushetia, but a firefight broke out
between the kidnappers and Russian security forces, the Interfax
news agency said. Cochetel, 37, was unharmed; he said three
kidnappers were killed.
	   In footage of the operation broadcast by Russia's NTV television
station, Cochetel was shown kneeling and crouching behind a white
van, his hands cuffed behind his back. Russian security officers in
masks and camouflage stood over him protectively, then dragged him
away as gunfire erupted and bullets bounced off the van.
	   Two security officers were slightly injured, Interior Ministry
spokesman Alexander Mikhailov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency. No ransom was paid for Cochetel's release, Mikhailov said.
	   Cochetel was flown aboard a chartered jet to Moscow, where he
was met by French Ambassador Hubert Colin de Verdiere and U.N.
officials. He left Saturday evening for Geneva, where his family
and colleagues were awaiting him at U.N. headquarters, said Vera
Sobolyeva, UNHCR spokeswoman in Moscow.
	   Speaking briefly to reporters, Cochetel thanked President Boris
Yeltsin and other officials who made his release possible. ``It is
the first time people have risked their lives for me,'' he said.
	   Cochetel said that for the first two months, ``there was a lot
of violence, they were interrogating me and that was all very
serious,'' Interfax reported. For the past several months, he had
been kept almost completely in the dark, he said.
	   ``Twenty minutes of daylight every single day, that's very
hard,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   Cochetel also said he knew who was responsible for his
kidnapping and called for the abductors to be brought to justice,
Interfax reported.
	   ``I believe there must be a court trial,'' he said. ``If there
is no trial, the process of kidnapping people will continue.''
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by gangs who are mostly
motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held captive.
	   Cochetel's release came four days after the severed heads of
four hostages were found in Chechnya. The four were killed after a
government rescue attempt apparently went wrong.
	   Chechnya's top prosecutor Mansur Tagirov, who was investigating
the killings and was apparently kidnapped Thursday, was released
Saturday, Interfax said.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Qatar's foreign minister, Sheik Hamad bin
Jassem bin Jaber Al Thani, met Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in the
desert on Saturday, Libya's official television reported.
	   The television, monitored in Cairo, did not say where the
meeting took place, but it showed Gadhafi, dressed in a muddy brown
gown and matching cap, receiving the Qatari minister in a tent.
	   Al Thani handed Gadhafi a letter that reaffirmed Qatar's support
for Libya ``in its just position toward the so-called Lockerbie
case,'' the television said, referring to Libya's objections to the
U.N. sanctions imposed in 1992 to press it to hand over two Libyans
wanted for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish
town of Lockerbie that left 270 people dead.
	   The television gave no other details about the visit.

World Cup champ told to cut ties to convicted East German doctor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Overall Alpine World Cup champion Hermann Maier is
being urged by the Austrian Ski Federation to immediately end his
association with a former East German doctor recently convicted of
administering performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Austrian federation president and Maier's personal manager Peter
Schroecksnadel told Saturday's Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung that
physiologist Bernd Pansold was hurting the sport.
	   ``As big an authority as Pansold is, he's damaging Austrian ski
sport more with his reputation at the moment than his sizeable
knowledge can help,'' Schroecksnadel told the German daily.
	   Maier, the reigning overall and super-giant slalom World Cup
champion, trains at the Obertauern independent Olympic training
center in Austria where Pansold works.
	   A Berlin court last week found the former East German doctor
guilty of administering performance-enhancing drugs to nine
underage athletes from 1975-84 even though he knew they were
dangerous. He was fined dlrs 8,200.
	   Maier told the Franfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung that Pansold
regularly checks his lactate level but doesn't dictate or
administer his training plan.
	   The skier said he paid around dlrs 3,000 for Pansold's services
last year out of his own pocket.
	   ``I train at the (Obertauern) sports center but my trainer is
Berg Mueller,'' Maier has said.
	   A dual gold medal winner at the Nagano Olympics, Maier earned
the nickname ``the Herminator'' for his powerful build and skiing
style.
	   Swiss ski boss Theo Nadig stirred controversy in late October
when he said a diet of pasta and granola could not explain Maier's
rapid physical development.
	   Maier, who won the World Cup title in only his first full season
on the circuit, had failed to make Austrian ski teams as a youth
because of weak knees and joints. However, always claimed working
as a bricklayer strengthened his body.

Legion of Doom returns as Flyers reacquire Renberg
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Renberg's position; ADDS detail, quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By KEN BERGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ The Philadelphia Flyers reunited their
``Legion of Doom'' line on Saturday, acquiring Swedish right wing
Mikael Renberg from the Tampa Bay Lightning in a four-player trade.
	   Renberg, traded to the Lightning in 1997, rejoins Eric Lindros
and John LeClair in Philadelphia. The Flyers also get center
Daymond Langkow and sent forwards Chris Gratton and Mike Sillinger
to the Lightning.
	   The Flyers, scheduled to play at Toronto on Saturday night, have
been searching for a right wing to replace Renberg on the
Lindros-LeClair line since trading him to Tampa Bay with Karl
Dykhuis for draft picks.
	   Flyers general manager Bob Clarke said coach Roger Neilson would
decide whether Renberg would return to the ``Legion of Doom.''
	   ``He'll certainly play some with Lindros,'' Clarke said. ``Keith
Jones has been awfully good there. Either one of them could play
with (Rod) Brind'Amour. Offensively, we've helped ourselves.''
	   Keith Jones gave the Flyers' first line a boost when he was
acquired from Colorado for Shjon Podein on Nov. 12, but
Philadelphia was still lagging six points behind first-place New
Jersey in the Atlantic.
	   The Flyers said Renberg was headed to Philadelphia and would
miss the Flyers' game in Toronto. His second tour of duty could
begin Sunday night at home against Edmonton.
	   Langkow, who had four goals and six assists in 22 games, was
making the trip to Toronto but wasn't certain to play.
	   Renberg played for the Flyers from 1993-97, joining Lindros and
LeClair on a potent line that led Philadelphia to the Stanley Cup
finals in his final season. He has only four goals and eight
assists in 20 games for the Lighting, who lost for the 12th time in
13 games Friday night.
	   The deal continued an odd association between Renberg and
Gratton. The Lightning got the right to four first-round draft
choices when they declined to match the Flyers' offer sheet for
Gratton in 1997, then traded the draft picks to the Flyers in the
Renberg deal.

Holbrooke tries `second-track' diplomacy on Cyprus

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Richard Holbrooke's latest initiative to
find peace does not involve pressure cooker diplomacy or threats of
NATO air strikes.
	   ``It all boils down to cooperation _ the businessmen working
together,'' Constantinos Lordos, head of a Greek Cypriot business
delegation, said Saturday. The delegation is here to meet with
Turkish Cypriot entrepreneurs from the other side of the divided
island.
	   Holbrooke's latest attempt at peace has targeted not so much the
politicians on Cyprus, but its business community. U.N.-sponsored
reunification talks have failed for years to find a way to rejoin
the island.
	   Meeting for the first time ever on Turkish soil, about 20
business people from the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities will
try to find the nuts and bolts of peaceful coexistence.
	   ``The general purpose of these meetings is to focus on practical
everyday problems in the lives of citizens and to do it in a
framework of mutual benefits,'' said Thomas Miller, the State
Department's coordinator for Cyprus.
	   With the threat of war looming ever closer because of a Greek
Cypriot decision to deploy Russian-made S-300 missiles on the
island later this month, Holbrooke's ``second track'' diplomacy
approach has so far proved much more successful than the mainstream
method of problem solving _ meeting with political leaders.
	   ``This has not been an easy process ... the situation in Cyprus
has not improved,'' Holbrooke told the business delegates at a
gathering hosted by billionaire Turkish industrialist Sarik Tara.
	   ``We are not going to be able to solve the Cyprus problem
today,'' he added. ``But by coming here, you have shown you want a
solution.''
	   On Monday, Holbrooke travels to Athens, Greece, for meetings
with Greece's ministers of defense and foreign affairs. His goal
will be to ensure that the missiles are not deployed on Cyprus. One
proposal is to put them on the Greek island of Crete.
	   Miller discussed the S-300s in Cyprus Friday with U.N.
representative Dame Ann Hercus. After the talks, he said ``the
missiles are clearly are a problem.''
	   Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, in Ankara for eye surgery,
was also meeting with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.
	   ``The Istanbul meetings may be a way for the Holbrooke-Miller
group to keep their initiative going in light of the fact that
everything else _ the politics, the missiles _ is apparently at a
dead end,'' said Marios Evriviades, a regional analyst with Athens'
Institute for International relations.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded and seized
its northern third in the wake of an abortive coup by supporters of
union with Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north
is only recognized by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   U.N.-sponsored talks froze in 1997, while Holbrooke's efforts
were stymied last May following a demand by Denktash for
recognition of his breakaway state and the cancellation of Cyprus'
entry talks with the European Union. The EU began accession talks
with Cyprus earlier this year, after rebuffing Turkey for
membership.
	   ``It is nothing new to say that this has been a difficult year
for Cyprus following the EU decision and the missiles. Dialogue has
broken down and this essentially is all that's left,'' said Dan
Smith, director of the International Peace Research Institute in
Oslo, Norway.
	   The Institute, which organized the groundbreaking peace meetings
between Israelis and Palestinians, is co-organizing the meetings
here with Columbia University's International Conflict Resolution
Program.
	   ``All I do hope is to overcome political difficulties so we can
go on to the real problems. The political will is what is
lacking,'' said Vedat Chelik, the head of the Turkish Cypriot
businessmen attending the two-day meeting.
	   In their first meeting, held last November in Brussels, Belgium,
the businessmen agreed to 42 joint projects to bring the two
communities together. So far, the only one that has worked is a
telephone exchange set up with Holbrooke's help allowing the two
sides to speak to each other.
	   Before, Greek and Turkish Cypriots had no way of communicating
directly. Even today, mail sent from one side of Cyprus to the
other has to go through Turkey and Greece.

Brown, Dodgers break U.S. baseball's 100 million dollar barrier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Kevin Brown became the first
American baseball player to get a dlrs 100 million contract,
agreeing on Saturday to a dlrs 105 million, seven-year deal with
the Los Angeles Dodgers.
	   The deal set a record both for total dollars and average annual
salary (dlrs 15 million). The previous high for average salary in
U.S. Major League Baseball, dlrs 13.33 million, was set less than
two weeks ago, when first baseman Mo Vaughn agreed Nov. 25 to an
dlrs 80 million, six-year contract with the Anaheim Angels.
	   The previous high for dollars was set Oct. 23, when catcher Mike
Piazza agreed to a dlrs 91 million, seven-year deal with the New
York Mets.
	   ``We think Kevin Brown is a big part of our future,'' Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone said. ``We're comfortable with the
terms. We feel like we logically evaluated the marketplace. We
needed the player, we wanted the player and we made the commitment
to our fans to becoming a winning team.''
	   Breaking the dlrs 100 million mark is sure to bring an outcry
among some MLB club owners against Australian-born media mogul
Rupert Murdoch, who took over the Dodgers in March. With Murdoch's
billions, Los Angeles has made major upgrades in an effort to
return to the World Series for the first time since 1988.
	   ``I never thought we'd see the day of a 91-million-dollar
player,'' said Dodgers senior vice president Tom Lasorda, who is
Piazza's godfather. ``There's only one thing certain in baseball _
nothing is certain.''
	   Brown gets a dlrs 5 million signing bonus, dlrs 10 million next
year and dlrs 15 million in each of the following six seasons. As
part of the deal, the Dodgers will give him the use of a private
plane 12 times per season to commute to Los Angeles on the United
States' West Coast from Brown's home in Macon, Georgia, on the East
Coast. He also gets a no-trade clause.
	   Anaheim, Baltimore, Colorado and St. Louis also were among the
finalists for Brown, a 33-year-old right-hander who went 18-7 with
a 2.38 ERA for San Diego this year. He helped Florida win the World
Series in 1997, then was traded to the Padres as part of the
Marlins' payroll purge and helped San Diego reach for the World
Series for the first time since 1984.

Iranian president urges investigation of mysterious killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iranian President Mohammad Khatami ordered
his police and intelligence services Saturday to step up an
investigation into a recent spate of mysterious killings and
disappearances, the official Iranian news agency reported.
	   Khatami gave the order at a meeting of Iran's National Security
Council, which he chaired in Tehran, the Islamic Republic News
Agency said in a report received in Cairo.
	   Four government critics, including two writers, have been found
dead in the past four weeks. On Friday, the family of a third
dissident writer, Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, said he had been
missing since Wednesday.
	   On Dec. 9, the body of Mohammad Mokhtari, a writer who
disappeared the previous week, was found dumped on the outskirts of
Tehran.
	   The New York-based Human Rights Watch said marks on Mokhtari's
head and neck indicated that he had been killed, possibly by
strangulation.
	   Last month, Majid Sharif, another writer, disappeared and was
later found dead, but his family said he may have died of a heart
attack.
	   Also last month, the head of an Iranian opposition group,
Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh, were stabbed to death in
their home.
	   Increasingly, hard-line opponents of Khatami are resorting to
violence to deal with opponents. Over the past year, vigilantes
have attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers and even a reformist
Cabinet minister.
	   Nobody has been charged in any of the attacks, leading to
suspicions that the campaign is being backed by powerful persons in
the ruling hierarchy.
	   Police say they had made several arrests in connection with the
killings, but the findings have not been made public.
	   Human Rights Watch has demanded an investigation into the
killings, saying they are part of an ``increasingly sinister
pattern of harassment and persecution of government critics in
Iran.

Betis and Atletico de Madrid battle to scoreless tie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ Real Betis and Atletico Madrid tied 0-0 on
Saturday at the start of a somber weekend of soccer as Spanish
first-division teams mourn a fan who was stabbed to death outside a
stadium.
	   The players and spectators at Seville's Benito Villamarin
Stadium observed a minute's silence in memory of Aitor Zabaleta, a
28-year-old visiting fan who was attacked Tuesday outside Atletico
Madrid's home stadium before a match with Real Sociedad, a team
from San Sebastian in the Basque country.
	   Police have arrested three alleged soccer hooligans and are
looking for several others. Newspapers say they all belong to a
neo-fascist splinter group of a mainstream fan club called the
Atletico Front.
	   All 18 Spanish teams playing on Sunday will also observe a
minute's silence for Zabaleta, who was stabbed in the chest as his
girlfriend looked on. He died in hospital after undergoing
emergency surgery.
	   His team Real Sociedad returns to the Spanish capital on Sunday,
this time to play Real Madrid, and all its players will be wearing
special jerseys with the name Zabaleta on the back.
	   Here in Seville, Atletico was playing without strikers Kiko
Narvaez, Osvaldo Giroldo, or Juninho, and midfielder Vladimir
Jugovic, all out because of injury. It was the only game Saturday
in the 14th week of the season.
	   Betis had a chance to score in the 12th minute when Atletico's
Michele Serena was called for an illegally touched ball. But
goalkeeper Jose Francisco Molina saved the penalty kick by Denilson
de Oliveira, the first of many good plays by Molina all night.
	   Betis goalie Antonio Prats made a good save of his own in the
43rd minute, stopping what looked to be a sure goal from Jose Mari
Romero.
	   Atletico came out stronger in the second half but Prats again
stopped promising shots from Antonio Munoz and Romero. In the 53rd
minute Prats saved a shot at point-blank range from Zoran Niegus
after a center from Romero.
	   Prats later left the game with a leg injury after stopping a
shot by Juan Carlos Valeron.
	   The scoreless tie left Atletico Madrid in fourth place with 22
points, and Betis in 11th with 18.
	   In Sunday's games, Real Madrid, which is six points behind
league leader Mallorca and in need of a win, hosts Real Sociedad.
	   Real Madrid's traditional rival Barcelona is in more dire
straits. The Catalan powerhouse has been eliminated from the
European Champions Cup and sits in eighth place with 19 points, the
same as Real but behind on goal difference.
	   Barcelona plays at home against Villareal. Dutch coach Louis van
Gaal has been hearing loud calls for his resignation although he
did gain some breathing space with Wednesday's 1-0 victory over
Danish side Brondby in a meaningless Champions League match.
	   In other games, Mallorca plays against Zaragoza. Deportivo la
Coruna, only two points back in second place, is confident it can
take over the lead coming off its late victory last week against
Barcelona.
	   To ascend to the top of the standings, Deportivo must defeat
Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.
	   Meanwhile Celta tries to regain the momentum that saw it climb
to the top of the table only weeks ago. Having already eliminated
English legend Liverpool and Premier League leader Aston Villa from
the UEFA Cup, Celta has a seemingly easy task against lowly
Espanyol.
	   Valencia welcomes struggling Salamanca, Valladolid hosts Alaves,
Racing Santander takes on Tenerife and last-placed Extremadura
hosts Oviedo.

Catholics riot after angry Protestants march down restricted

	   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Catholic militants burned
at least eight vehicles and threw gasoline bombs at police lines
Saturday after angry Protestants marched down a restricted route
through Londonderry.
	   Riot police clad in flak jackets, helmets and shields prevented
either side from getting into contact with the other, and as a
result came under attack from both sides. They arrested three
people _ two Catholics, one Protestant _ but reported no serious
injuries.
	   Earlier, some of the Protestant marchers from the Apprentice
Boys fraternal group clashed with police who prevented them from
parading a second time into the central square of the predominantly
Catholic city.
	   A government-appointed commission supposed to minimize trouble
over traditional Protestant marches ruled this week that the march
could pass through the central square, called the Diamond, in the
morning but not in the afternoon.
	   When the marchers passed in the morning, Catholic youths shouted
abuse and threw stones and bottles from a nearby street.
	   The senior police commander on the scene, Assistant Chief
Constable Alan McQuillan, noted that ``people on both sides were
determined to cause trouble.''
	   ``We tried to retain an atmosphere of normality today but
unfortunately that was impossible,'' McQuillan said.
	   The march commemorates the start of the 1688-89 siege of
Londonderry by the forces of King James II, a Catholic. Each year
it ends with the ritual burning of an effigy representing Lundy,
the compromising commander of Londonderry's Protestant garrison who
recommended handing over control of the city to James. To this day,
a favored Protestant term of abuse is to call someone a Lundy.
	   In August, the Apprentice Boys march again to commemorate the
Protestants' triumphant end of the siege. It, too, often triggers
street violence. The group is named in honor of 13 teen-age
apprentice workers who bolted the gates of the walled city in the
face of James' forces.
	   Meanwhile, the Sunday Times newspaper of London reported that
the Irish Republican Army has appointed one of its most hard-line
figures as its new chief of staff, the most senior post.
	   The report identified Brian Keenan, 56, as a stern opponent of
disarmament who was skeptical of current peace efforts.
	   The report also said the top two figures in the IRA's allied
Sinn Fein party, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, were re-elected
to the IRA's seven-member ruling Army Council at a secret meeting
last weekend.
	   McGuinness, another reputed former chief of staff, is liaising
between the IRA and a Canadian-led commission that April's peace
accord empowered to seek the disarmament of the IRA and pro-British
paramilitary groups by mid-2000.
	   On Friday the IRA reaffirmed its opposition to even a token
gesture on disarmament. The group called a cease-fire in July 1997
after killing about 1,800 people in its abortive campaign to
overthrow Northern Ireland as a Protestant-majority state linked
with Britain.

Michalzweski stops Thadzi with sudden knockout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Dariusz Michalczewski
Saturday ended a hard challenge to his WBO light heavyweight title
with a sudden ninth-round combination that sent American Drake
Thadzi staggering across the ring.
	   The hard left and right to the head seemed to come out of
nowhere, ending a tough fight for the unbeaten Polish-born fighter,
who had been rocked himself in the second round.
	   U.S. referee Louis Moret immediately ended the bout at 1:22
minutes into the round while Thadzi righted himself on the ropes.
His decision drew boos from the spectators.
	   But the IBO light heavyweight champion's corner didn't complain,
nor did Thadzi _ at first.
	   ``I was a little off _ but next time will be a different
story,'' said Thadzi, now 30-9-1. ``But he did break off the fight
too early. It wasn't a one-sided fight.''
	   Michalczewski 14th defense of his crown was being billed locally
as a record for a light heavyweight.
	   Michalczewski, known for spectacular endings to his bouts, ran
his record to 39-0 with 32 knockouts. Many of his fights have ended
with a single shot by his left.
	   Michalczewski also challenged Roy Jones Jr., the WBA-WBC light
heavyweight champion, sometimes called the best boxer in the world.
	   ``I want him. I'll even go to America,'' said Michalczewski.
``It's time he takes a stand.''
	   Michalczewski became the first man in history to own the WBO,
IBF and WBA titles at the same time after he beat Virgil Hill two
years ago. He also once won the WBO cruiserweight title.
	   Thadzi, the IBO light heavyweight champion, had stunned
Michalczewski in the second round, crowding the German and tagging
him with one fierce uppercut after another.
	   Michalczewski didn't fare much better in the third round, but
then finally backed up Thadzi by exploding a left to the head
midway through the fourth round.
	   By the eighth round, Michalczewski was back in form and with
enough room to continually slip hard lefts to the head through the
tiring Thadzi's gloves.
	   ``You have to put on a little show, but I felt super good the
whole fight,'' Michalczewski said. ``But he was tough.''
	   But he also displayed some old faults like dropping his left
hand.
	   ``I don't want to take anything away from him, but there are
tougher opponents,'' said Thadzi, who has fought numerous top
fighters.
	   On the undercard, unbeaten Cuban fighter Juan Carlos Gomez
retained his WBC cruiserwight title by knocking out American Rodney
Gordon in the second round.
	   Gomez, who fled Cuba for Germany two years, caught the American
with 2:19 remaining in the round with a left hook. He also dropped
the American with the blow in the opening round.
	   Gomez, 26-0 with 22 knockouts, was making the third defense of
the crown he won Feb. 21 against Argentina's Marcelo Dominguez.
	   Gordon was taken to a hospital afterwards to be treated for a
head injury.

Betis, Atletico battle to goalless draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ Benito Villamarin Stadium fell still for a
minute Saturday, a silent tribute to a soccer fan fatally stabbed
earlier in the week prior to a UEFA Cup match.
	   The moment of silence, which preceded the 0-0 draw between Betis
and Atletico Madrid, was to be observed at the remainder of the
nine first-division matches this weekend, a way of honoring
28-year-old Aitor Zabaleta and decrying increasing violence
surrounding soccer.
	   Zabaleta, a supporter of Real Sociedad, was attacked Tuesday
outside Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon Stadium before
Sociedad's UEFA Cup game.
	   Police have arrested three alleged soccer hooligans and are
looking for several others. Newspapers say they all belong to a
neo-fascist splinter group of a mainstream fan club called the
Atletico Front.
	   Zabaleta was stabbed in the chest as his girlfriend looked on.
He died in hospital after undergoing emergency surgery.
	   Real Sociedad returns to the Spanish capital on Sunday to play
Real Madrid, and all Socidad players were to wear special jerseys
with Zabaleta's name on the back.
	   In Seville on Saturday, Atletico played without strikers Kiko
Narvaez, Osvaldo Giroldo and Juninho, as well as midfielder
Vladimir Jugovic, all out because of injury.
	   Betis' best chance to score came in the 12th minute when
Atletico's Michele Serena was called for a handball, but goalkeeper
Jose Francisco Molina saved the penalty by Denilson.
	   Betis keeper Antonio Prats was nearly equal with a stop on Jose
Mari Romer in the 43rd minute.
	   Atletico came out stronger in the second half but Prats again
stopped promising shots from Antonio Munoz and Romero. In the 53rd
minute, Prats stopped Zoran Niegus after a cross from Romero.
	   Prats was later forced out of the game with a leg injury after
foiling another chance by Juan Carlos Valeron.
	   The scoreless draw left Atletico Madrid in fourth place with 22
points, and Betis in 11th with 18.
	   In Sunday's games, besides the Sociedad-Real Madrid contest,
Barcelona plays at home against Villareal, Mallorca plays against
Zaragoza, Deportivo La Coruna faces Athletic Bilbao, Celta plays
Espanyol, Valencia welcomes struggling Salamanca, Valladolid hosts
Alaves, Racing Santander takes on Tenerife and last-placed
Extremadura hosts Oviedo.

Mori leads after first jumping portion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colorado (AP) _ Japanese Satoshi Mori had the
longest jump of the first round Saturday and led jumping, giving
him a 2-second lead going into the cross-country phase of a two-day
Nordic combined World Cup event.
	   Mori had jumps of 116 and 114.5 meter for 239.8 points and will
start Sunday's 15-kilometer race two seconds in front of Alexei
Fadeev of Russia. Fadeev had the longest jump of the day, going
113.5 and 117.5 meters, good for 239.4 points.
	   World Cup leader Hannu Manninen of Finland, a far stronger skier
than Mori and Fadeev, was third and will start 17 seconds behind
Mori. He said Olympic champion Bjarte Engen Vik of Norway, who was
sixth in jumping and will ski 37 seconds after Mori, is the man to
watch in the 15K.
	   Mori led three Japanese skiers into the top five with Gen Tomii
fourth and three-time World Cup champion Kenji Ogiwara fifth.
	   ``I will try to ski my own race, at my pace, at not think of
Manninen or anyone else,'' Mori said through an interpreter.
	   ``I think I will catch them but Bjarte will be tough. I will
prepare my tactic (race plan) tonight,'' Manninen said.
	   He edged Vik by a stride Thursday in a one-day sprint event and
has won four of the five World Cup combined meets this season,
finishing second to Vik in the other event.
	   ``I think this altitude (2,040 meters, 6,700 feet) is still a
problem for me. This race is longer (than Thursday's 7.5K) and I am
not yet used to skiing at this altitude,'' Manninen said.
	   Norwegian coach Jan-Erik Aalbu, who broke a finger on his left
hand playing basketball with Manninen and his teammate Jari
Mantila, agreed with the tall Finn. He also said American Todd
Lodwick, a hometown favorite who was tied for 11th and starts 2:05
later, will be someone to watch, too, in addition to the Norwegians
and Manninen.
	   ``Bjarte jumped well and I think it will be Hannu and Bjarte,
and then some Norwegians. And Todd skis so well in Steamboat; he's
used to this altitude, so that should be a factor,'' Aalbu said.

Newspaper: Pinochet says Britain kidnapped him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet accused the British
government of kidnapping him in an act of ``treason,'' that makes
Prime Minister Tony Blair ``untrustworthy,'' according to a report
in the Sunday Mirror newspaper.
	   The former Chilean dictator branded Home Secretary Jack Straw,
who earlier this week ruled he could be extradited to Spain, a
kidnapper and declared that British justice ``can be bent depending
on what time of day it is,'' the newspaper said.
	   The tabloid newspaper said the interview was conducted through
Pinochet's friend and former cabinet minister Sergio de Castro, who
met with reporters and asked the general questions on the telephone
on their behalf, relaying Pinochet's responses.
	   The Sunday Mirror stood by its story despite a later statement
from Patrick Robertson, an adviser to General Pinochet, denying
Pinochet had given an interview to the Sunday Mirror.
	   ``The sentiments expressed by Sergio de Castro are his own, and
Senator Pinochet has no comment now or in the near future about the
circumstances surrounding his detention in the United Kingdom,''
Robertson said.
	   The 83-year-old general has been held in Britain since London
police arrested him Oct. 16 in his hospital bed as he recovered
from back surgery. He was detained after a Spanish judge sought his
extradition to face charges of genocide, torture and murder during
his 17-year regime, which ended in 1990.
	   ``They have effectively kidnapped me and are now holding me
illegally against my will. The men behind this are no more than
criminals,'' The Sunday Mirror quoted Pinochet as saying. ``And how
can Tony Blair ever be trusted? He is untrustworthy.''
	   A spokesman for Blair, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, declined comment on the report, saying the matter is a
judicial process and that it would be inappropriate to comment.
	   Meanwhile, the Foreign Office denied a report in the Sunday
Telegraph newspaper that officials at the British embassy in Madrid
had warned Pinochet two months ago not to come to Britain after
learning he could face an extradition request from Spain.
	   The telegraph said a source at the Chilean embassy in Madrid,
which it did not name, confirmed a warning had been received and
passed on.
	   The paper quoted Pinochet lawyer Fernando Barros as saying that
although his team knew the Spanish judge was investigating
Pinochet, they believed he had not formulated an accusation, so
assumed it was safe for Pinochet to travel to London.

<HEADLINE>
Talks break off after less than 30 minutes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After lasting less than 30 minutes, negotiations
aimed at stopping the lockout in the U.S. National Basketball
Association ended abruptly Saturday.
	   It was a sign that the 1998-99 pro basketball season could be in
more serious jeopardy than ever as the sides fight over the terms
of a new collective bargaining agreement. And it now appears
certain that a season _ if there is one _ won't begin until the end
of January or early February.
	   Commissioner David Stern, deputy commissioner Russ Granik and
their lawyers emerged dour-faced from the union's law office after
the meeting, which was one of the shortest in length since the
lockout began 5 1-2 months ago.
	   ``We're getting nowhere,'' Granik said. ``We learned today that
basically nothing has changed at all.''
	   The breakup came after the union told the league where it was
willing to make some movement, a union attorney said. But the offer
was not good enough to keep the sides at the negotiating table.
	   No new talks are scheduled.
	   ``The reality is that the issues that we raised were extremely
significant and pertinent, but they continue to be intransigent,''
union director Billy Hunter said. ``We're trying, we'll continue to
try, but it's still a situation where it's necessary for us to fall
on the sword.
	   ``We're being extremely reasonable, but how much is enough?
That's the issue.''
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is money. The owners
have insisted on maximum salary costs and the union has refused to
accept a ``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   So far, the first two months of the season have been scrapped as
the sides have fought over how to divide about dlrs 2 billion in
projected annual revenues.
	   The owners have asked for a 50-50 split, while the players have
tied many of their concessions to receiving 60 percent.
	   Saturday's meeting was the second between the sides in three
days, and the site was meant to be a secret. Stern, Granik and
their attorneys were among the attendees for the league, while the
union was represented by Hunter, Patrick Ewing, Herb Williams and
at least two lawyers.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ A French U.N. official held captive in southern
Russia for more than 10 months was freed by Russian security forces
in a shootout Saturday and flown to Geneva for a reunion with his
family and colleagues.
	   Vincent Cochetel, head of the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in the North Ossetia region, was taken to
a hospital for medical checks immediately after his arrival at
Geneva airport. He was said to be exhausted, but in good health.
	   His father, Alain, said the family hugged quietly, too
overwhelmed to speak, when Cochetel stepped off the plane. His
mother, Madeleine, described her son's return as ``the best
Christmas present ever.''
	   Cochetel, 37, was seized by three masked gunmen on Jan. 29 in
the North Ossetia regional capital, Vladikavkaz. He was freed in a
pre-dawn operation on the border between the republics of Chechnya
and Ingushetia, but a firefight broke out between the kidnappers
and Russian security forces, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Cochetel, who is married and has two daughters ages 6 and 7, was
unharmed. He said three kidnappers were killed.
	   In footage of the operation broadcast by Russia's NTV television
station, Cochetel was shown kneeling and crouching behind a white
van, his hands cuffed behind his back. Russian security officers in
masks and camouflage stood over him protectively, then dragged him
away as gunfire erupted and bullets bounced off the van.
	   Two security officers were slightly injured, Interior Ministry
spokesman Alexander Mikhailov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency. No ransom was paid for Cochetel's release, Mikhailov said.
	   Cochetel was flown by chartered jet from southern Russia to
Moscow, where he was met by French Ambassador Hubert Colin de
Verdiere and U.N. officials before flying on to Geneva.
	   Speaking briefly to reporters in Moscow, Cochetel thanked
President Boris Yeltsin and other officials who made his release
possible. ``It is the first time people have risked their lives for
me,'' he said.
	   Cochetel said that for the first two months, ``there was a lot
of violence, they were interrogating me and that was all very
serious,'' Interfax reported. For the past several months, he had
been kept almost completely in the dark, he said.
	   ``Twenty minutes of daylight every single day, that's very
hard,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   Cochetel also said he knew who was responsible for his
kidnapping and called for the abductors to be brought to justice,
Interfax reported.
	   ``I believe there must be a court trial,'' he said. ``If there
is no trial, the process of kidnapping people will continue.''
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by gangs who are mostly
motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held captive.
	   Cochetel's release came four days after the severed heads of
four hostages were found in Chechnya. The four were killed after a
government rescue attempt apparently went wrong.
	   Chechnya's top prosecutor Mansur Tagirov, who was investigating
the killings and was apparently kidnapped Thursday, was released
Saturday, Interfax said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Under an impeachment cloud, U.S.
President Bill Clinton opened a tough diplomatic mission Saturday
aimed at saving the Wye River peace accords from unraveling amid
violence, political turmoil and mistrust. The difficulty of
Clinton's three-day visit was quickly underscored as Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of failing to meet
their obligations under the Wye agreement. Netanyahu told Clinton
the Palestinians must fulfill the pact ``with deeds and not only
with promises that all too often prove empty. It must be honestly
said, Mr. President, that in the last few weeks our partners have
not kept these commitments and have reverted to past practices.''
In reply, Clinton said peacemaking has opened historic
opportunities to Israel ``but each step forward has been tempered
with pain and understandable feelings of ambivalence'' over
questions about whether agreements are being fully implemented.
(CLINTON-MIDEAST)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Plagued by partisanship to the end, the House
Judiciary Committee on Saturday approved a fourth and final
Republican-drafted article of impeachment against President Bill
Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Democrats failed in their
demand for a lesser punishment of censure in advance of next week's
historic showdown in the full House over charges of perjury,
obstruction of justice and misuse of power. By a vote of 21-16, the
committee accused the president of abuse of power, saying he had
``given perjurious, false and misleading'' answers to some of the
81 questions the panel recently asked about his relationship with
the former White House intern. The vote was along straight party
lines, in keeping with Friday's approval of three other articles
alleging perjury and obstruction of justice. Clinton, who told the
nation Friday he would accept rebuke or censure from Congress, was
overseas at the time of the vote. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi Cabinet minister intervened
Saturday in the dispute over a U.N. bid to inspect the Baath Party
offices, saying such an inspection could take place if the owners
granted permission. The offices of the ruling party that 12 U.N.
inspectors tried to enter Wednesday was a ``private house,''
Culture and Information Minister Humam Abdel Khaliq told reporters.
``Just like a house, if the owner allows them in, we have no
objection.'' A Baath Party official denied access to the building
in the Adhamiya district of Baghdad, saying they had to submit a
written request for what they were seeking. On Thursday, a party
leader, Latif Nsayyif Jassim, said the inspectors would never be
allowed in because the offices did not contain materials relevant
to their search. Chief U.N. inspector Richard Butler accused the
Iraqis of blocking an ``absolutely legal'' inspection and said the
offices contained ``materials of significance.'' (IRAQ-UN)
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union leaders failed Saturday to
narrow a rift between rich and poorer members over how to pay for
ambitious EU plans to almost double its membership by expanding
eastward. Leaders insisted that the split won't delay expansion
and, in public at least, frontrunners among the former-Eastern bloc
candidates seemed reassured that they would be allowed in early in
the next decade. ``We've finished ... with more optimism than
before,'' said Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek. ``There was
no voice against enlargement, and nobody said the process should be
delayed.'' At the heart of the debate is determination by Germany
and other rich EU nations to limit the amount they have to pay to
help bring the newcomers' post-communist economies up to Western
standards. (EU-SUMMIT)
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian police helped quell
anti-Israel protests on Saturday, hours before U.S. President Bill
Clinton arrived in the region _ a sign of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's determination to smooth the visit. In
Palestinian-administered Bethlehem, Palestinian protesters stoned
Israeli soldiers guarding the entrance to the city. The troops _
positioned below a banner put up by residents declaring ``Bill
Clinton: Welcome to Palestine'' _ responded with tear gas and
rubber bullets. The Palestinians see Clinton's visit as a mark of
recognition of the independent state which they intend to declare
in the coming year. A few minutes before the fighting broke out, a
family set up Christmas decorations on a balcony directly above the
banner. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The whispers and rumors about
Olympic corruption have existed for years. On Saturday, a senior
Olympics organizer came forward with sensational bribery
allegations that shook the international competition to its core.
The International Olympic Committee's worst nightmare came to pass
when Switzerland's Marc Hodler _ a longtime member of the
organization's ruling inner circle _ detailed what he described as
systematic buying and selling of the Olympic Games. ``To my
knowledge, there has always, always, been a certain part of the
vote given to corruption,'' he said. It's the biggest ethics
scandal in the history of the 104-year-old IOC and could have
widespread repercussions for the Olympic movement. Hodler
specifically cited a pattern of bribery and other ethical
malpractice in the bidding and selection of at least four Olympic
host cities _ Atlanta, Nagano, Sydney and Salt Lake City.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on the Leaning Tower of Pisa, actress Laura
Flynn Boyle, director Joan Chen, Princess Diana, and Natalie Wood's
daughter. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PISA, Italy (AP) _ The moment of truth has finally arrived:
After nearly a decade of delays, work has begun to ensure the famed
Leaning Tower of Pisa does not topple over.
	   But residents whose livelihoods depend on the hordes of tourists
who flock to Pisa for a view of the tower are holding their breath
_ hoping nothing will go wrong to jeopardize their future.
	   ``After all these years of study upon study, I just hope they
have chosen the best procedure,'' Fabio Magagnini, a taxi driver,
said Saturday. ``Around town everyone is saying, `Let's hope they
don't make it fall.'''
	   According to an ambitious _ and risky _ plan, the 12th-century
tower will be straightened by a half-degree, enough to stabilize
the tower but not enough for the naked eye to detect.
	   If the project succeeds, as the international committee that
devised the plan predicts, tourists might soon be allowed to again
make the dizzying climb up the tower's spiral staircase.
	   Visits to the interior of the tower were banned in 1990 for fear
the monument would collapse.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Being a sex symbol isn't all fun and games for
Lara Flynn Boyle.
	   ``The Practice'' co-star, who gained fame in ``Twin Peaks,''
says being sexy on TV and in movies can be a lot less glamorous
than it looks.
	   ``I've been doing sex scenes since the beginning of time,''
Boyle says in the January issue of Redbook. ``My first was with
Christian Slater in `Mobsters.' We had to do it on a roulette table
... I was like, `Boy, is this really how it's supposed to be?'''
	   Boyle had a live-in romance with ``Twin Peaks'' co-star Kyle
MacLachlan, but says she hasn't had a long-term relationship since
that ended years ago. In the meantime, she's dated a few duds.
	   ``I've gone on vacations with guys and had them bill me for my
half of the vacation! My mother's like, `They should be paying you
to go out with them.' But I don't want to become a man-hater,''
Boyle said. ``If I hated men I wouldn't look the way I do. I'm
always like, `Oh, I think I'll put something cute on.'''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Joan Chen was named best director at
Taiwan's Golden Horse Film Festival Saturday for ``Xiu Xiu _ The
Sent Down Girl,'' the Chinese actress' directing debut.
	   The film, about a girl growing up in the turbulent 1966-76
Cultural Revolution in communist China, also won the best film
award and awards for best actress for Lee Lu-lu and best actor for
Lopsang Chunpei.
	   The annual Golden Horse Film Festival is a showcase for
Chinese-language films.
	   Chen's film credits include ``Dim Sum: a Little Bit of Heart,''
``The Last Emperor,'' ``On Deadly Ground,'' ``The Awakening'' and
``Heaven and Earth,'' and she appeared on the TV show ``Twin
Peaks.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP ) _ When it comes to picking movie roles, opposites
attract for Natasha Gregson Wagner.
	   The late screen legend Natalie Wood's daughter, who was adopted
by stepfather Robert Wagner, is a lighthearted girl's girl fast
becoming known for playing heavy characters.
	   ``I'm attracted to dark parts and scripts,'' Wagner says in the
January issue of Cosmopolitan.
	   Those roles have tackled topics. In ``Two Girls and a Guy'' it
was infidelity, in ``Love, Last Rites'' it was obsession and in
``Urban Legend'' she had her head cut off. She's also appeared in
the horror film ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and the grim nightclub
drama ``Velvet Goldmine.''
	   Now she's playing a heroin-addicted prostitute in ``Another Day
in Paradise.''
	   ``The characters that I'm drawn to are sexual creatures,
especially young girls who are figuring all that stuff out for
themselves,'' the 28-year-old Wagner said.
	   All of which tends to go against the grain of the real girl,
whose idea of a good time is shopping, or a night at home with
girlfriends.
	   ``The funnest thing is having my friends and sisters over and
cooking, hanging out and talking,'' she said.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Documents compiled by the National Security
Agency over many years name the late Princess Diana on 1,056 pages,
intelligence officials said Saturday.
	   But they said those references are casual and incidental and
that she was never a target of U.S. intelligence efforts.
	   ``It's what we would call incidental mentions,'' said an
official of the National Security Council who commented on
condition of anonymity. ``This is just a famous person.''
	   The fact that NSA agents picked up mentions of Diana in its
international electronic monitoring was disclosed last week when
the agency denied an Internet news service's Freedom of Information
Act request for any intercepts mentioning her, but acknowledged in
the process that such intercepts existed.
	   The Daily Mirror in London said: ``America's spy chiefs admitted
... they snooped on Princess Diana for years - and learned some of
her most intimate love secrets.''
	   The princess, the divorced wife of Charles, Prince of Wales, the
heir to the British throne, was killed in a car crash in Paris on
Aug. 31, 1997.

Michalzweski stops Thadzi with sudden knockout

 &UR; EDS: CLARIFIES 14th defense breaks Bob Fosters record &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Dariusz Michalczewski
retained his WBO light heavyweight title Saturday with a
ninth-round combination that sent American Drake Thadzi staggering
across the ring.
	   The hard left and right to the head seemed to come out of
nowhere, ending a tough fight for the unbeaten Polish-born fighter,
who had been rocked himself in the second round.
	   Referee Louis Moret immediately ended the bout at 1:22 of the
round while Thadzi righted himself on the ropes. His decision drew
boos from the spectators.
	   Thadzi's corner didn't complain, nor did Thadzi _ at first.
	   ``I was a little off _ but next time will be a different
story,'' Thadzi, 30-9-1, said. ``But he did break off the fight too
early. It wasn't a one-sided fight.''
	   Michalczewski's 14th defense of the WBO title was a record for a
light heavyweight. Bob Foster won his first 13 defenses, but his
next fight ended in a draw against Jorge Ahumada in 1974.
	   Michalczewski, known for spectacular endings to his bouts, ran
his record to 39-0 with 32 knockouts. Many of his fights have ended
with a single punch.
	   Michalczewski also challenged Roy Jones Jr., the WBA-WBC light
heavyweight champion, sometimes called the best boxer in the world.
	   ``I want him. I'll even go to America,'' Michalczewski said.
``It's time he takes a stand.''
	   Michalczewski became the first fighter to own the WBO, IBF and
WBA titles at the same time after he beat Virgil Hill two years
ago. He also once held the WBO cruiserweight title.
	   Thadzi, the light heavyweight champion of the IBO, another
little-regarded fringe organization, had stunned Michalczewski in
the second round, crowding the German and tagging him with one
fierce uppercut after another.
	   Michalczewski didn't fare much better in the third round, but
then finally backed up Thadzi by exploding a left to the head
midway through the fourth round.
	   By the eighth round, Michalczewski was back in form and with
enough room to continually slip hard lefts to the head through the
tiring Thadzi's gloves.
	   ``You have to put on a little show, but I felt super good the
whole fight,'' Michalczewski said. ``But he was tough.''
	   But he also displayed some old faults like dropping his left
hand.
	   ``I don't want to take anything away from him, but there are
tougher opponents,'' Thadzi said.
	   On the undercard, unbeaten Cuban fighter Juan Carlos Gomez
retained his WBC cruiserwight title by knocking out American Rodney
Gordon in the second round.
	   Gomez, who fled Cuba for Germany two years, caught the American
with 2:19 remaining in the round with a left hook. He also dropped
the American with the blow in the opening round.
	   Gomez, 26-0 with 22 knockouts, was making the third defense of
the crown he won Feb. 21 against Argentina's Marcelo Dominguez.
	   Gordon was taken to a hospital afterwards to be treated for a
head injury.

	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The International Olympic
Committee's worst nightmare came to pass when a longtime member of
the organization's ruling inner circle detailed what he described
as systematic buying and selling of the Olympic Games.
	   ``To my knowledge, there has always, always, been a certain part
of the vote given to corruption,'' Switzerland's Marc Hodler said
Saturday in bribery allegations that shook the international
competition to its core.
	   It's the biggest ethics scandal in the history of the
104-year-old IOC and could have widespread repercussions for the
Olympic movement.
	   Hodler specifically cited a pattern of bribery and other ethical
malpractice in the bidding and selection of at least four Olympic
host cities _ Atlanta, Nagano, Sydney and Salt Lake City.
	   He cited bribes of up to dlrs 1 million and payoffs of up to
dlrs 5 million.
	   The IOC quickly ``disassociated'' itself from Hodler's
allegations, saying he was voicing his personal opinions. However,
the organization did not deny the charges.
	   The charges come not from a maverick or discredited official _
but from one of the IOC's elder statesmen and close confidant of
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   Hodler, a Swiss lawyer who recently turned 80, has been on the
IOC since 1963. Earlier this year, Hodler stepped down after 47
years as president of the International Ski Federation.
	   Hodler said he chose to go public with his corruption
allegations because he hopes they lead to a radical reform of the
Olympic selection process.
	   He said he is proposing that Olympic cities be selected by a
small group, including members of the IOC executive board, rather
than the full IOC membership in order to remove the possibility of
vote buying.
	   At IOC headquarters, Hodler said he believed 5 percent to 7
percent of IOC members _ currently numbering 115 _ have solicited
bribes from cities bidding to host the games.
	   He said a network of four ``agents'' _ including one IOC member
_ have been seeking bribes to secure votes for Olympic bids. He
gave no names.
	   Hodler said he believed the agents had been buying and selling
votes for the past 10 years.
	   ``The price would be between dlrs 500,000 and dlrs 1 million for
a number of votes,'' he said, adding that agents charged the city
winning the bid ``something like dlrs 3 million to dlrs 5
million.''
	   Asked whether all Olympic votes are tainted, Hodler said, ``I
know of so many times. There is a good chance it is always the
case.''
	   Hodler said losing cities have told him there is a list of IOC
members who can be bought.
	   Samaranch, who has been IOC president since 1980, has always
denied allegations of corruption in the organization.
	   On Saturday, the IOC put out a written statement saying the
``executive board disassociated itself from allegations made by one
of its members with the Olympic bid process.''
	   Hodler's allegations came as the IOC continued investigations
into alleged financial misconduct by the Salt Lake City, Utah group
that won the bid for the 2002 games.
	   Hodler has described as a ``bribe'' the dlrs 500,000 scholarship
fund set up by Salt Lake City that benefited the relatives of six
IOC members. A high-level IOC panel is investigating the matter.
	   Asked whether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the 1996 games
was clean, Hodler said, ``Certainly not.''
	   Billy Payne, head of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic
Games, denied the charges.
	   Hodler also leveled allegations against the head of the Athens,
Greece bid, which lost to Atlanta in the 1996 vote. He said he
didn't know of any misconduct in Athens' successful bid for the
2004 games.
	   Asked whether Sydney's election for the 2000 games was clean,
Hodler said, ``I would be surprised. I know what happened but I
don't want to disclose it.''
	   The former minister in charge of Sydney's 2000 Olympic bid
revealed he was asked to offer bribes for votes. But Bruce Baird,
the former New South Wales minister, said he refused.
	   The committee that won the 1998 games for Nagano, Japan
``certainly had to do things which are not legitimate,'' Hodler
said.
	   Hodler contested the argument by the current Salt Lake City
organizing committee that it was not directly involved in the
controversial scholarship program and that the onus was on former
bid chief Thomas Welch.
	   From 1991 to 1995, the committee _ under the direction of Welch
_ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships to 13 individuals _ six
of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa.
	   Hodler also alleged the head of the family behind the Fiat car
company handed out free vans to secure votes to bring the 1997
skiing World Championships to an Italian Alpine resort.
	   Fiat issued a statement rejecting the allegations.

Bosman still waits for his money while Europe rides the Bosman

 &UR; EDS: Third anniversary of Bosman ruling is Tuesday. &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Nowadays, Jean-Marc Bosman goes
jogging, plays tennis, hits the ski tracks whenever there is snow,
does just about everything to compensate for turning his back on
the one sport that made him world famous _ soccer.
	   The landmark court ruling that bears his name turns 3 years old
on Tuesday. Over that period, it has revolutionized the world's top
leagues, turning many journeyman players into millionaires and
stars into multimillionaires.
	   Meanwhile the 34-year-old Bosman is unemployed and still waiting
for the first franc to come out of the trial that created free
agency in Europe and scrapped limits that the wealthy European
leagues place on other Europeans.
	   Disappointed, yes, ``but I have no bitterness left in me,''
Bosman saiys.
	   Hope springs eternal and Bosman is expecting a breakthrough in
his court case by the new year, eight years after he challenged
Europe's soccer authorities because his transfer from Belgium's FC
Liege to France's Dunkirk went awry.
	   To the world, it seemed Bosman won his final victory on Dec. 15,
1995, when the European Court of Justice ruled the system of
transfer fees after contracts had expired and per-team limits on
European Union foreigners were illegal.
	   The ruling however, went back to the appeals court in Belgium,
where Bosman's case has remained logjammed in procedural issues
ever since.
	   ``It drags on and on. I hope to have something now around the
end of the month,'' said Bosman, hoping for an out-of-court
settlement.
	   Before the 1995 ruling, Bosman said he was offered over 30
million francs (dlrs 900,000) not to let the case go to the
European Court of Justice. Even now, he has no regrets.
	   A local sports and union rights organization launched a ``Thank
You Jean-Marc Bosman,'' operation last week, calling on all
first-division players in the 15 EU nations to donate the bonus of
one game to Bosman in a show of solidarity.
	   ``His career was shattered ... and you can imagine the impact on
his financial situation,'' said Paul Carlier of the Sport and
Freedom group.
	   So far solidarity has been hard to come by.
	   ``Now they can show what it has meant to them and do something
for me,'' Bosman said. ``They have my bank account number. I'll be
able to see what is coming in.''
	   Belgian defender Bertrand Crasson, one of the first to profit
from the free agency Bosman spawned when he moved from Anderlecht
to Naples in 1996, already has helped Bosman.
	   ``He deserves any reward that comes his way,'' Crasson said.
	   It took over two years to set up a benefit game for Bosman but
the game in France did little to soothe the financial strain.
	   ``It didn't earn me a dime,'' Bosman said.
	   He quit competitive soccer two years ago because he could not
live off his salary.
	   ``I have no intention of going back in. I just don't want to get
into the system again,'' he said.
	   But his love of the game has not deserted him. When he watches
evening games at his parents' home, his mother Angele still senses
it.
	   ``I see it when he watches soccer on television. It still
hurts,'' she said.
	   Top-level soccer has undergone many changes since the Bosman
ruling, with the most powerful European clubs signing most of the
best players, creating a few showcase leagues around Europe but
often weakening the domestic leagues in other nations.
	   ``I had hoped it would have been a more managed transition,''
said Jean-Louis Dupont, Bosman's lawyer. ``We risk going from one
extreme to the other.''

Maruyama making a name for himself at Presidents Cup

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Shigeki Maruyama can't help but
smile in the Presidents Cup. The Americans can't help but wonder.
	   Just who is this guy?
	   One of the least known players on an International team loaded
with stars like Greg Norman, Steve Elkington, Vijay Singh and Ernie
Els, Maruyama is stealing the show at Royal Melbourne Golf Club.
	   The International team has an astonishing 14 1/2 to 5 1/2 lead
over the United States going into the Sunday singles matches, and
Maruyama is a big reason why.
	   Four matches, four victories and some pretty impressive scalps.
	   Maruyama, whose six professional victories have all come in
Japan, gave the International team its biggest lift Saturday in an
alternate-match with Craig Parry when he sank a 35-foot birdie putt
on the 17th hole to even the match against Fred Couples and Tiger
Woods.
	   Parry won it a hole later with a 50-foot chip-in for birdie.
	   In the afternoon, Maruyama teamed with countryman Joe Ozaki and
dusted off David Duval and Phil Mickelson in a best-ball match.
After Mickelson squared the match with a 30-foot putter, Maruyama
proved ended the match it a hurry with three straight birdies for a
3 and 2 victory.
	   Events like the Presidents Cup or Ryder Cup are a perfect place
for an unknown star to emerge, and this year the label fits nicely
on the 5-foot-6 Japanese dynamo.
	   ``It certainly has brought the recognition of players into focus
_ other than the United States players and Australian players who
we all know about,'' said U.S. captain Jack Nicklaus. ``From a
television standpoint, I think it's wonderful.''
	   Maruyama is regarded in Japan as the next Jumbo Ozaki, who has
won over 100 tournaments and is ranked No. 13 in the world. But the
knock on Ozaki is that he can never win outside Japan.
	   Maruyama already is a little more traveled.
	   Not only was he among the early leaders in the 1996 British Open
and this year's PGA Championship at Sahalee, the long-hitting
Maruyama finished 11th in the World Series of Golf in August, which
was won by Duval.
	   ``Outside of Japan, a lot of people don't think of Japanese golf
at this level,'' Maruyama said through an interpreter. ``We wanted
to do our best and to represent Japan to everyone around the world.
	   ``We don't go out of Japan very much, but when we do, we like to
play well.''
	   Only two players have unblemished records through two days and
20 matches at Royal Melbourne _ Maruyama and Joe Ozaki, added to
the team when his brother Jumbo decided he didn't want to make the
trip.
	   Then again, Ozaki's two wins have come in the best-ball matches
when he was teamed with Maruyama. And Maruyama has been the
difference-maker.
	   In their 4 and 3 victory over Mark Calcavecchia and John Huston,
Maruyama made three straight birdies on the front side for a 3-up
lead than they never relinquished. On Saturday, he once again gave
the Japanese team the early lead with birdie putts, then turned it
on right when it looked like Mickelson and Duval were ready to make
a run.
	   In the alternate-shot matches, Maruyama has taken advantage of
Parry's knowledge of Royal Melbourne _ they whipped U.S. Open
champion Lee Janzen and Scott Hoch 3 and 2 on Friday, then added
the 1-up victory over Woods and Couples on Saturday.
	   ``I hit where Mr. Parry told me to hit,'' Maruyama said.
	   Maruyama will be on his own Sunday when he plays against Huston.
A victory would give him a 5-0 mark in this year's matches _ a
Presidents Cup record held only by Mark O'Meara in 1996.
	   Maruyama will never be confused for O'Meara, the Masters and
British Open champion, but he's certainly making a name for
himself.
	   ``Maruyama hasn't played much in the States, but when he plays,
he usually plays pretty well,'' said Nicklaus, who has watched him
at his own Memorial Tournament on the PGA Tour. ``He's a pretty
darn good player.''
	   The Americans have found that out in a hurry.

IOC official alleges widespread bribery in Olympic selection

 &UR; EDS: Stands as RECAP to Sports-Olympics-Bribes. &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Whispers and rumors about
corruption within the International Olympic Committee have existed
for years.
	   On Saturday, one of the IOC's own senior leaders came forward
with startling bribery allegations that shook the agency to the
core and could have widespread repercussions on the entire Olympic
movement.
	   Switzerland's Marc Hodler _ a longtime member of the
organization's ruling inner circle _ detailed what he described as
the systematic buying and selling of the Olympic Games.
	   ``To my knowledge, there has always, always, been a certain part
of the vote given to corruption,'' he said, in setting off the
biggest ethics scandal in the history of the 104-year-old
organization.
	   Hodler specifically cited a pattern of bribery and other ethical
malpractice in the bidding and selection of at least four Olympic
host cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia; and Salt
Lake City.
	   He also cited bribes of up to dlrs 1 million and payoffs of up
to dlrs 5 million.
	   The IOC quickly ``disassociated'' itself from Hodler's
allegations, saying he was voicing his personal opinions. However,
it did not deny his charges.
	   Those charges came not from a maverick or discredited official,
but from one of the IOC's elder statesmen and close confidant of
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   Hodler, a Swiss lawyer who recently turned 80, has been on the
IOC since 1963, making him and former FIFA president Joao Havelange
of Brazil the organization's longest-serving members. Earlier this
year, Hodler stepped down after 47 years as president of the
International Ski Federation.
	   Hodler said he chose to go public with his corruption
allegations because he hopes they lead to a radical reform of the
Olympic selection process.
	   His allegations came as the IOC investigated alleged financial
misconduct by the Salt Lake City group which won the bid for the
2002 games.
	   Hodler used the word ``bribe'' to describe the dlrs 500,000
scholarship fund set up by Salt Lake that benefited the relatives
of six IOC members. A high-level IOC panel is investigating the
charges.
	   Asked whether Atlanta's victory in the vote for the 1996 games
was clean, Hodler said, ``Certainly not.''
	   However, John Krimsky, deputy secretary general of the U.S.
Olympic Committee, disputed Hodler's assertion.
	   ``There is no basis for the charges against Atlanta at this
point,'' Krimsky said. ``All these issues should be put to the IOC
review commission.''
	   Billy Payne, head of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic
Games, said: ``No payments, direct or indirect. No scholarships,
direct or indirect. ... I have never heard of that and will state
positively, unequivocally Atlanta did not do that.''
	   Hodler said Olympic cities should be selected by a small group,
including members of the IOC executive board, rather than the full
IOC membership in order to remove the possibilities of vote buying.
	   He said members _ whose principal role is to vote for Olympic
host cities _ should have no problems agreeing to the change.
	   ``If he doesn't sign, he admits he's a crook,'' Hodler said.
	   In an extraordinary scene at the IOC headquarters, where the
agency was conducting a routine, yearend executive board meeting,
Hodler repeated one bombshell accusation after another. Groups of
reporters huddled around him in the lobby while Olympic officials
listed and looked on in stunned amazement.
	   Hodler said he believed 5 to 7 percent of IOC members _
currently numbering 115 _ have solicited bribes from cities bidding
to host the games.
	   Hodler's principal allegation was that a network of four
``agents'' _ including one IOC member _ have been seeking bribes to
secure votes for Olympic bids. He gave no names.
	   Hodler said he believed the agents had been buying and selling
votes for the past 10 years.
	   ``The four agents try to make a living out of this,'' Hodler
said. ``I missed a chance to be a rich man. Some of the agents do
the following: They say, `I can offer this or that number of
votes.' The price would be between 500,000 dollars and 1 million
dollars for a number of votes, a bloc.''

	   Hodler added that the agents then charge the city winning the
bid ``something like 3 million dollars to 5 million dollars.''
	   Hodler said there is one agent who boasts ``that no city has
ever won the Olympic Games without his help.''
	   ``No one can prove that,'' Hodler said. ``It could be
possible.''
	   Asked whether all Olympic votes are tainted, Hodler said, ``I
know of so many times. There is a good chance it is always the
case.''
	   Hodler said losing cities have told him there is a list of IOC
members who can be bought.
	   Hodler said he hasn't seen the list, but ``what I got is the
number of people that clearly, regularly asked for financial
support.''
	   Samaranch, who has been IOC president since 1980, has always
denied allegations of corruption in the organization, saying he
trusts his members ``100 percent.''
	   On Saturday, he said, ``The only official spokesman for the IOC
executive board is Francois Carrard,'' the director general.
	   ``All the other comments are personal comments. They are not
official comments,'' Samaranch said.
	   Said Carrard: ``These allegations come as a surprise to us. He
is a highly respected IOC member who expresses his personal
views.''
	   Later, the IOC issued a written statement saying the ``executive
board disassociated itself from allegations made by one of its
members with the Olympic bid process.''
	   Hodler also leveled charges against the head of the Athens bid,
which lost to Atlanta in the 1996 vote. However, he said he didn't
know of any misconduct in Athens' successful bid for the 2004
games.
	   Asked whether Sydney's election for the 2000 games was clean,
Hodler said, ``I would be surprised. I know what happened, but I
don't want to disclose it.''
	   ``I can't imagine that Sydney is different from the others,'' he
said. ``Sydney pretends it is completely clean, clean, clean.''
	   The former minister in charge of Sydney's 2000 Olympic bid
revealed he was asked to offer bribes in exchange for votes. But
Bruce Baird, the former New South Wales minister, said he refused.
	   ``I'm pretty angry with Marc Hodler where he implied about
Sydney,'' said Australian IOC member Phil Coles, an official with
the Sydney bidding and organizing committees. ``That's outrageous _
firing scatter guns in all directions. Generalizations like that
are scandalous.
	   ``I'm sure (corruption) is not widespread. The rumor mill has
been rife for many years. He can say what he likes, but don't
generalize. It's not fair.''
	   As for Nagano, Hodler said the committee that won the 1998 games
for the Japanese city ``certainly had to do things which are not
legitimate.''
	   Hodler also alleged:
	   _ An agent ``managed'' the African boycott of the 1976 Montreal
Olympics.
	   ``With 800,000 dollars, the countries would have taken part in
Montreal,'' he said. ``He didn't get the money.''
	   _ The head of the family behind the Fiat car company handed out
free vans to secure votes to bring the 1997 Alpine ski World
Championships to an Italian Alpine resort.
	   Hodler said Gianni Agnelli gave cars to 19 small nations during
the campaign, which led to the selection of the Italian resort of
Sestriere.
	   Fiat issued a statement rejecting the allegations as
``completely false.''

Clinton in Mideast, meeting Netanyahu, Arafat

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After a defiant but warm welcome from Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. President Bill Clinton is
trying to get the crisis-plagued Wye River peace accord back on
track.
	   At a late-night arrival ceremony for Clinton Saturday, Netanyahu
said he hoped the president's visit would ``contribute to true
peace.'' Again, the Israeli leader accused the Palestinians of
ignoring commitments in peace accords.
	   Clinton opens talks with Netanyahu on Sunday and with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip.
	   ``Mr. President,'' Netanyahu said, speaking in Hebrew. ``The
truth has to be told. In recent weeks the Palestinians again
constantly, systematically and intentionally violated all their
commitments. We are not entitled, not able and not prepared to
forgo fulfillment of those commitments.''
	   Netanyahu, who is facing political turmoil in his hard-line
coalition government, said he could not accept ``a phony peace on
paper'' which is ``not honored in practice.''
	   Since Clinton presided over its signing in Washington in
October, the land-for-security agreement he helped broker at Wye
River, Maryland, has hit one snag after another. Israel then froze
implementation of the accord altogether, accusing Arafat of
violating the deal and inciting violent street protests.
	   Clinton said peacemaking has opened historic opportunities to
Israel. The president said the United States shares Israel's
concerns about security.
	   ``Peace is not simply an option among many but the only choice
that can avert still more years of bloodshed, apprehension and
sorrow. That is why I'm here.'' He said ``both sides now must face
the challenge of implementing Wye.''
	   Accompanied by his wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea, the
president flew from the airport on Marine One to Jerusalem where
they will stay during the three-day trip to Israel and Palestinian
territories.
	   Moments before Clinton's arrival in Israel, a group of
right-wing demonstrators gathered outside Clinton's Jerusalem
hotel. Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said police asked
the small group to leave, and that one demonstrator who refused was
taken in for questioning.
	   About two hours before Air Force One landed Saturday, the House
Judiciary Committee approved a fourth article of impeachment
against Clinton. The full House will decide next week whether he
will have to stand trial in the Senate next year.
	   Both Clinton's and Netanyahu have a shaky political future. The
Israeli leader is fighting for his political survival as parliament
prepares for a no-confidence vote within two weeks. His coalition
began to weaken after he and Arafat signed the Wye River Memorandum
Oct. 23 agreeing to turn over 13 percent of West Bank territory to
be met by Palestinian security measures.
	   Netanyahu has said there would be no further troop withdrawals
until West Bank rioting and violence ends. Israel and the
Palestinians are also in bitter disagreement over procedures for
revoking passages in the Palestinian charter calling for Israel's
destruction and the release of Palestinian prisoners held in
Israeli jails for militant or political acts against the Jewish
state.
	   On Monday, the president will fly to the Palestinian-run Gaza
Strip where he is to be welcomed by Arafat with the trappings of a
state visit. Clinton's visit to Gaza is seen by some as a boost for
dreams of Palestinian statehood.
	   The president will address the Palestinian National Council and
other organizations after their affirmation of a decision to revoke
the anti-Israeli provisions of the Palestinian charter.
	   On Tuesday, Clinton is to visit Manger Square in Bethlehem, the
Palestinian-controlled West Bank town where tradition says Jesus
was born. The first family will tour the Church of the Nativity and
the president will light a Christmas tree.
	   His last stop will be at Masada, a hilltop fortress that is a
powerful symbol of Jewish resolve. Under siege by an army of 15,000
Romans, a small group of Jews chose mass suicide rather than
surrender.

Oil ministers to discuss oil policy in Madrid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _Venezuelan, Mexican and Saudi oil
ministerial delegations will meet in Madrid sometime next week to
discuss the effectiveness of the three countries' oil policy,
Venezuelan President-elect Hugo Chavez said late Saturday.
	   Chavez made the announcement after a two-hour meeting with
Mexican Energy Minister Luis Tellez and state-owned oil monopoly
Petroleos Mexicanos, or PEMEX, head Adrian Lajous.
	   ``The objective is to examine oil policy, to examine the
existing oil reduction accords ... and to evaluate what will be the
evolution (next year) of the current alliance of the oil
community,'' Chavez told reporters.
	   The Madrid meeting, which doesn't yet have a fixed date, will be
the fourth formal meeting of the ``tripartite'' oil group composed
of Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia.
	   The last meeting, held on Oct. 2 in Cancun, Mexico, yielded only
a commitment by Mexico to extend its promised oil reductions until
June 30, 1999. In its two previous meetings, however, the group
initiated and then expanded the current accords among major oil
exporters to reduce production.
	   The Venezuelan president-elect also reiterated that his
administration will enforce existing oil production reduction
agreements made earlier this year.
	   Venezuela promised to slash oil production by 525,000 barrels a
day, but Energy Minister Erwin Arrieta recently said that country
won't cut more than 440,000 barrels per day during the life of the
cutback accords. These accords last until June 30, 1999.

Statehooders hopeful for first win as Puerto Ricans vote

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Divided, edgy and somewhat
confused, Puerto Ricans are deciding whether to petition for U.S.
statehood after an acrimonious campaign that, if anything,
highlighted their pride in being a distinct nation.
	   A victory for the statehood movement _ even by a mere plurality
of votes _ would be their first and could begin the long and
arduous journey to becoming the 51st state. A defeat, the second in
five years, could bury the movement for many years to come.
	   Last-minute polls going into Sunday's vote showed a photo finish
between statehood and ``none of the above,'' the option backed by
the movement that supports keeping the current ``commonwealth''
status.
	   Statehood had been ahead in most polls to date, supporters
staged the most visible and energetic campaign, and it appears to
have the more determined voters. Gov. Pedro Rossello, who has made
statehood his crusade, predicted ``a big triumph.''
	   The opposition has played on Puerto Ricans' pride in their
culture _ and their fear that the melodies of Spanish and rhythms
of salsa might be further and irrevocably crushed in a statehood
stampede of fast food, MTV and imposed English.
	   For Congress, which has ultimate authority over Puerto Rico's
status, the vote poses some serious questions.
	   If Puerto Rico became the first U.S. state to have a homogeneous
Spanish-speaking population with a distinct Hispanic identity, how
would that affect a Union whose face already is changing, including
a burgeoning Hispanic population? Will the United States remain an
overwhelmingly English-speaking nation?
	   Another question is whether the United States should fully
incorporate a territory so ambivalent about statehood that getting
half the people to support the idea is a mammoth undertaking.
	   Although it could theoretically bring on permanent and jarring
changes, the referendum has not caught fire with the public.
	   Under the Puerto Rican commonwealth devised in 1952, the island
has many of the rights of a U.S. state and some of the
characteristics of a country.
	   Its 3.8 million people are U.S. citizens and serve in the
military, which maintains a strategic presence on the island. But
they don't pay federal taxes or vote for president or Congress.
	   Critically, Puerto Ricans have their own Olympic team and other
symbols of sovereignty that satisfy their immense patriotism.
	   With a bewildering array of five options on the ballot _ all
written in legalese and lacking as much as a heading _ it seemed
unlikely that statehood _ ``Option 3'' _ could get the 51 percent
majority that many say is needed for Congress to take notice.
	   Rossello had hoped that Congress would authorize a statehood
process in 1998, the centennial of U.S. rule in Puerto Rico.
	   A bill calling for a binding referendum process allowing Puerto
Ricans to choose among statehood, commonwealth and independence
passed the House by a single vote in March. But it stalled in the
Senate, partly due to Republican concerns that a Puerto Rican state
would send mostly Democrats to the Hill.
	   Rossello called Sunday's nonbinding referendum anyway. Banking
on support from President Bill Clinton, he was expected to use even
a plurality for statehood to urge Congress to act.
	   Rossello's strategy, aides say, is to have Congress devise a
binding referendum between only statehood and independence. With
many people fearful their prosperity could vanish with
independence, statehood would then gain the huge majority Americans
expect in return for the honor, the reasoning goes. Polls indeed
show such a vote would heavily favor statehood.
	   A poll published in The San Juan Star on Friday found statehood
ahead of ``None of the above,'' 48 percent to 46 percent. But a
poll in El Nuevo Dia found ``none of the above'' ahead for the
first time, 48 percent to 45 percent. In both cases the difference
was less than the margin of error.
	   The remainder is split between independence, ``free
association'' _ independence with treaty ties _ and a commonwealth
definition opposed by commonwealthers because of a dispute over
wording.
	   San Juan Mayor Sila Calderon, the darling of the
pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party, has been predicting a
last-minute rush by the undecided to ``none of the above.''
	   That would be similar to what happened in the last referendum in
1993. With statehood ahead in the polls, undecided voters opted for
the certainties of the status quo at the last minute, giving
commonwealth a narrow victory.

Bribery allegations only latest accusations against Olympic

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The allegations made Saturday of widespread
bribery in voting for Olympic host cities were not the first
accusations of corruption facing the International Olympic
Committee, a group founded on fairness and honor.
	   The worst previous case in the IOC's 104-year history came in
1991, when Robert Helmick resigned as a member of the international
committee and as president of the U.S. Olympic Committee because of
conflict of interest in private dealings with sports-related
companies.
	   An investigation by Arnold Burns, a former deputy U.S. attorney
general, found Helmick, a lawyer from Des Moines, Iowa,
``repeatedly violated conflict-of-interest provisions of the USOC
and created a perception that he was trafficking on his Olympic
positions for the benefit of private clients.''
	   The following year, the IOC and its president, Juan Antonio
Samaranch, were the focus of ``The Lords of the Rings,'' a book by
British authors Andrew Jennings and Vyv Simson, that reported
widespread corruption and revealed Samaranch's ties to the fascist
regime of former Spanish dictator Francisco Franco.
	   It said Samaranch and other international sports leaders had
benefited personally from the success of the Olympics and that
cities bidding to stage the games spent small fortunes to obtain
votes.
	   Focusing on the race for the 1998 Winter Olympics, the book said
Nagano, Japan, committed dlrs 10 million to secure votes during the
IOC session in Birmingham, England, where the vote was taken.
	   Nagano won that balloting by four votes over Salt Lake City,
which four years later was chosen to stage the 2002 Winter Games.
	   Earlier, the IOC had been so embarrassed by lavish parties,
gifts and travel given to its members and their families in the
runup to voting for the 1992 Summer and Winter Games that it
imposed the first of what have become increasingly tight
restrictions on what members may accept from bid cities. Those
rules now limit gifts to a total of dlrs 150 for each of the 115
IOC members.
	   Despite widespread speculation and repeated reports of
corruption, however, the IOC never has publicly punished a member
for violating its ethics rules.
	   The Olympic Charter, the IOC's bylaws, says the committee and
the international Olympic community it leads ``seeks to create a
way of life based on the joy found in effort, the educational value
of good example and respect for universal fundamental ethical
principles.''

Atlanta Olympic officials deny bribery charges

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Olympic organizers and government officials
angrily denied charges on Saturday that International Olympic
Committee members were bribed during the city's successful bid for
the 1996 Centennial Games.
	   ``No payments, direct or indirect,'' said Billy Payne, who led
Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Games and was chief of the Atlanta
Committee for the Olympic Games. ``No scholarships, direct or
indirect. ...
	   ``I have never heard of that and will state positively,
unequivocally, Atlanta did not do that.''
	   Marc Hodler, a senior member of the IOC Committee executive
board, told reporters in Switzerland that organizers in Atlanta and
other host cities paid for the votes of IOC members during the
bidding process.
	   The 80-year-old Swiss lawyer said agents work on the behalf of
IOC members seeking the best possible deal. Hodler charged that
payments were sometimes made in the form of college scholarships to
relatives of IOC members.
	   Hodler said other organizing committees, including 1998 Winter
Games host Salt Lake City, also bribed IOC members.
	   In his 1996 book, ``The New Lords of the Rings,'' British
journalist Andrew Jennings said that ACOG paid the tuition for the
stepson of a powerful Russian Olympic official.
	   Andrei Smirnov, the stepson of then-IOC executive committee
member Vitaly Smirnov, enrolled at the University of Georgia in
1991, a year after Atlanta won the Summer Games.
	   On Saturday, Payne _ who played gridiron football at the
university _ said he worked on the younger Smirnov's behalf but
never made payments. He said the aid never went beyond offering
contact names and phone numbers.
	   ``We knew him, and we knew his father and ... Vitaly had become
a good friend,'' Payne said. ``We said, 'Call this person and call
that person.' We gave him a name at a Ramada Inn, where he got a
job cleaning toilets.
	   ``We helped him as we would a son of any friend.''
	   The Salt Lake Olympic Committee has acknowledged that almost
dlrs 400,000 from a college scholarship fund it ran during its bid
wound up with children of six IOC members.
	   Hodler said the same thing went on to secure the Atlanta bid.
When the city won the Games in 1990, it was considered an upset
over Athens, Greece, site of the first modern Olympics in 1896.
	   Dean H. Propst, who was the chancellor of the state university
system at the time of Atlanta's bidding, said Georgia schools had
no involvement in a scholarship-for-votes deal.
	   ``Anything like that would have to have been approved by the
Board of Regents,'' Propst said. ``I think I would have known about
it.''
	   Zell Miller, governor of the state of Georgia, had not heard of
any bribes being given to IOC members for their votes, a
spokeswoman said.
	   Andrew Young, ex-Atlanta mayor and former U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, was given credit for helping Atlanta win the games
by persuading African IOC members to vote for the city. Young was
traveling Saturday and did not return several phone calls.
	   Current Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell was not involved in the bid
process. His spokesman, Nick Gold, said city officials did lobby
IOC members during the bidding process, but without breaking any
rules.
	   ``In no way were there any bribes offered,'' Gold said.

Trustees meeting called to discuss scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The board of trustees overseeing
the Salt Lake City Olympics will meet in emergency session next
week to dicuss the controversy surrounding alleged rules violations
involving the bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   The board's executive committee will meet in Salt Lake next
Friday. The board had not planned to meet again until Jan. 14.
	   Salt Lake spokesman Frank Zang said Saturday that the meeting
was moved up at the urging of organizing committee president Frank
Joklik so members could be apprised of the situation.
	   ``There is only one item on the agenda _ this,'' said John
Krimsky, U.S. Olympic Committee's deputy secretary general,
referring to the controversy.
	   The IOC opened a high-level investigation Friday into alleged
misconduct by the Salt Lake bid committee, which won the right to
stage the 2002 games.
	   The controversy centers on a scholarship fund _ described as
``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials. The program provided
nearly dlrs 400,000 in tuition and other assistance to 13
individuals _ including six relatives of IOC members, mostly from
Africa.
	   Senior Swiss IOC member Marc Hodler, who heads the IOC's
oversight panel for the 2002 games, has described the fund as a
``bribe'' to sway the votes of IOC members. Salt Lake won the games
by a landslide in the 1995 election.
	   Joklik, senior vice president Dave Johnson and other officials
met for 90 minutes Friday night with the IOC panel investigating
the case. Neither side commented on the substance of the meeting.
	   Asked to sum up the mood of the Salt Lake officials, Krimsky
said, ``I wouldn't call it jovial, but they were stable.''
	   Zang said late Saturday there had been no more meetings with the
IOC panel since Friday.
	   ``We're in a holding pattern,'' he said. ``We're on call and
ready to meet with the IOC whenever we're asked.''
	   Officials said they don't expect the inquiry to be wrapped up by
the end of the IOC executive board meetings here Monday.
	   Officials have declined to speculate on what _ if any sanctions
_ could be taken against Salt Lake.
	   In Utah, government were cautious about commenting on the
possible fallout of the bribery allegations.
	   ``We simply don't have enough perspective right now,'' said
Vicki Varela, spokeswoman for Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt. ``The hope is
that as we all have more information, the integrity of the bid as a
whole will remain intact.''
	   ``All we can do is try to maintain quality services and do a
positive campaign saying that Salt Lake City is different from the
Salt Lake Olympics,'' said Bryce Jolley, chairman of the City
Council.
	   The investigation has completely overshadowed Salt Lake's report
to the IOC on preparations for the games.
	   On Sunday, SLOC officials will seek the executive board's
approval for their new dlrs 1.453 billion budget, final competition
schedule and any venue changes.
	   In addition, organizers are expected to ask for the board's
endorsement for Salt Lake's long-delayed mascot _ or mascots. The
official launch of the mascot is scheduled for February.
	   Hodler contested the argument by the current Salt Lake
organizing committee that it was not directly involved in the
controversial scholarship program and that the onus was on former
bid chief Thomas Welch.
	   ``Yesterday the lawyer of Salt Lake City said, `Everything had
been done by Tom Welch, who is not there anymore. We know nothing.'
My experience is that this is not true,'' Hodler said.
	   Joklik was chairman of the bid committee at the time. Johnson
also was a high official on the bid panel.
	   Welch resigned as SLOC president last year after allegations of
domestic violence against his wife.

Forensics expert says digging may be off at disputed Kosovo site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Plans to exhume massacre victims
from a grave in a rebel-held part of Kosovo province may be dropped
because of Serbian police resistance, a forensics team member said
Saturday.
	   A Finnish team was blocked Thursday from starting work at a hill
near Gornje Obrinje that is believed to contain the bodies of 22
ethnic Albanians massacred by Serb troops in September. Serb police
in armored vehicles said digging couldn't be carried out without
their presence.
	   Talks between the experts and government authorities have yet to
resolve the dispute, team member Tino Lahelma said. ``Anything can
happen, but I do think we have an impasse with Gornje Obrinje,''
Lahelma said.
	   If the situation persists, he said work at the site will not be
possible. However, exhumation efforts would continue at five other
sites where authorities also gave the team permission to dig. ``We
don't want to give up,'' Lahelma said.
	   The top government official for Kosovo, Zoran Andjelkovic,
insists the Finns are not being prevented from doing their work.
But Lahelma said it's unrealistic for police to insist on escorting
the Finns and the Serbian legal team accompanying them to the site
in rebel-controlled territory.
	   Tension remains high despite a 2-month-old truce, and the Kosovo
Liberation Army of ethnic Albanian separatists has said police are
not welcome in the central Drenica region, heartland of the
guerrilla movement.
	   ``We don't want to risk our lives'' by bringing police into a
KLA-controlled area, Lahelma said.
	   Gornje Obrinje, 25 miles west of Pristina, is where some of the
most gruesome killings took place during fighting between Serb
forces and ethnic Albanian separatist rebels. The grave the Finns
were to investigate there was believed to contain the bodies of 22
ethnic Albanians from a single family clan, including children. The
mutilated bodies were seen by diplomats and journalists shortly
after the slayings in September.
	   In related events Saturday:
	   _Family members of Serb civilians believed abducted by rebels
appealed to the U.S. head of international peace monitors to help
in the search for the missing. About 200 Serbs have disappeared in
Kosovo.
	   _Serbian media said ethnic Albanian gunmen killed five people
Friday: four ethnic Albanians loyal to the Serbian government and a
Serb policeman.

Clinton's options dwindle as House impeachment vote nears
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP News Analysis &QC; 
 &UR; By RON FOURNIER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Political Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Now that President Bill Clinton has suggested
``censure and rebuke'' as a punishment, his few remaining escape
routes are risky or grim. He may have unwittingly decreased his
chance of avoiding a Senate impeachment trial.
	   Some supporters suggested he should have cancelled a trip to the
Mideast to wage the fight himself. He'll return just before the
issue goes to the House floor on Wednesday.
	   ``I don't see any way out of this,'' Roger Davidson, University
of Maryland political science professor, said Saturday as the House
Judiciary Committee approved a fourth and final article of
impeachment. ``He's just watching the train speeding down the
tracks toward him.''
	   Clinton's advisers struggled to plot his next move, as the
president began a four-day diplomatic mission to the Middle East.
	   One option is to offer more concessions to Republicans,
particularly the two dozen or so moderates who hold Clinton's fate
in their hands. Few wavering lawmakers were moved by the
president's Rose Garden address Friday, in which he apologized for
his conduct and said he would accept congressional censure.
	   To their dismay, Clinton stubbornly refused to give any ground
on charges that he lied under oath. The closest he came was a weak
third-person reference: ``It's hard to hear yourself called
deceitful and manipulative,'' he said.
	   Many Republicans insist Clinton must come clean to avoid
impeachment in the House. His chances of surviving a Senate trial
are much higher, since Republicans lack the necessary two-thirds
majority to remove the president from office in the so-far strictly
partisan battle.
	   Rep. Rick Lazio, one of two undecided Republicans touring the
Middle East with Clinton, said aboard Air Force One that ``it would
be an important statement'' if Clinton admitted to lying.
	   ``He has had numerous opportunities to confront the reality of
what he has done and missed those opportunities. It's not too late,
but it's very late in the game,'' Lazio said.
	   Yet few members of the president's inner circle are willing to
predict he will to go so far. A confession would increase Clinton's
exposure to criminal charges after leaving office, and would not
stop Republican demands for more concessions, they say.
	   ``The only thing he hasn't done is plead guilty to a crime. If
he does that, they'll say he should be impeached because he pleaded
guilty to a crime,'' said Lanny Davis, a former White House special
counsel and informal adviser.
	   Davis said he wished Clinton had canceled the Middle East trip
``to wage this battle himself.''
	   He suggests the president should attack House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, making the conservative nicknamed ``The Hammer'' a
lightening rod for anti-impeachment sentiment. In past political
battles, the party's target was outgoing House Speaker Newt
Gingrich.
	   ``I hope the president starts to fight,'' Davis said. ``The time
for apologies are over.''
	   The aggressive approach is an emerging Democratic tactic.
	   White House lawyer Gregory Craig said Saturday a House vote for
impeachment would ``divide the country, gridlock the government and
defy the will of the people.''
	   After the White House was accused of applying political pressure
to Republican moderates, Judiciary Committee member Barney Frank, a
Democrat, fired back: ``Any discussion of pressuring ... that
leaves out the name of Tom DeLay is equivalent to debating
impeachment without mentioning Monica Lewinsky.''
	   Frank's sister, White House communications director Ann Lewis,
said Clinton's team also will begin to sound alarms about what the
House is poised to do. The strategy is to rally the majority of
Americans who tell pollsters they don't support impeachment. But it
will be a chore.
	   Though six out of 10 say they oppose impeachment, the number who
want Clinton ousted has grown slightly. In one recent poll, nearly
90 percent of people surveyed said Clinton lied under oath.
	   Clinton supporters fear there may be little passion behind the
public's opposition to impeachment. ``The public has checked out on
all of this since the election,'' said Democratic pollster Geoffrey
Garin, though he said the Judiciary Committee votes might get their
attention.
	   Phone banks and other pressure tactics are being organized this
weekend by labor and minority groups allied with the Democratic
National Committee. Their activities are concentrated in the
handful of districts served by undecided Republicans.
	   Yet Clinton's critics may be more energized than his supporters.
	   ``The Republican base has gotten a shot of adrenaline since the
midterm elections,'' said Republican strategist Ralph Reed, former
head of the Christian Coalition.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A police officer convicted of providing guns
to a paramilitary group has been sentenced to nearly four years in
prison, the first conviction in the December, 1997 massacre of 45
Indian villagers in the southern state of Chiapas.
	   Prosecutors have arrested about 125 people _ including soldiers
and policemen accused of aiding the pro-government gunmen or
failing to stop the massacre _ but before Friday's decision had not
gained a conviction in almost one year since the massacre.
	   State policeman Sebastian Luna Perez was sentenced to three
years, nine months in prison for illegal arms transport and
possession by a judge in the state capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez
Friday, the newspaper Reforma reported Saturday.
	   Court authorities were unavailable to comment on reports of the
sentence Saturday.
	   Another 12 policemen are also on trial in the case, and a
soldier has been charged with having trained the group that
committed the massacre on Dec. 22, 1997 in the Chiapas hamlet of
Acteal. A retired army general serving as a police officer has been
charged with failing to stop the killing. ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Protesters stormed congress Saturday throwing
tomatoes, dumping flour on some lawmakers and briefly disrupting a
session in which a vote was planned on a dlrs 60 billion bank
bailout proposal.
	   The ruling party and members of one opposition group reached a
tentative compromise late Friday on the controversial government
purchase of bad loans made by private banks, ending a months-long
stalemate.
	   About 50 members of El Barzon, a militant debtors' group, forced
an hour-long adjournment in Saturday's session when they stormed
the floor.
	   Many lawmakers had not yet arrived for the bank bailout debate
when the protesters entered after jumping fences and forcing a
door. ___ &QC; 
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ An accident involving a passenger bus and
two trucks left nine people dead and 32 injured, authorities in
southern Guatemala reported Saturday.
	   The accident, which occured Friday night in the town of
Amatitlan, about 15 miles (25 kms) south of the capital, blocked
traffic on one of the country's main highways for several hours.
	   Survivors told local police that the bus skidded about 300 yards
(meters) before striking a tractor trailer and a smaller truck. It
was unclear whether the victims were traveling on the bus or the
trucks.
	   The injured were taken to Guatemala's Roosevelt Hospital and a
hospital in Amatitlan for treatment.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ A French U.N. official held captive in southern
Russia for more than 10 months was freed by Russian security forces
in a shootout Saturday and flown to Geneva for a reunion with his
family and colleagues.
	   Vincent Cochetel, head of the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in the North Ossetia region, was taken to
a hospital for medical checks immediately after his arrival at
Geneva airport. He was said to be exhausted, but in good health.
	   His father, Alain, said the family hugged quietly, too
overwhelmed to speak, when Cochetel stepped off the plane. His
mother, Madeleine, described her son's return as ``the best
Christmas present ever.''
	   Cochetel, 37, was seized by three masked gunmen on Jan. 29 in
the North Ossetia regional capital, Vladikavkaz. He was freed in a
pre-dawn operation on the border between the republics of Chechnya
and Ingushetia, but a firefight broke out between the kidnappers
and Russian security forces, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Cochetel, who is married and has two daughters ages 6 and 7, was
unharmed. He said three kidnappers were killed.
	   In footage of the operation broadcast by Russia's NTV television
station, Cochetel was shown kneeling and crouching behind a white
van, his hands cuffed behind his back. Russian security officers in
masks and camouflage stood over him protectively, then dragged him
away as gunfire erupted and bullets bounced off the van.
	   Two security officers were slightly injured, Interior Ministry
spokesman Alexander Mikhailov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency. No ransom was paid for Cochetel's release, Mikhailov said.
	   Cochetel was flown by chartered jet from southern Russia to
Moscow, where he was met by French Ambassador Hubert Colin de
Verdiere and U.N. officials before flying on to Geneva.
	   Speaking briefly to reporters in Moscow, Cochetel thanked
President Boris Yeltsin and other officials who made his release
possible. ``It is the first time people have risked their lives for
me,'' he said.
	   Cochetel said that for the first two months, ``there was a lot
of violence, they were interrogating me and that was all very
serious,'' Interfax reported. For the past several months, he had
been kept almost completely in the dark, he said.
	   ``Twenty minutes of daylight every single day, that's very
hard,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   Cochetel also said he knew who was responsible for his
kidnapping and called for the abductors to be brought to justice,
Interfax reported.
	   ``I believe there must be a court trial,'' he said. ``If there
is no trial, the process of kidnapping people will continue.''
	   Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia
ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the
breakaway republic and neighboring regions by gangs who are mostly
motivated by ransom. Dozens of people are currently held captive.
	   Cochetel's release came four days after the severed heads of
four hostages were found in Chechnya. The four were killed after a
government rescue attempt apparently went wrong.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov ordered a partial call-up of
army reserves Saturday night in an effort to fight crime. Deputy
Prime Minister Turpal Atgeriyev told Chechen television that crime
``has assumed proportions threatening the state,'' according to
Interfax.
	   ``How many people must the bandits kill to make us lose our
patience and declare a real war on them?,'' Interfax quoted
Atgeriyev as saying. He said that those responsible for murdering
three Britons and a New Zealander in Chechnya last week must be
brought to justice.
	   Chechnya's top prosecutor Mansur Tagirov, who was investigating
the killings and apparently was kidnapped Thursday, was released
Saturday, Interfax said.

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Spacewalking astronauts completed
their construction work on the international space station
Saturday, lashing a toolbox to the outside and fixing a jammed
antenna.
	   It was the third and final excursion out into Endeavour's open
cargo bay for Jerry Ross and James Newman.
	   All that remained following the spacewalk was Sunday afternoon's
release of the seven-story, 35-ton complex, freshly wired and
outfitted by the visiting shuttle crew.
	   ``We've come a long way,'' commander Robert Cabana observed.
	   Working nearly 250 miles above Earth, Ross and Newman lugged out
a 2 foot-by-2-foot bundle containing 50 wrenches, ratchets, clamps,
bars, foot loops, tethers and other tools. They attached the
package to the top of Unity, the American-made side of the station.
	   The toolbox looked like a picnic cooler.
	   ``I'm hungry, what's in the refrigerator?'' joked Newman.
	   ``Nothing edible,'' Ross replied.
	   The tools will be used by future spacewalkers. The next
construction team goes up in May.
	   Ross turned his attention to the stuck Russian antenna after
completing a check of the cables he and Newman installed earlier in
the week and disconnecting other cables no longer needed.
	   Armed with a 10-foot pole, Ross was hoisted on the end of the
shuttle robot arm up to Zarya, the Russian-built control module
stacked atop Unity. He kept his distance as he poked the antenna,
the same method that Newman used to fix another jammed antenna
during spacewalk No. 2 on Wednesday.
	   Ross tapped the stuck antenna, then jiggled it, then tapped it
again and again. After several minutes and dozens of pokes, the
antenna finally shot out to its full 4 feet.
	   ``There it goes! You can see it in the sun,'' Newman called out.
	   ``All right!'' shouted Ross.
	   The two roll-out antennas failed to open properly following last
month's launch of Zarya.
	   Once that was done, the spacewalkers shimmied to the tiptop of
Zarya and did the Russians another favor by fixing a loose panel.
	   The remainder of the spacewalk was dedicated to non-construction
work: a photo survey of the space station and a test of the
astronauts' mini jetpacks. They were to remain tethered to the
shuttle for added safety.
	   Ross was extra careful this time not to lose anything. Two tools
got away from him during Monday's spacewalk, and a thermal cover
floated away during Wednesday's outing.
	   ``I don't have the slightest idea what happened,'' Ross told a
TV interviewer late Friday. ``I did four previous spacewalks, never
lost an item. ... I have absolutely no explanation for why things
came loose.''
	   Saturday's spacewalk was the seventh of Ross' career _ a U.S.
record _ and the fourth for Newman.
	   NASA estimates 159 more spacewalks will be needed over the next
five years to build and maintain the international space station,
which eventually will stretch as long as a football field. Most of
the spacewalks will be conducted by Americans.

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Lorrie Morgan is happily talking
until the subject shifts to Tammy Wynette.
	   Then she stops.
	   ``I don't want to talk about Tammy,'' Morgan says. ``I get too
sad.''
	   Morgan has often has been compared to Wynette, who died in
April. Like Wynette, Morgan is tough but vulnerable, scarred by
tragedy and dogged by the tabloids. And like Wynette, she can make
it all come pouring out in her voice.
	   On ``Secret Love,'' Morgan's new album, she takes a detour from
country to sing sophisticated pop classics by George Gershwin
(``They Can't Take That Away From Me''), Sammy Fain (``Secret
Love'') and other masters of popular song.
	   The stretch would be difficult for many country singers. Not so
Morgan, whose father made sure her musical education was
well-rounded.
	   Born Loretta Lynn Morgan in 1959, she was the fifth child of
late country crooner George Morgan. As a child she was a regular
backstage at the Grand Ole Opry and made her debut on the radio
show when she was 13.
	   But she didn't claim stardom as a birthright. It took years to
claw her way up working clubs, local television and the Opryland
theme park. She recorded on four record labels before coming into
her own as a solo star in 1989 with the million-selling album
``Leave the Light On.''
	   As a high-profile country star of the 1990s, she pushes
Nashville boundaries in almost every area: music, image and as
prime grist for the gossip mill.
	   Earlier this year, tabloids alleged that Morgan took ``a wild
ride in the back of a limousine with President Clinton'' when she
attended the annual Christmas tree lighting in Washington, D.C.,
last year. Morgan said the reports were ``totally fabricated.''
	   Over the years, she's shown up on the arm of U.S. Sen. Fred
Thompson, R-Tennessee, and Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman.
Her second husband, country singer Keith Whitley, died in 1989 from
alcohol poisoning.
	   But Morgan smiles and shrugs her shoulders, and says she has no
apologies for what she's done in her life.
	   She sits behind her desk at the antique-laden offices of Lorrie
Morgan Entertainment. Known to favor outrageous and revealing stage
costumes at times, she is dressed in an elegant white business suit
for an interview.
	   She is assertive, with a steely, challenging gaze. Talking about
the country music business, Morgan will say things her peers are
too diplomatic to articulate.
	   ``We can't be dictated to by radio,'' she offers at one point.
``Radio needs to play what we send them. ... That's my opinion, and
that's a lot of our opinions.''
	   She's also not afraid to take chances.
	   Take ``Secret Love,'' for example. Conventional wisdom says
recording such an album is a bad idea because it runs counter to
Morgan's image as a country hit maker. And with a new country album
coming in two months, it will be pushed aside as a marketing
priority at RCA.
	   She did it anyway.
	   ``Just adding to the load, adding to the stress,'' she says with
a tired smile and a roll of her eyes. ``It's something I've wanted
to do since I was a little girl.''
	   Morgan supported the album with a brief tour, hiring small
orchestras in each city.
	   ``I'd love for country music to embrace this album and say,
`This is one of our artists taking a walk barefoot through the park
for a few months,''' Morgan says. ``Half the songs I hear on
country radio are not country music, so why not play a couple of
these cuts?''
	   Morgan learned to love the standards at the knee of her father,
who died in 1975. Lush hits like ``Candy Kisses'' and ``Almost''
earned him the title of ``the Perry Como of Country Music.'' He was
inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame this year.
	   ``When you think about the greats, like Jim Reeves and Eddy
Arnold and George Morgan, there really isn't that much of a
difference between their singing and Andy Williams and Perry
Como,'' Morgan said. ``It's just the instrumentation that was a lot
different.''
	   Morgan's year-old marriage to singer Jon Randall is her third to
a musician. She's previously been married to Whitley and steel
guitarist Ron Gaddis. She also had a short marriage to bus driver
Brad Thompson.
	   Morgan has two children, Jesse Keith Whitley, 11, and Morgan
Anastasia Gaddis, 17.
	   She says she takes on projects like ``Secret Love'' to send a
message to ``my grandchildren and generations to come: `Great music
never dies, it never gets old. It's never outdated.'''

<TEXT>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) _ Perhaps nowhere in the music industry is
staying close to one's roots as important as in punk rock.
	   Artists who stray too far from their past _ playing small clubs
for passionate fans _ while they pursue fame and fortune are
blistered as sellouts.
	   It's the same with bands who leave the independent, or
``indie,'' record labels where their records were first sold to
join a major player in the business.
	   But Fugazi, a four-man punk band from Washington, D.C., never
tried reaching for the brass ring of celebrity, despite many
lucrative offers over the years. And the adherence to that ethic
has made them one of the most famous and successful punk bands in
the nation.
	   ``Our only ambition is making music that satisfies us,'' said
drummer Brendan Canty, who makes up the band with guitarists Ian
MacKaye and Guy Picciotto and bassist Joe Lally.
	   Fugazi doesn't make videos to promote its latest releases of
anti-authoritarianism lyrics wrapped in virtuoso rock music. And
the band isn't being pushed into record stores across the United
States by a huge record label's long distribution arms.
	   ``I've seen a lot of friends who signed with major labels crash
and burn, eat humble pie,'' Canty said. ``Maybe that's because in
that side of the business, the pressure's turned up on expectations
to perform.''
	   Instead, the band runs its own label, Dischord Records. Dischord
was founded by MacKaye in 1980 while he was playing in the
hard-core punk outfit Minor Threat. With no bottom line to meet,
the label can keep prices low and the band accessible to everyone.
Dischord sold Fugazi's most recent CD, ``End Hits,'' for dlrs 10.
	   The fan-friendliness carries over to their concerts, where
tickets are about dlrs 5 and the shows are crowded with people of
all ages. This is an approach guaranteed not to earn the band the
most money possible, considering its popularity. But as the song
``Merchandise'' notes, ``You are not what you own.''
	   Fugazi's fans, in turn, thank the band for its generosity by
packing their concerts.
	   On a recent night in Des Moines, more than 500 people wedged
into the darkness of the sold-out Safari Club to mosh, pogo and
shimmy. It's a scene that will be repeated during the band's
three-week autumn tour of the Midwest and South.
	   The fans also turn out in droves to buy the band's albums.
Fugazi has sold more than 1 million records in its 11-year career.
	   ``For an independent band, that's pretty handsome to show
numbers like that,'' said Jeff Mayfield, director for charts at
Billboard Magazine.
	   Fugazi (the band takes its name from Vietnam War soldiers' slang
for ``messed up'') is popular enough to have been invited to
participate in Lollapalooza, the annual traveling rock show.
	   But the concert refused the band's request to drop ticket
prices, so Fugazi stayed true to its principles and rejected the
offer, no matter the loss of exposure.
	   ``The absolute worst thing that could happen to me is being
famous,'' Canty said. ``I don't want to exploit myself for that.''
	   Other bands respect Fugazi for its attitude and ethical stands.
Jim Ward, a member of At the Drive-In, an El Paso band sharing the
bill at the recent show here, said it was hard not to admire them.
	   ``I've been listening to them for a lot of years,'' Ward said.
``It definitely means a lot for us to play with them.''
	   Perhaps what contribujtes most to Fugazi's success could be seen
during the first encore at the Safari Club. The band opened with
``Arpeggiator,'' a sophisticated, driving instrumental based upon
an arpeggio, where the notes in the chords are played in succession
and not simultaneously.
	   Closing the four-song encore was the hard-core ``Do You Like
Me,'' which rails against the merger of defense contractors
Lockheed and Martin Marietta.
	   Fugazi is very political, with songs like ``Dear Justice
Letter,'' addressed to late U.S. Supreme Court Justice William
Brennan, and ``5 Corporations,'' which accuses conglomerates of
creating a stifling conformity.
	   The band has also performed at benefit concerts for issues as
diverse as Tibetan freedom and home rule for Washington, D.C.
	   But the political movement for which the band is best known is
``Straight Edge.'' That song, written by MacKaye while he was with
Minor Threat, talks about a no-drug, no-alcohol lifestyle. Punks
across the nation took the lead from the lyrics and followed suit.
	   The movement of mostly young people has proliferated in Utah,
with an estimated 3,000 adherents. In September, a follower of the
Straight Edge philosophy was sentenced to seven years in prison for
bombing a fur-breeding cooperative.
	   ``It was just the title of a song that I wrote,'' said MacKaye,
who doesn't drink, do drugs or eat meat. ``I guess I coined the
phrase but certainly never intended to start a movement.''
	   Fugazi will soon release a documentary called ``Instrument,'' a
collaboration with filmmaker Jem Cohen about the last 11 years of
the band. The two-hour film will be released on video by Dischord
early next year and will contain footage shot in Super 8, 16mm and
video, combining concert, tour, studio and interview material.
	   The film's soundtrack is made up entirely of unreleased Fugazi
music culled from live tapes, demos and basement recording
sessions, and is to be released as an album.

Kjus and weather thwart Austrians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Austrian skiers, who appeared
invincible this World Cup season, were nowhere to be seen on
Saturday.
	   While Lasse Kjus claimed his first World Cup win in nearly two
years, one had to look all the way down to 15th place before
finding the first Austrian, unheralded Norbert Holzknecht.
	   Below that, lost in the depths of the results sheet, reigning
World Cup downhill champion Andreas Schifferer languished in 29th.
Double Olympic champion Hermann Maier, who won the World Cup
overall, super-G and giant slalom titles last year, straggled in
36th.
	   Instead, it was Kjus who shared the podium with two Italians,
Luca Cattaneo in second and Erik Seletto in third.
	   It marked the first time this season that the Austrians failed
to land at least one skier on the podium. In fact, before Saturday,
the Austrians had counted at least one skier among the top three in
every downhill since January 24 last year when Josef Strobl
finished third in Kitzbuehel.
	   With the Austrians topping the standings in every discipline but
the downhill, Kjus's victory came as a refreshing change _ and
surprise.
	   With his last win dating back to March 1997, when he won a
downhill on home snow in Kvitfjell, Norway, Kjus was bewildered
himself.
	   ``I really wasn't expecting anything special because I'd been
through two bad seasons,'' said Kjus, who suffered from frequent
colds which kept him off the slopes until a sinus operation last
April alleviated the problem. ``I have to say this win makes me
very happy ... almost relieved.''
	   Kjus wasn't the only one surprised with the day's outcome.
	   Unexpected good weather and variable course conditions wreaked
havoc with the natural order of things.
	   With the course conditions and lighting improving midway through
the race, higher-ranked racers with early start numbers struggled
on a slower surface, while later skiers benefitted from a
significant advantage.
	   Purposely choosing a higher start number, Kjus's gamble paid
off, while Austria's elite were left regretting their choice to run
early.
	   Apart from Kjus and Cattaneo, the rest of top-10 finishers were
mostly unknowns, skiers whose mediocre results left them much
further down the start list.
	   One of the day's most spectacular results was that of American
Chad Fleischer, who started back in 52nd to finish 11th.
	   ``Things like that happen in ski racing,'' said Kjus, who won
the overal World Cup title in 1996. ``Most of the good racers
started very early which is likely the reason they didn't do so
well.
	   ``The course was not fast enough and it was probably impossible
for them to go any faster than they did.''
	   Austrian skiers will have the opportunity to make up for the
slip in Sunday's super-G.

Brenda Blethyn turns brassy in 'Little Voice'

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Brenda Blethyn appears for a tea-time interview at
the Dorchester Hotel wearing what she refers to as ``this old
jacket I've had for three years.''
	   It was only 18 months ago that the English theater and TV
actress wore a Giorgio Armani original to the Academy Awards when
she was up for best actress for her astounding performance in
``Secrets and Lies.''
	   She lost to Frances McDormand (``Fargo''), and although she got
to keep the dress, she hasn't worn it since. ``I do have a peek at
it now and then,'' Blethyn, 52, says almost shyly. ``It seems like
another life.''
	   Not so fast: Blethyn may well find herself on the awards circuit
once again if filmgoers respond to the cheerfully brazen yet
desperate mother she plays in the new film ``Little Voice'' as
rapturously as they did to her tearful Cynthia, the hapless
working-class white Londoner unexpectedly reunited with the black
child she had given up for adoption, in Mike Leigh's 1996 film,
``Secrets and Lies.''
	   Writer-director Mark Herman's ``Little Voice,'' adapted from Jim
Cartwright's 1992 London play ``The Rise and Fall of Little
Voice,'' occupies altogether different terrain.
	   While the economic circumstances remain anything but posh, Mari
Hoff is a feisty Yorkshire widow with a sizable sexual appetite
whose garrulousness makes up for the fact that her withdrawn
daughter _ nicknamed ``Little Voice'' _ barely speaks.
	   Instead, the daughter sings, belting out eerily perfect
impersonations of Shirley Bassey, Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe and
the like. The role is played by Jane Horrocks, who originated it on
stage.
	   When her gift for mimicry comes to the attention of local talent
agent Ray Say (played by a fiercely comic Michael Caine), hopes are
high that a daughter's peculiar skills might be a mother's
salvation.
	   Mari is as impetuous and full of bluster as Cynthia in ``Secrets
and Lies'' was timid and nervous. Still, there's a compassion that
can be seen to fuel both women's fraught lives.
	   ``Cynthia was generous but a pessimist _ just a doormat
really,'' says Blethyn. ``Mari could have gone down the same path,
but she got wise.
	   ``She's an optimist, a survivor. The chutzpah of it all is that
she tells herself _ she convinces herself _ that everything's
great, that it's all right.''
	   The result is a performance of brilliantly sustained raucousness
from an imposingly chesty, brassy Blethyn.
	   When she arrived in the northern English coastal town of
Scarborough for the location filming, Blethyn says, ``I had this
little suit on and said, `Where's wardrobe?' Mark (Herman) must
have thought he'd made a terrible mistake.''
	   Not for long.
	   ``Brenda came out half an hour later as Mari,'' Herman says,
``and there were all the crew whistling at her. It was an amazing
transformation.''
	   ``She's appealingly appalling, appallingly appealing,'' Herman
says of her performance.
	   Blethyn laughs, thinking back on the same moment.
	   ``There was this rumpus and wolf whistles, and Mari exploded
through the door,'' she says. For the role, she recalls, ``I was
only a couple of pounds heavier, though people thought I'd gained
two stone (28 pounds).''
	   Inheriting the stage role for which actress Alison Steadman
(``Life Is Sweet'') won an Olivier Award, London's equivalent of
the Tony, Blethyn refused to sanitize Mari for popular consumption.
	   ``I thought it wasn't honest to do that,'' she says. ``If you
start smoothing it down, making her more palatable, it's dreadfully
patronizing.''
	   Blethyn aimed instead ``just to present Mari as she is and hope
that ultimately people have compassion for her. We all know people
like Mari. We just don't get to see them up close, behind closed
doors.''
	   Blethyn lives in Honor Oak in southeast London with her partner,
Michael Mayhew, who is art director in the print and publications
department of the Royal National Theater.
	   The National has been one of Blethyn's numerous theater haunts,
where she appeared in such plays as George Farquhar's ``The Beaux'
Stratagem'' and a Tom Stoppard caprice called ``Dalliance.''
	   More recently, she played a psychologically arrested woman
reduced to a crawling, mewling child in Alan Ayckbourn's ``Wildest
Dreams.'' And she elicited pathos as well as belly laughs as the
buxom heroine of Alan Bennett's tragicomic, ``Habeas Corpus.''
	   The film renown that accompanied ``Secrets and Lies'' took
Blethyn by surprise, because she had only been in two other movies,
``The Witches'' (1990) and ``A River Runs Through It'' (1992), in
which she played Brad Pitt's mother.
	   ``I was a novice as far as film was concerned. I'd been working
over 20 years at the time, and then all that happened,'' she says
of ``Secrets and Lies,'' which won her a Golden Globe award and the
best actress prize at the Cannes Film Festival.
	   Since then, Blethyn has made six films.
	   She traveled to the ``Little Voice'' location directly from the
Blue Mountains of Australia and the set of an intimate
psychological drama, ``In the Winter Dark.'' After ``Little Voice''
came ``Night Train,'' with John Hurt, and ``Daddy and Them,''
written and directed by and starring Oscar-winner Billy Bob
Thornton (``Sling Blade'').
	   And though there's talk of a movie with Danny DeVito, Blethyn
speaks of returning next year to the theater.
	   ``I'll get withdrawal symptoms if I don't,'' she says. ``Because
film is new to me, I'm happy doing that _ but not forever.''

Stories of kindertransports add new pieces to Holocaust mosaic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHELLE BOORSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It was nasty, cold and muddy in England when
Erika Estis arrived in December 1938, a 16-year-old refugee from
Germany carrying only a small rucksack and the desperate hope that
her parents would soon be free to join her.
	   But time passed, and her parents did not come to the unheated
summer camp where she and other refugee children were staying.
	   Others came, though, to browse for a child they might like to
take home.
	   ``I remember parading around and wanting to be picked,'' Estis
said.
	   And then, one day, she was.
	   ``I wound up with one family after another, none of whom were
particularly thrilled to have me,'' she said. ``It wasn't a good
way for a girl to grow up.''
	   Estis was one of an unusual group of child refugees known as
``kindertransports.'' These were children, mostly Jewish, from
Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Austria who were put alone on
trains on the eve of the Holocaust and sent to Britain, which had
agreed to take 1,000 children, but without their parents.
	   Their lives unfold in a new documentary, ``My Knees Were
Jumping: Remembering the Kindertransports,'' and was the subject of
a 1993 play, ``Kindertransport.'' Reams of memoirs have been
written in the past decade, and another documentary is in the
works.
	   Estis was shuffled from home to home during World War II, all
the while receiving increasingly bleak letters from her parents and
constantly checking lists of Holocaust survivors for their names.
Eventually, she learned they had been killed.
	   ``I didn't care what happened after that,'' she said. ``I didn't
think I should have survived. I wasn't even pleased that I did.''
	   As the war neared, the number of young refugees swelled to
10,000. For most, the last memory they have of their parents is of
them waving goodbye on the platform.
	   And that was that. Overwhelmed by the horror of the stories
coming out of the Nazi death camps, many of the kindertransports
remained silent for years about their experience, feeling their
memories of being orphaned in England and lingering fears of
abandonment were literally not worth mentioning.
	   Friends and family knew only fragments of their past, only that
a father had been ``sent away'' as a child and was still fragile,
or that a mother was afraid of the security guard at the library
because he wore a uniform.
	   Then Bertha Leverton, an English ``kind,'' or child, decided in
1989 to have a reunion of the people she knew who had stayed in
hostels and schools during the war. She expected 100 to 200 people.
More than 1,200 showed up from around the world.
	   After that, the Kindertransport Association was founded in New
York, national reunions were held and people began writing and
talking about their experiences for the first time, relieved that
there were so many others like them.
	   ``My Knees Were Jumping'' offers a new piece of the Holocaust
mosaic, and it is both ugly and beautiful. After all, while the
kindertransports experienced the cruelty of their Nazi neighbors
and then a painful separation from their parents, they also knew
the pleasure of being rescued by strangers _ in many cases,
non-Jews.
	   Filmmaker Melissa Hacker opens all sorts of closed doors in her
documentary. Taped at the first meeting of the KTA in upstate New
York in 1990, the film shows the kaleidoscope of experiences the
children had once they left home.
	   One woman says leaving Nazi Germany, where neighbors turned into
enemies overnight, allowed her ``to be a child again. I was
surrounded by love and affection from total strangers.'' A man says
that while he was kept fed, clothed and ``reasonably warm'' in
England, he didn't have a single hug or kiss from age 8 to 16. ``I
felt I had lost my childhood,'' he said.
	   Other children were physically or sexually abused. Regardless,
many kindertransports see their legacy as one of hope, not of
despair.
	   ``I speak to children's groups and I like to tell them we were
rescued and that rescue is possible,'' said Estis, 76, who now
lives in Hastings-on-the-Hudson, north of New York City. ``If
people get together, you can do some good in this world. There has
to be a lesson in this.''
	   That aside, it is often difficult to watch ``My Knees Are
Jumping.'' It's hard to imagine someone putting a tag with an
anonymous number around the neck of a 4-year-old, and placing the
child on a train while its mother and father were kept behind a
barricade.
	   One woman in the film tells of watching her father at the
platform in Germany. As the train slowly pulled away, she saw him
jump the gate, crying and yelling, ``Don't take my baby!'' That is
the last memory she has of her father.
	   The novelist Lore Segal was on a kindertransport and is in the
film with her mother, Franzi Groszmann. Groszmann's eyes widen as
she tells of going to the Vienna train station around midnight,
which is when most of the transports left.
	   ``At the moment ... I don't think I felt anything. I was alive,
I walked, I did, but I don't think I felt,'' says Groszmann, now a
93-year-old New Yorker with a shock of bright white hair.
	   Not all kindertransports were as fortunate as Segal, now 70, who
was reunited with her mother. Most never again saw their parents.
	   Hacker's film includes a scene from a newly formed support group
for children of kindertransports in which one person after another
describes growing up with a parent who was simultaneously strong
and yet frighteningly fragile.
	   They recount wanting but being unable to run to their parents'
bed after a nightmare for fear of scaring them. One woman recalls
sitting in the car at the age of 6 and bracing for the possibility
of taking over the wheel should her father collapse.
	   Oddly, the kindertransport story begins with smiling, trusting
children boarding trains they were told would take them on an
exciting vacation. They would learn English and have an adventure,
their parents told them, and then the family would be reunited.
	   ``I would go, and my parents would follow,'' said Estis. ``It
was no big deal.''

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Buried deep among the hundreds of old scripts
in RKO Pictures' archives was a 1941 melodramatic gem about an
amnesia-stricken man who wakes up in the middle of a revolution in
Mexico.
	   Never produced, the screenplay for ``The Way to Santiago'' is
credited to Orson Welles. A quick look at the text leaves no doubt
it was the work of the ``Citizen Kane'' filmmaker when he was at
the peak of his arrogant brilliance.
	   The script begins: ``My face fills the frame.''
	   Abandoned by RKO after Welles' epic fall from grace, ``The Way
to Santiago'' has finally gotten the green light nearly six decades
later and is being produced by a rejuvenated RKO.
	   ``This script caught everything about Welles,'' said RKO
Chairman and CEO Ted Hartley, citing the screenplay's action,
suspense and jungle romance. ``It reflected his greatness in
storytelling.''
	   Proving that ideas never die in Hollywood, RKO is mining its
storied past for tomorrow's films.
	   In one week, the RKO-produced ``Mighty Joe Young,'' an updated
version of RKO's 1949 gorilla picture, will be released. The studio
is also working on new takes of its 1943 thriller ``I Walked With a
Zombie'' and the 1948 John Ford Western ``Fort Apache,'' among many
others.
	   It is a delicate time for RKO to be tinkering with Hollywood's
past. Controversy surrounds Universal Studios' scene-by-scene color
remake of the Hitchcock classic ``Psycho.'' Critics called the
project sacrilegious.
	   Hartley insists RKO will pick its projects judiciously. That
means no remakes of ``Citizen Kane'' or ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
But it's open season on other films.
	   ``The kinds of movies that you want to reinvent or adapt are
those where the story and screenplay were sound, but that the movie
either didn't fully realize the script or things have changed so
much that you can take the script and bring it up to date,''
Hartley said.
	   Clearly, the studio is on safer ground reconsidering old scripts
since, in most cases, they have long since been forgotten.
	   And it's hard to go wrong with Welles, an unlikely box office
star 13 years after his death. Universal this year released a
re-edited version of his 1958 film ``Touch of Evil.'' The new
version followed Welles' recently discovered editing notes, written
after he saw the studio's original cut. The restored version played
well on the art house circuit.
	   RKO is going carefully through its 800-script library, dating
back to the silent era, turning up unproduced scripts from such
legendary writers as Ben Hecht and Dalton Trumbo. One script, a
1923 silent called ``Sherlock's Home,'' was penned by a 21-year-old
Darryl Francis Zanuck, who would go on to become one of the most
powerful men in Hollywood.
	   ``It's like finding buried treasure,'' said Julia Halperin, a
top RKO executive who oversees the archives. ``With some of the old
scripts, there is a certain style and sophistication that they
don't have now.''
	   The Welles script was known to film historians for years, but it
wasn't easy to find. When Hartley and his investors took over RKO
in 1990, the company's archives were a mess, with scripts and
correspondence stored in warehouses all over the country and no
cataloging system.
	   Researchers hired by RKO from the University of California, Los
Angeles, took months to make some sense out of the paper, which had
been piling up for decades.
	   RKO, (for Radio-Keith-Orpheum), has existed in one form or
another for nearly as long as moving pictures. It can trace its
roots back to a single nickelodeon that opened in Milwaukee in
1909, and over the decades has undergone many corporate
reconfigurations under countless executives, wreaking havoc on the
bookkeeping.
	   ``When I came to RKO, the company was in the kind of disarray
that any company goes through when it's having hard times,''
Hartley said.
	   It was a shell of its former selves. The theatrical and
television rights to most of its movies had been sold off to Ted
Turner years earlier. All that remained were the RKO name, the
famous radio tower logo, and copyrights on all the material,
produced or not.
	   Like other production houses, the new RKO develops new material
for film and television, but the copyrights entitle it to remake
its movies and shoot its old scripts.
	   The turmoil that Hartley found at RKO was nothing new. As James
Naremore pointed out in the book ``The Magic World of Orson
Welles,'' the company had six different production heads from 1926
to 1933, and by the mid-1940s had gone through six more.
	   Into all this stepped a young Orson Welles, the radio wonderboy
from New York, who was lured to the pictures in 1939 by RKO with a
contract promising great artistic freedom as long as he stayed
within tight budgets.
	   His first movie for RKO was ``Citizen Kane.'' It is now widely
considered the greatest American film of all time. But in early
1941, it was a picture in trouble. RKO was going to release it in
February, but faced immense opposition from powerful publisher
William Randolph Hearst, on whom the film was partly based, and his
allies in Hollywood. ``Kane'' would be released several months
later.

	   Against this backdrop, Welles was trying to get RKO to produce
``The Way to Santiago.''
	   ``Santiago'' tells the story of a man who wakes up in Mexico
with no idea of who he is or how he got there. The twist is that he
has an uncanny resemblance to a notorious figure. The story follows
the man's search for his own identity while evil forces try to kill
him.
	   Welles intended to direct and star in the film, as he had done
in ``Kane,'' so the name of the main character is simply ``Me'' in
the script.
	   In a letter on file in RKO's archives, Welles writes from New
York to studio production head George Schaeffer on Feb. 2, 1941
that he's eager to get started, assuring Schaeffer ``we are going
to successfully avoid a lot of the things that cost us time and
money in the making of 'Kane.'''
	   ``The only way to achieve the results we all urgently want is
for those in responsibility to understand, finally, that even if
they don't like my way of doing things, they must do it my way just
the same ... (and most important) without making an effort to prove
in the process that my way is wrong,'' Welles wrote.
	   The ``Kane'' problems were obviously weighing on Welles.
	   ``I am sorry not to be in Hollywood only because I know that
apologists for our difficulties in 'Kane' will get your ear with a
plausibility they never could manage were I not away,'' he said.
	   The studio appeared very interested in ``The Way to Santiago.''
	   In a 1941 memo, a studio executive described the ``Mexican
Melodrama'' script as ``enormously interesting'' and ``exciting''
with a good start, lots of suspense, though it ``lets down a bit in
the middle portion.''
	   ``With Welles' flair for casting, his fast-moving direction and
his amazing, if recently acquired, knowledge of what can be done
with a camera, I should be tempted to let him work out his own
problems on this one,'' the memo said.
	   The studio did express some concern about relations with the
Mexican government over the subject matter of the film. This was at
a time when RKO was co-owned by Nelson Rockefeller, who had oil
holdings in Latin America.
	   But ``The Way to Santiago'' never got made because of a
corporate shakeup that cost Welles his main supporter, Rockefeller;
problems with Welles' second film, ``The Magnificent Ambersons'';
and Welles' own self-destructive behavior.
	   The script was filed away until the new RKO found it and gave it
a second look. And while Hartley hails the script, he says it isn't
without flaws. The search is on for a script doctor unafraid to
take on a Welles screenplay.
	   ``It needs some work,'' Hartley said. ``Among other things, it
kind of drifted off near the end.''

Egyptian `Sesame Street' to teach girls they're as good as boys

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sometimes she dreams of being an astronaut.
Other times she pretends she's Queen Hatshepsut, who wore a false
beard and ruled Egypt as a king.
	   For now, though, this little Muppet who lives in the shadow of
the pyramids is having fun _ and shattering stereotypes _ just by
climbing trees.
	   She's the star of a new, Egyptian production of ``Sesame
Street,'' which aims to teach girls they're as good as their
brothers.
	   ``Up to now, peasant families in Egypt had lots of kids. And the
girls weren't expected to go to school,'' Egyptian puppet expert
Zeinab Mubarak said during a recent visit to the Children's
Television Workshop, in Manhattan. ``So the girls were left behind
to have kids, cook, sew.''
	   Enter Khokha, the new Muppet. ``She's full of energy, she wants
to know things. And she's not afraid to go out and probe on her own
_ she'll climb up a tree to see the leaves,'' says Ms. Mubarak.
	   ``It's women's liberation through the Muppets,'' jokes executive
producer Amr Koura, who also attended the recent brainstorming
sessions with the Muppets' creators in New York.
	   Viewers of the Egyptian ``Sesame Street'' _ set to debut next
year _ might come from secular urban homes or traditional ones
steeped in Islam.
	   Koura's production team, working just a short drive from the
pyramids in Giza, is developing three Arabic-speaking Muppets to
speak to all of them.
	   The puppets on the weekly, 30-minute show will learn about
pharaohs and mummies. They'll find out the desert can be navigated
using the moon, the stars and the wind, and that the Nile
fertilizes their food. And they'll also get acquainted with
refrigerators and washing machines.
	   Creating Khokha has taken special care. So far, the producers
agree the fuzzy she-monster should appear au naturel, rather than
in girls' clothing. Boys, especially, might accept new ideas
``easier if they come from something that's fuzzy and blue than
from a girl,'' said Ed Christie of the Jim Henson Co., which
designs the Muppets.
	   The ambitious Khokha will cavort in an old-style Egyptian
courtyard with a pair of ``monster'' Muppets, resembling humans or
animals.
	   Cat and dog characters, so beloved in America, might be
off-limits in Egypt. ``The first thing kids would do back home with
cats or dogs is to chase them, or throw pebbles at them,'' said Ms.
Mubarak, who toyed with the idea of a donkey-type Muppet instead.
	   At the recent two-week workshop, Christie hoisted a free-form
Muppet on a rod _ an ``Anything Muppet'' that can be made into
anything. Later, he produced myriad sketches for the three Egyptian
characters and sent them to Giza.
	   Along with Khokha, there is a jolly, trusting young fellow who
loves nature and has a tuft of hair sticking out of his head. Ms.
Mubarak had suggested giving him that kind of ``physical trait that
springs out of his being upset, especially when nature gets
upset.''
	   This sensitive boy ``would be upset that the girl is climbing a
tree and hurting the leaves,'' said studio director Gamal Abdel
Hameed. Producers wanted the show to deal with nature because of
Egypt's growing environmental problems.
	   The third character, Ms. Mubarak said, is ``a know-it-all who
tries to be helpful but is often wrong.'' He might tell kids that
``if you put a seed in the oven, a tree will come out.''
	   ``He lies?'' asked Christie.
	   ``No, he doesn't lie, he has an imagination,'' she said. ``And
he laughs at himself when he makes a mistake.''
	   After more discussion, Christie asked: ``And what are you
learning from him?''
	   ``Social skills more than the alphabet,'' said writer Sherine
Fahmy. Egypt joins 18 other countries that have co-produced
``Sesame Street,'' first seen on U.S. public television 30 years
ago.
	   In China, where a one-child government policy created many
single-child families, the show emphasizes learning to share. In an
Israeli-Palestinian joint venture, peaceful coexistence is key to
``Shara'a Simsim,'' as the show is called in Arabic, or ``Rechov
Sumsum,'' in Hebrew.
	   Christie, the Muppet designer, told the Egyptian producers that
the most important part of the puppet is the puppeteer _ the human
hands and voice that animate the creature can transcend cultural
and language barriers.
	   ``Expression of character comes from the performance, not from
gadgets we can provide,'' said Christie.

Kenny Rogers brings `Christmas From the Heart' to New York
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo NY331 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARY CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Newsfeatures Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ ``Christmas From the Heart'' is Kenny Rogers'
gift to New York for the holidays.
	   No, the show isn't as lavish as Radio City Music Hall's
Christmas show or ``A Christmas Carol'' at Madison Square Garden.
	   ``Christmas From the Heart,'' as the title suggests, is
heartfelt and personal.
	   ``The more personal I can make this, the better,'' Rogers says.
``If you take us for what we are, it's a wonderful story I promise
will touch you.''
	   For 15 years, Rogers toured with a Christmas concert, singing
traditional Christmas songs.
	   Last year, he did something different.
	   Rogers and Kelly Junkermann wrote a 90-minute play about a toy
shop owner who hopes for a miracle to save his store from
foreclosure.
	   Some songs were added by Rogers, and the show was performed
before a group of preschoolers and some senior citizens. The
audience loved it. Hallmark Entertainment agreed to sponsor a
40-day tour to 35 cities last Christmas season, then decided to
bring the show to New York this year.
	   ``Christmas From the Heart'' opened in November and will run
until Jan. 3 at the 2,900-seat Beacon Theatre, located near Lincoln
Center.
	   Rogers plays Hank Longley, the owner of the toy shop. The cast
includes dancers and singers, plus eight children, ages 6 to 11.
	   ``The toys come to life, dance, sing and try to help me save the
store, behind my back,'' he says.
	   The story comes, in part, from Rogers' childhood.
	   He grew up in a housing project in Houston, one of eight
children. His family had little money.
	   On his way to and from school, Rogers and his friends would stop
at Bryant's 5 and 10 Cent Store.
	   ``Mr. Bryant gave us school supplies free and dlrs 1 for every A
and, best of all, sat us down and told us stories,'' Rogers
recalls. ``He was world-traveled and told how great it was to go
around the world. Each story had some moral or social value to
it.''
	   Rogers took this experience as inspiration for his Christmas
show.
	   ``My toy shop story is based loosely on this concept,'' he says.
``If kids have good grades, they get to pick a story they want me
to tell.''
	   When one child asks for a story about the first stuffed dog, it
is Rogers who tells the story. He ends by saying, ``We named the
dog Hero.'' Then he sings a song about how the world needs heroes.
	   ``Each story has a song attached to it,'' he says.
	   Some of the toys in the show are antique or broken. ``That's a
metaphor for disabled people. We never mention that or explain to
the kids why broken toys have value but the parallel is easily
drawn,'' Rogers says.
	   All of the show's songs were written by Rogers, Warren Hartman
and Steve Glassmeyer. A CD was released (Dreamcatcher) to coincide
with the New York engagement.
	   Rogers, whose hair began turning white when he was 30, recently
celebrated his 60th birthday. Although he found marking another
decade more painful than he expected, ``Old is 20 years older than
you are.''
	   Last year, he cut the sides from his beard. Looking at the long,
thick beard on old album covers, he shakes his head and says, ``And
I thought I looked so cute, too.''
	   Rogers began his career performing with the New Christy
Minstrels, a folk group, and The First Edition, a country rock
group.
	   ``Lady'' was Rogers' first pop No. 1 hit. His other hits include
``Islands in the Stream,'' a duet with Dolly Parton and written by
Barry Gibb; ``Sweet Music Man,'' a country hit that Rogers wrote;
and ``Lucille,'' written by Roger Bowling.
	   Bowling brought ``Lucille'' to Rogers after a first recording
didn't sell.
	   ``It's a great bar song,'' Rogers says. ``Any time you can
become part of pop culture, those songs have lives that go on
beyond the artists themselves.''
	   Rogers expected ``The Gambler'' _ the title song from his TV
movies _ to be a hit on the country charts. But he never dreamed it
would become popular worldwide.
	   Another of his songs, ``Through the Years,'' is popular for
weddings and anniversaries.
	   He has sold more than 80 million albums worldwide, not including
single record and extended play sales. He has won three Grammy
Awards, including Best Country Vocal Performance Duet with Ronnie
Milsap for ``Make No Mistake'' in 1987.
	   Rogers has residences in Atlanta and Athens, Georgia. When he
isn't busy with his Christmas show, he tours on weekends.
	   Besides music and films, Rogers is a published photographer. His
first two books were on celebrities and American landscapes. His
third book will feature country performers.
	   Earlier this year, Rogers was presented with the Country Radio
Broadcaster's Humanitarian Award, presented at the 29th Annual
Country Radio Seminar in Nashville, Tennessee.
	   His philanthropic interests include a cerebral palsy center in
Sikeston, Missouri, and a homeless shelter in Athens.
	   ``I do a lot more local than national,'' he says. ``I want to
know where every dollar goes.''

	   In the spotlight: Katie Holmes _ from the Midwest to Dawson's
Creek
	    &UR; Image: Katie Holmes is the raven-haired It Girl who plays a
tomboy on the WB television series, ``Dawson's Creek.'' She is
envied by thousands of her peers for getting a chance to kiss her
handsome co-star, James Van Der Beek.
	    &UR; Personal Stats: Holmes was born Dec. 18, 1978, and grew up with
four siblings in her hometown of Toledo, Ohio. She graduated from
Notre Dame Academy, a Catholic school in her hometown, and was
accepted at Columbia University. (However, she has decided to delay
starting college.)
	    &UR; Breakthrough: Holmes was a junior in high school when she read
for director Ang Lee's ``The Ice Storm.'' She was hired on the
spot.
	   Growing up in the Midwest and attending parochial school helped
her cope with the sudden change from student to actress.
	   ``I know I grew up very naive and sheltered, but I like that,''
Holmes says. ``I feel sad when I see kids who have experienced too
much too young. I'm glad I could wait this long before I had to
deal with reality.''
	   Holmes' homespun values even shocked ``Dawson's Creek''
producers. She told them she couldn't fly to Hollywood for an
audition because of a high school play. When the shock wore off,
the audition was rescheduled. She got the role of Joey Potter.
	   Holmes says she's pleased that last season ended with a kiss.
	   ``Selfishly, I'm really happy,'' she says. ``I'm really sick of
playing the depressed 'Poor me, I want him' role. I think we have
to give the audience what it wants.'' But, she adds, ``I doubt it
will work out.''
	   Although she is sifting through film offers, Holmes still dreams
of college. ``In five years, I would like to be done with college
or at least in the process of achieving my degree. Success is about
getting an education.''
	    &UR; Quote ``I'm a private person. I'm not a big socializer. I'm a
little shy, but I'm also friendly. Those are the same qualities I
look for in a guy.''
	    &UR; Next up: She has appeared in ``Disturbing Behavior,'' which
didn't hit it big at the box office, but has two more films
scheduled for release next year: ``Killing Mrs. Tingle,'' a
thriller directed by ``Dawson'' creator Kevin Williamson, and
``Go,'' a dark comedy from Doug Liman, the man behind ``Swingers.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When Alfred Hitchcock released ``Psycho'' in
1960, audiences gripped their armrests as they watched the slashing
thrust of a kitchen knife and Marion Crane's blood slip down a
bathtub drain.
	   Her shock, her agony, her death were captured in basic black and
white, as was her blood (Hitchcock used chocolate syrup). The
``Shower Scene,'' as it has become known, is one of the most
terrifying in contemporary horror movies. It also is one of the
most influential, as is ``Psycho'' itself, which laid the
groundwork for every psychological thriller released since then.
Hitchcock made us afraid, very afraid. He also made us think.
	   Gus Van Sant has lovingly re-created Hitchcock's film _ in
brilliant color.
	   Are we still afraid? No.
	   Are there any surprises? No.
	   Is the movie fun? Every now and then.
	   Is a boy's best friend still his mother? Yes.
	   Van Sant and Universal Pictures claim the 1998 ``Psycho''
reinterprets the original frame by frame. It even retains most of
the dialogue. And, like the original, the performances are all
strong and the cinematography is excellent.
	   But something is missing. There's a flatness and an easiness
where there should be an evil vibrancy. It's almost as though the
cheerfulness of color dilutes the edginess of terror. And while
Hitchcock walked in the shadow of horror with a sly wink, Van
Sant's effort is too self-conscious and too studied.
	   Van Sant has not tried to put his own spin on the story; there
are no new insights into the mother-fixated Norman (Vince Vaughn),
nor does the director attempt to add more dimension to Marion (Anne
Heche), the embezzler who's having an affair with a married man.
There are no new subplots or any attempt to drag the swamp looking
for more bodies besides Marion's and that of Milton Arbogast
(William H. Macy), the private detective sent to find her after she
disappears with dlrs 400,000 she has stolen from her boss.
	   Where Van Sant does try to veer from the original largely has to
do with sexuality. Marion's lover, Sam (Viggo Mortensen), flashes a
naked derriere in opening scenes, and Marion is, of course, naked
in the ``Shower Scene'' and wears sexy little bikini briefs. It's
all a far cry from Janet Leigh in the Hitchcock original, who
showed off her body in lingerie that best resembled body armor.
	   And the most revealing of all: Norman's voyeurism now involves
masturbation, something Hitchcock only hinted at in his original
film.
	   To his credit, Vaughn does not try to imitate Anthony Perkins'
Norman Bates, and gives a fresh but different portrayal. Where the
frenzied jerks of Perkins angular body collided with those
delicious facial tics to make Norman as sanely insane as possible,
Vaughn is more subdued, given to little boyish giggles.
	   And there are updates. Marion now steals dlrs 400,000 instead of
dlrs 40,000. And her sister, Lila (Julianne Moore), is not the
straight-laced, glove-wearing woman Vera Miles portrayed in the
original, but a hip and saucy woman who's not afraid of anything.
One unnecessary moment: As Sam and Lila leave Sam's hardware store
to report Arbogast's disappearance to the deputy sheriff, Lila
stops dead in her tracks and says, ``Let me get my Walkman.'' If
the scene is meant to be funny or ironic, it isn't. It serves only
to make Lila seem stupid.
	   But Van Sant can be forgiven. After all, he's aiming for the
same youthful audience that made hits out of ``Scream,'' ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer'' and all the other slasher flicks.
	   Danny Elfman has adapted Bernard Herrmann's original, haunting
music, so that familiar screeching to announce another killing is
still with us.
	   The Universal release was produced by Van Sant and Brian Grazer.
The film is dedicated to the memory of Alfred Hitchcock, who may or
may not be turning in his grave.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ ``Star Trek'' at its best offers a balanced
version of the classic sci-fi vision: a futuristic, computerized
universe leavened by resonant, believable characters and relevant
human themes. That's the reason it has lasted through three
decades, four TV series and nine movies.
	   But the keepers of Gene Roddenberry's flame, while always
good-intentioned, sometimes try too hard. Some ``Trek'' films have
drifted too far into comedy, too far into darkness, even too far
into just plain silliness.
	   Not so the latest installment. ``Star Trek: Insurrection''
strikes the difficult balance between action and humanity _ the
best ``Trek'' movie since 1982's ``Star Trek II: The Wrath of
Khan.''
	   The quality _ and the subtlety _ is clear from the beginning.
``Insurrection'' begins not in space but on land, in the middle of
an idyllic country scene outside a village. This is a planet at
peace _ but a planet being watched surreptitiously by Starfleet,
the military/exploration arm of the United Federation of Planets.
	   In short order, the scene turns chaotic. The android Data (Brent
Spiner, a favorite member of the USS Enterprise crew from the
series ``Star Trek: The Next Generation''), on assignment with the
Starfleet surveillance team, has apparently gone berserk and
revealed the observation station to the locals, who call themselves
the Ba'ku.
	   The Enterprise, led by Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart),
is dispatched to stop Data. Picard finds that Data's actions have a
purpose: There is a plot afoot, an agreement between Starfleet and
another race, the Son'a, to relocate the Ba'ku to another world so
their planet can be exploited for its very rare _ and valuable _
natural resource: energy that restores youth and vitality.
	   Picard, appalled by the actions of his Starfleet and enchanted
by Anij (Donna Murphy), a Ba'ku woman, decides he must disobey
Admiral Dougherty (Anthony Zerbe) and prevent the relocation. His
main opponent is a desperate man: the aging, decaying Ru'afo (F.
Murray Abraham), desperate to reclaim his vitality.
	   Picard is joined, in true ``Trek'' fashion, by his command team
from the TV series _ First Officer Will Riker (Jonathan Frakes),
Klingon Lt. Cmdr. Worf (Michael Dorn), Engineer Geordi LaForge
(LeVar Burton), Ship's Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and
Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden). Unlike the past two films
with the ``Next Generation'' cast, each crew member matters to the
plot and has at least one really good scene.
	   Stewart, always good at breathing life into Picard, does so
especially well this time. While in ``First Contact'' he played an
Ahab, obsessed with revenge, in ``Insurrection'' he is more of a
Solomon, a balancing influence and moral compass. He is both gentle
and strong, and his is a sad lament in a time of unrest: ``Can
anyone remember when we used to be explorers?''
	   The true test of a ``Star Trek'' movie is whether non-fans can
make any sense of it. ``Insurrection'' succeeds mightily. The story
is intricate but accessible, and inside ``Trek'' jokes are framed
in a way that viewers who don't catch them lose little.
	   Production design just keeps getting better; the latest
``Enterprise'' is a beautiful ship, and the Ba'ku planet is a
carefully constructed world of breathtaking natural resources and
subtle, Asian-influenced agrarian architecture. The greatest
strength of ``Star Trek'' has always been to create and maintain a
believable, cohesive fantasy universe, and ``Insurrection''
bolsters this tradition.
	   The guest stars also shine. Abraham is a fun ``Trek'' villain;
though not as full of Shakespearean bluster as Ricardo Montalban's
Khan Noonian Singh or Christopher Plummer's General Chang, he is an
engaging adversary who sees himself wasting away and will do
anything to stop it. As Dougherty, the always entertaining Zerbe
personifies the split between Federation's noninterference ``Prime
Directive'' and political expediency. And Murphy glows as a woman
wise beyond her years _ however many years that may be.
	   In the end, the question is this: Do the needs of the few
outweigh the needs of the many? With action and muted moments,
``Star Trek: Insurrection'' attempts to answer that, and Frakes,
who also directed, does a fine job assembling the vision.
	   In the late 20th century, when idealism is often scorned and
storytelling is reduced to the lowest common denominator of action,
``Star Trek: Insurrection'' is science fiction at its most
superior: a humanistic drama that's full of action and excitement
and still not afraid to feel.
	   The film is produced by ``Trek'' guru Rick Berman from a Michael
Piller script.

At the Movies: 'Shakespeare in Love''

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Imagine you knew these things about William
Shakespeare:
	   That he had a flaming, adulterous affair during his early London
years.
	   That he suffered from writer's block and sought a cure on a
consultant's couch.
	   That his play about the star-crossed lovers was first titled
``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.''
	   It would all be fantasy, of course, because the Bard of Avon's
personal life is largely a blank to history. But that didn't stop
the makers of ``Shakespeare in Love'' from concocting a glorious
romp through the life and raucous times of the Elizabethan theater.
	   The setting is 1593. Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes), has left
his wife in Stratford-on-Avon and has created a stir in the London
theater with his chronicles and comedies such as ``The Comedy of
Errors'' and ``The Taming of the Shrew.''
	   Almost 30, he is sexually restless and uncertain of his destiny
in the theater.
	   Along comes Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), a rebellious beauty
and headstrong woman bound by the restraints of a male-dominated
society. She disguises herself as a man to qualify for the
playwright's new play and wins the role of Romeo (males played
female characters since women were forbidden on the Elizabethan
stage). Will uncovers her ruse, and his passion rises.
	   But Will's romance with Viola, like the romance in the play he
now feverishly writes, is doomed. She is destined to marry nasty
Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), who needs her dowry to settle his debts
and finance his property in Virginia. What follows is the stuff
that Shakespeare's comedies are made of: mistaken identities,
switched sexes, undelivered messages.
	   It all ends with the lovers onstage, Viola playing Juliet
(despite the edict against actresses) and Will as Romeo. Their
parting is as tragic as the play, but the experience prompts
Shakespeare to shrug off his hangups and move on to create his
greatest works.
	   Marc Norman wrote the screenplay of ``Shakespeare in Love,''
with Tom Stoppard adding his own bright ironies. They provide
anachronisms that turn out to be more amusing than disconcerting:
Will tells an actor ``break a leg'' before a performance; an actor
complains, ``I never played the Palace.'' Inside joke: a lampoon of
today's film credits.
	   Director John Madden invests the film with all the lusty verve
of Tony Richardson's ``Tom Jones.'' He makes splendid use of the
large, stellar cast, which includes Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck, Tom
Wilkinson and Simon Callow. It is the great Dame Judi Dench who
electrifies her every scene, playing Queen Elizabeth with the same
brilliance she applied to Victoria in ``Mrs. Brown.''
	   The two lovers are perfectly cast. Miss Paltrow brings beauty
and intelligence to the spirited Viola. Fiennes' Shakespeare is
what one would like to imagine the great man had been: dashing,
fearless, besotted with love, conscious of his immense gift but not
overwhelmed by it. Fiennes' own destiny appears certain to be
stardom equal to his brother Ralph's.
	   The Miramax and Universal release was produced by David Parfitt,
Donna Gigliotti, Harvey Weinstein, Edward Zwick and Marc Norman.

	   ``The Words That Remain'' (Shanachie) _ Solas
	   The rip-snorting version of Woody Guthrie's ``Pastures of
Plenty'' that opens Solas' new album serves notice that this is one
Celtic disc that stands out from the pack. Propelled by rhythmic
acoustic guitar, percussion and a driving fiddle, the song is a
sparkler, one of many on this excellent album. Solas is never
afraid on ``The Words That Remain'' to venture away from tradition,
though the band shows that it's quite handy with jigs and reels,
too.
	   Despite its impressive instrumental power, though, perhaps the
best thing about Solas is the lovely, graceful singing of Karan
Casey. Her gorgeous voice helps make ``The Words That Remain'' a
gem of an album, one that should appeal to Celtic music lovers and
those who wouldn't know Mary Black from Frank Black.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Easy to Love'' (Southport) _ April Aloisio
	   ``Easy to Love,'' April Aloisio's third _ and finest _ album for
Chicago's Southport jazz label, is a lovely, softly swinging
affair. Her voice glides over the melodies, which often are
strummed by ace guitarists Dave Onderdonk and Fareed Haque, like a
sea bird skimming above a wave. Never is this more apparent than on
her version of Stevie Wonder's love song, ``Another Star.'' But
whether backed by gentle guitarists or swinging with saxman Von
Freeman, Aloisio is never short of excellent here.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Wide Swing Tremolo'' (Warner Bros.) _ Son Volt
	   ``Wide Swing Tremolo'' gets off to a bad start with the odd
``Straightface,'' a kind of straight-ahead, churning guitar,
distorted vocals, post-grunge rock song that could have been done
by 1,000 other bands. But ``Straightface'' gives way to ``Driving
the View,'' and suddenly we remember why we're here. Then, after a
brief, odd harmonica interlude (``Jodel'') it's on to ``Medicine
Hat,'' and you just couldn't ask for a sweeter one-two punch. At
its best, and that includes much of ``Tremolo,'' Son Volt is head
and shoulders above the alt-country pack.
	   Son Volt combines yearning vocals and hard-to-decipher lyrics
with twangy, dusty rock into powerful and moving songs. There's
still some of the ``sturm und twang'' that marked Farrar's old
band, Uncle Tupelo, but Farrar sounds most at home delivering
gently rocking, midtempo numbers that conjure visions of open roads
and big skies.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Season of Rain'' (Q Division) _ Merrie Amsterburg
	   If Aimee Mann and ``Hejira''-era Joni Mitchell were two corners
of a triangle, ``Season of Rain'' might be the third. While that
gives some idea of the territory Merrie Amsterburg stakes out on
this sadly beautiful album, ``Season of Rain'' can stand nicely on
its own. Amsterburg gives texture to her nicely melodic songs with
bouzouki and other slightly off-the-mainstream instruments, and
while the songs mostly concern loss, the album is not as depressing
as its title might imply. ``Season of Rain'' works mostly at the
place where folk and pop meet, and it works well. Amsterburg is
worth watching, if this is a good indication of her talent, because
this one shines.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``After Yesterday'' (Red House) _ John Gorka
	   John Gorka's warm, rich voice has never sounded better than on
``After Yesterday.'' Gorka, long one of the more interesting
contemporary singer-songwriters, sounds less lugubrious here than
he has in the past, a state perhaps achieved through marriage and
the birth of a child. Still, I have to say my favorite on the album
is ``Thorny Patch,'' a sad song made all the more haunting by Lucy
Kaplansky's luminous harmony singing.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Bed'' (Zoe) _ Juliana Hatfield
	   ``Bed'' rocks with a raw urgency that was missing from much of
Juliana Hatfield's previous solo work. It sounds like an album that
was recorded over just a few days, which it was, and that's a good
thing. Hatfield's voice sounds a little ragged, the music is
churning and jagged and the end result is rock 'n' roll like it
ought to be.

Ricky Williams wins Heisman Trophy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD ROSENBLATT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Ricky Williams ran away with it all _ the
rushing records, the recognition and finally, overwhelmingly, the
Heisman Trophy on Saturday night.
	   Williams, who broke Tony Dorsett's career rushing record in
grand style and set dozens more records along the way, was a
landslide winner over Kansas State quarterback Michael Bishop,
winning by a 1,563 points _ the fourth-largest margin in Heisman
history.
	   The 6-foot, (1.83-meter) 225-pound (102-kilo) San Diegan with
dreadlocks, pierced tongue and Mickey Mouse tattoo, ran for 2,124
yards and 27 touchdowns in one of the most sensational seasons in
college football history.
	   ``I want to thank my beautiful mother, she raised three kids
alone,'' Williams said seconds after becoming the first Heisman
winner with dreadlocks, bleached, no less. ``It's a pleasure to be
with so many great players present and past.
	   ``On Thanksgiving, I woke up and gave thanks, just sat there for
about an hour. I have a lot to be thankful for.''
	   Not only did Williams win nearly every other individual award _
the AP College Player of the Year and Walter Camp, Maxwell and Doak
Walker awards _ he also carried the Longhorns to an 8-3 record and
a berth in the Cotton Bowl.
	   Williams set or tied 16 NCAA and 44 schools records, including
career marks for yards (6,279), scoring (452 points), touchdowns
(75) and all-purpose yards (7,206).
	   Williams collected 714 first-place votes and 2,355 points from
the 920 Heisman voters in winning college football's most precious
prize. Bishop had 41 first-place votes and 792 points.
	   UCLA quarterback Cade McNown was third with 696 points,
Kentucky's Tim Couch was fourth with 527 points and Syracuse
quarterback Donovan McNabb fifth with 232 points.
	   The largest margin of victory in the Heisman was in 1968, when
Southern California's O.J. Simpson beat Purdue's Leroy Keyes by
1,750 points. In 1993, Florida State's Charlie Ward won the Heisman
by 1,622 points over Tennessee's Heath Shuler; and in 1991,
Michigan's Desmond Howard won by 1,574 points over Florida State's
Casey Weldon.
	   The closest vote was in 1985, when Auburn's Bo Jackson edged
Iowa's Chuck Long by 45 points.
	   Central Florida quarterback Daunte Culpepper was sixth, followed
by Georgia's all-purpose star, Champ Bailey, North Carolina State
wide receiver Torry Holt, Ohio State quarterback Joe Germaine and
Tulane quarterback Shaun King.
	   In receiving the highest percentage of first-place ballots in
Heisman history, Williams easily won all six voting regions. Three
points were awarded for a first-place vote, two for second and one
for third.
	   Williams also received the third most first place votes, behind
Simpson's 855 in '68 and Ward's 740 in '93, and the third most
points, behind Simpson's 2,853 and Dorsett's 2,357 in 1976.
	   Williams' Heisman-defining moment occurred against Texas'
biggest rival _ Texas A-and-M _ in the final regular-season game.
Needing 11 yards to top Dorsett's record late in the first quarter,
Williams was looking to break a big one.
	   He left a tackler at the line of scrimmage, shed another a few
yards later and raced down the left sideline as 84,000 hometown
fans stood and screamed in delight. Near the goal line, cornerback
Jason Webster caught him, but Williams dragged him the final yards
to complete a record-smashing 60-yard touchdown run.
	   On the sidelines, Dorsett, Earl Campbell and even A-and-M's own
John David Crow _ Heisman winners all _ cheered along with everyone
else. They knew the run would be worth a lifetime of reruns.
	   ``I was exhausted,'' said Williams, who ended up with 259 yards
in the 26-24 upset of the Aggies. ``I came to the sideline and I
was mobbed by the whole team. I couldn't breathe and I was trying
to say help, but I couldn't get anything out.''
	   Williams, fifth in last year's balloting but upset he wasn't
even invited to the ceremony, nearly passed on returning to Austin.
Just when it looked like he would leave for the riches of the NFL,
though, he changed his mind, saying he was coming back to win
games, have fun and break some records.
	   ``My teammates made it for me, '' Williams said. ``The Heisman
Trophy is supposed to be an individual award. But in this case, it
was a team award. My teammates played hard for me.''
	   Did they ever.
	   Williams, who has a twin sister, Nisey, and another sister,
Cassie, _ both students at Texas _ entered the season needing 1,928
yards to break Dorsett's 22-year-old record.
	   His quest seemed impossible. The Longhorns, with a new coach in
Mack Brown, had one of the nation's worst defenses in going 4-7
last season and had only inexperience at quarterback.
	   ``Every coordinator in the country had circled Ricky's name and
there's absolutely no way a guy can get 1,800 or so yards,'' Brown
said. ``We had 23 1,000-yard rushers at North Carolina. I never
thought of a guy getting 2,000.''
	   But Williams isn't just any guy. As a freshman, he joked about
how he'd win a Heisman and put his trophy alongside Campbell's in a
glass case at Texas' T lounge. He gave himself an e-mail address
with the word Heisman in it.
	   He plays video games, He visits kids in school and in the

Serbs sentence Muslims found guilty of murder

<TEXT>
	   BIJELJINA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In a retrial demanded by
international mediators, a Bosnian Serb court Saturday sentenced
three Muslims to a total of 51 years in prison for murder.
	   Two of the men were found guilty of three counts of murder and
sentenced to 20 years in prison each, the third was given an
11-year sentence for one count of murder.
	   The verdict differed only slightly from the initial trial last
year, when all three men were given 20-year prison terms.
International officials, however, called the 1997 trial a sham and
insisted the three Muslims be tried again.
	   International officials who monitored Saturday's trial made no
immediate comment.
	   The three men were part of a group of seven, who claimed to have
escaped from a massacre of thousands of Muslim men when Bosnian
Serbs captured the town of Srebrenica, south of Zvornik, in July
1995.
	   They said they survived months in the wild and surrendered when
they spotted U.S. soldiers patrolling the former front-line in May
1996.
	   The U.S. troops noted some of the men were wearing military
uniforms, carrying weapons and had recent haircuts, and handed them
over to Bosnian Serb police. They were held for a year before the
first trial opened.
	   Saturday's ruling stunned the defense lawyers, who plan to
appeal the ruling to a Bosnian Serb supreme court.
	   ``This is a catastrophe. There is no evidence of a murder,''
said Bakir Pasic, a defense lawyer. ``There are no bodies of those
murdered.''
	   According to Pasic, the court based its ruling on a report that
four Serbs from the Zvornik area went missing and were never found,
without any substantial evidence linking their disappearance to the
Muslims.
	   Some remains found in the woods were used as evidence, but the
court refused a doctor's request that forensics be used to identify
them.
	   The three men convicted _ Nedzad Hasic, Ahmo Harbas and Behudin
Husic _ announced they were staging a hunger strike in protest of
the court's decision.

U.S. officials working with Russia on Y2K problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ United States military officials are working with
their Russian counterparts on an agreement to station people in
each other's nuclear command centers as a precaution against a
possible missle strike caused by computer problems stemming from
the Year 2000 programming glitch, The Boston Globe reported
Saturday.
	   The Globe reported that the Clinton administration is trying to
calm Russian concerns that the so-called Y2K problem would cause
that nation's radar screens to go blank, an event that could be
interpreted as an attack on Moscow. Such a development might spur
Russia to launch its own missiles.
	   ``We need to make sure there is no chance someone will be
blindsided if the radar screens of any country using nuclear
weapons go blank,'' said William Curtis, director of the Pentagon's
year 2000 compliance office.
	   He said that there is no chance of Y2K resulting in an
unintended U.S. nuclear launch.
	   The United States could have its experts in Moscow by the middle
of next year, Curtis said, adding that the administration is also
negotiating with China over the Y2K issue.
	   Computer programmers around the world are working to solve their
own little pieces of the Year 2000 computer flaw, commonly known as
Y2K. Left uncorrected, it could threaten the world's electrical
grids, financial markets, the water supplies and air-traffic
control systems.
	   The problem dates back decades, to a time when computer
programmers _ to save electronic storage space _ represented years
like 1998 with only their last two digits: 98. The practice leads
to trouble when computers try to add or subtract dates using that
two-digit format and the world approaches the Year 2000, or 00.
	   Militarily, Curtis said the United States government is walking
a fine line between provoking nuclear panic over the issue and
``keeping people from going to sleep at the wheel.''

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Spacewalking astronauts completed
their construction work on the international space station
Saturday, lashing a toolbox to the outside and fixing a jammed
antenna.
	   It was the third and final excursion out into Endeavour's open
cargo bay for Jerry Ross and James Newman.
	   All that remained following the spacewalk was Sunday afternoon's
release of the seven-story, 35-ton complex, freshly wired and
outfitted by the visiting shuttle crew.
	   ``We've come a long way,'' commander Robert Cabana observed.
	   Working nearly 250 miles above Earth, Ross and Newman lugged out
a 2 foot-by-2-foot bundle containing 50 wrenches, ratchets, clamps,
bars, foot loops, tethers and other tools. They attached the
package to the top of Unity, the American-made side of the station.
	   The toolbox looked like a picnic cooler.
	   ``I'm hungry, what's in the refrigerator?'' joked Newman.
	   ``Nothing edible,'' Ross replied.
	   The tools will be used by future spacewalkers. The next
construction team goes up in May.
	   Ross turned his attention to the stuck Russian antenna after
completing a check of the cables he and Newman installed earlier in
the week and disconnecting other cables no longer needed.
	   Armed with a 10-foot pole, Ross was hoisted on the end of the
shuttle robot arm up to Zarya, the Russian-built control module
stacked atop Unity. He kept his distance as he poked the antenna,
the same method that Newman used to fix another jammed antenna
during spacewalk No. 2 on Wednesday.
	   Ross tapped the stuck antenna, then jiggled it, then tapped it
again and again. After several minutes and dozens of pokes, the
antenna finally shot out to its full 4 feet.
	   ``There it goes! You can see it in the sun,'' Newman called out.
	   ``All right!'' shouted Ross.
	   The two roll-out antennas failed to open properly following last
month's launch of Zarya.
	   Once that was done, the spacewalkers shimmied to the tiptop of
Zarya and did the Russians another favor by securing a loose
experiment tray.
	   The remainder of the spacewalk was dedicated to non-construction
work: a photo survey of the space station and a test of the
astronauts' mini jetpacks. They remained tethered to the shuttle
for added safety.
	   Ross was extra careful this time not to lose anything. Two tools
got away from him during Monday's spacewalk, and a thermal cover
floated away during Wednesday's outing.
	   ``I don't have the slightest idea what happened,'' Ross told a
TV interviewer late Friday. ``I did four previous spacewalks, never
lost an item. ... I have absolutely no explanation for why things
came loose.''
	   Saturday's spacewalk was the seventh of Ross' career _ a U.S.
record _ and the fourth for Newman.
	   NASA estimates 159 more spacewalks will be needed over the next
five years to build and maintain the international space station,
which eventually will stretch as long as a football field. Most of
the spacewalks will be conducted by Americans.

Cambodian prime minister heads to Hanoi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ With hopes Cambodia would become
ASEAN's newest member this week effectively dashed, Prime Minister
Hun Sen quietly left for Vietnam Sunday on a two-day state visit.
	   Denied entry last year, Cambodia has pushed hard for admission
into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations during a Dec. 15-16
summit in the Vietnamese capital.
	   Early optimism that its application might win approval all but
vanished on Friday, however, when foreign ministers of the nine
current member states failed to reach a consensus on the issue.
	   Hun Sen, who wants to attend the ASEAN summit after his state
visit, did not speak to reporters at Phnom Penh's airport before
boarding a plane to Hanoi.
	   But Cambodian Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Ouch Kim An
said it would be disheartening and potentially damaging for
Cambodia to have its membership application put on hold for the
second time in as many years.
	   ``We will be disappointed if we will not be admitted because we
have been prepared for more than a year to enter ASEAN,'' he said.
``It is economically important for us to be a part of ASEAN. We
cannot be isolated.''
	   Cambodia was originally scheduled to join the grouping in July
1997 along with Laos and Myanmar, but its admission was delayed
after Hun Sen ousted his co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh
in a violent coup.
	   Following a close election this July, Hun Sen and Ranariddh
settled their differences last month and formed a coalition
government. Hun Sen was made sole prime minister in the deal and
the prince was named president of the National Assembly.
	   Host nation Vietnam had spearheaded the effort to get its
neighbor accepted this time around, reportedly even putting
together a schedule for an admission ceremony at the summit.
	   However, several foreign ministers apparently stuck to their
views that Hun Sen's coalition with his former enemy must prove
stable before the country joins ASEAN.
	   Some have stated their reluctance stems from the fact that loose
ends still remain from last month's coalition deal, including a
controversial plan to form an upper house of Parliament in
Cambodia.
	   Ouch Kim An called the creation of a senate an internal affair
of Cambodia that should not hold up its entry into ASEAN. Still, he
said his nation would remain patient if it is not accepted.
	   ``If they won't admit us at this time, it is up to them. We will
wait,'' he said.
	   Despite the lack of consensus among foreign ministers, there is
still a chance that Southeast Asian leaders could admit Cambodia
during the summit, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said
Friday in Hanoi.

China's People's Liberation Army expanding overseas ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's People's Liberation Army, the world's
largest military force, has sent more than 20,000 of its members
abroad to study since 1990 to improve professionalism and upgrade
weapons technology, an official report said Sunday.
	   The PLA also has invited foreign specialists to provide
military-related training in China, including 1,000 people in 1996
alone, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The exchanges have helped modernize the PLA and strengthen
relations with military forces in Western countries, the report
said.
	   China's military also has taken a more active role in
international peacekeeping in recent years. Since 1989, it has sent
more than 1,200 military personnel to take part in six United
Nations peacekeeping actions.
	   The report quoted an unidentified official of the National
Defense Ministry as saying that military diplomacy will continue to
expand.
	   The PLA has 99 attache offices abroad, more than double the
number in 1978, the report said.
	   The 2.9-million-member People's Liberation Army is in the midst
of a sweeping effort to reduce its ranks by 500,000 over the next
three years and upgrade its military technology.
	   It also faces economic changes. The ruling Communist Party has
set a mid-December deadline for the PLA and the People's Armed
Police to transfer their vast business holdings to civilian
control.
	   The order is aimed at combating corruption and forcing the
military to focus on defense instead of business operations.

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ A middle order collapse sank England
to 227 all out in the third Ashes cricket test against Australia at
the Adelaide Oval on Sunday.
	   Resuming the day on 160 for three, England lost seven wickets
for just 40 runs to be all out at lunch, leaving Australia with a
164-run lead.
	   Australia scored 391 in its first innings.
	   No.3 Nasser Hussain anchored England's batting for more than
four hours, and remained unbeaten on 89.
	   Legspinner Stuart MacGill claimed three wickets and pacemen
Glenn McGrath and Damien Fleming each took two in the morning
session.
	   England collapsed either side of a 103-run fourth wicket stand
between Hussain and Mark Ramprakash, who contributed 61.
	   England made 187 for three before the introduction of McGrath.
	   McGrath had Ramprakash caught at second slip by Mark Waugh, and
two overs later bowled John Crawley off stump.
	   MacGill snared the wickets of Graeme Hick and Dean Headley with
successive balls. He was denied a hat-trike by Darren Gough.
	   Fleming wrapped up the innings with two wickets in as many
balls, bowling Alan Mullally for a duck and trapping Peter Such leg
before wicket first ball, leaving him on a hat-trick when England
bat again.
	   MacGill took 4-53 including 3-8 in eight balls while McGrath,
Fleming and Colin Miller took two wickets apiece.

Australian coal miners plan 48-hour nationwide strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Up to 20,000 coal miners across
Australia plan to go on strike for 48 hours from midnight Monday to
protest a cut in the price of coking coal, union officials said
Sunday.
	   Construction, Mining, Forestry, and Energy Union national
president Tony Maher said the strike was triggered by an agreement
by the country's three leading coal exporters to a U.S. dlrs 9 per
metric ton price, an 18 percent reduction.
	   Maher said the new coking coal price agreement by North
Goonyella Mine, Mount Isa Mines (MIM) and Shell was made in Britain
to ``avoid scrutiny'' back in Australia.
	   He said the price cut would mean further job losses in an
industry already reeling from the loss of 4,000 jobs in the past 12
months.
	   ``For every mine worker lost, another three jobs are lost from
the flow on effect -- that means 16,000 jobs lost,'' he said.
	   ``Now there'll be many more on the scrapheap.''
	   Maher attributed the problems facing the coal industry to
oversupply.
	   ``There's 20 million ton excess capacity coming out of
Australia,'' he said.
	   ``We're allowing too many new mines to come on stream and the
government just sits back and lets them open up new mines.''

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Lawmakers approved a dlrs 60 billion bank
bailout proposal Saturday night after five hours of contentious
debate and a tomato-throwing demonstration by members of a debtors'
movement.
	   Lawmakers voted 325-159 with one abstention on measures
President Ernesto Zedillo's governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party has said are needed to prevent a collapse of the financial
system and a wider economic crisis.
	   Catcalls and shouting accompanied debate on the plan to
establish a new government institution to weed out illegal loans
and ensure banks try to collect on credit extended.
	   ``The new institute is a forceful break with the past,'' said
Santiago Creel, a congressman of the conservative National Action
Party, which had reached a compromise with the ruling party on the
bailout late Friday. He was jeered by legislators who opposed the
plan.
	   Before the bank bailout debate began, about 50 members of the
debtors' group El Barzon forced an hourlong adjournment when they
stormed the floor, throwing tomatoes and dumping flour on some
lawmakers. Many lawmakers had not yet arrived when protesters
forced their way in.
	   El Barzon is made up of middle-class Mexicans who were driven to
bankruptcy by soaring interest rates after the 1994-95 economic
crisis. The group opposes the government's planned purchase of bad
loans because it would force taxpayers to pay for what it calls
bankers' misconduct.
	   Friday's compromise, approved by lawmakers Saturday night, would
replace the current bank deposit protection fund known as Fobaproa
with a new Savings Protection Institute. The latter would assume
most of the $60 billion in overdue loans held by Fobaproa, but
apparently would exclude loans auditors determine were illegal.
	   National Action Party President Felipe Calderon said the
measures would allow for a sharp reduction in home mortgage debt
and cut the amount owed by farmers by as much as 60 percent.
	   The compromise apparently settled some of the economic
uncertainty, but the future of Central Bank Gov. Guillermo Ortiz
remained unclear. The opposition has demanded Ortiz's resignation.
	   National Action officials said the agreement bars Ortiz from any
role in the new institute. They accuse Ortiz of violating the law
in the bank bailout that followed Mexico's 1995 financial crash.
	   However, Congressman Angel Aceves Saucedo of the governing party
insisted ``there will be no resignation of Guillermo Ortiz.''

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Spacewalking astronauts completed
their construction work on the international space station
Saturday, lashing a toolbox to the outside and fixing a jammed
antenna.
	   It was the third and final excursion out into Endeavour's open
cargo bay for Jerry Ross and James Newman.
	   All that remained following the spacewalk was Sunday afternoon's
release of the seven-story, 35-ton complex, freshly wired and
outfitted by the visiting shuttle crew.
	   ``We've come a long way,'' commander Robert Cabana observed.
	   Working nearly 250 miles above Earth, Ross and Newman lugged out
a 2 foot-by-2-foot bundle containing 50 wrenches, ratchets, clamps,
bars, foot loops, tethers and other tools. They attached the
package to the top of Unity, the American-made side of the station.
	   The toolbox looked like a picnic cooler.
	   ``I'm hungry, what's in the refrigerator?'' joked Newman.
	   ``Nothing edible,'' Ross replied.
	   The tools will be used by future spacewalkers. The next
construction team goes up in May.
	   Ross turned his attention to the stuck Russian antenna after
completing a check of the cables he and Newman installed earlier in
the week and disconnecting other cables no longer needed.
	   Armed with a 10-foot pole, Ross was hoisted on the end of the
shuttle robot arm up to Zarya, the Russian-built control module
stacked atop Unity. He kept his distance as he poked the antenna,
the same method that Newman used to fix another jammed antenna
during spacewalk No. 2 on Wednesday.
	   Ross tapped the stuck antenna, then jiggled it, then tapped it
again and again. After several minutes and dozens of pokes, the
antenna finally shot out to its full 4 feet.
	   ``There it goes! You can see it in the sun,'' Newman called out.
	   ``All right!'' shouted Ross.
	   The two roll-out antennas failed to open properly following last
month's launch of Zarya.
	   Once that was done, the spacewalkers shimmied to the tiptop of
Zarya and did the Russians another favor by securing a loose
experiment tray.
	   The remainder of the seven-hour spacewalk was dedicated to
non-construction work: a photo survey of the space station and a
test of the astronauts' mini jetpacks. They remained tethered to
the shuttle for added safety.
	   Ross was extra careful this time not to lose anything. Two tools
got away from him during Monday's spacewalk, and a thermal cover
floated away during Wednesday's outing.
	   ``I don't have the slightest idea what happened,'' Ross told a
TV interviewer late Friday. ``I did four previous spacewalks, never
lost an item. ... I have absolutely no explanation for why things
came loose.''
	   Saturday's spacewalk was the seventh of Ross' career _ a U.S.
record _ and the fourth for Newman.
	   NASA estimates 159 more spacewalks will be needed over the next
five years to build and maintain the international space station,
which eventually will stretch as long as a football field. Most of
the spacewalks will be conducted by Americans.

Malaysia's governing party meets amid political storm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo KL101-2
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad warned Sunday that disunity in the governing party could
threaten the integrity of the Southeast Asian nation that he has
ruled for 17 years.
	   Mahathir's comments to nearly 2,000 delegates came at the
opening of the party's first national convention since a political
storm erupted over his sacking of Anwar Ibrahim, formerly his
deputy prime minister and the No. 2-ranked official in the United
Malays National Organization (UMNO) party.
	   ``The party is important, not the individual. Individuals come
and go,'' Mahathir said.
	   ``Foreigners chose a credible puppet and tried to use him to
conquer the country,'' Mahathir said in an obvious reference to
Anwar.
	   Party leaders have often accused Anwar of being too close to
Western leaders and too willing to accept economic prescriptions
dictated by the International Monetary Fund.
	   ``Special privileges were given to the puppet and his cronies,
but when this puppet lost his power, open support was given to
destroy the country,'' the premier said.
	   Mahathir, 72, faces the toughest challenge in his political
career. Anwar's removal from office in September and subsequent
arrest led to a wave of protests and rallies demanding the prime
minister's resignation.
	   As dissent has spread within the ruling party, Malaysian police
have jailed many influential leaders for backing Anwar's call for
political reforms.
	   But Sunday's convention was unlikely to trigger stormy debate or
any other form of open opposition to Mahathir because the party
does not tolerate any criticism of the leadership in public.
	   ``Today, the only agenda for the meeting is to amend the party
constitution and to make sure democracy in the party will not be
abused and leaders will not use their democratic powers to destroy
the party,'' Mahathir said.
	   Ahead of the meeting, party leaders called on younger cadres to
demonstrate their support for Mahathir.
	   ``UMNO youth should never ever go against the party
leadership,'' party vice president Najib Tun Razak said in a speech
given on Saturday.
	   On the sidelines of the convention, party leaders were likely to
discuss the question of choosing Mahathir's successor. An election
for top party posts is scheduled next year, but many people expect
Mahathir to announce a deputy sooner.
	   Sunday's New Straits Times newspaper narrowed the field of
contenders to three politicians _ Education Minister Najib Tun
Razak, Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi and Tengku Razaleigh
Hamzah, a former finance minister who left the party in 1987 over
differences with Mahathir and then later rejoined.
	   The party has not had a deputy leader since Anwar was thrown out
of the deputy prime minister's office on Sept. 2 and expelled by
the party the next day.
	   The absence of a successor to Mahathir, who has been in poor
health in recent weeks, has added to the uncertainty caused by
Malaysia's economic problems.
	   ``You could say we are not used to not having a number two,''
Abdul Aziz Sheikh Fadzir, a party delegate, was quoted as saying by
the News Straits Times.
	   The last general assembly meeting in July showcased a clear rift
between Mahathir and Anwar. The ex-deputy prime minister's ally,
Zahid Hamidi, angered Mahathir by accusing the party's leadership
of practicing cronyism and nepotism.
	   Zahid was jailed for several weeks soon after Anwar was sacked
and arrested.

India beats Pakistan in kabaddi opener
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ India opened defense of its Asian Games
title in kabaddi, a kind of team tag, with a 17-9 victory over
Pakistan in the South Asian sport Sunday.
	   India led 10-6 at halftime.
	   B.C. Ramesh gained five points for the Indians, who did most of
their scoring in raids into Pakistan's zone.
	   Pakistan played a defensive game, scoring most of its points by
pinning down Indian raiders.
	   The sport, requiring strategy and breath control, draws its name
from the rule requiring raiders to continually say ``kabaddi''
while in enemy territory. Opponents try to pin down the raiders
until they run out of breath and can't keep up the chant.
	   India won the gold medal at the last Asian Games in 1994,
besting Pakistan and Nepal.

Largest coal-producing area of China to close 2,908 illegal mines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Shanxi province, China's top coal-producing
region, will close 2,908 small-sized illegal coal mines by the end
of next year to reduce a national oversupply of coal, an official
newspaper said Sunday.
	   Provincial officials at a recent meeting said closing the mines
would reduce output by nearly 70 million tons, the Guangming Daily
reported.
	   The central government has ordered the closure of small mines in
order to halt the plunder of national resources, reduce pollution
and help stem losses in the coal industry.
	   Many of these mines also have lax safety standards and high
fatality rates due to accidents.
	   Nationwide, 25,800 small coal mines are supposed to close next
year, bringing output down by 250 million tons, the Business Weekly
reported Sunday. About 1 million miners are expected to lose their
jobs.
	   China's state-owned coal sector has reported large deficits so
far this year due to an oversupply of coal.

Tears in the pool, no shows on the Asian Games medals chart
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For one anguished fan, the news that
Japanese swim star Shunsuke Ito had left the building was too much
to bear. She burst into tears.
	   To his bemusement, Ito is not only making waves in the pool:
he's become a heart-throb of the Asian Games after winning four
swimming gold medals.
	   ``To be so popular in Thailand was surprising for me because in
Japan I'm not popular at all,'' the swimmer said after picking up
his fourth gold _ in the men's 4 x 100 medley relay _ on Saturday.
	   The distraught fan, one of many who have sought Ito's autograph,
was still hanging around outside the swimming pool at least an hour
after the last race had ended and began to cry when told he had
left.
	   Ito's identical twin, Shusuke, also is competing in the Asian
Games and won a relay gold and a silver behind his older twin in
the 100 freestyle.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OFF THE CHART: With the Asian Games at mid-point, more than a
third of the participating nations have yet to appear on the medals
chart.
	   Among the 15 no shows are some of the world's poorest nations,
including Cambodia, Laos, Bhutan and Bangladesh, as well as tiny
countries like Macau, Brunei and Bahrain.
	   Others that have yet to reap gold, silver or bronze are the
Maldives, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Tajikistan, Sri Lanka
and Yemen.
	   Heading the competition among 41 nations are Asian sports
superpowers China, Japan and South Korea.
	   With some strong athletes in track and field, Qatar and Sri
Lanka are likely to end their medal droughts before the Games end
Dec. 20.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MIRACULOUS SERPENTS: Some officials are claiming that Thailand's
mythical serpents _ the nagas _ performed an Asian Games miracle.
	   According to the games' official newspaper, a rainstorm was fast
approaching just as electricity was about to be tested at the main
stadium before the start of the 41-nation competition.
	   What could stop the rain?
	   The venue official turned to the nagas and prayed. The testing
proceeded. The heavens only opened up five minutes after the test
was completed.
	   Statues of two gigantic nagas, a male and a female, stand beside
the main stadium at the Thammasat Sports Complex, one of three
major centers of the 13th Asian Games.

GM prepares for belated debut in tough Chinese car market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo SHA101 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOE McDONALD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ General Motors Corp. is preparing for its
belated debut in the intensely competitive Chinese car market with
a special, high-tech product: a Buick sedan.
	   A ceremonial ``first Buick'' is set to roll off the assembly
line on Thursday, with top GM executives on hand to launch a joint
venture that is the biggest foreign investment yet in China.
	   But after the fanfare dies away, the world's biggest automaker
will face an uphill battle to make its dlrs 750 million investment
pay off.
	   GM is entering a market glutted by entrenched Japanese and
European rivals. Competition in some areas is so fierce that
Beijing has imposed minimum prices on its own small automakers to
keep them from bankrupting each other with price wars. A slowing
economy and shifting government policies have cut into the
luxury-car market targeted by GM.
	   Nevertheless, the company says it can thrive because of its
unusual strategy _ offering the newest model in a market often used
by others to recycle older technology.
	   ``There are no comparable Chinese vehicles to what we are going
to provide,'' said Philip Murtaugh, the American general manager of
the joint venture, Shanghai General Motors Co.
	   Chinese buy about 1.5 million cars a year, or one-tenth as many
as the United States, but foreign companies with visions of vast
growth have piled into the market. GM was the last in before
Beijing suspended new joint ventures while it tries to galvanize
its domestic industry by merging more than 100 companies into a
handful of conglomerates.
	   Most prominent is Volkswagen, whose Santana sedan is popular as
a taxi, police cruiser or office car. VW's 13-year-old joint
venture in Shanghai commands half the market for mid-size sedans
with sales of more than 200,000 Santanas a year.
	   Volkswagen also sells upmarket Passat and Jetta sedans. Honda
sells the Accord sedan. Mercedes-Benz is developing a minivan
venture. Toyota, Nissan, Daihatsu and others have production or
assembly deals with Chinese partners.
	   Working in its favor, GM has support from the Shanghai city
government, which has ordered 2,200 cars. Its local partner is
Shanghai Automotive Industries Co., the leading Chinese assembler
for foreign car makers.
	   ``They have the best partner in China,'' said Len Shapiro, head
of the Beijing office of Automotive Resources Asia, an industry
consultant.
	   With 3,000 employees, the GM factory set among electronics
factories in a quiet section of Shanghai's Pudong industrial
district is to start out making 30,000 cars a year, eventually
rising to 100,000.
	   The first car _ a snappy-looking luxury sedan priced at 300,000
to 400,000 yuan (dlrs 36,000 to dlrs 48,000) _ is based on the
Buick Regal sold in the United States but called simply the Buick.
	   The sedan has been restyled for China, with radio and
air-conditioning controls in a more spacious back seat where the
most important passenger often rides. Features include what GM
advertises as the first Chinese-made automatic transmission.
	   Such details can make a big difference.
	   Peugeot pulled out of China last year after selling a few
thousand copies of its 504 sedan. Industry analysts said the French
company underestimated Chinese buyers and should have sold a
bigger, newer model.
	   ``These customers are educated, and they will have high
expectations, so we decided to bring in our latest vehicle,'' said
Murtaugh, a 43-year-old veteran of GM factories in England and
Japan.
	   Whether that will be enough to lure buyers remains to be seen.
	   Economic growth has slowed dramatically since GM began planning
its factory in the early 1990s, although at 7 percent it still is
healthy by Asian standards. Government officials who could have
been GM's best customers have been ordered to sell off cars in a
clampdown on corruption. The private market is dominated by
bargain-hunters.
	   ``Customers are going to be acting like private buyers _ much
more cost-conscious, less prestige-oriented,'' said Shapiro, the
industry analyst.
	   Murtaugh acknowledged that the outlook ``is not as rosy as it
was two years ago,'' but said GM can meet its sales targets by
capturing a bigger market share.
	   Even that may not be enough, Shapiro said.
	   While GM forecasts a Chinese luxury-car market of up to 120,000
vehicles annually, he said official belt-tightening could shrivel
that figure to just 18,000 cars a year.
	   ``GM could own that entire market _ which we don't see happening
_ and still have tremendous overcapacity,'' he said.
	   Despite that, Shapiro said, GM is laying a promising foundation
by spending heavily on creating a reputation for quality.
	   ``For the long-term, they're doing all the right things,'' he
said.

Hurricanes 3, Red Wings 0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GREENSBORO, North Carolina (AP) _ Keith Primeau scored against
his old team and the Carolina Hurricanes rewarded the first sellout
crowd in their 58-game history at the Greensboro Coliseum with a
3-0 victory over Detroit on Saturday night.
	   Ray Sheppard added a goal and an assist, Kent Manderville added
a goal and Arturs Irbe got his third shutout of the season as
Carolina sent the Red Wings to their first shutout on the road in
nearly eight years.
	   The difference for the Hurricanes was Primeau, who was traded
from Detroit on Oct. 9, 1996. He set the tone early against his old
teammates with some aggressive first-period play, and he put the
Hurricanes ahead to stay less than six minutes into the game when
he flipped in a feed from Sami Kapanen.
 &UR; Sabres 4, Bruins 1
	   In Boston, Miroslav Satan scored two goals and Dominik Hasek
stopped 36 shots for his league-leading 15th win as the Buffalo
Sabres defeated the Boston Bruins in a matchup of surging teams.
	   The win extended the Sabres' unbeaten streak to seven games
(6-0-1) and halted Boston's at eight. The Bruins were 6-0-2 before
Saturday.
	   Hasek, who faced just 16 shots in recording a 2-0 victory over
the Rangers on Friday, had his scoreless streak snapped at 146:06
when P.J. Axelsson scored 7:50 into the third period. He faced 21
shots in the second period, but only a few were tough chances.
 &UR; Devils 5, Avalanche 3
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Bobby Holik scored two goals,
including the game-winner in the third period, as the streaking New
Jersey Devils beat Colorado to end the Avalanche's five-game
winning streak.
	   Denis Pederson, Brian Rolston and Randy McKay also scored for
the Devils, who extended their unbeaten streak to 5-0-2. New Jersey
has lost only once in the last 12 games (8-1-3).
	   Christian Matte, Jeff Odgers and Rene Corbet scored for
Colorado.
 &UR; Lightning 2, Islanders 1, OT
	   In Uniondale, New York, Benoit Hogue's goal with 47.3 seconds
left in overtime led the Tampa Bay Lightning over the New York
Islanders in a battle of struggling teams.
	   Chris Gratton, reacquired in a multi-player trade with
Philadelphia earlier in the day, made his debut with Tampa Bay and
picked up an assist.
	   Karl Dykhuis also scored for Tampa Bay, which won for only the
second time in 14 games. Trevor Linden scored for the Islanders,
who have lost seven straight, and 10 of their last 12.
	   Tampa Bay goalie Corey Schwab stopped 34 shots for the
Lightning.
 &UR; Flyers 3, Maple Leafs 0
	   In Toronto, John LeClair scored his 20th goal of the season and
John Vanbiesbrouck made 23 saves as the Philadelphia Flyers beat
Toronto, ending the Maple Leafs' seven-game home winning streak.
	   Valeri Zelepukin and Eric Lindros also scored for Philadelphia.
Lindros, with his fifth goal in his last three games, leads the NHL
in scoring with 39 points. LeClair, who tied Chicago's Tony Amonte
for the league lead in goals, also had an assist for 36 points.
	   The Maple Leafs continued to struggle with opponents from their
conference. They're 5-10-1 against the Eastern Conference, but
11-1-1 against the West.
 &UR; Canadiens 2, Predators 2
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, despite Jonas Hoglund's third goal in
three games, the Montreal Canadiens' winless streak stretched to
six when they tied the Nashville Predators.
	   The Canadiens, now 0-4-2 in the stretch, managed the tie despite
being outshot 43-27 and playing without their leading scorer, Mark
Recchi. The forward scratched himself from the lineup because of
pneumonia, ending his current league-high streak of 570 straight
games.
	   Hoglund tied a Montreal high this season for goals in
consecutive games. His fifth goal came on a hard wrist shot from
the left circle with 1:58 left in the second period to pull
Montreal into the 2-2 tie.
 &UR; Flames 4, Panthers 2
	   In Sunrise, Florida, Theo Fleury scored the deciding goal and
rookie goaltender Jean Sebastien Giguere had 36 saves to lead the
Calgary Flames over the Florida Panthers.
	   Viktor Kozlov had a goal and an assist, while Dino Ciccarelli
scored the 607th goal of his career, tying him with Mark Messier
for eighth place on the all-time scoring list.
	   The Panthers had scored 15 goals in their last three home games
(2-0-1), including 10 on the power play. They were 0-for-2 with a
man advantage Saturday night.
 &UR; Penguins 4, Blues 3
	   In St. Louis, Alexei Kovalev scored twice and Jaromir Jagr had a
goal and an assist, leading the Pittsburgh Penguins over the St.
Louis Blues.
	   Pittsburgh scored four goals in a 1:39 span to lead 4-2 after
the first period.
	   Penguins goaltender Tom Barrasso stopped 32 shots as the Blues
outshot Pittsburgh 35-14. Blues goalie Grant Fuhr was making his
first appearance in 11 games after suffering a strained groin.
	   The Blues are 1-4-1 in their last six games. Pittsburgh snapped
a three-game winless streak and is 2-1-3 in its last six contests.
 &UR; Coyotes 2, Senators 0
	   In Kanata, Ontario, Nikolai Khabibulin stopped 42 shots and
Jyrki Lumme scored the game-winner in the second period as the
Phoenix Coyotes beat the Ottawa Senators.
	   Teppo Numminen scored an empty-net goal for Phoenix, undefeated
in four games (3-0-1). The win gave the Coyotes 37 points, one more
than the idle Dallas Stars for top spot in the NHL. Phoenix is 5-1
against the Eastern Conference this season.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's Yu Guohui claimed his country's
first track and field gold medal at the Asian Games with a
comfortable victory in the men's 20-kilometer walk Sunday.
	   Yu took more than two minutes off his previous best time in
recording 1 hour, 20 minutes, 25 seconds, a games record.
	   ``It's no surprise for me to win this race,'' Yu said. ``If the
wind was slower, I could have had a better time.''
	   Valeriy Borissov of Kazakstan was second in 1:23:52 while Asian
championship winner Li Zewen of China was third in 1:24:41, well
off his best of 1:18:32 set in the World Cup walking competition
last year.
	   The gold was the second of 43 for track and field. Japan's Naoko
Takahashi won the women's marathon on the opening day of the games
a week earlier.
	   China is expected to dominate the track meet, which got off to a
full start in the main stadium Sunday.

Vargas wrests title from Campas

 &UR; EDS: WILL be UPDATED after Gatti-Robinson fight. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ When Fernando Vargas said the
more experienced Yory Boy Campas was made to order for him, he
wasn't being just a wisecracking 21-year-old.
	   ``A lot of people felt I couldn't do it,'' Vargas said after
winning the IBF junior middleweight championship Saturday night at
the Trump Taj Mahal. ``I proved them wrong.''
	   Vargas, fighting as a pro for the 15th time, pounded Campas into
submission after seven rounds of his 75th fight.
	   Vargas maintained before the fight that Campas would be easy to
hit.
	   ``Campas is like an old car,'' Vargas said. ``It looks good from
the outside but inside it's got a million miles on it.''
	   According to a CompuBox punch count, Vargas landed 202 of 403
punches while Campas connected on 76 of 259.
	   One judge had Vargas ahead by six points and the other two had
him ahead by four.
	   Vargas pounded Campas around the ring in the seventh round and,
at the end, the 27-year-old champion from Mexico, blood pouring
from a broken nose and badly cut upper lip, told his corner he had
had enough.
	   The championship fight was the first half of an HBO
doubleheader. The second fight was a lightweight rematch between
Arturo Gatti and Ivan Robinson.
	   Vargas had much the best of the first three rounds, landing
several sharp rights and some good left jabs.
	   Campas then tried to turn the flow but he really never gained
control. He looked slow and older than his 27 years.
	   In the seventh round, Vargas hurt Campas badly with an
eight-punch barrage at midround. Then he landed three or four other
combinations, twice knocking out Campas' mouthpiece.
	   At the end of the round, Campas knew his title was gone after
just his third loss against 72 victories. He had scored 62
knockouts.
	   Vargas, 15-0, all by knockout, earned dlrs 180,000 and put
himself into position for much bigger paydays. Campas earned about
dlrs 450,000.
	   Both fighters weighed 151 pounds.

ACB won't comment on summons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Cricket Board (ACB)
refused to comment Sunday on a summons for test stars Mark Waugh
and Shane Warne to appear before a Pakistan judicial inquiry.
	   The judge investigating allegations of match fixing and bribery
in Pakistan has sent a summons for the pair to appear before him in
Lahore on Dec. 19.
	   ACB chief executive officer Malcolm Speed said Sunday the board
would not comment on the summons until it was received.
	   Speed and ACB chairman Denis Rogers have both previously said it
was unlikely Warne and Waugh would give evidence to the Pakistan
inquiry before Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum.
	   Rogers also said the ACB was unlikely to release to the inquiry
details of the board's investigation into Warne and Waugh's
involvement with an illegal bookmaker.
	   Waugh and Warne last week admitted taking money from an Indian
bookmaker for providing pitch and weather information during
Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in 1994.
	   They were fined by the ACB in February 1995 in action kept
secret until last Tuesday.
	   The bookmaker scandal has implications on the Pakistan inquiry
which in part is investigating allegations of attempted bribery
against former Pakistan captain Salim Malik.
	   Waugh, Warne and former test spinner Tim May allege Malik
offered them bribes to throw a match during Australia's tour of
Pakistan that followed the
	   Sri Lankan series.
	   Waugh gave evidence to that effect before the Pakistan inquiry
last October but did not mention his link with the Delhi-based
bookmaker.
	   Australian captain Mark Taylor also gave evidence to the
inquiry.
	   A lawyer for the Pakistan Cricket Board, Ali Sibtain Fazli, said
Waugh's credibility had been ``severely dented'' because of his
admission of taking money from the Indian bookmaker.
	   ``The judge wants Waugh to reappear again so he can be
re-examined,'' Fazli
	   said.
	   ``The judge at no stage feels the Warne and Waugh admissions
mean Salim Malik is innocent but he maintains the revelations have
changed the scandal.''
	   Justice Qayyum was to have reported to the Pakistan government
within 10 days but says the Waugh and Warne scandal will delay his
findings.
	   Meanwhile, a Hobart newspaper claimed Sunday that an
Australia-Pakistan one-day international in Hobart last year may
have been a fixed match that went wrong.
	   The Sunday Tasmanian based its front-page report on an alleged
conversation between an Australian and Pakistani player after the
match.
	   Pakistan won the low scoring match at Bellerive Oval on Jan. 7
last year by 29 runs. It had been dismissed for 149, but then
bowled out Australia for 120.
	   Cricket writer David Stockdale reported that after the match an
Australian player spoke to a Pakistani at the bar of Hobart's Grand
Chancellor hotel.
	   ``What are you looking so glum about, you won the match?'' the
Australian was said to have asked.
	   ``That's the problem,'' the Pakistani allegedly replied, ``we
were supposed to lose and it's caused a lot of friction because the
bookmakers have lost a lot of money.''
	   ACB chairman Denis Rogers refused to comment to the report.
