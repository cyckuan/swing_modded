<HEADLINE> Dalian Takes China Soccer Title in Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Dalian Wanda
defeated Guangzhou Apollo two goals against nil to take the title
of the Chinese Soccer League on Thursday with five rounds remained.
</P>
<P>
Wanda improved its unbeaten record to 51 and won its third
title as the league entered its fourth year stage.
</P>
<P>
From 14 wins and three draws, Wanda has scored 45 points after
the 17th round, 16 points clear of second placer Shanghai Shenhua.
</P>
<P>
Wanda dominated the game by scoring the first in the 28th
minute when Wang Tao curled an angled free-kick on the brink of
the box.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes before the break, Hao Haidong, top scorer with 11
in the league, chested down the pass from Wang Tao before an
Apollo defender tapped in an own goal.
</P>
<P>
Wanda kept its momentum in the pitch but failed to extend the
lead with poor finishes in the second half.
</P>
<P>
In Chongqing, Yanbian Aodong capitalised on its rare chance to
beat host Vanguards Huandao with a goal at the 88th minute.
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards played an excellent match with most possession of
the ball but all their shots turned into vain.
</P>
<P>
Strikers Gaofeng and Han Jinming forced Aodong's goalkeeper to
dive to and from to block the string of attacks before Li Canjie
scored the lone late goal in a peculiar counterattack.
</P>
<P>
In other matches, Tianjin Samsung exploited its home advantage
to share one point with powerhouse Shanghai Shenhua as neither
side opened the account in the regular 90-minute competition.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Hongyuan also had to settle for a scoreless draw with
Jinan Taishan, while Sichuan Quanxing drew with August First 2-2.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Bank of Canada earned
a record 1.68 billion dollars (1.18 billion US dollars) in fiscal
1997, the highest annual profit in Canadian corporate history,
said reports today.
</P>
<P>
The earnings were 17 percent higher than last year's 1.43
billion dollars. The bank's also set a profit record in the fourth
quarter, earning 449 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Royal's record profit came as a result of its strong
performances from all its operations, and particularly stock
market related, fee-based businesses, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
So far, four of Canada's Big Six banks have reported their
earnings in the fiscal year ended October 31.
</P>
<P>
The collective 1997 profit for the four banks were 5.56 billion
dollars, up 21 percent from last year.

<P>
OTTAWA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Canada's auto sales went up 15
percent last month, the highest November levels since 1989, said
reports today.
</P>
<P>
Sales of cars, trucks and minivans jumped to 109,603 during the
month from 95,235 a year ago. The industry racked up sales of
112,714 in November 1989.
</P>
<P>
For the first 11 months of the year, sales totaled 1.261
million, surpassing the total of 1.173 million recorded in all of
1996 and a 16-percent jump on the sales in the first 11 months of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Auto sales for 1997 are on pace to exceed 1.35 million, which
would be the best year for the industry since 1989, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
As has been the case for much of the year, huge gains in truck
sales have more than compensated for weak car sales.

<HEADLINE> Britain Admits Mad Cow Crisis Not Over Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- British Agriculture Minister
Jack Cunningham acknowledged today that the "mad cow" crisis could
last until 2001.
</P>
<P>
He said the end was not yet in sight to the saga of BSE (Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy), or mad cow disease, which helped
undermine the past Conservative government and raised widespread
fears about the safety of everyday foods.
</P>
<P>
"The way to finally get rid of these problems and bring lasting
support to the beef industry is to eradicate BSE from the national
herd altogether. We're doing everything we can to bring that about
as quickly as possible," said Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
Although he insisted on the safety of the beef meat, the
minister added, "We're likely to get down to very low levels of
the incidence of BSE in a couple of years time and to eradicate it
altogether by about 2001."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Cunningham proposed a ban on unboned beef
following scientific advice that mad cow disease could
theoretically be transmitted through beef bones.
</P>
<P>
But the announcement sparked off protests against imports of
cheap beef from Ireland overnight from Wales to Scotland and
England. Some 700 farmers mounted blockades of the Scottish ports
of Stranraer and Cairnryan, turning back about 20 truck loads of
Irish beef.
</P>
<P>
The government said today the protests were "totally
unacceptable" and threatened tough action against farmers
blockading British ports.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Textile Mill to Double Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- African Textile Mill (ATM) in
eastern Uganda is expected to double its output in the future,
Rao Kalluri, the General Manager of Mbale-based ATM, said.
</P>
<P>
Kalluri said his factory is heading to become the best of its
kind in Africa, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said his factory has installed the fourth machine to
increase its product to 12,000 or 13,000 meters of cotton fabric
every day from its 5,000 or 6,000 meters a month earlier, an
increase of 100 percent compared with previous years.
</P>
<P>
The fourth machine will operate in December, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Kalluri told the local English newspaper ''the Monitor'' that
Cooperative Bank has offered a loan to help his factory expand
its capacity of producing 18 million meters and up to 2,000 tons
of yarn a year for export. But he did not say how much he had
got from the bank.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt: Resettle Unproductive Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Lands and Agriculture Minister
Kumbirai Kangai today dismissed claims that the government
recently designated some of the most highly utilized and
productive farms in Zimbabwe for resettlement purposes.
</P>
<P>
Kangai, who is attending the ruling Zanu (PF) annual
conference in Mutare of east Zimbabwe, told the Zimbabwe News
Agency that the farms designated were either derelict,
under-utilized, were under multiple ownership or were adjacent to
communal people.
</P>
<P>
But the Commercial Farmers Union claimed that some of the
1,480 farms which the government plans to be used for
resettlement are productive farmland.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you all the farms we have indicated we want to
compulsorily acquire fall in one of these categories," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kangai said the government's stance on acquiring land to
redress the land ownership imbalance between white and black
Zimbabweans was receiving international support.
</P>
<P>
He described as wrong the assertion in some quarters that
Zimbabwe's agriculture would collapse should the government go
ahead to acquire the farms.
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, was determined to ensure the land
allocated to resettled farmers remained productive.
</P>
<P>
"The land would remain productive because we will allocate it
to indigenous farmers who will make it even more productive," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also denied the listing of farms for compulsory acquisition
ahead of the conference was meant to please the party's
membership which was complaining about the government's failure
to implement some of the resolutions made at last year's
conference.

<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- In an editorial to be published
Friday by the People's Daily hails the just-concluded state visits
by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Canada and Mexico as a
complete success.
</P>
<P>
The leading Chinese official newspaper says, "The visits have
achieved the goals of deepening understanding, enhancing
friendship, looking forward to the future and developing
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Canadian Governor-General Romeo Leblanc
and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, President Jiang visited the
two countries from November 26 to December 3 and was warmly
welcomed and received by the two governments and two peoples.
</P>
<P>
This is another important diplomatic move made by China toward
the America after President Jiang paid a state visit to the United
States, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
China, Canada and Mexico, which are three major countries on
the Pacific and members of APEC, play a key role in promoting
peace, stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region and
the world at large, it says.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's tour of the two countries was a big event in the
history of the Sino-Canadian and Sino-Mexican relations, which
drew close attention from the Asia-Pacific and world media, it
adds.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that at the turn of century the positive results
achieved during Jiang's visits to Canada and Mexico will exert a
positive impact on establishing and developing a new type of
state-to-state relationship which conforms to the law of history
and the trend of times and on promoting the lofty cause of peace
and development of the human beings," it notes.

<P>
KATHMANDU, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany has agreed to provide
a grant assistance of some 22.2 million U.S. dollars to finance a
power renovation project in Nepal, Nepal's official RSS news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be used to cover the foreign exchange cost of the
electric and communication equipment for expanding the Load
Dispatch Center in Kathmandu, and to expand the Balaju sub-station
for the connection of two additional transmission lines to the
center.
</P>
<P>
The two lines will connect the Khimti Khola and Chilime
hydroelectric power plants to the network of Kathmandu and to the
Load Dispatch Center.
</P>
<P>
Once the center is expanded, supply interruptions due to
continuous check will be reduced and restoration of the supply
will be faster, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and Germany have confirmed poverty alleviation as the
overall aim of their development cooperation, while developing
infrastructure is a priority area in Nepal's efforts to alleviate
poverty.

Robertson made the statement after the Iraqi government
restricted U.N. arms inspectors from visiting certain presidential
palaces and other facilities in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The British defense secretary stressed that the British
aircraft carrier Invincible, which is paying a port call in
Barcelona, Spain, would be sent to the Gulf to join the American
forces in the region if necessary.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Cohen said, "We are hoping it would not
become necessary, but we would not rule out any military action."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Stock Index Nosedived </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe stock market, the
second largest in Africa, fell a massive 358 points to close at
8,025 today as a cloud of uncertainty continued to hang over the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attributed the fall in the key industrial index
to a negative sentiment triggered by inflationary pressures such
as the recent hike of taxes by the government.
</P>
<P>
The government heightened the taxes because it has been under
siege from former freedom fighters to raise four billion
Zimbabwean Dollars (about 300 million U.S. Dollars) for their
gratuities and pensions.
</P>
<P>
The designation of some commercial farms for resettling
landless peasants has also unnerved investors who are staying on
the sidelines to watch events in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The mining index also tumbled when it fell by 69 points on the
back of losses in coal mining giant Wankie and gold producer
Bindura.

JOHANNESBURG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa, Swaziland
and Zimbabwe are among only 20 countries that have recorded
significant growth of trade union membership, the International
Labor Organization (ILO) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the 1997/98 world labor report, Francois Eyraud,

The increase in the three Southern African countries' union
membership were in sharp contrast to the general decrease in the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Sahara Africa has a total of 10.03 million registered
union members.
</P>
<P>
Eyraud attributed South Africa's gains to its high level of

<HEADLINE> US Registers Best Productivity Increase in Nearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The US workforce recorded
the best productivity increase in nearly five years over the
second quarter and the corresponding quarter of last year, the
Labor Department said here today.
</P>
<P>
Non-farm business productivity, which is output per hour
worked, grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.1 percent
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
That was revised down from an estimate of 4.5 percent last
month. Still, it was the largest gain since the final three months
of 1992.
</P>
<P>
Productivity increased a healthy 2.4 percent in the second
quarter and a more moderate 1.4 percent in the first.
</P>
<P>
The department said labor costs per unit of output, a key
ingredient in price pressures, fell 0.2 percent at an annual rate
after rising at a 0.9 percent rate in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Rapid productivity increases of nearly 3 percent a year
supported the post-World War II economic growth from 1947 through
1973. Since 1990, US productivity has averaged only about 1.2
percent a year. The latest productivity gain was led by a 9.3
percent increase in manufacturing, the highest in 15 years.

<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern today called on the British government to put an immediate
end to a British ports blockade that has hit Ireland's meat
exports.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, British farmers have blocked the
country's western ports to prevent cheap Irish meat imports from
coming into Britain.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Irish parliament early today, Prime Minister
Ahern was quoted by press reports from Dublin as saying that he
would talk to his British counterpart, Tony Blair, urging "the
movement of goods (to) be allowed."
</P>
<P>
Ahern noted that it was the British government's duty to uphold
free movement of goods. "That is not happening. Movement is being
impeded," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Apparently what happened is that the police have stood back
and allowed the protesters to interview the truckers and take
their action," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Irish Road Haulage Association said
companies faced "serious mounting financial losses" as a result of
the British farmers' protests.

limit set by the European Union's Maastricht treaty."
</P>
<P>
McCreevy told parliament Wednesday that his aim was to control
public spending and correct tax inequities, striking a balance
between "proper rectitude and punitive rigor."
</P>
<P>
With the European Commission set to decide who qualified for
the euro on the basis of 1997-98 budget figures, Ireland was well
set to reach the target.
</P>
<P>
The budget would be in surplus next year, at 0.3 of GDP in
1997-1998, 0.6 percent in 1998-1999 and 1.3 percent in 1999-2000,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government expects to borrow 89 million Irish pounds
(130.83 million US dollars) to meet its spending shortfall,
eliminating exchequer borrowing by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Current spending will rise by 3.7 percent in 1997-1998,
including a 517 million Irish pound (760 million US dollar) tax
and allowance package, which will take 15,000 people out of the
tax net, McCreevy said.
</P>
<P>
By tightening up on tax shelters enjoyed by the rich, and tax
allowance schemes, McCreevy projected savings of up to 20 million
Irish pounds (29.4 million US dollars) a year.

<HEADLINE> Editorial: Developing Overall Friendly Cooperative Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico, which has a culture of long standing, is a
developing country with significant influence in the Latin
American region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Mexican people have enjoyed a traditional
friendship which dates back to ancient times, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have been subjected to humiliation by
colonialists in the modern times and have waged a long struggle
for national independence.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that China and Mexico have been
pursuing a peaceful foreign policy of independence and work for
the establishment of a new, peaceful, stable, just and reasonable
political and economic order in the world.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are now faced with the common tasks of
developing economy and improving people's well-being.
</P>
<P>
China and Mexico, which share a long history of friendship,
have a solid foundation for developing all-round cooperation, the
editorial notes.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Mexico, President Jiang and his Mexican
counterpart Ernesto Zedillo agreed to establish an all-round
partnership oriented to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have reached a number of agreements on bilateral
cooperation in consular affairs, sports, social sciences and
economy, consolidating and deepening the friendly cooperation
between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Developing Sino-Mexican economic relations is not only in the
fundamental interests of the two peoples but also of great
importance to world peace and development, says the editorial.
</P>
<P>
Today's world is far from tranquil and the human beings have to
meet various challenges in order to survive and prosper.
</P>
<P>
However, "we hold a firm belief in human progress in the
future. It's an earnest aspiration of world people and the call of
times to maintain world peace and promote common development," it
says.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between countries should be based on equality and
mutual benefit. It has been proved that the world will enjoy
peace, stability and prosperity if all the countries, developing
or developed, build their relations on equality, mutual respect
and mutual benefit, the editorial says.

<HEADLINE> Japan: Top Donor to Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan led the top five
bilateral donors to Tanzania last year, reported the "Daily News"
today.
</P>
<P>
The other donors in diminishing order were Denmark, Sweden,
Norway and the Netherlands, according to the annual development
cooperation report released Wednesday by the UNDP country office
in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The report released by the UNDP Deputy Resident
Representative, Simon Nhongo, shows that the World Bank was the
largest multilateral donor, followed by the European Union (EU),
International Monetary Fund (IMF), African Development Bank (ADB)
and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
Nhongo said total external assistance to Tanzania topped 906.4
million U.S. Dollars, which was 11.4 percent higher than the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
He said 65.5 percent of the assistance given in the year under
review was in a form of grants.
</P>
<P>
The figures represent total per capital external assistance in
the year of 31.16 US Dollars compared with 28.8 Dollars in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
During the year, he said, bilateral donor agencies were the
major source of external assistance, accounting for 53.1 percent
of total assistance.
</P>
<P>
Multilateral funding agencies, consisting of the United
Nations and non-U.N. system were the second major source of
assistance, accounting for 44.4 percent of total assistance.
</P>
<P>
Nhongo said contributions from non-U.N. multilateral agencies
constituted 13.7 percent of total aid flows with the EU
constituting the largest share of 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The top sectors which received assistance in the year were
transport (14.7 percent) and public administration (12.3
percent), while the export trade and disaster management sectors
received the least assistance of 0.5 percent and 0.02 percent
respectively, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Youths Called to Protect Mt Kilimanjaro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian youths should
protect Mount Kilimanjaro in order to preserve the fauna and
flora which helps bring about ecological balance.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by a representative of the United Nations
Association of Tanzania, William Mbunga, at a press conference in
the city Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United Nations of Youth, Tanzania Branch, a
registered youth initiative, has launched a campaign to arouse
young people's awareness to protect the highest mountain in
Africa, according to today's Daily News.
</P>
<P>
The campaign seeks to arouse young people's awareness of
protecting the 5,895-meter-high mountain which has not been
properly managed.
</P>
<P>
The recent fires in Rombo and Hai districts on the slopes of
the mountain have destroyed more than 10,000 hectares of natural
wetland forest resulting in an enormous loss of fauna and flora.
</P>
<P>
He said the approach to be taken for the campaigning is
through community participation, especially by involving young
people.
</P>
<P>
A dinner will be held today at Nyumba ya Sanaa in Dar es
Salaam to raise money for an expedition to the mountain during
December 10-24.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all surged today and ended higher, with London rising to a
six-week high and regaining the 5,000-point level, boosted by Wall
Street's opening gains and the dollar's strength.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index ended more than 100 points higher at
5,082.3, up 111.6 points, buoyed by the Bank of England's decision
to keep official interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The City had largely discounted the thought of another rate
hike before Christmas but traders were still relieved at the news.
</P>
<P>
A strong performance on Wall Street and firmer futures helped
sentiment. Reuters soared after announcing that it planned to
return 1.5 billion pounds (2.5 billion US dollars) to investors.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt ended 1.39 percent higher on the
back of pre-Christmas bargain hunting. The DAX-30 index rose 56.91

<P>
The CAC-40 index ended 12.10 points up at 2,914.45.

LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- As the World Trade Organization
(WTO) financial services negotiations draw to a close, the
Financial Leaders Group (FLG) has urged all parties to quickly
table new and improved offers needed to successfully conclude the
talks.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the case for financial services liberalization is

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Tries to Stop Israel's Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Before leaving for Europe,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today made efforts to
stop the nationwide strike launched by the Trade Union Wednesday
in protest against government's plans for wages reform and
privatization.
</P>
<P>
At the Ben Gurion Airport in Tel-Aviv, Netanyahu held talks
with Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman and Trade Union Chairman Amir
Peretz in a bid to eliminate their differences over economic
reform plans.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that the strike gives the Israeli economy
a bad name and that it harms millions of citizens. He called on
the strikers to return to work, saying that "I don't know what
they're striking for. It's a political strike. There is not
reason for it."
</P>
<P>
Following today's meeting, Peretz said that he hopes he and
Neeman will bridge their differences in a short time, adding
that the workers will return to their jobs as he has given the
order.
</P>
<P>
Neeman said that he was ready to renew negotiations with
Peretz. But he stressed that he opposed contempt of the law by
the Trade Union, which ignored the National Labor Court ruling
ordering workers to return to their jobs by 6 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein also called on
the Trade Union to honor the court decision, saying that the
defiance of the court order could push the nation into total
anarchy.
</P>
<P>
Everyday life was definitely disrupted today as the general
strike entered its second day, which paralyzed the country by
shutting down airports, seaports, banks, the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange, government offices and state-owned industries.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Manufacturers Association estimated the strike's daily
cost at 53 million shekels (about 15 million U.S. dollars). Dan
Propper, head of the association, warned that if the strike
continued, foreign investors could be affected.
</P>
<P>
The strike was triggered by the words of Neeman Monday,
describing the striking workers as "exploding bombs" and enemies
from within.
</P>
<P>
In response to the assault, Peretz declared the strike
Tuesday at an emergency gathering of thousands of union members
in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The strike is the latest round in a Trade Union battle
against government economic reform plans, which have sparked
fears that worker's rights would be harmed.
</P>
<P>
Some 150,000 clerks and municipal workers launched a two-day
strike last Sudday against cost-cutting measures taken by local
authorities and they resumed work only after the National Labor
Court issued a back-to-work order.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Gold Conference Ends in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The three-day international
conference on Nazi gold ended in London this afternoon with its
Chairman Lord Mackay calling it "a memorable and most stimulating
conference."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the final press conference, Lord Mackay said that
some 240 delegates from 41 countries and six non-government
organizations have "made extremely useful discussion" on the
origins and fate of the Nazi gold.
</P>
<P>
"Discussion was throughout free, frank and productive. The
atmosphere in our meetings was not one of recrimination for past
events, but one of constructive examination of present actions and
future plans," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day conference, British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook announced the establishment of a special fund to
compensate survivors of the Holocaust that occurred during World
War II and pledged that Britain would contribute 1 million pounds
(about 1.7 million U.S. dollars) to the fund.
</P>
<P>
The United States government promised to contribute an
immediate 4 million dollars to the fund and would increase the
total volume to 25 million pounds over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Argentina, Austria, Croatia, Greece, and
Luxembourg expressed their desire to make some contributions.
</P>
<P>
All the delegates urged international research on Nazi gold to
be pursued further in an effort to bring full light upon the past
events.
</P>
<P>
The United States delegation announced today that a further
conference would be held in Washington next year to look further
at other assets other than gold.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizensat said at a press
briefing, "The U.S. Holocaust Museum has indicated a willingness
to host such a conference to follow up our work here and to give
these issues and other remaining questions the attention and depth
of study they so richly deserve."
</P>
<P>
"We hope to convene such a conference in Washington in late
spring or early summer under the sponsorship of the U.S. Holocaust
Museum," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the conference is far from resolving all the
outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the United States have called on all the 15
countries, which claimed the remaining 5.5 tons of Nazi gold, to
hand over their shares of the gold to the special fund for
Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the 15 countries refused to waive their rights
to the remaining gold and hand over them to the New York-based
fund.
</P>
<P>
The conference was also marked by arguments over whether the
Allies gave the European central banks gold that they knew had
been stolen from individuals and whether the Tripartite Gold
Commission, run by Britain, France and the United States, should
open its archives to the public.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion China
conceded its first goal in two years in the regional tournament
when it savored its opener 3-1 win over DPR Korea at the 11th
Asian Women's Soccer Championship here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Korean striker Kim Kun Sil swung in her header in the 83rd
minute, putting an end to the remarkable tournament record of
shutout victories registered by the Chinese women who kept their
nets intact without conceding any goal en rout to their triumph at
the last edition two years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, it took only three minutes for the hot favourites to
stamp their authority on the championship which they have won five
times in a row as veteran striker Liu Ailing fired in a
left-footed shot off the brink of the box.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese eleven were in no mood to cherish the early 1-0
cushion, geared up their attacks by pressing forward and found the
net again on a 17th-minute header from defender Fan Yunjie.
</P>
<P>
The Koreans, who have been described as unpredictable for their
absence from the international stage for more than one year,
played the first half with a few attempts.
</P>
<P>
With the best runners-up joining three group winners in the
semi-finals, the Koreans wouldn't give up any slip of hope and
their stamina and strong physique eventually were paid off in the
83rd minute.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side, cheered up by a 4,000-strong crowd, sealed
the victory in the dying minute as Liu struck her second with a
powerful central shot two minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yuanan, head coach of the Chinese team, said the conceded
goal didn't come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
"I never take any opponent for granted and expected every
possible result against the Koreans, either win or draw, and even
loss."

Commission (TRC) failed to lay charges against former state
President P W Botha todya owing to a defective subpoena served
last month, South African Press Association reported.

<P>
Botha has disobeyed the subpoena to testify before the TRC

Western Cape Attorney-General Frank Kahn announced after a
meeting with TRC Chairman Desmond Tutu that although the subpoena
told Botha what date and place he had to appear before the
commission, it neglected to mention a time.

his deputy, Alex Boraine, who walked to Kahn's office from the TRC
headquarters at about 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) to lay charges against
Botha for his failure to appear at today's hearing.

Romario, the Player of 1994 World Cup, said the Norwegians
dared to resort to an all-out attacking tactics even in a tie

the draw for the 1998 World Cup finals in France made on Thursday
in Marseille.

<HEADLINE> EU to Support Russia's Reforms via Technical Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is
launching two high-level policy advice projects worth 6 million
ECUs (6.7 million U.S. dollars) to support Russia's reforms.
</P>
<P>
The assistance program, announced here today by the European
Commission, will be directed at strengthening the building up of a
state of law by supporting local institutions involved in legal
reforms and at providing the Russian administration with
high-level economic policy advice.
</P>
<P>
The two projects are part of a 1996 Tacis action program for
the Russian Federation and were both signed late last month by the
commission, the executive agency of the 15-nation union. Tacis is
an EU technical assistance program.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 the Tacis program has committed more than 1,000
million ECUs to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The building of a state of law has been identified by both the
EU and Russia as a high priority in Russia's reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
It includes the training and re-training of legal
professionals, teachers and officials, and the development of
curricula and training materials.
</P>
<P>
Specified reform areas which will be addressed by the project
are company law, improvement of administrative rules affecting
business law and the civil and penal codes.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has, since 1995, financed the
establishment and operation of the Russian-European Center for
Economic Policy.
</P>
<P>
Directly linked to the office of the Russian prime minister,
the policy center provides high-level advice in the economic area
to the Russian government, the parliament and the presidential
administration as well as creates strong links with similar
research and policy advice institutions in the EU.

LONDON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair has pledged that Britain would show strong leadership in
Europe when it takes over the presidency of the European Union
(EU) early next year.

<P>
Launching a new logo of 15 stars of the EU at London's Waterloo

<P>
"A test for Britain to show that we can and do offer strong
leadership in Europe. A test for Europe to show that it can
embrace the need for change and reform," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Blair, whose Labor party won a landslide election victory in
May, noted he wanted to seize the opportunity "to show the modern,
vibrant, dynamic new Britain to the wider world."
</P>
<P>
On the single European currency, due to be launched in 1999,
Blair reaffirmed Britain's commitment to ensure a successful start
for Europe's single currency, even though his government has ruled
out joining in the first wave of the European Monetary Union
(EMU).
</P>
<P>
"It is in all our interests that monetary union work. We will
play our part to ensure that it does," he said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Coryo Securities Corp., a major
South Korean brokerage house, was declared insolvent today as it
failed to honor maturing notes.
</P>
<P>
The firm, with 1,100 employees in 53 domestic branches and
overseas incorporated companies in New York, London and Hong Kong,
was the first case of bankruptcy involved in the current monetary
crisis in the South Korean financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Because of the failure to settle the notes, the business of
Coryo will be suspended as of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A business source said the dishonored promissory notes totaled
17 billion won (about 14.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Coryo, founded in 1959 and listed in 1986, with 10 affiliated
firms covering investment and management, life insurance, trade,
pharmaceuticals and other areas, was one of the nine
financially-troubled firms forbidden to conduct foreign currency
business last week.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Ministry of Finance and Economy said Coryo's
bankruptcy means the beginning of the restructuring in the
financial sector, following an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund to bailout the sector.
</P>
<P>
While ministry officials said there will be no more bankruptcy
in the financial sector, industry experts predict that it is
possible that two or three other ailing securities firms may
become insolvent.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye has allowed private companies to buy tea leaves
from farmers in Rungwe District, Mbeya Region in the southwest,
after the Tanzania Tea Authority (TTA) failed to pay farmers.
</P>
<P>
TTA owes the farmers a total of 84 million shillings (about
134,400 U.S. Dollars), according to "The Guardian" today.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye, who is on a six-day tour to the region, gave the green
light in Tukuyu town Thursday, after the farmers told him that
with no economic returns they have to uproot tea plants.
</P>
<P>
The Rungwe District Commissioner, Ms Cynthia Ngoye, said TTA's
payment failure has frustrated the district's efforts to mobilize
farmers to cultivate tea.
</P>
<P>
TTA production manager Juma Chiloga said TTA had planned to
pay the farmers in three phases, but the plans failed because the
money allocated, totalling 32 million shillings, was not
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
The Premier said he has made such a decision to encourage
farmers to boost the production of tea which is one of the major
foreign exchange earners of the country.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The experts meeting of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) concluded here this
afternoon with some major differences unsolved.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the eighth OIC summit, Iranian Deputy Foreign
Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters that three issues
unsolved would be referred to the meeting of the OIC foreign
ministers due to open here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zarif said that the issue of relations of some Islamic
countries with Israel, northern Iraq and the OIC structural
reform remained unsolved due to sharp differences among the OIC
member states.
</P>
<P>
The differences on the issue of relations of Islamic
countries with Israel were serious, he said, but most of the OIC
members including Iran condemned the Israeli hardline policies
and were against the compromise with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Middle East peace process was the hot topic of
the OIC experts meeting since it opened Tuesday and the Islamic
countries are obviously separated due to the different views on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Most of the OIC members agreed with the Middle East peace
process while some countries voiced opposition to the process in
the discussion of the OIC political committee.
</P>
<P>
Zarif confirmed the differences among the OIC members over
the Issue of Middle East peace process, saying that it was
natural for the OIC members to have different views.
</P>
<P>
He said that 140 resolutions were adopted during the four-day
discussions in the political, economic and cultural committees.
</P>
<P>
Zarif expressed the hope that the remaining issues would be
solved in the ministerial meeting.

<P>
NANJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred builders and
technicians in Nanjing, the capital city of east China's Jiangsu
province, started a month-long parts replacement on its first
Yangtze River Bridge, today.
</P>
<P>
The parts renewal project will cost more than 14 million yuan
(1.69 million US dollars), according to Railway Ministry experts
who have been conducting tests.
</P>
<P>
The double-deck, highway-railway bridge at Nanjing, which was
built in 1968, now handles 200 trains daily as against a few dozen
at the beginning, but, as the speed of trains and their carrying
capacity increase, the bridge has some difficulty in handling them.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is expected to provide an example for parts
replacements on the Yellow River Bridge and the Huaihe River
Bridge, which are expected to be part of the rail route from
Beijing to Shanghai -- the country's first main trunk line with
seamless rails.

<P>
MANILA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Combined forces of the
Philippine military, police and local government officials today
successfully rescued 12 kidnap victims who were abducted Thursday
in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The victims were rescued in Piagapo, Lanao del Sur province,
around 2:00 p.m., the Philippine News Agency today quoted
Superintendent Cosain Alonto, provincial police director, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the saved kidnap victims are mentors of the Mindanao
State University and four others remain unidentified, but reports
said they are students of the university.
</P>
<P>
Seven heavily-armed kidnappers Thursday abducted 15 people
aboard a minibus and then released three of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Alonto said the abductors were cordoned in Piagapo town and had
no place to go, which prompted them to abandon the victims.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports identified the kidnapping suspects as members
of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), a former Muslim
rebel group which signed a peace accord with the government last
year.
</P>
<P>
Demands set by the disgruntled MNLF members prior to the rescue
of the victims were replacement of 52 firearms earlier surrendered
to the government and immediate release of their overdue
livelihood funds.

<HEADLINE> China's First CDMA Network Built in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China has established the
first CDMA (code division multiple access) network in south
China's Guangdong Province, and will put it into commercial
operation by next summer.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by a local official at '97 Expo Comm
South China, a computer and telecommunications trade show held in
Guangzhou on December 2-5.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xuedao, vice-director of the Guangdong Posts and
Telecommunications Administration, said that the CDMA network,
which is regarded as a possible substitute to the present GSM
(global service for mobile communications) wireless system, has
begun trial operation in Guangzhou and Panyu in the province. It
is equipped with 13 base stations and has a switching capacity of
20,000.
</P>
<P>
He said that a special operator, Guangdong Great Wall Mobile
Communications Co., was launched to take charge of the CDMA
service in the province.
</P>
<P>
The province will further expand the switching capacity of the
network next year, Chen said. Lucent Technologies, one of the
leading telecommunications companies in the United States, will
continue to supply the project with its CDMA technology and
equipment, including its flagship switching machine -- the
5ESS-2000 Switch.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Guangdong, three large cities in China --
Beijing, Shanghai and Xi'an -- have also initiated CDMA projects
to improve the technical quality of their mobile communications
systems.
</P>
<P>
Representatives with Lucent Technologies (China) Co Ltd,
said at the exhibition that the Guangdong CDMA network passed the
roaming service test by the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications last September. CDMA users in the province
will be connected with Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiuchuan, vice director of the Mobile Telecommunications
Bureau under the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, said
that the country's mobile telephone subscriptions have grown at a
rate of 120 percent over the past few years. Li said there will be
18 million clients by 2000.
</P>
<P>
To meet the ever-growing demand, "the only way out is to
develop a technology that can make more use of radio frequencies,"
Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CDMA technology, which boasts a switching
capacity 10 times that of the present analog mobile communications
standard, will be among the most efficient means to explore
frequency resources.
</P>
<P>
Li said that once the country opens the market to foreign CDMA
suppliers, the telecommunications administrative body will
encourage the companies to transfer their technology in China.
</P>
<P>
So far, four overseas CDMA manufacturers, namely, Lucent
Technologies and Motorola of the Unites States, Samsung of the
Republic of Korea, and Nortel of Canada, have participated in
CDMA projects in China.

<HEADLINE> Imelda Marcos Allowed to Travel Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court
today allowed Imelda Marcos, widow of former president Ferdinand
Marcos, to travel to the United States for a scheduled eye
operation.
</P>
<P>
With the nod, the former first lady can pursue her much sought
medical needs with her eye specialist-doctor based in Boston,
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
Imelda earlier had asked twice the country's special anti-graft
court, Sandiganbayan, for permission to travel to the U.S. for
medical help.
</P>
<P>
But both requests were denied by the court on the ground Imelda
has pending cases, prompting her to appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court laid down several conditions in granting
Imelda permit to travel to the United States, where she can stay
for only one month.
</P>
<P>
Among the conditions was an increase of her posted bail from
15,000 pesos to 100,000 pesos (2,800 U.S. dollars). Imelda was
also required to report to the Philippine consulate in New York
City and the Philippine government of her arrival.
</P>
<P>
Imelda and her children are facing a series of lawsuits before
Manila courts for various alleged offenses.
</P>
<P>
Manila courts have sentenced Imelda to 18 years in jail for
corruption and her son to a nine-year imprisonment for tax
evasion. Both cases are on appeal and the pair are free on bail.
</P>
<P>
Imelda, who was elected a member of the House of
Representatives in 1992, still faces about 100 other lawsuits for
allegedly helping her late husband plunder the country.
</P>
<P>
Ferdinand Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt in 1996 and
died in exile in Hawaii three years later. The government has
accused him of looting billions of dollars from the country during
his 20-year dictatorial rule.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Information
Bureau of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office spoke today
about the coming visit of Hsu Hsin-liang, chairman of Taiwan's
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), to the US.
</P>
<P>
Hsu is scheduled to visit the US and some other countries in
early December, according to Taiwan newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the fact that there is only one China
in the world, that Taiwan is part of China, and that no separation
of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity will be allowed
is common knowledge.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are firm in our position against 'Taiwan
independence'."
</P>
<P>
Realizing the reunification of China is the common wish of
Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Straits and an irresistible
historical trend, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that any political force or individual to conduct
activities to split China is against the will of the people and is
bound to fail.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that various parties in Taiwan will go
along with the trend of the times and do something practical to
develop cross-straits relations.

accords, a German government spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing about the talks between Netanyahu

<HEADLINE> Trade Unions Urged to Actively Back Reforms (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trade unions must intensify their efforts to satisfy their
workers' basic living needs and promote the re-employment of
laid-off workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The guiding ideology for China's trade union work in 1998 will
be Deng Xiaoping's Theory, the gist of the 15th Party Congress and
the basic principle of relying on the working class
wholeheartedly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the past year, he said that trade unions at all
levels have scored excellent achievements in encouraging workers
to participate in enterprise management, improve labor relations,
safeguard workers' legitimate rights and interests and help
laid-off people to find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that this year more than 600,000 management
personnel in more than 76,000 state enterprises underwent the
"democratic appraisal" by the workers' congresses, formed by
representatives of enterprise employees.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with recommendations of the workers' congresses,
more than 36,000 managers were commended, awarded or promoted,
while more than 11,400 were demoted or ousted," he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, he said, more than 54 million
employees in 187,000 enterprises had signed collective labor
contracts with their employers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, trade unions across the country have established
some 1,300 professional institutions to train more than one
million workers each year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said trade unions have developed rapidly over recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, by the end of last June, trade unions had
been formed in 147,000 foreign-funded, private and township
enterprises employing approximately 21 million workers.

<HEADLINE> Russian Children Study in Chinese Acrobatics School (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- At 6 every morning, Alesha and
his classmates start their day with running, jumping and
gymnastics in the China Acrobatics and Circus School.
</P>
<P>
Alesha, among 20 children from Russia's Republic of Yakut,
arrived in Beijing in October for acrobatic training. The
seven-year training program, approved by the Chinese school and
concerned organizations in Yakut in June, might turn the children
into promising acrobats, or even stars, for the northernmost
Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
"The exercises are very tiring but funny, and I've learned many
things from here," said Alesha, who is 11 years old.
</P>
<P>
Acrobatic exercises sometimes mean sweat and tears. After one
hour of morning warm-ups, the children receive skill training,
which usually lasts three hours and includes gymnastics,
calisthenics and exercises for body shaping. Another two-hour
class awaits the children.
</P>
<P>
Liang Anna, the Russian pupils' instructor, described them as
"lively, earnest and hardworking."
</P>
<P>
"But the Chinese teachers are more gentle with the Russian
pupils than their Chinese classmates, especially in the beginning
days," Liang said, "They need time to gradually adapt themselves
to life here."

<P>
Although living with amiable coaches, those children admitted
that they have cried on occasion.
</P>
<P>
"When not succeeding in difficult movements and hurting myself,
I did cry," said Alesha, regarded as the top student by his
companions.
</P>
<P>
In fact, they can take pride in their achievements. They were
chosen from more than 3,000 competitors who applied for entry to
the Chinese acrobatics school, the first and only one in China to
enroll foreign pupils. The state-sponsored school recruits only 70
trainees nationwide each year.

<HEADLINE> Russian Children Study in Chinese Acrobatics School (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Besides acrobatic training, the Russian children have also been
provided with courses of Russian, Chinese, maths, music and
history of arts.
</P>
<P>
"They love studying Chinese because they want to understand the
Chinese teachers better," said Liang, claiming that they can speak
a few of everyday Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The teachers take good care of them during daily lives while
being strict with them in classrooms, the pupils said.
</P>
<P>
For the recent two months, they have visited the Great Wall,
the Summer Palace, the Palace Museum and the Tiananmen Square in
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all children spend happy life in China. Every day they
can even eat bortsch, a delicious Russian traditional soup they
favor most.
</P>
<P>
However, they feel homesick sometimes. Apart from Kosha who are
with his mother in Beijing, group leader of the 20 children, the
other pupils could only alleviate the homesickness by telephoning
family members regularly.
</P>
<P>
"I often writes back home and all of us write letters," the
8-year-old Aena said, "But I still long for the summer vacation."
</P>
<P>
The success in this field, however, is the children's highest
aspiration. Alesha wanted to choose one or two suitable acrobatic
courses after the training of basic skills.
</P>
<P>
"Our coach said that excellent pupils can also join the
nationwide performance tours of Chinese children," he said.
</P>
<P>
Valja, Kosha's mother, said, "The tradition of the Chinese
culture and quality training here will provide them good
opportunities in acrobatics."

<HEADLINE> Asian Squads Hope For Wins in World Cup Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Rated as outsiders, all the
four Asian squads are facing tough clashes with none predicting
its sure sailing into later stage of the World Cup finals in
France.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Japan and Iran are pitted separately
in eight first-round groups after the draw was concluded in
Marseille late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is bracketed in Group E with the Netherlands,
Belgium and Mexico, looking for its first-even win in four
consecutive outings into the finals.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, who reached the second round in the 1994 World
Cup, is drawn into a tough Group C with hosts France, South Africa
and former European champions Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Japan faces former winners Argentina, and fellow newcomers
Croatia and Jamaica in Group H, while Iran, the last team to
qualify for the finals, is in Group F against current European
champions Germany, Yugoslavia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Coach Cha Bum-kun of South Korea, the best Asian team with the
most impressive qualifiers, is pinning his hope for a victory over
Mexico as both the Netherlands and Belgium stand as hard nuts for
the next World Cup hosts.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good chance for us. Belgium and Mexico are good teams
for us to face and all of the Korean people want us to win our
first World Cup match against Mexico," said coach Cha.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, who beat Morocco and Belgium to reach the second
round of the last World Cup finals in the United States, still
secretly cherishes the hope of reaching the second round.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia Football Association president Faisal Bin Fahad
said "we are triple Asian champions and are playing in our second
successive World Cup so we are confident we can reach the last 16
- France must be favourites for our group."
</P>
<P>
Japanese coach Takeshi Okada set the target of winning a game
at the country's first World Cup final.
</P>
<P>
Iran, who booked the last berth after beating Australia on away
goals in two play-offs, remained tongue-tighted against any
prediction.
</P>
<P>
But, the Iranians also have their edge as Khodadad Azizi, the
Asian Player of the Year, Ali Daei and Karim Bagheri all play in
the Bundesliga.
</P>
<P>
Iranian FA president Dariush Mostafavi said in Marseille that
"we have been waiting for this moment for 20 years. Ours is quite
a difficult group and we will have to work hard to pull off a
great World Cup."
</P>
<P>
However, British bookmakers have already had their say in the
World Cup finals wherein Iran is considered as the longest shot at
300-1, both South Korea and Saudi Arabi at 200-1 and Japan
250-1.

<HEADLINE> Liberian President Wants Re-definition of ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles
Taylor has called for the re-definition of the west African
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) in Liberia and Sierra Leone as part
of the conditions for the force's continued stay in his country.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG could stay in Liberia for as long as three years or
more, Taylor said on Thursday at the end of his two-day official
visit to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"But the functions of ECOMOG in Liberia and Sierra Leone
should be defined and separated," he was quoted by today's press
reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
They are two different cases, Taylor said, but he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was sent to Liberia in 1990 to help end the civil war
there. According to a peace accord, the force will withdraw from
that country from December this year to February next year.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional force was dispatched to Sierra Leone in the
wake of the May 25 coup that overthrew the legitimate government.
It is enforcing economic sanctions and embargo on that country.
</P>
<P>
The pullout of ECOMOG from Liberia has begun since last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, disagreement grew on whether ECOMOG should be
involved in restructuring Liberia's post-war army in line with
the Abuja Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
Taylor has said earlier it's his constitutional authority to do
the job, thus leading to a rift between him and ECOMOG force
commander Major-General Victor Malu.
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's news briefing, the Liberian leader denied
statements credited to him that he would not allow Liberia to be
used as a base to solved the Sierra Leonean problem.
</P>
<P>
Describing such reports as rumor, Taylor said since Liberia
was a member of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), the country will support any ECOWAS plans on Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
Taylor was earlier reported as not allowing ECOMOG to launch
attacks against the military junta in Sierra Leone from Liberia.
</P>
<P>
He also denied reports that Liberia would prefer the United
States to train its army, saying that there would be a departure
from that as a result of the planned African peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
As for the allegation that Nigerians are harassed in Liberia
by security agents, Taylor promised to investigate the issue and
take appropriate action against those responsible.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time Taylor visited Nigeria after he was
sworn in as president last August.
</P>
<P>
No communique was released as expected at the end of the
visit.

<P>
MACAO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of residents in Macao
reached 420,300 by the end of September, an increase of 4,400
from last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics
Department show that during the first nine months this year, Macao
had 3,703 newly-born babies and 984 deaths.
</P>
<P>
While April, May and June seemed to be the least romantic
period to tie the knots in Macao, a total of 1,292 couples got
married in the first three quarters, compared with 1,460 marriages
in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
And Macao may still be an attractive place to live in.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign nationals allowed to move into Macao was
about the same level as last year, reaching 1,132. But the number
of foreign nationals who had previously lived in Macao but left
between January and September added up to only 473, compared to
780 in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the move-in and departure, Macao had 659 new
residents of foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
More overseas laborers left Macao in the period, reflecting a
sluggish economy. The number of overseas contract laborers in
Macao declined by 334 to reach 29,566 at the end of September.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a total of 1,526 Chinese nationals were permitted
to emigrate to Macao, and two-thirds of them were women. There
were also 3,938 repatriated illegal immigrants, compared with
5,032 for the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Gateway to Asian Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The one-day regional
conference on marketing and market research closed here this
afternoon after some 250 prominent experts raised their awareness
of Hong Kong's role as a gateway to the services sector of China
and other Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference entitled "Researching the Asian
Markets of the New Millennium," Chairman of the Market Research
Society of Hong Kong Christopher Robinson said Hong Kong is the
most highly developed services economy in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that many feel that Hong Kong, which returned to China
on July 1, will ultimately assume the role of China's
international financial center.
</P>
<P>
"This role as a hub or gateway into China is not just based on
Hong Kong's fortunate location as an entry point to the Pearl
River Delta. It is clearly based on the quality and
resourcefulness of our prime commodity -- people. Hong Kongers are
acknowledged to be some of the most flexible, adaptable and
successful entrepreneurs in modern business," Robinson noted.
</P>
<P>
He also listed 12 most important reasons given for the
attractiveness of Hong Kong to regional operations, including good
banking and financial facilities, top-class infrastructure, rule
of law and international business standards.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary for Trade and Industry of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region Tam Wing-pong said that Hong Kong is
an established major international trading, financial and business
center.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong remains a hub of everything -- a hub of goods, a hub
of services, a hub of money and a hub of business entities, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Into the 21st century, Hong Kong will continue its
development as a world class, high value-added service economy and
the premier services center in the region," and "chief among these
is that Hong Kong will maintain the firm hold on free trade
policy."
</P>
<P>
Describing Hong Kong's economic fundamentals as "strong," Tam
stressed that Hong Kong would play its role of a services gateway
in the region in the new millennium.

<HEADLINE> Three More Historical Sites in China Added to World Heritage List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The ancient towns of Pingyao
and Lijiang as well as the classical gardens in Suzhou have been
added to UNESCO's list of World Cultural Heritages.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the 21st Annual Meeting of the
Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritages being held in
Naples, Italy, according to the Chinese National Committee for the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
So far, 19 Chinese cultural and natural heritage sites have
been approved by UNESCO for the list.
</P>
<P>
Pingyao in north China's Shanxi Province was built during the
Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. A group of
typical ancient buildings reflect the town's heritage.
</P>
<P>
Lijiang in southwest China's Yunnan province is 800 years old
and the only city where the Naxi ethnic minority reside. It is
famous for its houses and street layout.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou gardens in east China are famous for their scenic
beauty and residential architecture.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO adopted the Convention on the Protection of
World Cultural and Natural Heritages in 1972, calling for concerted
efforts to protect the common history of mankind. One-hundred
forty-six countries have signed the convention.
</P>
<P>
The World Heritage Committee, under UNESCO, each year considers
candidates for listing as World Heritage sites. The cultural and
natural sites which are of outstanding significance and universal
value, will be listed as World Heritage sites for protection by
the international community.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian-American Chambers
of Commerce (NACC) has renewed its call on the United States
government to lift its sanctions on Nigeria, saying that
sanctions do not produce democracy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the first Nigerian-American trade
fair in Lagos, NACC's President Moses Ihonde said, instead of
helping the emergence of a democratic government, sanctions can
only weaken the economy.
</P>
<P>
"When the economy is weakened, democracy can not be
established nor sustained," he was quoted by local media as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
A weakened economy like that of Nigeria, he said, must be
assisted to grow and not be suppressed with sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Ihonde appealed to the U.S. to reconsider its position in
relation to Nigeria with the aim of improving commercial dealings
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also urged foreign investors not to depending on media
reports, but to look at those investors that were already on
ground to decide if the Nigerian business environment is safe or
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and other western countries have been maintaining
various economic and military sanctions on Nigeria in the last
few years in the excuse of democracy and human rights.

<HEADLINE> HK Cyanide Spill Causes No Injury, Contamination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Poisonous sodium cyanide
powder scattered from four barrels of the chemical in a traffic
accident in Hong Kong Thursday afternoon caused neither injuries
nor contamination.
</P>
<P>
A medium goods vehicle was traveling northward along the Tai Po
Road in Sha Tin with 32 barrels of the deadly chemical. Nineteen
barrels fell off the truck onto the road in the accident and four
were damaged, scattering some 100 kilograms of lethal powder on
the road.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred near a reservoir, but test of water
samples taken from the reservoir as precautionary measures showed
no trace of contamination by the fallen chemical.
</P>
<P>
Emergency crews were called to the spot for a massive clean-up
operation, which was completed at 3:57 AM on Friday and the
southbound and northbound lanes of the road section, closed
earlier to traffic for cleaning, had been re-opened, according to
a government statement today.
</P>
<P>
And chemical tests by a government chemist at the scene found
no cyanide compound in the air.
</P>
<P>
There was no question of normal water supply as no draw-off has
been made from the reservoir since October this year, according to
a spokesman for the Water Supplies Department.
</P>
<P>
Sodium cyanide is considered one of the deadliest chemicals.
And only a whiff would kill as the powder dissolves into highly
toxic fume when mixed with water.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong law does not require a special permit for its
transportation although the chemical must be specially packaged
and labeled, according to a Fire Services Department spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Build More Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to build more schools to
meet the needs for an increasing number of students, local
newspaper Va Kio reported today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21 schools have been built in Macao over the past
five years, creating 13,000 vacancies for students. And the
vacancies will increase by 4,000 in the 1997/1998 school year, the
newspaper quoted Luis Viscu, director of the Macao Education and
Youth Department, as saying.
</P>
<P>
These schools, including pre-primary, primary and middle
schools, were the result of joint efforts of the government,
individual institutions, and professionals, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government will appropriate more land for
building more schools.
</P>
<P>
With more schools, the average number of students for a middle
school class remains at 45 despite the 15-percent increase in the
number of middle school students from the previous school year.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has some 95,000 students in its primary and middle
schools, 6 percent more than in 1996. Most of the students are
attending private schools.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The groups of the 98 World Cup Football came out of the hat
of the organization committee Thursday evening in Marseille. The
first round, which will open on June 12, 1998, with Brazil against
Scotland at the Stadium of France in Paris, looks appealing. An
explosive group will have the United States, Iran, Germany and
Yugoslavia. The drawing of lot gave France a comfortable group.
</P>
<P>
-- The international conference on Nazi Gold ended Thursday in
London, with the debates having allowed an advancement of the
humanitarian right. A dozen countries, including the United
States, Croatia, Luxembourg, Austria, Brazil, Argentina and
Poland, have agreed to donate to a fund to compensate the
survivors of Nazi genocide in eastern Europe, while the United
States has decided to host a follow-up conference in mid-1998 in
Washington, which will extend the discussion to the arts objects
robbed by Nazis.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The government and the oppositions exchanged sharp words in
the debate on the new immigration law at the National Assembly
which began on Thursday. Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement accused his predecessor Jean-Louis Debre of trying to
"flatter a part of the electorate" of the extreme-right National
Front (FN), while Debre accused him of "organizing non-respect of
the law." The leader of FN Jean-Marie Le Pen has called for a
referendum on the new nationality law adopted last week by the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
-- Israel could have been cheated by its own spies. At the
heart of its secret service Mossad, a high-ranking officer had
deliberately sent false information to prevent Israel from making
peace with Syria, according to Israeli press reports. In 1996,
Israel was once on the verge of attacking Syria after receiving
disinformation that Syria was massing troops to reconquer the
Golan Heights.

<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today accepted the resignation of embattled Police Director
General Recaredo Sarmiento effective December 15.
</P>
<P>
Ramos announced the resignation of Sarmiento at a hastily
called press conference in the Presidential Palace late this

kidnapping for ransom in the country, particularly in Manila's
Chinatown district.
</P>
<P>
In the resignation letter which he submitted to Ramos Thursday,
Sarmiento said that in the light of "recent developments and
consistent with our time-honored principle and tradition of
command responsibility, I hereby tender my courtesy resignation."

<P>
Taking over Sarmiento's post is Police Director Santiago Alino,
concurrently the chief of the directorial staff of the Philippine
National Police.
</P>
<P>
As Ramos announced the acceptance of Sarmiento's resignation,
two suspected kidnappers were killed in a gun battle in Cubao, the
capital region, at noon today.

<HEADLINE> Trade Unions Urged to Actively Back Reforms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese trade union leader
today called on all trade union officials to emancipate their
minds and help workers abandon old concepts, enhance awareness of
reforms and take an active part in the country's reforms.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dinghua, vice-chairman of the 12th executive committee of
the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), made his remarks
in a work report to the committee's fifth session, which opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
"The goals and tasks for reforms and development set forth
during the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), convened in Beijing in September, has represented the
fundamental interests of the working class," Zhang told more than
200 members of the ACFTU executive committee.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the trade union holds that all reforms
related to the workers' direct interests must comply with economic
laws and the workers' wishes, follow the principles of democratic
decision-making and be standardized in accordance with the laws.
</P>
<P>
"We also believe that to maintain social stability the overall
bearing capacity of the workers must be taken into account and
measures be taken to guarantee the workers' basic living standards
before any major reforms are carried out," he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the 15th CPC National Congress has both
opened new opportunities and posed new challenges for the trade
unions.
</P>
<P>
"The deepening of economic reforms, diversity of the realizing
forms of the public ownership and the stepping-up of reforms in
state-owned enterprises would inevitably lead to more complicated
labor relations and greater pressure on employment," he
explained.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Committee Offers Suggestions on Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A presidential committee on
prevention of suicide has submitted a package of recommendations
to President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the Presidential Secretariat
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The committee, especially set up in March to study the issue of
suicide, has got the president's approval to implement their
recommendations, the secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
The committee suggested that pesticides be restricted from easy
access to people and lethal pesticides be phased out over a period
of ten years.
</P>
<P>
A national center of suicide study will be established to
collect and analyze data related to the issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the committee asked the media to publish positive
and constructive messages which discourage suicide.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has the highest suicide rate in the world, according
to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, a total of 7,700 people committed suicides. Last year,
almost 10,000 Sri Lankans killed themselves due to various
reasons.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed that most people committed suicide because of
unemployment, dropout of school, failure in love affairs, family
problems, housing and drug-addiction.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
finished marginally higher in light trading today as many
investors were treading water ahead of the release of key data in
the U.S. tonight.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index rose 4.7 points to 2557.2, with gains
also held back by a poorer performance in resource stocks.
</P>
<P>
"It's a Friday. There is Christmas coming up which is taking
away some interest. And most of you have some big key numbers
coming out in the U.S. tonight and people don't want to take
strong positions ahead of that," an Ord Minnett analyst said.
</P>
<P>
The vital U.S. payroll data for November was due out tonight
Australian time, providing the latest evidence on economic growth.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was a light 264.46 million shares at a value

overnight.
</P>
<P>
Zinc miner Pasminco was one to suffer, falling 3.8 cents to 1.6
Australian dollars in trade of 7.27 million shares.
</P>
<P>
BHP also fell 12 cents, Rio Tinto and WMC improved by five
cents to 16.80 and 5.00 Australian dollars respectively, while
Woodside Petroleum was 23.1 cents better.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks suffered further as the bullion price fell to
286.85 U.S. dollars late in Sydney, from 290.25 an ounce late
Thursday. The gold index dropped 15.5 points to 866.3.
</P>
<P>
The all industrial index rose 13.9 points to 4374.8.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Drops Again on Gold Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A series of dips to new
four-year lows this week culminated in the Australian dollar
breaching the critical 67 U.S. cents level in offshore trading
today.
</P>
<P>
A sharp fall in the gold price pressured the local currency
down to a close of 67.25 U.S. cents, back from 67.38 late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Overnight, the Australian dollar briefly touched 66.98 U.S.
cents in New York - the lowest point since it reached 66.88 U.S.
cents in December 1993.
</P>
<P>
Macquarie Bank foreign exchange manager Mark O'Leary said a
falling gold price was largely to blame for the currency's
weakness.
</P>
<P>
Gold's slide began Thursday after an announcement that the
Argentine central bank sold 4 million ounces of its gold reserves
in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, gold bullion closed at 286.85 U.S. dollars per fine
ounce, from 290.25 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On the day, dealing in the Australian dollar was choppy.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank chief economist Craig James said the
currency is likely to fall to 66 U.S. cents next week on the back
of continued flows into the U.S. dollar and declining commodity
prices.
</P>
<P>
"For the Australian dollar there is not a lot of upside
potential," James said. "The Asia slowdown, which is expected to
continue into 1998, is another focus."
</P>
<P>
Against the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar closed at 87.34
from 86.99 Thursday. It was at 1.1926 German marks, from 1.1948.

<HEADLINE> Second Generator at Lijiaxia Hydropower Station Goes Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The No. 2 generator at the
Lijiaxia Hydropower Station, the biggest of its kind on the upper
reaches of the Yellow River, successfully went online Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The power station, situated on the junction of Jainca County
and Hualong County in northwestern China's Qinghai Province, is
the third of many power stations scheduled for construction on the
upper reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Five 400,000-kilowatt turbogenerators will be installed, making
it the country' biggest turbogenerator power station. With a
designed annual generation capacity of 5.9 billion kilowatt/hour
of electricity, the power plant will be jointly financed by the
state, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Shaanxi, Gansu and
Qinghai provinces.
</P>
<P>
Workers with Lijiaxia Bureau of China No. 4 Water Resources and
Hydropower Engineering Administration have overcome many
difficulties to complete the infrastructure and installation of
equipment for the No. 2 generator, so that it can begin operation
as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
During the last three decades, China has built five large- and
medium-size hydropower stations on the upper reaches of the Yellow
River, and installed generators totalling more than three million
kilowatts.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Situation in Bangladesh, Serious: Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Some sero-epidemiological surveys
carried out in Bangladesh clearly indicate that an epidemic has
already started in this South Asian country, Weekend Independent
said in its latest issue today.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the magazine said, the country is still a low
prevalence area, but this situation could rapidly change unless
preventive measures are put in place.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, more than 350,000 individuals have been screened
serologically in the country for HIV antibody both by public and
private sources.
</P>
<P>
Till the end of June 1997, a total of 84 HIV positive cases had
been reported.
</P>
<P>
But in the absence of a proper surveillance mechanism, the
magazine pointed out, this number means very little in terms of
assessing the country's actual situation.
</P>
<P>
Both WHO and UNAID reported that the number of HIV infected
persons in Bangladesh is between 20,000 and 100,000. They were
considering the risks and also analyzing the existing information
available on the reported number of cases.
</P>
<P>
In a country where 80 percent deaths occur without any
consultation of a physician, every one should be very careful in
interpreting the HIV/AIDS situation in the country, the magazine
said.
</P>
<P>
Time is of the essence in the combat against the menace of AIDS
epidemic, the magazine warned. "We must act now."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Truth Commission Fails to Lay Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) failed to lay charges against former
state President P W Botha this morning owing to a defective subpoena
served last month, South African Press Association reported..
</P>
<P>
Botha has disobeyed the subpoena to testify before the TRC today
about the activities of the former National Party government's State
Security Council (SSC), which he chaired at the height of the
apartheid conflict.
</P>
<P>
Western Cape Attorney-General Frank Kahn announced after a meeting
with TRC Chairman Desmond Tutu that although the subpoena told Botha
what date and place he had to appear before the commission, it
neglected to mention a time.
</P>
<P>
This made the document legally defective, Kahn told Tutu and his
deputy, Alex Boraine, who walked to Kahn's office from the TRC
headquarters at about 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) to lay charges against Botha
for his failure to appear at today's hearing.
</P>
<P>
Under the founding bill of the TRC, the Promotion of National Unity
and Reconciliation Act, a person faces fines or up to two years of
imprisonment for disobeying a TRC subpoena.
</P>
<P>
To make up, a new subpoena would be issued today, telling Botha
that he has to appear before the TRC on December 19. The new document
would be served on his lawyer, Ernst Penzhorn, as well as at Botha's
home in Wilderness near George in Western Cape province.
</P>
<P>
Botha had already refused on the grounds of bad health to obey a
TRC subpoena to appear in the first round of SSC hearings in
Johannesburg last month.
</P>
<P>
He told an Afrikaans newspaper in mid-November that he would rather
be charged than appear before the TRC. Tutu has repeatedly warned him
of criminal charges after the publication of the interview.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said he was deeply saddened by Botha's stubborn refusal to
appear at the hearing. To accommodate Botha, Tutu announced after
Botha's failure to appear at the Johannesburg hearing that the second
round would be held in George, a city very close to Botha's retirement
home in Wilderness.
</P>
<P>
Later the venue was rearranged in Cape Town after Botha publicly
indicated his refusal.
</P>
<P>
The TRC was set up to heal the wounds of the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said the intention of the hearing is not to humiliate Botha.
Boraine said: "One of the things we have to get clear in this country
is that none of us is above the law."
</P>
<P>
Botha, whose government had vehemently implemented apartheid
policies, refused to apologize for the role of his government and said
that he would not seek amnesty at the TRC, which he said was becoming
a revenge camp against Afrikaners.

Chen Minzhang, minister of health (MOH) said today the medical
workers will be sent according to an agreement signed here today
between MOH and two Japanese organizations for the second phase of
the Sasakawa Medical Fellowship Project.

10-year anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The fellowship was established by the Nippon Foundation of

Health Foundation and Japan-China Medical Association in 1986 to
launch the first phase of the project from 1987-1997.
</P>
<P>
One-thousand fellowship winners from hospitals, medical
academies and research institutions across China were divided into

They made full use of what they learned abroad and became
integral to their work units after returning, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Attending today's meeting were State Councillor Peng Peiyun; Wu
Jieping, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress; He Luli, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Ready to Extend Training to Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia can provide
technical and management training to Ghana in tropical
resource-based industries to prepare for possible future
investments in that area, Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng
Yaik said here today.
</P>
<P>
Though there is a slowdown in Malaysian investment overseas
now, Malaysia could provide technical cooperation to Ghana in the
industry when the economic situation improved, he told reporters
after calling on Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings who arrived
here Thursday on a two-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
Lim said, "If things come back to normal, we can prepare
through our technical cooperation program to train researchers and
managers in the various resource-based industries that they
(Ghana) would want."
</P>
<P>
He said Rawlings, in their hour-long meeting, had invited the
Malaysian private sector to invest in developing Ghana's
resource-based industries.
</P>
<P>
Lim said Malaysia and Ghana could form part of a consortium for
ventures in tropical resource-based industries such as timber,
cocoa, rubber and palm oil where Malaysia could provide the
expertise and Ghana, the land and human resources.
</P>
<P>
A third country could then provide the market and finances for
any given project, he said, adding with the tripartite concept,
countries like France, China and Egypt, by serving as a third
country, would not only help in developing the economies of
developing countries but also in absorbing the products produced
in these countries.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian president, leading a 13-member delegation
including Foreign Minister J. V. Gbeho and Deputy Trade and
Industry Minister Dan Abodakpi, is scheduled to hold talks with
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad Saturday in Langkawi, a
resort island in northern Malaysia, where Mahathir is busy with
the ongoing Fourth Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace
(LIMA) Exhibition.

The 1,200-meter dike, designed by the Dutch, was built in 1908
during the Qing Dynasty. The dike has played an indispensible role
throughout this century in controlling shipping activities at the
Yangtze estuary to the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
However, the dike was in critical need of repair due to damage
resulting from years of silting. Some 30 million yuan has been
spent since April this year to strengthen the dike and protect the

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Growth for 1998 Revised to 4-5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim today revised downwards Malaysia's
projected growth for 1998 to between four and five percent from
the seven percent forecast in the 1998 Budget on October 17.
</P>
<P>
The lower GDP growth of between four and five percent is still
strong compared with the rest of the region and especially in view
of the availability of employment opportunities, Anwar, who is
also finance minister, said when announcing major measures at a
media conference here, which are expected to build up confidence
and credibility in the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the estimated growth for this year has also been
lowered to 7.5-7.7 percent from the earlier forecast 8.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Anwar also announced an 18 percent cut in 1998 government
expenditure as part of belt tightening measures to keep inflation
in check.
</P>
<P>
He said the current account deficit for 1998 was now projected
to fall to 3.0 percent of Gross National Product (GNP) from the
4.0 percent announced in the 1998 Budget.
</P>
<P>
He said that in efforts to reverse the persistent current
account deficit, lumpy imports of aircraft by Malaysia Airlines
and vessels by Malaysian International Shipping Corporation, which
significantly contribute to the nation's current account deficit,
would be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
Applications for new public listings, rights issues and
restructuring proposals would be frozen unless absolutely
necessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said banks had been advised to be careful when making margin
calls and bailouts of borrowers would be only justifiable if they
were suffering from temporary cash flow problems.
</P>
<P>
Anwar also dismissed market talk that there were plans for the
imposition of unilateral controls on currency trading.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that proposed Malaysian reverse investments, which
amounted to 7 billion ringgit (about 1.8918 billion U.S. dollars)
during the first half of 1997, would have to be deferred even if
these investmemts were to be financed through foreign borrowings.
</P>
<P>
However, investments which have significant linkages with the
domestic economy and which earn foreign exchange would continue to
be allowed, he announced.
</P>
<P>
According to the finance minister, Malaysia's current reserves
amount to 61.7 billion ringgit (about 16.6756 billion U.S.
dollars), sufficient to finance 3.7 months of retained imports.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's announcements had an immediate impact on the stock
market where the composite index (CI), which had slipped into
negative territory during the afternoon session, reversed itself
shortly after 4 p.m. today as details of the measures hit the
market.
</P>
<P>
The market barometer CI shot above the psychological 600-point
level to end the day at 607.40 points, up 31.51 points or 5.46
percent, while on the exchange market, the local currency -- the
ringgit clawed back from a new low of 3.8650 earlier in the day to
end at 3.6950 to the U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Joint Venture to Produce Lubricants in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Fuchs-GHL Lubricants Ltd., a
joint venture between Grease house Ltd. of Bangladesh and Balmer
Lawrie-Fuchs Ltd. of India, will start producing a wide range of
lubricants from next February to cater to local needs, a local
newspaper reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The two companies entered into a technical know-how agreement
in Dhaka Thursday, The Daily Star said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, lubricants for both common household and
industrial use would be gradually produced and introduced in the
Bangladeshi market, and imported base oil will be used as the main
raw material for these types of lubricants.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the high-end environment friendly bio-degradable
lubricants of the world famous "Fuchs" brand will be introduced.
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous potential of growth in the lubricant
market of Bangladesh," the newspaper quoted Dr. Manfred Fuchs, the
Fuchs Group chairman, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have come to invest in Bangladesh because the Asia-Pacific
part of the world consumes one third of lubricants produced
worldwide," Dr. Fuchs said. "This market is rapidly growing."
</P>
<P>
The total investment of joint venture, which is to be set up in
Bangladesh's second largest city of Chittagong, will be about 40
million taka (about 0.89 million U.S. dollars). The joint venture
will be capable of producing 10,000 tons of lubricants, which is
one fifth of the Bangladesh' annual demand.

COLOMBO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan People's

<HEADLINE> Israeli Treasury Cuts off Talks with Strikers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Treasury has broken
off talks with the Trade Union aimed at ending a crippling
nationwide strike, which entered its third day today, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Treasury made the decision Thursday night on
the instructions of Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein, who said
there would be no negotiations with workers who were in contempt
of court.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein's orders came after the Trade Union, defying
back-to-work orders issued Wednesday and an appeal from Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said it would continue the strike by
700,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
The State Attorney's office said that it would go back to the
National Labor Court today to get new back-to-work orders for the
strikers.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which was launched Wednesday in protest against
government plans for wages reform and privatization, has
paralyzed the country by effectively shutting down airports,
seaports, banks, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, government offices
and state-owned industries.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu called on the strikers to return to work, saying that
the strike gives the Israeli economy a bad name and harms
millions of citizens.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Manufacturers Association estimated the strike's daily
cost at 53 million shekels (about 15 million U.S. dollars). The
association head Dan Propper warned that if the strike
continued, foreign investors could be affected.
</P>
<P>
The strike was triggered by the words of Finance Minister
Ya'acov Neeman Monday, describing the striking workers as
"exploding bombs" and enemies from within.
</P>
<P>
In response to the assault, Trade Union Chairman Amir Peretz
declared the strike Tuesday night at an emergency gathering of
thousands of union members in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The strike is the latest round in the Trade Union's battle
against government's economic reform plans, which have sparked
fears that workers' rights would be harmed.

<HEADLINE> 3 More Luxor Attackers in Egypt Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Three of the six militants who
carried out the massive killings of foreign tourists last month
were college students in their early 20s from southern Egypt,
local English newspaper the Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The three were found to be Assiut University students Esmat
Erian, at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Mahmoud Mohamed
Abdul Karim, at the Faculty of Medicine, and Sayed Dessouki, a
student of the Higher Institute for Cooperatives and Agricultural
Guidance.
</P>
<P>
Assiut, 350 kilometers south of Cairo, is a stronghold of
Islamic militants who have been fighting a violent war against
Egypt's secular government since 1992 in a bid to install a
strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
The three young men were all from a village near Luxor, the
largest tourist city in southern Egypt, where they shot dead 58
foreign tourists and four Egyptians on November 17. Most of the
50,000 people in their hometown depend on tourism for a living,
said the Arabic newspaper Al Gomhuria today.
</P>
<P>
Their identities were revealed as Interior Minister Habib Al
Adly made a report on the ongoing investigations into the
massacre at a meeting between several cabinet ministers and the
ambassadors of 14 countries accredited to Cairo on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, Britain and Japan are the countries that have
lost the largest number of its citizens in the terrorist attack
in Luxor, about 500 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The six assailants, belonging to the Gamaa Islamiya, or the
Islamic Group, that claimed responsibility for the slayings, were
gunned down by police after the killings.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Wednesday, the Islamic Group said the six young
members acted independently and carried out the slayings without
orders from its leaders.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the attack, the Interior Ministry had identified
one of the assailants as Medhat Abdul Rahman Hussein, a known
militant, also from southern Egypt where Islamic militants have
been active.
</P>
<P>
The authorities gave no explanation to the delay in
identifying the attackers, but local press said this could be
because the militants had clean police records.

<HEADLINE> China to Vaccinate More Children Against Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Health
will vaccinate 60 million children four years old and younger this
month and next to prevent communicable polio.
</P>
<P>
Children in 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
as well as children in transient families will be given oral polio
vaccines on Dec. 5 and Jan. 5, according to an official with the
Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
The program will focus on children who have been given polio
vaccines less than three times after birth, especially those in
border and poverty-stricken areas, and those from the transient
population, he said.
</P>
<P>
This will be the fifth time China has launched a program
designed to stop the spread of the polio virus. Previous programs
have helped reduce the incidence of the disease.
</P>
<P>
China's long border with many countries in which polio is
widespread makes it difficult for he vaccination program to cover
all the remote areas, according to health officials. Because of
this and other factors, the polio vaccination rate of children is
declining in some areas, a major obstacle for the program in the
elimination of polio.
</P>
<P>
B. Melgard, director of the World Health Organization's
Expanding Immunization Program, delegates from other international
organizations have gone to Jilin, Xinjiang, Guangdong and Yunnan
provinces for vaccinations there. They will advise Chinese
officials on the elimination of polio.
</P>
<P>
No cases of polio have been reported for 13 years in Beijing,
where the vaccination program is carried out systematically, said
Guan Baoying, head of the epidemic prevention department of the
Beijing Municipal Health Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will provide 400,000 vaccines and set up 3,000
stations to vaccinate 120,000 children 4 and below, 80 percent of
whom are from transient families, she said.

KAMPALA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has

Dollars) for a free education program to pupils in Uganda this

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Rises in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The weaker peso and higher
interest rates pushed the Philippines' inflation rate to 6. 5
percent in November, the highest since January this year, the
National Statistics Office (NSO) said today.
</P>
<P>
The latest inflation level was considerably higher than 5.7
percent for October this year and 4.5 percent for November last
year, but was very close to a forecast of 6.45 percent by local
economists.
</P>
<P>
In November, all commodity groups registered higher inflation
rates compared with October except for clothing whose inflation
rate went down to 4.2 percent from 4.3 percent, the NSO said in a
report.
</P>
<P>
The major factor contributing to the rise in inflation rate was
a sharp increase in the rate for food, beverages and tobacco,
which rose to 3.6 percent from 2.4 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
By region, the inflation rate for the capital area of Metro
Manila remained the highest at 7 percent, unchanged compared with
October.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate has been on the rise since August as a result of
the weaker Philippine peso and higher interest rates accompanying
the volatile currency.
</P>
<P>
The peso, a victim of the regional financial crisis, has fallen
nearly 33 percent against the U.S. dollar since its de facto
devaluation in July.
</P>
<P>
Despite the continuing rise in inflation rate, government
economic managers are optimistic that its inflation target of 6 to
7 percent for the year is well within reach.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for the past ten months this year stood at a
low of 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government has resisted strong calls from many militant
labor unions for a hike of the country's minimum daily wage and
banned price hikes of basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
But economists predict a surging inflation rate for 1998 due to
the continuing effects of higher interest rates and the weak peso,
and a drought caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> Protection of Water Resources in Qilian Mountains of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- More trees will be planted in
northwest China's Qilian Mountains in order to conserve dwindling
water resources, according to sources from the Qilian Mountains
Protection Zone.
</P>
<P>
Zone Director Xu Mingsu said that trees will be planted on
266,000 hectares of mountain sploes in the next 12 years to
increase the forest coverage in the area from the current 438,000
ha. to over 584,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Forests in the Qilian Mountains are home to numerous species of
flora and fauna, and are an important source of water for over
667,000 hectares of farmland, as well as for over four million
residents and hundreds of industrial and mining enterprises in the
the Hexi Corridor, Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Deterioration of the local natural ecological environment,
resulting from various factors such as climate changes, have caused
the forest coverage rate to fall from 22 percent in the early
1950s to only 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government established a state-level natural reserve
in the area in 1988, and has since invested over 6 million yuan
(750,000 US dollars) to build nature and forest protection stations
and research centers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the provincial government has introduced
regulations to strengthen protection efforts in the Qilian
Mountain Nature Reserve.

various government departments" as well as strengthen its policy
research and analysis, he added.
</P>
<P>
Malawi, Malta and Uganda and two international institutions --
the International Center for Research in Agro-Forestry and the

<P>
TAIYUAN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A development project for
poverty relief funded by the World Bank has yielded enormous
economic, ecological and social benefits in Luliang, north China's
Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The project in Luliang, one of China's 18 most poverty-stricken
regions, is being carried out in seven counties and districts with
a total population of 1.13 million people, or some 33 percent of
the total population in the region.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has budgeted total funding of 27.12 million US
dollars for the project, with 24.19 million US dollars allocated
by the end of June, 1996. Local farmers have contributed
investments of some 29.89 million yuan (3.6 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the project, which is designed to improve the
local ecology, has had a positive impact, with Fangshan County
witnessing record per-capita grain and edible oil outputs in
1996. The project has also helped control erosion in the
region.

ANKARA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has announced that it
will not sign the Canada-proposed landmine ban treaty on grounds
of concerns of defending state security, local newspaper Daily
News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted senior officers from Turkish General Staff,
who declined to be named, as saying that Turkey is still faced
with frequent attacks from rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
"Although we respect the reasons for that treaty, we have to
take measures to ensure our border security," they said.
</P>
<P>
However, the officers said that Turkey will not export
landmines in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Officials from most nations of the world recently gathered in
Ottawa, Canada to sign the historic treaty that seeks to ban the
use of anti-personnel landmines across the globe.

Some countries, such as the United States, Russia as well as
some Middle East countries, refused to put signatures on the
Ottawa treaty.
</P>

BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province plans to set up 52 wastewater treatment plants with an
overall daily treatment capacity of 5.8 million tons before 2005.

The province has rapidly increased the emission of urban

Urban sewage accounted for 60 percent of the province's total
wastewater emission in 1996, becoming a major pollution source for

<HEADLINE> Weakening Baht May Not Lead to Export Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The loss of value of the Thai
currency, the baht, against the U.S. dollar may not increase as
much competitive edge for Thai exports as expected by some
economists and government officials, a local newspaper report said
today.
</P>
<P>
While the Thai baht has depreciated by about 60 percent against
the dollar since its floating on July 2, currencies of Thailand's
neighbors have also followed suit, blunting the much-hoped-for
increase in competitive edge of Thai exports, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The currencies of Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines have
all fallen by a range of between 30 and 40 percent since July.
</P>
<P>
Although the Thai baht has depreciated more than the currencies
of Thailand's major trade competitors in Southeast Asia, the
difference will eventually narrow down, the report quoted Viroj
Amatakulchai, chairman of the Federation of Thai Textile
Industries, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Thai exports are likely to gain a competitive price
advantage only against Chinese exports, as a result of a strong
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Thai exports in September totaled 171 billion baht (4.28
billion dollars), up 52 percent compared with the same month last
year. But when the depreciation of the baht is taken into account,
the actual increase is substantially lower, Viroj said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the currency crisis among ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) members will also cause Thai exports to
the region to drop, as a result of their weakening currencies.
</P>
<P>
Viroj urged the government to take measures quickly to boost
the country's productivity and competitiveness and cut production
costs so as to retain and expand Thailand's share in the world
market.

MANILA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today asked the Senate to ratify an agreement on the application
of safeguards on nuclear energy use in connection with the treaty
on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The protocol to the agreement was signed by the Philippines and

In a letter to Senate President Ernesto Maceda, Ramos said he
hoped the agreement would be quickly passed to address the need
for safeguards on nuclear energy use so as not to hamper the
economic and technological development of the Philippines or
international cooperation in peaceful use of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for safeguards that would respect the
health, safety, physical protection and other security provisions
to protect the rights of individuals.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Fighting Kills 50 in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Intense fighting between
government troops and rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) killed more than 30 troops and at least 26 rebel
guerrillas in the north Thursday, a local radio station reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Yes FM Radio Station said the troops suffered heavy loss of
lives when they tried to capture a rebel base in the Northern
jungles.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation began in the morning and lasted late into the
night.
</P>
<P>
Some soldiers were missing in action. The injured were admitted
to hospitals in Colombo and Anuradhapura, capital of the Northern
Central Province.
</P>
<P>
The troops are engaged in the final phase of Operation
Jayasikuru (Certain Victory) to open a land route running to the
north through rebel-controlled territories.
</P>
<P>
The government is keen to clear the highway to ensure a supply
route to the north both for military supplies and essentials for
the civilians.
</P>
<P>
For a long time supplies have been transported by air and sea,
too costly to the government.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting against the government for
a separate state in the north and east of the country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hosts Environmental Protection Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The China Intl. Environmental
Protection Exhibition opened today in the Beijing Exhibition
Center.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the exhibition, jointly sponsored by the State
Bureau of Environmental Protection (SBEP) and the Chinese
Association of Environmental Protection Industry, is to promote
the development of China's environmental industry by expanding
exchanges and cooperation with other countries.
</P>
<P>
SBEP Director Xie Zhenhua said that China will persist in its
sustainable development strategy, and allocates a total of 450
billion yuan (56 billion US dollars) for pollution control during
the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
"China has a vast potential market for environmental protection
equipment and technology, " said Xie, who also expressed hope that
more overseas businessmen will enter the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The five-day exhibition will feature technology and equipment
related to pollution control, clean production, recycling
resources, ecological protection and environmental monitoring.
</P>
<P>
More than 280 manufacturers from China's provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions, as well as representatives
from a number of ministries, are attending the exhibition which
has also attracted 54 companies from 14 countries, including the
United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The China-Europe Environmental Symposium being held in
conjunction with the exhibition will feature 11 lectures and 14
technology fairs.
</P>
<P>
Sources note that the exhibition will be held once every two
years.
</P>
<P>
Small firms account for some 80 percent of 7,500 companies in
China's environmental protection industry which has an annual
output of some 30 billion yuan (3.7 billion dollars).

CHENGDU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Liangshan Yi Nationality
Prefecture provides tourists with an opportunity to view aspects
of the former notorious slave system and China's space industry,
which features the cream of modern technology, in a single day.
</P>
<P>
Slavery prevailed in Liangshan, in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, until the 1950s, and the prefecture is currently
attempting to take full advantage of its unique resources to
attract tourists.
</P>
<P>
Attractions include a local slavery museum, primitive forests,
high mountains and beautiful lakes, as well as the Xichang

open to visitors.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 alone, the center hosted over 70,000 visitors curious
about China's fledgling space industry, with related earnings
standing at 5.38 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The local government is extending great effort to develop the
local tourism industry and plans to transform same into an
industrial pillar.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 90,000 College Graduates to Choose Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- In China, the state used to pay
college fees for students and assign them to jobs after
graduation. But this is changing.
</P>
<P>
Under new state guidelines, 90,000 students who are expected to
graduate from college next year will make their own decisions in
choosing jobs.
</P>
<P>
These graduates, 10 percent of the class of '98, will be the
first since China adopted the "pay-to-learn" reform of the
educational system in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission (SEC) chose 46 colleges and
universities to execute a pilot program in 1994. The reform was
extended to 660 schools last year, and to all colleges and
universities this year.
</P>
<P>
The reform's goal is to establish a system where students pay
some college fees and are allowed to choose their own jobs upon
graduation.
</P>
<P>
However, scholarships are being offered for graduates who fill
specific needs around the country.
</P>
<P>
An SEC official said the reform ensures that the enrollment
system will be a "fair competition" for every student.
</P>
<P>
Choosing their own jobs has become a trend for graduates in
China. By 1999, 50 percent of college graduates in Beijing will
decide what kind of job they take, according to an official from
Beijing Municipal Education Committee. By 2001, all graduate
students in the country will choose their own jobs.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Shiite Leader Survives Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Leader of Lebanese Higher
Islamic Shiite Council Sheikh Mohammed Shamseddine Thursday night
survived an assassination when he was praying inside the Imam Ali
mosque here, local newspaper the Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The council's press attache Mohammed Amin told the paper that
two gunmen with pistols with silencers entered the mosque's
courtyard and fired several shots after one of the cleric's
bodyguards, Bassem Shamseddine, noticed activity in nearby trees.
</P>
<P>
"The bodyguard was slightly wounded in the forehead but the
gunmen escaped and, the Sheikh was quickly escorted out of the
mosque," Amin said.
</P>
<P>
Amin refused to speculate on the motives behind the attack,
saying the council wouldn't issue a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Our responsibility is to explain the details of the incident
but we will not comment further," he said.
</P>
<P>
State prosecutor Adnan Addoum said that he had immediately
dispatched Beirut public prosecutor Abdullah Bitar and a team
from the central criminal evidence department to investigate the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and a host of officials
later contacted Shamseddine to express their relief that he had
been unharmed in the incident.

<HEADLINE> 15 Candidates Cleared in Kenya's Presidency Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 15 candidates have
been cleared to run for the presidency in Kenya's December 29
elections, the most crowded presidential race since the country
declared independence in early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, 74 and in power
for 19 years, is widely expected to win the campaign with
five-year more tenure largely due to the division of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Moi is the sole candidate of the ruling Kenya African National
Union (KANU) party.
</P>
<P>
His powerful rivals include Mwai Kibaki of Democratic Party of
Kenya, Wamalwa Kijana of FORD-Kenya, Raila Odinga of National
Development Party of Kenya, Charity Ngilu of Social Democratic
Party and Martin Shikuku of FORD-Asili.
</P>
<P>
Ngilu, and Wangari Maathai from Liberal Party of Kenya are the
first women ever to vie for the highest political office in the
eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Oludhe's Economic Independence Party, established 11
days ago, is the youngest party in the race, while the
37-year-old KANU the oldest.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates are Munyua Waiyaki of United Patriotic Party
of Kenya, George Anyona of Kenya Social Congress, Kimani wa
Nyoike of FORD-People, Koigi Wamwere of Kenda, David Ng'ethe of
Umma Patriotic Party of Kenya, Godfrey M'Mwireria of Green
African Party and Katama Mkangi of Kenya National Congress.
</P>
<P>
A presidential aspirant can be qualified as he/she gets the
mandatory 1,000 signatures of supporters. But to be a legal
Kenyan president, it takes no less than 25 percent votes in five
out of the country's eight provinces.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll, released by Kenya Institute of Education and
Democracy Thursday when the two-day presidential nominations
ended, predicted that Moi will garner 41 percent of the total
votes cast.
</P>
<P>
He will be followed by Kibaki and Ngilu with 14 and 13 percent
of votes respectively, according to the poll, which was carried
out in 42 constituencies over the weekend with more than 3,000
Kenyans interviewed.
</P>
<P>
Voting will be carried out along ethnic lines with most of the
opposition candidates only obtaining the 25 percent majority in
their home provinces, said the poll.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Advertising to Be Banned in EU (updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 5 (Xinhua) -- After 10 hours of heated
debate, European Union health ministers finally agreed late on
Thursday that all tobacco advertising has to phase out within six
years in the union.
</P>
<P>
Billboard advertising has to end within three years while
advertising via the mass media within four years, diplomatic
sources quoted the ministers' agreement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Plans to agree a EU-wide ban on direct and indirect tobacco
advertising and sponsorship had been thrown into disarray earlier
in the day when Spain, a long-time supporter of the ban, said it
could not support the move.
</P>
<P>
Only eight ministers favored the ban while Britain asked for a
10-year exemption for its Formula One motor racing.
</P>
<P>
Germany, Greece, Austria and Denmark had lined up either to
oppose the ban or withhold support for it while Finland, France,
Portugal and Italy already have banned tobacco advertising.
</P>
<P>
EU health commissioner Padraig Flynn had warned that he might
withdraw the commission directive proposing the ban if a deal
could not be reached at Thursday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The commission proposal was made in 1989 and it had been
discussed on 10 occasions by the EU health ministers without
reaching a common position.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed directive, EU member states will be able to
continue existing sponsorship of world-level events for a period
to be defined.
</P>
<P>
But sponsorship money have to decrease, as will the visibility
of tobacco advertising at these events.
</P>
<P>
The EU health ministers also agreed on a grace period of two
years for organizers of common events and a grace period of three
years for those of world-level events, such as the Formula One
motor racing and art events, according to diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Flynn had indicated that he would have accepted a
seven-year gap between the directive's full implementation and the
exemption being withdrawn.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Slower Growth Expected, but "Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The Southeast Asian financial
crisis in 1997 has created a lot of uncertainty for the economic
future of Asia, but the "Asian economic miracle" is not over, as
the region could still achieve steady, though slower, growth in
the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
As the fastest-growing region in the world, Asia has always
been the source of global economic growth during the past decades.
Its economic success has been "a miracle" in the eyes of
businessmen, investors and economists.
</P>
<P>
But, in early July, a financial crisis in Thailand spread
quickly to the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, all
"economic tigers" in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Within months, currencies of these countries have depreciated
between 10 and 35 percent, and stock markets dropped to their
lowest in years.
</P>
<P>
The effects of the fallout have been felt not only in Southeast
Asia, but also in other parts of Asia. South Korea is experiencing
its worst market turbulence, while Japan has also been dragged
into the trouble.
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the crisis, people began to wonder if the
"Asian miracle" is over. Some people even predicted a possible
recession in Asia.
</P>
<P>
But most economists believe that the "Asian miracle" may be
battered, but is not over.
</P>
<P>
They admit that the depth and severity of the economic slowdown
in Southeast Asia and the effects of the currency crisis on the
rest of the region are difficult to predict at the present stage.
</P>
<P>
However, Asia still has potential for steady growth in 1997 and
1998 because its economic fundamentals remain solid, they argued.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, Southeast Asian countries, except Singapore, have
been severely hit by the crisis. The impact of the crisis -- weak
currency exchange rates, higher interest rates, increasing
non-performing loans and foreign debts -- will start to bite the
economies of Southeast Asian countries in the last quarter of this
year and the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In its latest forecast, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said
that despite the measures taken by governments to improve their
fiscal positions, the economic growth in Southeast Asia will
decelerate from 7.4 percent last year to between 4.9 percent and
5.7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The growth is expected to range between 5.2 and 6.3 percent in
1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
Some economists painted an even darker picture for Southeast
Asia, predicting that the sub-region will grow at an average
annual rate of 4 percent over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Due to price hikes as a result of the crisis, inflation rate in
Southeast Asia is estimated to rise from 6.6 percent in 1996 to 9
percent in 1997, and to 11.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the financial turmoil in Southeast Asia, the
growing pace of other parts of Asia will also slow down. ADB
economists estimated that developing Asian economies will grow
between 6.1 percent on the lower side and 7 percent on the upper
side this year.
</P>
<P>
With the effects of the Southeast Asian crisis unfolding, the
Asian economy would grow between 5.3 percent and 6.2 percent in
1998, much lower than this year's, they said.
</P>
<P>
Also because of the crisis, Asia's inflation for 1997 has been
estimated at 7.8 percent, 4.7 percent higher than last year's.
</P>
<P>
However, the lower growth rates projected for this year and
next do not necessarily mean that the "Asian miracle" is over.
</P>
<P>
Some economic analysts cited the strong economic momentum in
China, the faster pace in South Asia, and export opportunities
created by currency devaluation in Southeast Asia as major factors
for the continuation of the miracle.
</P>
<P>
They said that Asia is projected to remain the fastest growing
region in the world, led by the growth of the Chinese economy,
which should be sustained in the 9 percent to 10 percent range
this year and next.
</P>
<P>
In addition, relatively solid growth is projected to continue
in India, where a reform process underway since 1992 has already
produced notable results, maintaining annual growth at about 7
percent since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The economic situation in the rest of South Asia is also
encouraging. Despite various bottlenecks, between 1994 and 1996,
their overall gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate was 6.5
percent, which represents an acceleration of the trend in the
past.
</P>
<P>
The estimated GDP growth rate for 1997 is 6.2 percent, but with
further implementation of different reform packages and
improvements in infrastructure, economies of South Asian countries
are forecast to grow on average at 6.5 percent in 1998 and 7
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The strong growth tendency both in China and South Asia will
certainly contribute to the growing momentum in the Asian region,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, there are signs of export recovery in Asia which would
also stimulate the economic growth in the region in the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a lower demand in the world electronics market and
appreciation of Southeast Asian currencies, which were pegged to
the U.S. dollar, resulted in sharp declines of Asia's exports.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the situation has changed this year with the
recovery of the electronics market and depreciation of Southeast
Asian currencies, which has made Southeast Asian products more
competitive in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Although uncertainty remains for Asia's economic future,
economists believe that the "Asian miracle" is not over.

<HEADLINE> Science and Technology Promote Grain Production in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Science and technology
applications have directly contributed to 43 percent of the total
grain production in northeast China, seven percentage points
higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Jilin provinces, a region known as
north China's granary, have adopted techniques such as
intercropping maize and wheat, and using special fertilizer
applications. The method has helped to increase grain yields on
many fields by as much as 15 tons per hectare.
</P>
<P>
It took Heilongjiang 17 years to push its annual grain
output by five billion kilograms from the figure 40 years
ago. However, the province recorded annual grain production
increases of five billion kg on two occassions during the 1990s,
with said increases achieved within two and four year
periods. Science and technology played a key role in the
achievement, according to local government officials.
</P>
<P>
The three provinces have also increased efforts to promote the
use of practical agricultural techniques. Heilongjiang has
established two agrobiology promotion stations serving more than
1,300 townships. The stations have trained some 21,600
agricultural technicians for 15,000 villages, with 30,000
households serving as role models in the use of science and
technology.

KUALA LUMPUR, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today launched
its Blueprint for the Development of the Aerospace Industry in a
bid to make it one that will be "globally-competitive and widely
acknowledged".
</P>
<P>
Launching the blueprint in northern Malaysia's resort island
Langkawi where the Fourth Langkawi International Maritime and
Aerospace (LIMA) Exhibition is held, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad also announced the formation of a high-level
committee led by himself and the upgrading of the Department of
the Civil Aviation (DCA) to strengthen the industry, according to
official reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysian Agency for Space Administration (MASA)
would also be formed to spur Malaysia's entry into the space
sector.
</P>
<P>
He said MASA would ensure the efficient management of the
country's space venture which included the development of a
national satellite program where it could help develop the
industrial and technology capability in this area.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir stressed that the aerospace industry could not afford
to be too divergent and fragmented, saying it was imperative that
the industry should adopt the national vision as its main thrust
and approach the aerospace development task on a consolidated
basis.
</P>
<P>
"This will provide a nationally consistent framework for
identifying and evaluating key initiatives to be developed," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that for a start, the blueprint, which was completed
last year and endorsed by the Cabinet last September, recommended
the establishment of a national level Steering Committee to
oversee the development of the aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
This committee in the form of a national aerospace council
would make key decisions in the areas of directions, priorities
and strategies for the industry, and the council would adopt the
"Smart Partnership" principles with the participation of leaders
from both the public and private sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the council, the government also supported the
idea of a national aerospace coordinating body to act as a
reference point for the various aerospace activities and
investments and the new body will consolidate the current national
initiatives in the aerospace sector and further spearhead
Malaysia's involvement in the industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that taking into account the industry expansion
into new and unexplored territory of aerospace activities, the
existing DCA would have to be upgraded while the proposed Civil
Aviation Authority would provide the industry with a monitoring
as well as regulatory function in the areas of air worthiness, air
traffic control and aerospace products and services.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that a National Human Resource Development
Program would be put in place to ensure adequate and competitive
skills and costs of personnel, saying that it would take into
account the various categories of labor required in the aerospace
industry such as toolmakers, aircraft engineers, test pilots and
systems analysts.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia also hopes to establish a premier educational
center for aerospace which will serve the domestic as well as the
regional need for education and training.
</P>
<P>
"The aerospace industry provides a gateway to technological
acquisition and therefore it is essential that these technologies
acquired through procurement and offset would help the nation to
gain access to a foreign market and fully realize our national
competitive advantage," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the successful implementation of the key programs, Mahathir
said, the industry must be equally supported by policies which are
both rational and enhancing.
</P>
<P>
"A national procurement policy which emphasizes local products
and services and technology will ensure a sustainable economic
development and reduce import and financial outflow," he said.
</P>
<P>
This policy is important in the procurement of military
equipment, privatization projects and offset programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the focus of the recommendations in the blueprint
was on the government because it set the legislative framework and
policy. "However, the success of the industry will be a
responsibility that goes much farther than the government. Action
and participation are required of all the stakeholders," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A museum has been opened to
the public here recently to display historical relics in ancient
Nanjing, now the capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing, known as Jinling in ancient times, was the
capital of six dynasties or kingdoms, namely, the Wu Kingdom
(222-280), the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420), the Song, Qi, Liang
and Chen kingdoms of the Southern Dynasties (420-589). It was also
the center of science, technology, culture and art in Asia. So it
has a lot of historical relics.
</P>
<P>
The museum, which covers 1,000 sq.m., features 300
pieces of precious historical relics unearthed in and near the
city over the past 50 years. Pottery and porcelain items on
exhibit are highly valuable for archeological and historical
studies.
</P>
<P>
Foreign glass products and diamond rings on display prove that
international trade between the east and the west prospered during
the period.
</P>
<P>
The museum is equipped with a computer system, which provides
visitors with abundant information about historical events and
sites, noted figures, documents and relics in the period.

<HEADLINE> EU Bans Tobacco Ads, Sports Sponsoring by Cigarette Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, Belgium, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union
(EU) has voted on Thursday here to ban most tobacco advertising
within four years and given cigarette makers until October 2006 to
end their sponsorship of major sports and cultural events .
</P>
<P>
That means those events such as, Formular One car racing,
tennis tournaments and yacht races can have nine more seasons with
financial support from tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
Until last month, Britain had long opposed an advertising and
sponsoring ban, at last agreed to give a temporary exemption for
Formula One racing. The sport provides 50,000 jobs in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the popular Formula One races, which gets about
200 million U.S. dollars from the tobacco industry, said in
advance of the EU meeting that a tobacco ban would force them to
withdraw many if not all of the 10 European Grand Prix races from
Europe and go to Asia instead.

<HEADLINE> Trees Now Cover Once Barren County in Northwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- On the vast, barren Loess
Plateau of northwestern China, Jingchuan County stands out like a
"kingdom of forest."
</P>
<P>
Poplar, pine and Chinese scholar trees grow well along county
roads in eastern Gansu Province. The forest cover in Jingchuan
County has increased to 34.9 percent. Four decades ago, it was
just 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The county used to suffer soil erosion over 98.6 percent of its
territory. More than 2,480 ravines have been formed because of the
Jinghe River.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, local farmers have been organized to grow
trees in the spring, build terraced fields in the summer, and
control small drainage areas in autumn.
</P>
<P>
Growing grass, planting trees and constructing terraced fields
are considered necessary work to protect the land for younger
generations.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have leveled farmland, built terraced fields along the
slopes of ravines and planted trees around fields to conserve
water.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts have paid off. Land that could not retain water,
soil or fertilizer has been converted to high-yield grain fields.
</P>
<P>
So far, 82.4 percent of the region's soil erosion has been
arrested, setting off a positive ecological cycle. Rural
residents no longer starve, and many households have been able to
store surplus grain for future needs.
</P>
<P>
Artificially grown dense forests not only prevent soil erosion,
but also provide local farmers with plenty of fuel, fodder for
livestocks and material for building houses. Felling trees is
controlled to protect the region's eco-system.
</P>
<P>
County authorities have combined water conservation with
industrialized farming in recent years to help farmers rise above
the poverty line and even prosper.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the Ministry of Water Resources chose Jingchuan as one
of the counties to experiment with a combination of soil erosion
control and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers have been developing major businesses such as
growing forests and fruit trees, and turning previously low-yield
farmland and terraced fields into money-making ventures.
</P>
<P>
Guanshan Forest Farm, which used to be treeless, is now called
the "forest park" of the Loess Plateau, where wolves and leopards
have begun to roam again. More than 90 percent of the county's
farmland now is protected by trees.
</P>
<P>
A German expert on an inspection tour said naturally occurring
forests would be unlikely here, but trees now cover the Loess
Plateau because of the farmers' efforts.

TAIYUAN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists recently
discovered relics of an ancient ethnic group in Yuanqu County in
north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The ancient town of Yuanqu, on the northern bank of the Yellow
River, was a battlefield between the Han people and the Gaoluoshi
people, an ethnic group in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-256 B.C.)
</P>
<P>
Archeologists excavated an ancient tomb near the west gate of
the Yuanqu county seat, and discovered that the earthenware
unearthed in the tomb differed greatly from the items of the same
period found in the tombs of the Han people.
</P>
<P>
The different designs, colors and decorations on the relics
showed that the person interred in the tomb was not a member of
the local Han community, according to archeologists.
</P>
<P>
They said the county was most likely inhabited by members of the
Gaoluoshi ethnic group which historical books refer to as the "Chidi".
</P>
<P>
Archeologists studying the relics believe the items will
provide valuable clues to relations between the ethnic groups and the
Han in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty.

</P>
<P>
The agency quoted witnesses as saying that the workers
scampered away for safety, leaving no one to help put out the
fire, which soon spread throughout the ship.
</P>
<P>
A tugboat belonging to Carlos Gothong Shipping Lines and two
Coast Guard patrol craft battled the fire with small hoses being
fed with sea water from small pumps, it said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the three boats first towed the stricken vessel
toward the middle of Cebu harbor to spare other ships docked at
portside, rendering useless the arrival of fire trucks from Cebu
city and Mandaue city.
</P>
<P>
Cebu Coast Guard Commander Franklin Llanto said his men would
help in the investigation of the incident.

<HEADLINE> Africa Leads in Child Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- As many as 23.6 million child
laborers aged between 10 and 14, or about one-third of the
world's 73 million child workers, are in Africa, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Africa leads in relative terms with the highest number of
child workers," Elias Mabere, the Assistant Director-General of
the International Labor Organization who is responsible for
Africa, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The trend in Africa is due to high population growth rates,
degrading conditions of living brought about by economic
hardships and the incapacity of the existing educational systems
to cater for all school-aged children, he added.
</P>
<P>
In sub-Saharan Africa, the problem was caused by increasing
rural poverty and the accelerated rural-urban migration in search
of job opportunities, he said at the on-going International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions Africa Region conference here.
</P>
<P>
The most pervasive and degrading forms of abuse involved
forced and bonded labor, commercial sexual exploitation and the
use of children in drug-trafficking, he said at the three-day
meeting which is to end tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called for all countries involved to adopt and
supervise international labor standards so as to combat child
labor.

<HEADLINE> Two Kidnap Suspects Killed in Manila Shoot-out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Two kidnap suspects were killed
while a policeman was wounded in a shoot-out in the Philippine
capital of Manila this morning.
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects was killed instantly while the other died
on arrival at a hospital as he sustained multiple gunshot wounds,
police said.
</P>
<P>
The shoot-out, which took place along E. Rodriguez Blvd.,
Cubao, Quezon city, around 11:00 p.m. today, involved a group of
policemen from the Central Police District Command who had been
following for about two weeks the movements of suspected members
of a kidnap gang.
</P>
<P>
Police said the gang was to meet with their cohorts in Cubao
when the shoot-out took place. The suspects apparently sensed that
they were being followed by lawmen, police said.
</P>
<P>
The suspects jumped out of the cab and opened fire at the
pursuing lawmen. One of the three suspects managed to escape, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, 98 kidnap incidents were
reported to the police in the first nine months this year compared
with 47 last year. More than 200 people were kidnapped in the
incidents this year and most of the victims were Filipino-Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The latest spate of kidnapping in the country has aroused
strong protests among the Chinese community in the Philippines. On
Tuesday, shops in Manila's Chinatown and Chinese schools in the
capital were closed in protest of the government's inability to
stop such crime.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to President Fidel Ramos on Thursday, the
Chinese community urged the government to take "more sincere,
concerted, decisive and effective actions" to stop kidnappings.

<HEADLINE> Science, Technology Revitalize National Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The improvement of China's
fiscal situation is a direct result of the nation's emphasis on
science and technology, said a top legislator in a signed article
carried in today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), said that only the sustained
development of science and technology will help the nation tap
major revenue resources.
</P>
<P>
The NPC vice-chairman commented on the great changes wrought by
science and technology in agriculture, industry, and the service
sector. For instance, per-unit area outputs of rice, wheat, and
corn in China surpass those of the world average by 26-to-51
percent. The overall yield per hectare is 8.5 times as much as two
decades ago when China began its reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
China began to renovate its traditional industries and develop
new ones with advanced technologies from abroad in the 1980s. It
has generated impetus for economic development and created
conditions for sustainable revenue growth, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
China's high-tech enterprises have generated 15 percent of the
country's gross industrial output, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"Science and technology promote rapid development of the
productive forces on one hand and produce enormous economic and
social returns on the other hand," he said.
</P>
<P>
"With development and popularization of various high-tech
businesses, taxation paid by newly developed industries and their
products have become an important financial resource that helps
increase the country's revenue," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The development of science, technology and education requires
national support, he said. Without financial aid from the state,
it would be very difficult for researchers to make necessary
breakthroughs. With financial support from the government,
knowledge gained through scientific research can be transferred
from laboratories to business workshops.
</P>
<P>
The NPC vice-chairman concluded that science and technology
supplements national revenue. While intensifying economic growth,
China should consider the role science and technology play in
developing the national economy, Wang said.

WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
approved two credits totaling 211.4 million U.S. dollars for two
educational projects in India.
</P>
<P>
A credit of some 59.4 million dollars will be used for the
second Utta Pradesh basic education project, which includes the
building of new schools and additional classrooms, the recruiting
and training of new teachers, the establishmnent of school
improvement funds and the provision of learning materials.
</P>
<P>
The project will benefit 600,000 children aged six to ten and
200,000 in the 11-13 age group, bringing the enrollment rates of
the targeted districts from 88 percent to 100 percent in primary
education and from 43 percent to 75 percent in higher primary
education by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The other credit of 152 million dollars is earmarked for
India's third district primary education project to cut school
dropout rate and expand school access.
</P>
<P>
The credit will help the state of Bihar to enroll more than 5.5
million school-age children in 17 disadvantaged districts and
double its enrollment rates by the end of the five-year project.
</P>
<P>
The credits will be channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's lending arm for
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Sustained Development in Township Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- China's rural industry met all
economic targets in the first 10 months of this year, a
government official on township-run industry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The rural industrial enterprises gained an added value of 745.8
billion yuan in the first 10 months of this year, up 15.6 percent
from the same period last year, said Jiang Yongtao, director of
the Township-run Industry Bureau under the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Business turnover totalled 3.28 trillion yuan in the first 10
months, up 17.6 percent; and profit rose to 130 billion yuan, up
18 percent. The ratio between output and market sales was 92.5
percent, he told a national conference on rural industrial
development held today in Hefei, capital of east China's Anhui
Province.
</P>
<P>
Nine billion U.S. dollars in investment have been attracted
from abroad for construction and expansion of rural
enterprises. More than 3,600 rural firms have started their
operations overseas.
</P>
<P>
Many enterprises have experimented with a diversified form of
ownership such as the stock partnership system, stock
cooperatives, leasing, mergers and formation of enterprise groups
in an effort to reorganize collective assets.
</P>
<P>
So far, rural China established 3.5 million stock cooperatives,
of which, 240,000, or 15 percent of the total, are collectively
owned firms, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said development of township-run enterprises in eastern
China grew by 15.8 percent; central China, 14.7 percent; and
western China, 18.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Jiang stated, problems still exist in the economic
operation of rural industries. About 15 percent of township-run
enterprises suffered losses, seven percent higher than last year's
figure.
</P>
<P>
Jiang attributed the increased losses to rising production
costs and lower profits, non-production expenditures, a sluggish
market and insufficient operation funds.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Beefs up Efforts to Stop Spread of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has worked
out a new comprehensive program to prevent the proliferation of
firearms in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Law and Order said on Thursday that the plan
was aimed at reducing the number of firearms, both legal and
illgal in private hands.
</P>
<P>
Controlling firearms will be done by way of stopping the flow
of illegal firearms into South Africa, preventing the theft of
legal firearms and taking active steps to reduce the existing
pool of firearms.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Safety and Security Joe Matthews said the
proliferation of firearms in South Africa has been a matter of
great concern to the government.
</P>
<P>
According to an official statistics, some 41 percent of all
murders and 76 percent of all robberies in 1996 were committed
with firearms. During the period from January 1996 to November
this year, a total of 50,585 legally registered firearms were
stolen or lost.
</P>
<P>
Estimates put the total number of illegal fireams in South
Africa at as much as four million with a further 3.76 milion
legally licensed firearms.
</P>
<P>
To stop the inflow of arms into South Africa, additional
firearms investigation units will be established to trace illegal
firearms in cooperation with other departments and even other
countries.
</P>
<P>
A Central Import-Control Office has been set up to control the
legal importing of firearms.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the theft of legal firearms, designated firearms
controlling officers will be appointed at police station level.
</P>
<P>
These officers will ensure that all applicants for firearms
are qualified and that such applicants have the necessary safes
to store the firearms and that applicants have completed a
competency test.
</P>
<P>
Other steps include linking state databases to ensure that
stolen firearms are not later legally licensed and dealers would
be physicaly checked to see if they had stolen firearms in stock.
</P>
<P>
Penalties for illegal firearms will be increased from five
years to 10 years in prison, and a person who loses a firearms
will be sentenced up to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
All the measures would be in place within the next two years,
Law and Order Ministry officials said.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Growth for Shanghai Consumer Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The consumer market in
Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, is expected to maintain
moderately rapid growth in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A local commercial official predicted that the city's retail
sales of consumer goods for the year will rise by 10-12 percent,
and will end at a level between 145.8-148.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed growth in the city's consumer market to
national macroeconomic development and Shanghai's position as an
international financial, economic and trade center.
</P>
<P>
Other favorable factors include a plentiful supply of goods,
bumper grain harvest, planned increases for investments in fixed
assets, growing demand for exports and implementation of the
shareholder system.
</P>
<P>
However, local analysts noted a decline in the purchasing power
of local residents due to an increase in the number of people
laid-off, slow growth in wages, expanded investment channels and
rising noncommercial expenses for items such as education, tourism
and telecommunications.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Parliament Passes New Income Tax Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The National Assembly of
Bulgaria, the top legislature of the country, today passed a new
tax law to extend the coverage on personal incomes.
</P>
<P>
The new law will be effective from January 1, 1998, to replace
the current Aggregate Income Taxation Act.
</P>
<P>
The law "completes the first stage of the tax reform we
promised to carry out," Yordan Tsonev, chairman of the Budget and
Finance Parliamentary Committee, told journalists.
</P>
<P>
Despite the restrictive provisions contained in the
legislation, Tsonev said, it will ensure the economic growth
projected for 1998 and promote business development in general.
</P>
<P>
If the reform goes on smoothly and tax collectability is
improved, the tax burden will diminish progressively, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, incomes derived from wage, trade, crafts
practicing, free-lancing, real estate sales and swaps, the sale of
shares and stakes, rent, leasing premiums or rents are all taxable.
</P>
<P>
It sets three deadlines for paying license tax: January 31,
July 31 and October 31. Those who pay the amount in full before
the first deadline are entitled to a five percent tax break.
</P>
<P>
Following a heated debate, the parliament approved lifting the
tax threshold for monthly and annual wage incomes from 50,000 leva
(about 31.7 U.S. dollars) now to 60,000 leva (38 dollars) in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Zhongyuan Records Breakthrough in Oil Prospecting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Industrial oil recently
gushed from the No.8 Well in the Zhongyuan (Central China) Oil
Field in Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The event marked a breakthrough in oil prospecting in the field
and ushered in a new era for prospecting on 2,000 sq.km. of
surrounding land.
</P>
<P>
The Zhongyuan Oil Field entered production in 1979, with
exploration efforts focusing on Puyang in central China's Henan
Province and Dongming in east China's Shandong Province. Fourteen
wells are currently producing oil.
</P>
<P>
The oil field has witnessed a dramatic drop in crude oil output
since 1988 when it produced a record 7.22 million tons, with the
current annual output standing at only four million tons due to a
shortage of proven reserves.
</P>
<P>
According to the Zhongyuan Petroleum Prospecting
Administration, the No.8 Well will reach a depth of 6,000 meters,
by the end of 1997. The well is designed to study the distribution
of oil reserves in a subsiding region east of Puyang.
</P>
<P>
The No.4 Well Drilling Company has drilled to a depth of
4,647.93 meters since May 9, 1997. An oil-bearing strata was
verified at 4,102 meters and the source bed was discovered at a
depth of 4,383 meters.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the findings indicate that the Zhongyuan Oil Field
has the potential for new reserves and increased output.

HONG KONG, December 5 (Xinhua) -- A young-blood team from the
Hong Kong Hockey Association left here on Friday for Singapore,
to compete in the First Women's Asian Hockey Federation (AHF)
Cup set for December 6 to 14.
</P>
<P>
The tournament, like the one held here last week with the host
coming out as the winner, is a second-tier field hockey event
for AHF-affiliated members other than China, Japan, South Korea
and India which form the first tier.
</P>
<P>
The tournament is meant to provide a chance for a high-level
and good-quality international competition for the teams.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, Hong Kong is to play in a round-robin
competition against Sri Lanka, Singapore, Chinese Taipei and
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
In the Hong Kong squad, there are five school girls who
finished second in the under-16 tournament in Singapore last
December.
</P>
<P>
"We've selected a very young team and inexperienced side for
the tournament. Our focus is on the future and this event will be
a huge learning experience for many players," said Adi Glancy,
coach of the team.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the trip is to lay the foundation for a strong
Hong Kong team for future competitions.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the 16 players are "home grown" ones, having
learned and developed their field hockey skills in Hong
Kong. "This owes to the many years of hard work by dedicated
members of the hockey community who unconditionally support the
sport in Hong Kong," said Brenda Smith, chairman of the Hong
Kong Hockey Association Women's Section.
</P>
<P>
"The number of young players joining our league is very
encouraging. Together with the large number of players from our
universities and other tertiary institutes, the league is
continuously getting new blood.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the trend will go on so that we can bring more home
grown players to the squad," the official said.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Socialists to Independently Run General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's Socialist Party
will not cooperate or form alliance with other parties in running
the next general election, Hungarian Prime Minister Horn Gyula
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the party, which is a ruling partner with the Alliance
of Free Democrats (AFD), will run independently for the National
Assembly as it did in 1990 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Horn was quoted by the Hungarian News Agency as saying that the
situation in Hungary has never been so good.
</P>
<P>
But he said it is still possible that the Socialist party will
have to jointly run the country with AFD after the next election.
</P>
<P>
He said what matters most in Socialist Party's choice of a
ruling parter is the common ground with its potential partners,
not the differences in their election platforms.

<P>
TOKYO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka said today that the monetary authorities are ready to
take action to stop yen's devaluation against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Excessive movements in currency exchange markets are
undesirable," Mitsuzuka told a regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
"Stability in currency markets is important for the global
economy," he stressed, adding that he will keep a close watch over
the movements.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar was quoted at 129.66-68 yen at noon in Tokyo,
and dealers said it might break through the 130-yen line soon.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the Japanese economy is now in a tough
situation, Mitsuzuka said the government will analyze it carefully
before announcing any assessment.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency Koji Omi
acknowledged that the country's economy is at a standstill, not in
the process of recovery. Japan's economic growth rate for fiscal
1997 will be less than one percent, far below the government's
target of 1.9 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry will take appropriate measures to stimulate
the economy, Mitsuzuka added.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Posts Record Grain Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
province has had yet another record grain output in 1997, thereby
fulfilling production targets for the Ninth Five Year Plan
(1996-2000) three years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Despite frequent natural disasters throughout the year, the
province managed to increase its grain output by 600,000 tons to
19.48 million tons. Guangdong has recorded four successive bumper
havests.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government, which has consistently placed
priority on the grain sector, allocated five billion yuan late
last year to improve water conservation facilities and upgrade
low-yield farmland.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it established some 50 grain production bases and
designated 14 counties as commodity grain suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of intensive technological applications has
also been a major factor contributing to good harvests, according
to local officials.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Forces Reduction Goodwill Gesture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The decision to reduce ground
and naval forces in northwest Russia, announced by President Boris
Yeltsin in Sweden, is part of Russia's military reform, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made a goodwill gesture toward the Baltic states
Wednesday, telling the Swedish parliament that Russia would reduce
its ground and naval forces in northwest Russia by 40 percent by
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The President also suggested that a "hot line" be set up
between militaries of Kaliningrad in Russia and three Baltic
states to supervise the territorial space of the Baltics and to
strengthen mutual trust in the region.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Gennady Tarasov, spokesman of Russian
Foreign Ministry, said the suggestion would further the
implementation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov asked the Western countries to clearly define their
army building plans in accordance with current security situation
in Europe. He expressed Russia's willingness to consider any
suggestion put forward by them.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh needs financial
support from donor countries and agencies to carry out development
programs for the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) that have just
signed a peace accord with the government, local press reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
Briefing heads of missions and representatives of donor
countries and agencies here Thursday on the CHT peace agreement
signed Tuesday, Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria said financial
assistance would be needed for the implementation of both
short-term and long-term programs for the CHT.
</P>
<P>
Additional resources would be required for resettling refugees,
developing infrastructure and other medium- and long-term
development projects in the hill districts, the finance minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that all tribal people would soon return
home, resume a normal life and contribute to the development and
prosperity of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The government has given special attention to the hill tracts
and some special facilities would be created for the area, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Immediate construction of infrastructure facilities like
schools, clinics, rural feeder roads and village markets are
urgently needed, the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
Development endeavors have been hindered over the years in the
hill districts, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for maintaining the momentum of the peace
process to help the hill districts return to normal conditions.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of development partners of Bangladesh hailed
the signing of the peace agreement and at the same time sought
detailed information on refugee resettlement and development
programs in the hill tracts, the press reports quoted Bangladeshi
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Their response to the government initiatives for development
in the region is very positive," the officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister
Victor Ciorbea said today that the economic adjustment in his
country has achieved initial success.
</P>
<P>
Summing up his one-year work at the joint meeting of the Senate
and Chamber of Deputies, Ciorbea said the exchange rate between
the Romanian currency, the leu, and hard currencies has been
stable.
</P>
<P>
Foreign reserves have increased from 700 million U.S. dollars
earlier this year to 2.6 billion dollars now, the highest since
World War II, and foreign investment amounted to more than one
billion dollars in one year, as much as the total in the previous
four years.
</P>
<P>
On the rise of inflation, he said it was a temporary situation.
</P>
<P>
The country had a large grain harvest this year, but industrial
production dropped, a problem which all countries in the
transition period have faced.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government would continue its economic reform,
strictly control inflation and crack down on tax evasion to
guarantee the stability of the national economy, Ciorbea stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Romanian parliament today approved Ciorbea's
cabinet reshuffle plan.

BELGRADE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- French and German foreign
ministers today called for peacekeepers to stay in Bosnia after
their current mandate expires by the end of June next year.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and his German
counterpart Klaus Kinkel said it's essential to maintain the
presence of the NATO-led multinational Stabilization Force (SFOR).
</P>
<P>
The reason, they explained at a joint news conference in
Sarajevo, is that only a small part of the so-called Dayton accord
to bring peace back to Bosnia has been implemented up to now.
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the agreement, especially those on civil
procedures, are yet to be settled, they told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers were in Sarajevo to meet Bosnian
leaders and prepare a meeting scheduled for December 9-10 in Bonn
of the committee that oversees the Dayton accord's implementation.
</P>
<P>
During their one-day stay, they met Biljana Plavsic, president
of the Bosnian Serb republic, and other top Serb and Croatian

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves $21 Bln Stand-By Credit for South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved South Korea's request for a three-year
stand-by credit equivalent to about 21 billion U.S. dollars in
support of the government's economic and financial program.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, about 5.56 billion dollars is available
immediately while about 3.58 billion dollars will be available on
December 18 following the first review under the program.
</P>
<P>
Another 2 billion dollars will be available on January 8, 1998
following the second review.
</P>
<P>
However, subsequent disbursement will be made available subject
to the attainment of performance targets and, in some cases,
program reviews.
</P>
<P>
The IMF stand-by credit is equivalent to 1,939 percent of South
Korea's quota of about 1.09 billion dollars equivalent in the
international financial institution.
</P>
<P>
In approving South Korea's request for the stand-by credit, the
IMF made the use of the accelerated procedures established under
the emergency financing mechanism (EFM), which was adopted in
September 1995, following the bailout package for the Mexico
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The macroeconomic objectives of the program include: building
the conditions for an early return of confidence so as to limit
the unavoidable slowdown of GDP growth in 1998, containing
inflation at or below 5 percent and building international
reserves to more than two months of imports by the end of 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
Alma-Ata, December 4 (Xinhua)-- Kazakhstan President Nursultan
Nazarbayev noted on December 4, "To develop friendly relations
with China is one of the first strategic priorities of Kazakhstan
foreign policies, and Sino-Kazakhstan relations have made
significant achievements in recent years under the mutual efforts
of both sides."
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev made this statement at his presidential residence
while meeting the delegates from more than 20 countries attending
the Asian Mutual Relations and Trust Conference at
vice-ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev pointed out that first of all, China and Kazakhstan
had laid down the legal foundations to solve the border problems
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Chinese government had made commitment to
guarantee the security of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
These two acts had greatly consolidated the stability of
bilateral ties and deepened mutual understanding. He made clear
Kazakhstan's high appraisal of the Chinese government's efforts to
develop the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said trade cooperation between the two countries had
been extended to many specific fields and cooperation in
transportation increased the opportunities for Kazakhstan to use
the Asian road network.
</P>
<P>
It is most notable that China plans to build a petroleum
pipeline running from west China to west Kazakhstan and
participate in Kazakhstan's oil recovery which will surely bring
Sino-Kazakhstan relations into a new era, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nazabayev also talked about Kazakhstan's relations with Russia,
Islamic countries and other issues.

MANILA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen people aboard a mini-bus
were abducted at gunpoint by seven heavily-armed men in Mindanao,
the southern Philippines, Thursday, the National Police said
today.
</P>
<P>
Five of the 15 captives, including two students, were released
after several hours of captivity, by the unidentified suspects,
police said.
</P>
<P>
A joint rescue operation has been launched by the local police
and military units in Lanao del Sur Province to pursue the
suspects who are still holding 10 people.
</P>
<P>
The massive abduction was the latest in a series of kidnappings
reported this week, which have already aroused a public outcry
over the government's failure to neutralize kidnapping gangs.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, thousands of Chinese Filipinos took part in a
protest march in Downtown Manila and a funeral for a young Chinese
businessman killed by his abductors.
</P>
<P>
Chinese businesses and schools were closed down for one day
Tuesday in Chinatown and other parts of the capital city to
protest the government's incompetence to solve the kidnapping
issue plaguing the country for years.
</P>
<P>
But as the Chinese community mourned and protested Tuesday,
five more Chinese residents were held by kidnappers. One of the
captives, a son-in-law of a Chinese tycoon, was killed along with
four of his kidnappers in a shootout between the suspects and
policemen.

<HEADLINE> Citibank Undecided on Thai Bank Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-based Citibank has not
yet made a decision on a reported takeover of Thailand's ailing
First Bangkok City Bank.
</P>
<P>
A definite decision is expected in three months after Citibank
completes examining the books of the Thai bank, the Bangkok Post
today quoted William Rhodes, vice president of Citibank, as saying
on Thursday after a meeting with Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai.
</P>
<P>
It was widely reported late last month that Citibank had agreed
to take a majority stake in the bank.
</P>
<P>
If the takeover came true, it would be the first such case
under a new rule of the Thai government that foreign investors can
hold a majority stake in Thai banks for up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have been cautious in welcoming the new
regulation for fear of loss after the 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are two bids by foreign investors to take over
Finance One plc, the largest of the 58 suspended finance
companies, whose fate will be announced by Thai Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Reports say only a very small number of them will be allowed to
reopen.

The German-based Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) announced
Thursday that it had received approval from senior creditors
grouping more than 50 international banks to acquire Finance One
plc.
</P>
<P>
There is also a rival bid, by Credit Suisse First Boston, to
buy 70.5 percent of Finance One's equity for about 148 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both plans will be presented to a Thai government agency for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
There is the possibility that neither will be accepted, as
Finance One could also face takeover and liquidation by the
Financial Restructuring Authority, a Thai government agency whose
main responsibility is to handle the 58 finance companies
suspended earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Confident of FTAA Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Foreign Trade
Minister Jose Manuel Salazar today expressed optimism that
negotiations for the creation of the Free Trade Area of the
Americas (FTAA) will start next April.
</P>
<P>
Doubts about the negotiations emerged when the United States
Congress denied President Bill Clinton the authorization to
negotiate the FTAA establishment through "the fast track."
</P>
<P>
The fast track is the commitment of the U.S. Congress with the
President of accepting or rejecting, without change, the
agreements the president negotiates with other nations.
</P>
<P>
Salazar, who presides over the preliminary FTAA negotiations,
said the U.S. president is interested in starting the negotiations
next April even if he does not have the support of his congress.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the 34 countries taking part in the FTAA
negotiations will meet in March to finalize a proposal that will
be presented for approval in the hemisphere summit to be held in
Santiago.
</P>
<P>
Salazar said it is probable that President Clinton will get the
Congress authorization after the negotiations start although he
will arrive at the summit without the authorization to negotiate
through "the fast track."
</P>
<P>
The important thing was that the U.S. president had the
authorization before 2005, the date foreseen for the FTAA
establishment, he added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Tamil Parties Have Reservations on Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Many Sri Lankan Tamil political
parties have reservations about contesting the local government
elections to be held in the north, local press reports said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Only the Democratic People's Liberation Front, a political wing
of the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam, has
announced its intention to contest seats on the 17 local bodies in
the north.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil United Liberation Front said the ground situation is
not suitable for holding the elections at present as rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are still active in some
areas where the elections would be held.
</P>
<P>
The Eelam People's Democratic Party stressed that many of the
day-to- day problems of the people in the north need to be solved
before politicians could take part in the local elections.
</P>
<P>
The Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front noted that
with heavy military presence in the north, elections would have no
meaning. The party also accused the military of "unnecessarily
interfering in civil affairs."
</P>
<P>
The Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization, the Eelavar Democratic
Front and other Tamil parties also expressed their concerns over
the coming elections in the north.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the parties left the door open when they said
their policy makers would meet next week to determine whether or
not they would contest the elections.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner of Elections Dayananda Dissanayake said on
Wednesday that nominations for general elections to municipal,
urban and village councils in Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts in
the north will be received from December 16 to 23.
</P>
<P>
The elections have been postponed for almost one year due to
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is engaging government troops in the north and east in
a desperate effort to create an independent state of their own.
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-long war has severely interrupted the normalcy of
the regions and caused heavy casualties. At least 55,000 people
have been killed and thousands of others rendered homeless since
the war broke out in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Lose Money at Cash Register </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Canadians are paying huge amount
of extra money to stores that aren't properly programming their
price scanners, said a study released today.
</P>
<P>
The study team visited five department stores, bought 375
items from three different stores in each of the chains, and found
errors in their bills an average of 14 percent of all times.
</P>
<P>
In nine percent of the cases, the error favored the store,
while the consumer came out ahead five percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
By average, there was a net overcharging of 2.5 percent to the
consumer as a result of scanner errors.
</P>
<P>
A similar government study a year ago found a national error
rate of 6.5 percent, and both consumers and stores came out ahead
half of the time.

<P>
WELLINGTON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Reserve Bank
intervened today to half the slide in the NZ dollar, which sank to
a three-year low against the U.S. dollar this morning.
</P>
<P>
The bank released a two-paragraph brief statement this
afternoon, warning that the monetary conditions have become too
loose.
</P>
<P>
The NZ dollar dipped below 60 U.S. cents this morning, but
bounced back half a cent this afternoon shortly after the Reserve
Bank's statement.
</P>
<P>
The dollar has lost over 10 U.S. cents in the past year since
peaking between 71 and 72 U.S. cents last December. It closed at
60.3 U.S. cents yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank's statement also prompted the wholesale
interest rates to rise. The 90-day bank bills have now reached
7.84 percent compared with yesterday's 7.63 percent.

<HEADLINE> Thai King Calls for More Focus on Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej
Thursday said Thailand should focus on a self-sustained
agriculture-based economy and use more Thai goods to get rid of
the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The king made the remarks in his annual address to the nation
on television Thursday night on the eve of Thailand's national day
today, which is also the king's 70th birthday.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said the king warned against relying too much
on industry to spur a recovery and striving too hard to become one
of Asia's "tiger" economies.
</P>
<P>
"Whether to be a tiger is unimportant," the king said, "and the
important thing is for the economy to be able to support Thais."
</P>
<P>
Thailand could not rely on the same policy of producing too
much industrial goods as other countries are also in trouble and
they also do not have money to buy Thai goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although an agrarian economy might be considered outdated,
Thailand needs to take a step back at this time in order that it
can go forward in the future, the king said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has a lot of land and the government should reinforce
its technical and financial support to increase agricultural
production, the king said.
</P>
<P>
During his one-and-a-half hour speech, the king also called on
the 60 million Thai people to remain united, be frugal, abstain
from the habit of overspending and buy more Thai goods.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Businessmen Insist on Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican private sector
organizations proposed again today that public assets be sold as a
solution to the internal debt problem.
</P>
<P>
The debt amounts to 1.1 trillion colons (about 2.7 billion
U.S. dollars), the Central Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for privatizing some companies, such as the state
monopolies of insurance and telecommunications, have caused
controversy in political circles.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion shows that two-thirds of Costa Ricans are
against the sale of the assets to solve the debt problem.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for the Defense of Institutionality, headed by
former President Rodrigo Carazo, said the sale would not solve the
problem, and the intention was simply for the state to get rid of
its enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Samuel Yankelewitz, president of the Costa Rican
Union of Chambers and Associations of Private Enterprise, said
today that as long as the assets were not sold, the internal debt
problem would persist.
</P>
<P>
It is not feasible that the state will promote the
privatization as a solution to the debt amid the electoral
campaign which will end in February.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Social Christian Party presidential candidate,
Miguel Angel Rodriguez, a favorite for the elections triumph,
supports the privatization and the dismantling of the state
monopolies in some economic sectors.

<HEADLINE> Investment Realization Still Low in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Realization level of domestic
and foreign investment in Indonesia has been low, an Indonesian
official said.
</P>
<P>
According to a 1996 survey, the realization level stood at
47.96 percent for domestic and 53.44 percent for foreign
investment, an official of the Investment Coordinating Board, R.
Iskandar, said here Thursday at a counseling meeting on the
investment policy.
</P>
<P>
Domestic investment projects since 1968 have reached 10,916
with a planned investment of 593.3 trillion rupiah (about 169.5
billion U.S. dollars), sources at the meeting today quoted
Iskandar as saying.
</P>
<P>
The foreign projects agreed since 1967 have reached 5,484 with
planned investments totaling 203.6 billion dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, even though the national economy is being rocked by
monetary turmoil, he said, domestic and foreign investors'
interest in Indonesia remains strong.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the value of domestic investments stood at 100.7
trillion rupiah, but this year until November 15, domestic
investments had totaled 110.8 trillion rupiah, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign investments were valued at 29.92 billion
dollars in 1996, but this year they had reached 29.94 billion
dollars by November.
</P>
<P>
However, economic observers here said the realization of
domestic and foreign investment in 1997 will be lower than that in
1996 because of the current monetary crisis, which has resulted in
a drop of some 50 percent in the value of the country's currency,
the rupiah, and impaired investors' confidence in the country's
monetary sector and its economy as a whole.

JAKARTA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Starvation and drought-related
diseases have killed at least 656 people in Indonesia's remote
corner of Irian Jaya Province, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The drought, believed to be the region's worst in half a
century, and a series of forest fires since July this year have
caused failures in the harvests of rice and other crops in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Reports said a total of 447 people have died in Jayawijaya
District, 3,400 kilometers east of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross reported earlier
that at least 103 villagers had died of starvation and
drought-related diseases in Mimika District west of Jayawijaya.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newspaper Kompas reported Thursday that 82
people have died in Merauke and 24 in Puncak Jaya districts in
Irian Jaya.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth and the
population increase have caused the rise of greenhouse gas
emissions in Canada, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
Total greenhouse gas emissions related to Canada's household
consumption increased 14 percent between 1981 and 1992, the
Federal Statistics Agency said in its report on the country's
environmental wealth.
</P>
<P>
The increase would have been much higher if it were not for a
shift towards using natural gas and better energy efficiency, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
As to environmental wealth, the agency said that energy,
minerals and timber contributed 316 billion Canadian dollars (221
billion U.S. dollars) to the national wealth in 1995, about a
tenth of its total.
</P>
<P>
If agricultural and developed land were included, the increase
would be up to 31 percent of the national wealth, the agency
added.

<HEADLINE> TV Wars Prelude Ukraine's Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma and the socialist Parliamentary Speaker Alexander Moroz are
fighting for ascendency in the forthcoming parliamentary elections
through control of the airwaves of the country's three national
television channels.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian parliament, the Supreme Soviet, adopted
legislation on November 21 which keeps foreign TV companies from
influencing the election campaign in Ukraine. The law, amending
the TV and radio broadcasting law, stipulates that citizens and
their associations, government officials and organizations are
banned from using foreign television and radio companies for
election campaigning.
</P>
<P>
Domestic electronic media with more than 10 percent foreign
capital is considered foreign in Ukraine. The national TV channels
UT-2 and UT-3 both have foreign investment of more than 10
percent, while UT-1 is 100 percent owned by the state. Under the
law, UT-2 and UT-3 which are completely controlled by presidential
supporters will stay out of the election campaign to a large
extent. UT-2 played a significant role in helping Kuchma win his
presidential race in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"It's a piece of legislation which forbids political
advertising on TV channels with foreign investment and affects all
the domestic national channels except for UT-1" says Viacheslav
Chornovil, leader of the national Rukh party. "It's simply an
attempt by the left to get rid of the competition."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Supreme Soviet passed a resolution on November
21, which orders the Cabinet of Ministers to facilitate the
operations of the AT Ukrainian Public Radio and Television,
providing the new TV/radio company with 10 hours of daily air time
on UT-2. Legislators say that the establishment of a new TV
company will give opposition forces nationwide air time during the
elections scheduled on March 29 and 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma quickly reacted on November 25 by publicly stating that
the executive would not implement this resolution. Yevgen
Kuchnariov, head of the presidential administration, said on
November 26 that the Cabinet of Minister would never agree to the
creation of the new TV company.
</P>
<P>
With the president and the cabinet so firmly against this,
Kuchma, who has been busy visiting foreign countries these months,
will likely veto the law on banning Ukrainian politicians from
campaigning on "foreign-owned" TV. As to the resolution on setting
up the new TV company, the executive will simply not implement
this because Kuchma cannot veto parliamentary resolutions by law.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage
today urged the small Caribbean economies to unite because it was
the only solution for the area in view of the integration of big
economic blocs.
</P>
<P>
Lage told the Carribean-Europe Conference that it is impossible
for the small Caribbean economies to compete with those of the
developed countries because of the technological gap,
protectionism and other reasons.
</P>
<P>
He said Cuba's disposition to cooperate within the union of
Caribbean countries, with which Havana had a trade exchange of 400
million U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"We build our relations with the Caribbean countries on the
basis of cooperation and not on competition," said Lage. He said
the Cuban government is willing to boost that linkage, for example
through technicians and qualified specialists.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Cuban relations with Europe, Lage said 29 percent
of Cuban trade is now with the European Union, compared with seven
percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
A proposal by the European Union to change the finishing time
of the Fourth Lome Convention was examined during the meeting of
European and Caribbean delegates. The agreement was initially
planned to end by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the Lome Covention, the former European colonial centers
are now giving preferential trade status to their former colonies
in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific regions.
</P>
<P>
The European Union plans to gradually eliminate those
preferences after the year 2000.

<P>
SOFIA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and Turkey finally
settled their border problem, which had existed for nearly half a
century, here today with the signing of an intergovernment
agreement by the two prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Agreement on Establishment of the International Border in
the Area of the Mouth of the River Rezovska and on Delimitation of
the Sea Areas between the Two Countries in the Black Sea was
signed on the first day of Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's
two-day visit to Sofia.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov said after the signing
ceremony: "This is the first time that Bulgaria has settled a
border problem independently. This boosts our self-confidence and
dignity."
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz signaled his satisfaction over the event, saying "the
agreement protects the interests of both countries."
</P>
<P>
Also signed today were agreements on Cooperation in culture,
education and science, in mutual assistance in customs operations,
and a protocol on cooperation between the two countries' interior
ministries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed on the formation of a joint working

citizens.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum on the promotion of free trade between Bulgaria
and Turkey is expected to be signed Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a 98-km
expressway linking Yangpu and Basuo on the midwestern coast of
Hainan Island in south China commenced recently.
</P>
<P>
The expressway will cost 900 million yuan and is scheduled for
completion by 1998. The new road will link Danzhou City, Baisha
County, Changjiang County and Dongfang City in the western part of
the island province.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Deputy Governor Wang Xiaofeng said the project
symbolizes the accelerated construction of an expressway ringing
the island.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Hainan will work hard to complete construction
of the expressway system prior to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has proceeded in line with local conditions and has
invested heavily in expressway construction over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
The 268-km expressway in eastern Hainan opened to traffic in
1995. Expansion of the northern section of the expressway, from
Haikou, the provincial capital on the northern end of the island,
to Qionghai, a city on mideastern coast, commenced in late 1996
and is scheduled for completion next March. Expansion of the
southern section, from Qionghai to Lingshui, will begin within the
year.
</P>
<P>
The expressway in the western part of the island will stretch a
total of 366 kilometers. The upper northern section from Haikou to
Yangpu opened in March this year. Construction of the southwestern
section, from Jiusuo to Sanya, a seaside resort on the southern
tip of Hainan Island, commenced in January this year and will be
completed in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary work for construction of the remaining 90 km
section of the western expressway from Basuo to Jiusuo is
proceeding smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Under Fire for Failure to Smash Kidnappings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
and his government are facing a barrage of public criticism for
their failure to smash kidnapping syndicates running rampant in
the country since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Many leading local newspapers published editorials today
expressing sympathy to the victims in the latest wave of
kidnapping and prodding the Ramos administration to stem the tide
of kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
"The kidnapping must be stopped at all costs," the Manila
Chronicle stressed in its editorial. "This is the urgent call we
make to government in the face of the continuing travesty of the
law by kidnap-for-ransom gangs."
</P>
<P>
As if to mock the protest being held Tuesday by the
Chinese-Filipino community over the failure of law-enforcement
agencies to stop the rash of abductions, kidnappers struck again,
killing a son-in-law of a Chinese tycoon and abducting five
others, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
"We commiserate with the entire Chinese-Filipino community over
these senseless killings and numerous abductions that have taken
place over the past year," it said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this recent rash of abductions and senseless
killings underscores the near-total breakdown of law and order in
this country."
</P>
<P>
The editorial also appealed to Ramos to create an
anti-kidnapping task force directly responsible to himself and
thoroughly revamp the National Police to improve its capability in
fighting organized crime.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to Ramos published today by another local
newspaper, Today, more than 100 organizations, most of them
Chinese-Filipino, expressed disappointment with Ramos' failure to
restore peace and order in the country as promised in the 1992
general elections.
</P>
<P>
"Yet, with barely half a year left of your administration, the
kidnapping problem continues to terrorize the citizenry," said the
letter published as a full-page advertisement.
</P>
<P>
"Not only has the problem worsened considerably but the
kidnappers have become more and more brazen and daring, taking
victims right from inside their businesses and homes, in broad
daylight and in busy thoroughfares too," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"We have suffered long enough," they told the president, noting
that, on average, one person was being kidnapped every other day
this year.
</P>
<P>
These denunciations and appeals came as some government
officials, notably Ramos' National Security Adviser Jose Almonte,
continued to downplay the magnitude of the problem.
</P>
<P>
Almonte had accused media and certain members of the
Chinese-Filipino community of exaggerating the issue and
overreacting to it.
</P>
<P>
Presidential adviser for political affairs, Ramon Montano,
earlier even called media the "No. 1 enemy in (anti-)kidnapping
operations."
</P>
<P>
But Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim, who is known for his resolve and
success in fighting crimes, warned that investors would be
frightened away unless the peace and order situation improved at
home.
</P>
<P>
"You should first put out the fire burning your house before
asking others to come in," he told reporters when taking part in
Tuesday's protest march.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Offers Help in Mediating Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 5 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has
offered to help break the deadlock in the Middle East peace process
during a meeting with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu here late Thursday evening, Israeli diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Kohl had not put pressure on Israel on its latest controversial
plans for a limited withdrawal from the West Bank, Israeli delegation
members told the German news agency DPA. The meeting was conducted in
a good atmosphere, they added.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders refused to make any comments before and after the
dinner meeting which was held at Kohl's chancellory residence in
Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is on a European tour which also brings him to Paris
for separate talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright
and French President Jacques Chirac on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said earlier that Netanyahu would try to seek Western
support for an Israeli plan which would involve a conditional
withdrawal of Israeli troops from six to eight percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The plan, whose details are still unknown, has already be rejected
the Palestinians as insufficent and a ploy to keep the territory under
its control.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is currently under increasing pressure from the
Western nations, with the United States in particular, to drop his
hardline policy and take concrete steps to help restart the
deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German weekly newspaper Zeit on Thursday,
the Israeli leader did not produce any signs for a major attitude
change.
</P>
<P>
He indicated in the interview that Israel would favor a second
limited withdrawal from the West Bank before the start of final-status
talks, provided that the Palestinians fulfil its anti-terrorism
obligations.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Europe to take a balanced approach to the Middle
East issues in order to play a more convincing role as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister left here for Paris Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Reorganizes Industrial Development Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's Industry Development
Committee (IDC) has been reorganized with Minister for Science and
Technology U Thaung designated as its chairman.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar said today that
the IDC was reconstituted following the formation of the State
Peace and Development Council (SPDC), Myanmar's governing body,
last month.
</P>
<P>
The IDC chairmanship was previously held by former Minister for
 Agriculture and Irrigation Myint Aung On.
</P>
<P>
At a coordination meeting here Thursday, SPDC Second Secretary
Tin Oo urged the IDC to accelerate its work and reorganize the
working committee to implement industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
Quoting SPDC Chairman Than Shwe, Tin Oo reiterated the
country's five industrial development objectives -- development of
agro-based industries, qualitative and quantitative improvement of
industrial products, production of new industrial products,
manufacture of industrial equipment and acquisition of good
opportunities for the nation's industrialization.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar IDC was first formed in July 1995 to promote the
development of the country's industries.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's industrial growth
reached 5.2 percent in the 1996-97 fiscal year, the first fiscal
of the country's present five-year plan. Myanmar has set a target
of 10.7-percent growth for the industrial sector in 1997-98, the
second fiscal year of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that the industrial sector accounts for
only 9.2 percent of the gross domestic product while the
agricultural sector makes up the lion's share.
</P>
<P>
The government has called for greater efforts for promoting the
private sector's involvement in the industrial sector and for
establishing industrial zones throughout the country, especially
in the capital of Yangon, to attract foreign investments to the
sector.

SAN JOSE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's Acting President
Rodrigo Oreamuno today rejected the allegation that organized
crime gangs were threatening the lives of U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
"We do not accept what the U.S. Department of State says," said
Oreamuno, who assumed the presidency of this Central American
country while President Jose Maria Figueres is visiting Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a recent U.S. State Department travel
advisory issued after a U.S. citizen and a Costa Rican farmer were
killed in a fight over a land dispute last month.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. citizens residing in the region of Pavones and Golfito
have been the target of organized gangs of squatters who have
tried to take the lands by violent means," the advisory said.
</P>
<P>
The gangs had not been punished and would continue threatening
U.S. citizens, it alleged.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Oreamuno said the allegation is an
exaggeration and, as agreed by Costa Rican political leaders and
police authorities, it does not reflect the reality of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Pavones and Golfito region is located on the southern
Pacific coast of Costa Rica, some 220 kilometers from San Jose.

<P>
HANGZHOU, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Province hopes to
become a major chemical industrial base in east China with plans
to build five new centers.
</P>
<P>
These five centers will be in Ningbo, specializing in
petrochemicals; Jinhua and Quzhou, fluorine chemicals; Taizhou,
fine chemicals; Hangzhou, organic chemical materials and high-tech
chemicals; and Wenzhou, comprehensive utilization of alums.
</P>
<P>
The chemical industry of Zhejiang has been growing rapidly in
recent years, generating 80 billion yuan in sales last
year. Pesticide production now accounts for one-tenth of the
nation's total.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, according to the plan, the local
government every year will select 100 large and medium-size
chemical industry enterprises and help them obtain 200 million
yuan of annual sales and 10 million yuan of annual pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
In a separate plan to boost the petrochemical industry in the
province, the total output value is expected to increase by 15
percent annually in the next three years, reaching 158 billion

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leftist Rebels to Release Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 5 (Xinhua) -- The leftist rebel group, the New
People's Army (NPA), will release today a police official and an
army sergeant taken hostage after a raid on a police station in
late October this year.
</P>
<P>
The two captives will be freed somewhere in southern Luzon to a
government peace panel and the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC), today's local press reports quoted a senior
government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Solicitor General Silvestre Bello, a government negotiator with
the NPA, said he and ICRC representative Paul Bonard will meet
today with NPA spokesman Gregorio Raosal and an NPA commander, who
will bring the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The release will be done between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. today,
according to Bello.
</P>
<P>
The NPA, the military arm of the National Democratic Front
(NDF), has been persuaded to push through with the release today
despite friction caused by an alleged military offensive on a
guerrilla camp, Bello said.
</P>
<P>
The NPA has warned that it would renege on its promise to
release the two hostages if the military attack took place.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, President Fidel Ramos announced a unilateral
30-day cease-fire with the NPA to facilitate the release and the
resumption of stalled peace talks with the NDF in the Netherlands
where many NDF leaders are living in exile.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, created by the Communist Party of the Philippines in
the late 1960s, has fought the government for more than three
decades. It began its exploratory peace talks with Manila three
years ago, but the talks have been unproductive.
</P>
<P>
Military estimates put the membership of the NPA at about
8,000.

<HEADLINE> Official: Humanitarian Concerns, Self-Defense Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The general principle of solving
the landmine problem should be one that takes balanced account of
both humanitarian concerns and the legitimate military needs of
sovereign states for self-defense, a senior Chinese official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ongoing Ottawa landmine conference, Zha Peixin,
head of the Chinese Observer Delegation, stressed that countries
differ in national conditions and defense needs.
</P>
<P>
"For many countries, especially those lacking advanced
defensive weapons, anti-personnel landmines (APLs) remain an
effective means of self-defense. Moreover, the issue of national
security is in itself an important aspect of humanitarianism," Zha
said.
</P>
<P>
"Before an alternative of APLs is found, the Chinese army must
reserve the right to use APLs on its own soil so as to form
defense capability.
</P>
<P>
"The sole purpose of this reservation lies in safeguarding
national unity and territorial integrity of the country and
ensuring the peaceful life of the Chinese people," the official
noted.
</P>
<P>
It is also in conformity with the right of self-defense
enshrined in the UN Charter and will not constitute a threat to
civilians of any country, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has all along attached great importance to humanitarian
concerns over landmine problems, favored humanitarian efforts of
the international community aimed at preventing casualties of
innocent civilians by the Plyndmines.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that strengthening restrictions on use and
banning abusive use of landmines constitute one of the important
aspects of reduction and total elimination of landmine casualties
to civilians," Zha told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government calls for all states to join, ratify and
observe the amended Landmine Protocol of the CCW.
</P>
<P>
Zha said removal of landmines laid in the past is another
important aspect in addressing the indiscriminate effect of
landmine on civilians and represents "the most urgent problem"
faced by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"China will continue to actively take part in international
efforts at mine clearance," he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, China is studying and mapping out plans to assist
countries suffering from landmine problems in mine-clearance
training, technology and equipment, including making contributions
to the international fund on mine clearance, he said.

<HEADLINE> AFC Supports HKFA in Operating the Game: AFC President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- "We will give all the support
to Mr. Timothy Fok Tsun-ting in running the Hong Kong Football
Association (HKFA) to uphold the old glory," Sultan Ahmad Shah,
president of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"HKFA is a family member of the Asian football and FIFA has
reconfirmed its status," Shah said.
</P>
<P>
The AFC chief was speaking at a tea reception given in his
honor by the HKFA here today.
</P>
<P>
Shah and his entourage, who arrived here on Wednesday, are
paying an unofficial visit here.
</P>
<P>
During his speech at today's reception, Sultan Shah recalled
that HKFA, as one of AFC's 12 founding members in 1954, was one of
the Asian football powers during the 1950s and 1960s and has been
playing an active role in Asian football.
</P>
<P>
He said that other Asian teams had progressed faster than Hong
Kong and Asia has so improved that it has "reached a respectable
level", with four teams qualified this year for the 1998 World Cup
finals in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"As AFC president, I'm very proud to have four teams in the
World Cup finals and I'm confident that Japan, South Korea, Iran
and Saudi Arabia who have qualified could carry the Asian flag
with dignity and honor," he continued.
</P>
<P>
He urged the HKFA to further their efforts to improve their
standard of play, hoping more games with teams from China's inland
areas will help Hong Kong teams improve faster.
</P>
<P>
Fok admitted that lack of facilities, among others, is a
problem for Hong Kong football and, "We'd had to have our own
stars," he said.

<HEADLINE> SPD Vows to Set New Course for Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANNOVER, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's main opposition
Social Democratic Party (SPD) concluded here today a three-day
party congress by vowing to replace Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
coalition government in next year's general elections and set
Germany on a new course.
</P>
<P>
"We want to win the next general elections so as to push
through a new policy in Germany," said SPD party leader and a
possible challenger to Kohl, Oskar Lafontaine, at the end of the
congress.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday meeting, however, was highlighted by an policy
speech delivered by the SPD premier of the Lower Saxony state,
Gerhard Schroeder, who is rivaling with Lafontaine to be the
party's formal chancellor candidate for the elections due in
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to the keynote speech made by Lafontaine on
Monday calling for more state role to run economy, Schroeder today
suggested to slash state regulations and bureaucracy to help cure
the country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who has a pro-business and modernizer image,
received a boost today when his economic concept was adopted by a
large majority by the SPD delegates in Hannover.
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called "Innovations for Germany" concept, the SPD
calls for more investment in education and research to boost
Germany's future competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
As its main remedies to cut the country's record high
unemployment, the SPD calls for an economic expansion policy, tax
cuts, as well as more flexible working hours and labour contracts.
</P>
<P>
Despite the differences in ideas, Lafontaine and Schroeder have
managed to avoid public rifts at the party congress and pledged to
join force to bring their party back to power after 15 years in
opposition.
</P>
<P>
"We will deliver an excellent team play," said Schroeder at the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Thierry Roussel Ordered to Appear Before Greek Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Thierry Roussel, father of
12-year-old Onassis heiress Athina, has been ordered to stand
trial before an Athens criminal court on charges of perjury,
slander and defamation against the board of the Alexander S.
Onassis Public Benefit foundation.
</P>
<P>
The indictment, which was issued by an Athens appeal court on
November 28, said that there was substantial evidence against
Roussel to be referred for trial by a court of misdemeanors for
"perjury, slander and defamation" in connection with false
allegations of mismanagement of the foundation's assets by its
four Greek board members, including the foundation's President,
Stelio Papadimitriou, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
No dates have been set for the hearings.
</P>
<P>
Papadimitriou said today that he had no personal dispute with
Roussel, but the latter had insulted what was most sacred for the
board.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Roussel would come to Greece and appear before
the court.
</P>
<P>
The foundation was founded by Aristotle Onassis shortly after
his death in 1975. Roussel and the four other trustee, including
Papadimitriou, are responsible for managing Athina's 3 billion
fortune until she reaches adulthood.
</P>
<P>
A bitter legal battle between Roussel and the four other
trustees began after Roussel claimed last month that there was a
plot to kidnap Athina.
</P>
<P>
The foundation insists that there was no such plot, but rather
a check on Roussel's arrangements for Athina's security.

UNITED NATIONS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations today decided to renew Iraqi Oil-for-food plan
for another period of six months effective from December 5, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The current program expires on Friday and is aimed to
alleviate the impact of UN trade sanctions on Iraq which has been
in place since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reaffirmed the commitment of all member
States to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed its willingness to find ways of
improving the implementation of the humanitarian program and
to take actions over additional resources as needed to meet the
priority humanitarian requirement of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the resolution 986 of the United Nations
adopted in April, 1995, Iraq is allowed to sell 2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil every six months to buy humanitarian goods
for its people. But the oil-for-food plan was not implemented
until last December.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Tries to Stop Israel's Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Before leaving for Europe,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today made efforts to
stop the nationwide strike launched by the Trade Union Wednesday
in protest against government's plans for wages reform and
privatization.
</P>
<P>
At the Ben Gurion Airport in Tel-Aviv, Netanyahu held talks
with Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman and Trade Union Chairman Amir
Peretz in a bid to eliminate their differences over economic
reform plans.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that the strike gives the Israeli economy
a bad name and that it harms millions of citizens. He called on
the strikers to return to work, saying that "I don't know what
they're striking for. It's a political strike. There is not
reason for it."
</P>
<P>
Following today's meeting, Peretz said that he hopes he and
Neeman will bridge their differences in a short time, adding
that the workers will return to their jobs as he has given the
order.
</P>
<P>
Neeman said that he was ready to renew negotiations with
Peretz. But he stressed that he opposed contempt of the law by
the Trade Union, which ignored the National Labor Court ruling
ordering workers to return to their jobs by 6 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein also called on
the Trade Union to honor the court decision, saying that the
defiance of the court order could push the nation into total
anarchy.
</P>
<P>
Everyday life was definitely disrupted today as the general
strike entered its second day, which paralyzed the country by
shutting down airports, seaports, banks, the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange, government offices and state-owned industries.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Manufacturers Association estimated the strike's daily
cost at 53 million shekels (about 15 million U.S. dollars). Dan
Propper, head of the association, warned that if the strike
continued, foreign investors could be affected.
</P>
<P>
The strike was triggered by the words of Neeman Monday,
describing the striking workers as "exploding bombs" and enemies
from within.
</P>
<P>
In response to the assault, Peretz declared the strike
Tuesday at an emergency gathering of thousands of union members
in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The strike is the latest round in a Trade Union battle
against government economic reform plans, which have sparked
fears that worker's rights would be harmed.
</P>
<P>
Some 150,000 clerks and municipal workers launched a two-day
strike last Sudday against cost-cutting measures taken by local
authorities and they resumed work only after the National Labor
Court issued a back-to-work order.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations today decided to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in Macedonia
for the final period until August 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reaffirmed its commitment to the
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The council reiterated its appreciation for the important role
played by the UNPREDEP in contributing to the maintenance of peace
and stability in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The council noted there had been a number of positive
development on the overall situation in the area, in particular
the stabilization of the situation in Albania, but that peace and
stability in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia continue to
depend largely on developments in other parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also requested the UN secretary-general to
report to it by June 1, 1998 on the modalities of the termination
of the UNPREDEP, including practical steps for the complete
withdrawal of the military component immediately after August 31,
1998, and to submit recommendations on the type of international
presence that would be most appropriate for the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia after August 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The UNPREDEP was established in 1992. Its mandate should end on
November 30. After days of consultation, the council unanimously
agreeed to extend its mandate for the final period of nine months.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian School Dropouts High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The 15 percent rate of
primary school leavers joining secondary schools in Tanzania is a
clear indication that school completion rates are low and
dropouts are high, "The Guardian" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, citing a report by the United Nations
Development Program, said the east African country continues
facing severe problems in the education sector.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP Development Cooperation Report for Tanzania for 1996,
which was released on Wednesday in Dar es Salaam, says that
transition rate of 15 percent from primary to secondary education
was very low in comparison with ratios of secondary education
enrollment in other sub-Saharan African countries.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of education at all levels has yet to improve due
to insufficient supply of qualified teachers, classrooms and
education materials," the report notes.
</P>
<P>
The report points out that insufficient funding for
educational activities and inadequate remuneration of teachers
have also contributed to the generally poor quality of education.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Talks Should Achieve Breakthrough: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
special envoy for the Middle East peace process said here today
that the Palestinians and Israelis should achieve breakthrough in
their peace talks before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Posuvalyuk, the Russian envoy, made the remark while
briefing Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan on the outcome of his
present regional tour which is part of Russia's efforts to put the
peace process back on track, Jordan's official news agency Petra
reported.
</P>
<P>
A solution for the problem between the Palestinians and
Israelis should be found before the new year, the agency quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, details of the special envoy's idea have not been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk said that Russia believed that the two sides were
committed to peace but the problem was that each side had its own
conditions and demands.
</P>
<P>
Russia held that the door between the Palestinians and Israelis
was closed, but there were windows from which the mediators could
enter to help overcome the deadlock between the two sides, said
the special envoy who arrived here Wednesday from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Russia would continue its efforts to help resume talks
between Israel and the Arab states, said Posuvalyuk who earlier
held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel
Aviv and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in the West Bank
city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Russia's willingness to cooperate with the United
States, the European Union and all the concerned parties in the
region to push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hassan reiterated Jordan's support for
the Palestinian demand that Israel carry out all its obligations
under the interim accords.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at a press conference after meeting Netanyahu and
Arafat, Posuvalyuk said that all sides should strictly abide by
all the signed peace accords and not take any unilateral moves
that would influence the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk was named special envoy in heel of Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov's visit to the region in November.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have rejected a recent Israeli cabinet
decision to implement only a limited one-phase redeployment to
withdraw from 6-8 percent of the West Bank. Jordan supported the
rejection.
</P>
<P>
The signed Palestinian-Israeli interim accords stipulate
that Israeli redeployment from 90 percent of the West Bank be
implemented in a three-phase withdrawal to be finished by
mid-1998.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Should Learn From Mistakes: Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU (PF)
President Robert Mugabe today urged the party's top leadership to
take stock of its weaknesses and strengths and draw up a
realistic agenda for the third national party conference.
</P>
<P>
Opening a central committee meeting ahead of the conference
which kicks off in Mutare of east Zimbabwe on Friday, Mugabe said
in order to attain a high level of achievement, party leaders
must continue to draw lessons from their own past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
"The many new tasks that we are facing are great challenges
indeed. But we can never tackle them successfully unless we begin
by taking stock of ourselves and effecting remedial measures," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe urged the party's central committee to listen to the
over 5,000 delegates attending the conference.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the main issues to be discussed was land
following the recent controversial designation of 1,480 farms by
the government under the 1992 land acquisition act.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe urged delegates to the conference to deliberate on the
land issue as openly as possible.
</P>
<P>
"In this respect, all party members here should discuss this
issue frankly and in detail, focusing properly on how the land to
be acquired should be distributed and managed without any
decrease in production," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "increased production and productivity in
agriculture should be the watchword."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Thursday afternoon a full report of the National
Land Acquisition Committee, which was charged by ZANU (PF)
National Chairman Joseph Msika, was submitted to the politburo
meeting and later to the central committee meeting for adoption
in readiness for presentation to the national party conference on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe will present the central committee report to the
national party conference on Friday which he said would focus on
the land question, the indigenization of the economy, state
assistance to former freedom fighters, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the
state of the party and gender issues.

<HEADLINE> Somali Negotiators Agree on Federal Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The participants of the
on-going Somali negotiations in Cairo have agreed upon the need
for a national reconciliation conference and the establishment of
a government based on federal system with regional autonomy.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed here today by Ismail Warsame, Executive
Assistant to the Somali National Salvation Council (SNSC).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local press, he said the Cairo
negotiation which is being attended by delegates of SNSC and
Hussein Aideed's faction, has yet other crucial issues to
resolve.
</P>
<P>
He added, the venue of the reconciliation conference,
representation at the conference and the leaving of Hussein
Aideed's militia from occupied regions around Mogadishu are among
the issues yet to be resolved at the negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Warsame stressed that "for the national reconciliation
conference to succeed, it is absolutely necessary for Hussein
Aideed's militia to leave those places."
</P>
<P>
The venue of the national reconciliation conference, which is
decided by SNSC at the Sodere peace conference to be at Bossasso,
is being discussed at the Cairo negotiation between SNSC and
Hussein Aideed's group, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, some 12 committees comprising more than 200 members
are working hard in Bossasso for the reconciliation conference to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement reached by the negotiation parties
in Cairo, they have approved the establishment of a three-year
period transitional government.
</P>
<P>
A presidential council composed of 13 members elected by the
National Reconciliation Conference will be established. The
members of the presidential council will on their part elect a
president by a simple majority vote. The date of the
reconciliation conference will be decided following the
conclusion of the Cairo negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Moi to Get 40 Percent of Vote: Opinion Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The results of an opinion poll
showed that the incumbent President Daniel arap Moi will capture
40.8 percent of the vote in the December 29 General Election.
</P>
<P>
The poll conducted by the Institute for Education in Democracy
(IED) predicted that Moi will get at least 25 percent of the vote
in seven of Kenya's eight provinces.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Constitution provides that the winning presidential
candidate must gather at least 25 percent of the vote in at least
five of Kenya's eight provinces.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here today by IED said that Mwai Kibaki,
Chairman of the opposition Democratic Party of Kenya, will rank
second with 13.7 percent and opposition Social Democratic Party
Chairman Charity Ngilu will finish third with 12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first multi-party elections held in 1992, Moi garnered
35.8 percent of the vote with Kenneth Matiba getting 26.4 percent
and Kibaki 20.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Matiba is not a candidate this year as he refused to register
as a voter, and he has called for a boycott against the coming
General Election.
</P>
<P>
The poll indicated that 11 percent of those questioned were
undecided about whom to vote for.
</P>
<P>
The IED pointed out that "with the campaigns kicking off, the
results could change substantially."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the poll was conducted on November 29
and 30, and involved 1,500 households from 42 out of the 210
constituencies in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
IED which receives official funds from the U.S., Britain and
Scandinavian countries is one of the most established Kenyan
non-governmental organizations in the democracy field.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Minister of
Agriculture Shawki Fakhoury announced today that Libya has agreed
to open its market to Lebanese agricultural products in a bid to
help Lebanese farmers market their crop.
</P>
<P>
The minister said at a news conference that the agreement was
reached by Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and its Libyan
counterpart Muammar Gaddafi during a phone call Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
He said that Libya had agreed to import as much Lebanese
produce as it can, including apples, vegetable, especially
grapes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Gaddafi has given order to facilitate the export of
Lebanese produce to Libya and speed up the work, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fakhoury said that the contact between Hrawi and Gaddafi was a
positive step which led to the opening of Libya's market to
Lebanese agricultural and industrial products.
</P>
<P>
This year, Lebanese farmers have seen a bumper harvest in
crops, especially potato, grapes and apples. But they are facing
problems in selling them out.
</P>
<P>
Besides Libya, the Lebanese government has also gained
agreement from six gulf states and Jordan to import Lebanese
agricultural products.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Shift Foreign Policy on Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States' foreign
policy on Africa is set to shift from that of dictating on how
the continent's leaders should run their countries to that of
forging partnerships, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
African Affairs Susan Rice said today.
</P>
<P>
"In the past there was too much finger waving diplomacy with
the U.S. telling African governments on what to do," said Rice.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to listen and hear from the leadership on what
role the U.S. can play in Africa. The U.S. can play a
constructive role when it is desired by the governments of the
regions," she said.
</P>
<P>
She was fielding questions from journalists and interested
groups from Harare, Kampala and Addis Ababa via satellite ahead
of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to seven
African countries beginning December 8, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.S. was "very encouraged" by the trend whereby
African leaders now took the primary responsibility of solving
their own problems. Meanwhile, Rice expressed frustration that
reconciliation was still to be achieved in war-torn Somalia,
saying solution to the crisis in the Horn of Africa country
rested squarely with the Somalis themselves.
</P>
<P>
Albright's trip will focus on advancing U.S. interests in the
Great Lakes region, developing partnership with a new generation
of African leaders and reaching out directly to people,
particularly the youth who will take Africa into the 21st
century, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.

<HEADLINE> People Killed by Mysterious Animal in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The northeastern region of
Bari in Somalia is facing fatalities from a mysterious animal at
a time when the southern regions of the country are suffering
from natural disasters caused by heavy rains and floods.
</P>
<P>
In the last 15 days, six people have died and eight others
were wounded after they were attacked and eaten by the unknown
animal in Bari region.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the VHF radios, the animal, small
and skinny with white tail attacked the people in the less
populated areas outside the towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
On Monday and Tuesday this week, the animal has eaten two
people in the town of Qardo, nearly 150 km south of the regional
capital, Bossaso.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the animal about the size of a wolf jumped on
the torso of the person and sucked the blood and then ate the
flesh with all the bones.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the animal has the ability to
finish the whole body of the person within minutes before anyone
comes for his/her help.
</P>
<P>
The pieces of three human being flesh believably eaten by
these animals were also found in two other districts, Iskushban
and Hurdia a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The last known victim was a woman wounded by the animal
locally given the name of 'Hintifaa' who was brought to a
hospital in Bossaso yesterday after gunmen rushed out for her
rescue. The gunmen have reportedly shot and killed the animal.
The body of the animal was also dragged to Bossaso where the
people watched it for several hours before setting it on fire.
</P>
<P>
Eight more animals of this kind were also killed after
numerous gunmen went out to hunt for them in the country.
</P>
<P>
The people of the region believe that these animals have
originally crossed from the border with Ethiopia into Somalia.
The eyewitnesses also said the animals usually wait for the
people near the garbage collection sites where they also eat the
thrown out animal bones.

JOHANNESBURG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The El Nino weather
phenomenon is still in a position to cause dry, scorching weather
in Southern Africa in the next few months, a local weather expert
has predicted.
</P>
<P>
The dry weather is expected despite good rain in South Africa
recently. Up to 120 millimeters of rain had fallen in a number of
planting areas, and more rain is expected in the next two weeks
in spite of El Nino, said weather expert Willem Landman.
</P>
<P>
However, Landman warned that there was no reason to believe
the El Nino weather pattern had weakened.
</P>
<P>
He said the effects of El Nino should begin to be felt later
this month.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is a warming of the South Pacific, which causes
adverse weather conditions in many parts of the world, including

<HEADLINE> Egyptians Embrace High-Tech at Mideast Biggest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is trying to take the
advantage of the opportunity to develop its information technology
(IT) as the largest IT show in the Arab world, Cairo Telecomp '97,
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
With over 180 companies from 25 Arab, European, American and
Asian countries and regions, the list of exhibitors at the show
reads like a "Who is Who" of the international telecommunications
and IT community.
</P>
<P>
In its second year, the International Telecom, IT, Satellite
and Broadcasting Technology Trade Fair for the Arab-North Africa,
has established itself as an indispensable event for the regional
market, Martin Marz, managing director of the fair, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
On the show grounds, as computer professionals took advantage
of a free access to the Internet in the conference hall, curious
visitors were attracted to the eye-catching stands of some
international high-tech heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
Arianespace, the world's first space transportation company
based in Europe, placed a model of the NILESAT, Egypt's first
satellite due to be launched early next year, in the center of a
flood-lit platform in the Cairo International Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
The French-made NILESAT, a 158-million-U.S. dollar project,
will be able to transmit 12 channels, with each airing six
programs simultaneously through digital technology.
</P>
<P>
Experts told Xinhua that Egypt remains one of the world's last
large, untapped cellular markets. The telecommunications services
in Egypt are controlled by the sole telecommunications authority
TelecomEgypt.
</P>
<P>
The number of telephone lines in Egypt have been growing by 9.4
percent to reach 4,780,000 while each 100 subscribers own 7.9
lines in 1997, compared with 1.2 in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's personal computer market has grown at the world's
fastest rate for the second year in a row, according to the
International Data Corp., a leading industry monitor and
consultant.
</P>
<P>
Egypt saw shipment of nearly 84,000 units in 1996, registering
a growth of 46 percent than that of the previous year. The
nation's number of installed units reached 311,886 in the same
year, representing a growth rate of 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, out of the 62 million population, only 48,000
Egyptians use the pager installed since 1990, and mobiles
introduced here 13 months ago remain a pricey novelty.
</P>
<P>
Aware of the under-development of Egypt's telecommunications
industry, Egyptian Minister of Transport and Communications
Soliman Metwalli Soliman said at today's opening ceremony that
Arab and North African countries have to carve out a place for
themselves in the IT market.
</P>
<P>
The importance of information can never be overestimated as it
has now taken on the function of a fourth productive factor in
addition to the classic productive factors of labor, soil and
capital, said Marz.
</P>
<P>
In parallel to four days of crowds of visitors at the booths,
fertile talks, negotiations and seminars will be held.
</P>
<P>
Under the slogan "Middle East through Communication," ministers
of Algeria, Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Syria, will attend
various workshops and symposiums during the four-day fair, in a
bid to boost the Arab telecommunications industry whose revenues
account for 1.2 percent of the world total.

<HEADLINE> Ministerial Panel Fails Again to Agree on Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The ministerial committee
responsible for formulating Israel's second redeployment in West
Bank and guidelines on the permanent talks with the Palestinians
held second meeting here today, but again failed to reach an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
before his departure for an European tour, which will take him to
Germany and France for a series of important meetings with
European leaders to discuss the peace process.
</P>
<P>
All other committee members, including Foreign Minister David
Levy, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted an aide to one of the ministers as saying
that the committee held "serious deliberations" over mapping the
extent of another redeployment and the guidelines for impending
final-status talks with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The aide disclosed that the committee was equally divided
between Netanyahu and Sharon, who favored the establishment of an
expansive security zone, and Levy and Mordechai, who insisted that
the security zone could be much smaller. Levy and Mordechai
reportedly said that Israel should go forward with the second
redeployment in order to win diplomatic points.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during an inspection tour to the Eretz Crossing
between Israel and Gaza Strip, Mordechai said Israel must carry
out the second redeployment because it will open the way for the
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The minister denied a power struggle within the ministerial
panel over the further redeployment, adding he expected an
agreement to be reached during Sunday's session. He also stressed
that there was no pressure from the United States on Israel over
the redeployment issue, adding that all decisions will be based on
Israel's best interests.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial panel is to meet against next week upon
Netanyahu's return from his current visits to Germany and France in
a bid to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu flied to the German capital of Bonn late this
afternoon for talks with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He then
will travel to Paris Friday to hold meetings with United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and French President Jacques
Chirac to discuss the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright is expected to push for Israel's carrying out the
delayed second redeployment in the West Bank and its agreement to
a time-out of Israeli settlements so to advance the stalemated
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Israeli state television Channel I Wednesday,
Levy said he thought that his proposal for keeping the settlement
activities to a minimal level could satisfy the demand for a
time-out of settlement expansion as put forward by Albright.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said Wednesday that Washington was
not satisfied with the Israeli-set 6-8 percent of further
redeployment as reported by the media, while saying the PNA's
hope for getting most of the West Bank in the final settlement was
also unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is trying to bridging the huge gap between the two
sides in order to achieve progress in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the Netanyahu-Albright talks, the second held
in Europe for the past weeks, would likely have impact on the
much-expected summit between Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been trying hard to arrange this summit during
Netanyahu's visit to the U.S. last month, but Clinton snubbed the
Israeli leader to express his dissatisfaction with his handling of
the peace process.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Second Annual Loan for Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today announced the approval of the second annual loan
for Tanzania, an equivalent to 97 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to support Tanzania's economic
program for 1997/98. The initial amount of some 69.8 million
dollars has been increased by about 27.17 million dollars to
assist the eastern African nation in dealing with the effect of
drought.
</P>
<P>
The loan is made available in two equal semiannual
installments, the first of which can be disbursed on December 19,
this year.
</P>
<P>
The key macroeconomic objectives of the 1997/98 program include
achieving a real GDP growth rate of 4.7 percent, reducing the
inflation rate to no more than 13 percent and limiting the external
current account deficit to some 14.4 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania joined the IMF in September, 1962. Its quota is about
200 million dollars equivalent and its outstanding use of IMF
financing currently totals about 204 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Egypt FM Says Ties with Qatar Remain Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that the Egyptian-Qatari ties remain good,
adding that the two countries enjoy a permanent friendship.
</P>
<P>
"Egyptian-Qatari ties are good at present, were good in the
past and will remain good in the future," Moussa told reporters,
apparently playing down the recent tense relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
"What happened was just an exception to that rule," he added,
describing Wednesday's talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani as "good."
</P>
<P>
Mediated by Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Qatar Wednesday patched
up their disputes during the meeting between the leaders of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid today voiced his delight over success of Saudi
Arabia's mediation to dispel the cloud that enveloped the Arab
giant and the small Gulf emirate.
</P>
<P>
"I hope such way of settling inter-misunderstandings would be
applied all along," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Qatari relations deteriorated in October when Egypt
was ready to boycott the fourth Middle East and North Africa
economic conference which was held in the Qatari capital of Doha
last month.
</P>
<P>
Qatar responded with a ban on the entry of nationals of Egypt
alongside other nine countries as a security precaution for the
Doha conference, infuriating Cairo and other Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Adding fuel to their row were Qatar's charges that Egypt had
plotted the 1996 coup attempt to overthrow the Gulf sheikdom's
emir. Egypt rejected the charges and demanded for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
Signals for solving the crisis came to the fore Monday as their
war of words on the media eased amid intensive mediation by Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The reconciliation bids involved messages sent by Saudi King
Fahd to the leaders of Egypt and Qatar and visits by their foreign
ministers to Riyadh before Wednesday's summit.

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds More American Youth Accept "Separate but </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- More young people in the
United States have come to see nothing wrong with the races
keeping to themselves as long as they are not discriminated
against, said a poll released Wednesday by MTV, the youth-oriented
cable network.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 54 percent of young people characterize
race relations as "good," compared with 42 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
But young people seem increasingly accepting of the "separate
but equal" concept -- the phrase at the heart of the civil rights
dispute that poses the question whether separate facilities can
ever be equal.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, 41 percent of youth said it was "OK if the races are
basically separate from one another in our country as long as
everyone has equal opportunities." That figure rose to 68 percent
in the 1997 survey.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of those who disagree with the "separate but
equal" philosophy fell from 57 percent in 1991 to 31 percent
today.
</P>
<P>
"What young people are saying in this poll, and what our
audience tells us, is that there is still much work to be done,"
said Judy McGrath, MTV President. "This is no time for
complacency."
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted from September 17-30 by GarinHartYang
Research, sampled more than 750 people aged 15-24. The margin of
error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> UK Car Insurers to Pay NHS Crash Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The British government plans to
force insurance companies to be charged for the cost of National
Health Service (NHS) treatment for road crash victims, said local
press reports today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Health Secretary Frank Dobson will unveil
the plan today and he will also order hospital chiefs to claw back
millions of pounds from the cost of treating crash victims over
the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Although the power to claim back care costs from insurers has
been in place since the 1930s, it has not been widely used and the
NHS has been put off claiming by time-consuming procedures.
</P>
<P>
That is why the government will announce a change in the law to
ensure insurance firms automatically pay up.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, insurance firms covering a driver who caused an
accident will pay up to 3,000 pounds (5,040 US dollars) for
hospital care and 300 pounds for outpatient treatment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, insurers will also be asked to meet the cost of an
ambulance sent to the crash scene.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 300,000 people are treated by the
NHS each year for car crash injuries at a cost of around 440
million pounds (739.2 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to save around 100 million pounds (168
million US dollars) a year, but at the same time, will increase
car insurance premiums for the country's 23 million motorists by
up to 20 pounds per annum.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Financial Crisis Will Be Over Soon, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis
will be over soon with the joint efforts of the international
world and governments of Asian countries, officials and economists
asserted here today.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar hosted here today by the Asia Society, a
non-governmental organization engaged in promoting U.S.-Asian
relationship, U.S. trade officials and economists shared their
views on the latest development of the financial market in
Southeast Asia and its impact on trade, financial and investment
issues globally.
</P>
<P>
The guest speakers, including John Wolf, U.S. Coordinator for
APEC, and Harinder Kohli, Senior Operations Advisor from the World
Bank, indicated again the need for Asian countries to open their
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Robert Denham, Chairman and CEO of the Salomon, Inc., turned
down the idea that speculators played a big role in the Asian
crisis. "What weighs more is the economic fundamentals," he said,
adding that bad loans and poor management of banks and security
institutions are very obvious problems.
</P>
<P>
China more or less survived the crisis this time, but for a
long-term protection, it should quicken the steps of opening its
financial market, according to Malcolm Binks, Senior Vice
President of the International Department of Merrill Lynch, a
leading securities firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
Binks said that Hong Kong has successfully overcome the crisis
with its pegging system between the H.K. dollar and U.S. dollar.
The system will continue to work in a short term. But he said it
is expensive for Hong Kong to stick to the system in a long term,
especially when its neighbors have devaluated their currencies.
</P>
<P>
Binks also said that he believed the financial crisis in Asia
will be over soon, because of the pressure of investors and
measures taken by the governments. But the medicine and dosage
will be different for the ailment of different countries,
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
The speakers also agreed that Asia's financial woes will not
affect too much on the still-strong U.S. economy. But according to
the latest surveys of the U.S. Federal Reserve, U.S. manufacturers
were starting to feel the impact of the Asian Crisis. Sales to the
region slowed a bit, and Asian competitors were cutting prices on
imports to the U.S., widening the trade gap.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Determined to Remain in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany today affirmed
their determination to maintain their military presence in Bosnia
after June 1998, when the Stabilization Force (SFOR) ends its
mission.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his French counterpart
Hubert Vedrine, who made a visit to Sarajevo today, said that a
military guarantee for the peace process in Bosnia would be
necessary after the date, according reports from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel and Vedrine met with the three members of the Bosnian
presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, Kresimir Zubak and Momcilo
Krajisnik, as well as the president of Republika Srpska, Biljan
Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the two ministers to Bosnia came before the
holding of the meeting in Bonn on December 9-10 by members of the
follow-up committee of the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French Defense Minister Alain Richard said today
that the United States government should not use the U.S. Congress
as "an alibi" in the discussion about the post-SFOR period in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Radio-Television Luxembourg (RTL),
Richard also said that he is convinced the United States will
maintain its presence in Bosnia after June 1998, when the SFOR
completes its mission.

<HEADLINE> China Spells out Position on Security Council Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- China reiterated today
that the enlargement of the U.N. Security Council should follow
the principle of equitable geographical distribution and ensure a
proper balance between the developing and developed nations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations Qin Huasun told the
52nd Session of U.N. General Assembly that the international
community needs to be vigilant against the proposal for
admitting some countries into the Security Council in a "quick
fix" manner "through the backdoor".
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the fact that although the so-called quick fix
proposal has been turned down, a small number of countries are
still using such argument as "to view the question practically and
take into full consideration of the actual situation in various
different regions" as an excuse to practice double standards and
discriminate against developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The hard-won understanding about the sufficient representation
of developing countries in the Security Council should be the
basis and prerequisite for future reform of the Council, he said,
noting that "any reform plan that deviates from this common
understanding will not be feasible."
</P>
<P>
Attaching importance to the transparency of the Council's work,
Qin said China has always worked actively in this regard.
</P>
<P>
China paid much attention to improving the efficiency of the
work of the Council when assuming the presidency of the Council
in November, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
China properly handled many urgent issues while trying hard to
enhance the transparency by briefing non-Council members the same
day when consultations were held.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China is in favor of the Council's enlargement, but it
maintains that full and patient discussions and consultations are
needed.
</P>
<P>
"Any action to set a deadline to the reform or force a vote on
certain proposal in the General Assembly when conditions are not
yet ripe will bring about serious consequences," he warned.

WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has talked with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the
Middle East peace process before she meets with Israeli and

on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that
Clinton and Albright agreed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat should "focus
intently on the immediate issues" that the United States had put
forward.

The issues include security cooperation, Israeli military
redeployments, a "time-out" in construction of Jewish
settlements and an "accelerated timing for negotiating final
status issues".
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Netanyahu and Arafat "know that that's the
agenda, and they can well expect the secretary to come prepared
to press those particular issues with determination."
</P>
<P>
Albright plans to meet Netanyahu in Paris on Friday and
Arafat in Geneva on Saturday on her way to a week-long trip to
Africa.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Russia's Offer to Reduce Forces on Baltic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States welcomed
Russia's offer to reduce military forces on its borders with the
Baltic states, a State Department spokesman announced today.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had an opportunity to study the proposals but we've
had a cursory look at them," said State Department spokesman James
Rubin when referring to a statement by Russian President Boris
Yeltsin during a current visit to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that Russia would unilaterally cut its ground and
naval forces by 40 percent in just over a year while his aides
said this would apply to northern Russia bordering the Baltic
states.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome efforts by all nations in the region to foster
stability and enhance regional cooperation," Rubin told a regular
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We also note that Russia previously proposed measures designed
for further cooperation among northern European states.... We
support such cooperation and are willing to participate actively
in it," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin stressed that the "inherent right of the Baltic
states to choose the means to ensure their own security" should be
respected.
</P>
<P>
The Baltic states, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, regained
their independence in 1991 from the former Soviet Union. They are
now applying for memberships of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Russia opposes any expansion of NATO to the Baltic states while
the U.S. says Russia has no veto over which east European country
can join the alliance.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Launches Investment Fund for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Thursday launched a 650 million U.S. fund to boost American
companies' investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
George sunoz, head of the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation, said the launch of the fund showed "this region is
a priority for the U.S. private sector as well as the American
government."
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade with Africa has increased sharply in the past
several years, outpacing growth with all other areas of the
world. In 1996, it grew by 18.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The fund will support investments in natural resources,
telecommunications and manufacturing in 29 sub-Saharan nations.
Another fund, expected to be introduced early next year, will
provide 500 million U.S. dollars to support investments in African
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's launch of the new fund is the result of Clinton
administration initiative to expand the economic relationship
between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa by lowering
tariffs, encouraging free-market reforms and urging international
lending organizations such as the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund to forgive some of the debts of the continent's
poorest countries.
