GUIYANG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou Province

vice-governor Lou Jiwei announced here this evening.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 investment projects will be up for bids at this

</P>
<P>
Lou said at a news briefing that most of the projects will be
in the fields of energy, raw materials, transportation, and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
"China's effort to shift its investment and construction
emphasis to central and western areas will enable Guizhou to
accelerate its development pace," Lou pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Official sources have said that the central government has
decided to increase its investment in infrastructure in Guizhou
over the next few years. A project to electrify a railway line
from Guizhou's Shuicheng to Zhuzhou of neighboring Hunan Province,
at a total cost of 20 billion yuan, will soon be started, Lou said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Guizhou will, over the next five years,
allocate billions of yuan for building a highway system that
connects all parts of the province and extends to the neighboring
provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hunan, and Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The vice-governor revealed that Guiyang's Longdongbao Airport,
the largest in southwest China, will be commissioned to use on

NICOSIA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali's special representative for Cyprus Han Sung-Joo
will be informed on all aspects of the protracted Cyprus problem
during his forthcoming visit to the island, Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his return from a two-week visit abroad, President
Clerides said Han "is still at a stage where he is being informed
on the most important and difficult" issues relating to the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
"He will be in Cyprus to be briefed on all the aspects and
difficulties in the Cyprus question rather than offer solutions,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
Clerides described Han as a very serious and positive person
whom he respects.
</P>

Han, who begins his six-day visit Tuesday, is expected to meet

The envoy will also meet with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf

<HEADLINE> Violence in Pakistan's Capital Twin City Controlled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani police have
controlled the violent protest today launched by an opposition
party in Rawalpindi, the twin city of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
About 600 Jamaat-e-Islami activists staged a sit-in in
Rawalpindi this morning against the recently-announced federal
budget for fiscal year 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
They tried to proceed into the capital and protest in front of
the prime minister's secretariat.
</P>
<P>
However, a large number of policemen blocked the routes between
Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Instead of going back, the protesters broke away the barricades
and clashed with the police.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, some 40 armed protesters
suddenly got off a bus and opened fire on the police, who returned
fire.
</P>
<P>
About five people including a policeman were killed and 48
others including 10 policemen were injured during the incident.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar said that some
Pakistani army troops were called in to reinforce the police but
the troops have returned to their barracks now.
</P>
<P>
Many Pakistani officials condemned the violence resulting from
a demonstration, saying that it was destructive politics.
</P>
<P>
They were of the view that Jamaat-e-Islami should come out with
alternate budgetary proposals in the National Assembly instead
resorting to outside agitation.
</P>
<P>
They said that many Afghan nationals in the procession were the
major trouble-makers in the incident.

<HEADLINE> Zhou Nan on Provisional Legislature in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of the
Provisional Legislative Council is necessary and it has legal
basis, said Zhou Nan, director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong
Branch.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Time magazine last Saturday, Zhou said
that the establishment of the Provisional Legislative Council is
to fill the legislative vacuum in 1997 when the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) is formed.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was the British authorities who derailed the
through train in Hong Kong as it acted against the Sino-British
Joint Declaration, the principle of Convergence with the Basic Law
and the agreements and understandings reached between the Chinese
and British sides.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Provisional Legislative Council will settle
many issues at the early period of the SAR, including the
issuance of the SAR passport and regulations governing the use of
the passport, the endorsement of the judges-designate of the Court
of Final Appeal and other courts.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the Basic Law, there will be a Hong
Kong Basic Law Committee under China's National People's Congress,
and six members on the committee will have to be nominated jointly
by Hong Kong's legislative organ and other bodies.
</P>
<P>
"The Provisional Legislative Council is indispensable to the
Hong Kong SAR," Zhou Nan said.
</P>
<P>
As for the members of the Provisional Legislative Council, he
said that they will be elected by a selection committee.
</P>
<P>
He said personally he hoped that more than one-half of the
present sitting legislators can join the future Provisional
Legislative Council. But it is up to the selection committee to
decide, he added.

<HEADLINE> Uzbekistan Urges for More Italian Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Uzbekistan
President Islam Karimov said today his country wished to start
more joint ventures with Italy.
</P>
<P>
Italy has so far neglected "the Uzbek trail," as it has only 19
joint ventures with Uzbekistan compared with 200 of the United
States and 170 of Germany, said Karimov.
</P>
<P>
However, he said foreign investment had exceeded 1 billion
U.S. dollars in his country less than five years after the former
Soviet republic gained its independence.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a group of local entrepreneurs on the sidelines of
the EU summit underway in Florence, Italy, Karimov also offered a
five-year tax exemption to foreign companies with investment in
his country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Uzbekistan and the 15-nation EU on Friday signed a
cooperation agreement on wide-ranging fields, which is similar to
accords already struck between the EU and other former Soviet
republics.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, new companies will be set up and
intellectual property and investment protected. The EU will also
offer technical assistance to Uzbekistan and help it join the
World Trade Organization.

JOHANNESBURG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- There was no ''fixed'' list of
South Africa's 10,000 most wanted criminals, National Police
Commissioner George Fivaz said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria, Fivaz said it was misleading to
refer to a fixed and static list due to the fluid crime situation.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling a long-term police plan on June 13, Fivaz promised the
arrests of the country's 10,000 most wanted criminals, already
identified, within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
The police plan, which formed part of the national crime
prevention strategy, maped out a concerted effort to bring south
Africa's rising crime rate under control.
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, Fivaz said serious crime suspects identified
after the launch of the police plan would also be targeted in terms
of this objective.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Apologizes Over "Comfort Women" Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto today publicly apologized to the so-called
"comfort women" over their being forced into sex slaves at the
Japanese army brothels during World War II.
</P>
<P>
"I extend my wholehearted apology and remorse (to the women
involved)," said Hashimoto at a joint press conference with South
Korean President Kim Young-sam on South Korea's southern resort
island of Cheju after their summit talks.
</P>
<P>
"The 'comfort women' issue is the one which most severely hurt
the prestige and dignity of women," he said.
</P>
<P>
Historians say that as many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans,
were recruited as "comfort women" for the Japanese army as it
invaded East and Southeast Asia in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Peninsula had been under the Japanese colonial rule
from 1910 until Japan's World War II defeat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said, "we are trying to work out a dream about future
while embracing the weight of the past, taking advantage of the
co-hosting of the World Cup (with South Korea)."
</P>
<P>
The co-hosting of the World Cup event tops the agenda in the
summit talks today. On May 31, the International Football
Federation decided in Zurich, Switzerland, that South Korea and
Japan will jointly host the 2002 World Cup soccer finals.
</P>
<P>
"I have said on several occasions since my inauguration as the
prime minister that we cannot escape from the weight of the past
and the responsibility of the future," Hashimoto noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was a second-grade elementary school student at
the time when Japan was defeated in World War II and that he
learned since then the reality about unhappy things involving the
history of Japan and Korea.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, I could never imagine how enormous the suffering
(the Japanese colonial policy of) forcing Koreans to change their
names to Japanese ones brought to the minds of the Korean people
might have been, although I have never learned that kind of thing
at school," the Japanese prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
President Kim said that he and Hashimoto agreed to cooperate
closely to make the 2002 World Cup football finals a most
successful one in the World Cup history.
</P>
<P>
"To the end, we agreed that both governments maintain a close
liaison system," Kim added.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said he agreed with Kim that they will make efforts
to foster an atmosphere for an early conclusion of bilateral
fisheries agreement for orderly fishing in seas between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> MPs-elect from Bangladeshi BNP Party Take Oath </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- MPs from the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP), the largest opposition in the country, took oath here
this evening.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Sheikh Razzak Ali administered the oath-taking ceremony
for the 107 BNP MPs and three from other parties.
</P>
<P>
The BNP, former ruling party, obtained 116 out of 300
parliamentary seats in the country's seventh elections while the
Awami (people's) League (AL) won 146 seats and formed the new
government Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that BNP chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia and
another BNP MP-elect who have won five and two seats respectively
did not attend the ceremony today because they could not yet
decide which seat they would retain and which they would
surrender.
</P>
<P>
As per constitutional provision, they have to retain only one
seat each before taking oath.
</P>
<P>
Asked to make comments on the current situation, Khaleda said,
"I am yet to take oath and will express my reaction after oath
taking."
</P>
<P>
But a BNP MP said that the party would play a "positive role"
as opposition in the parliament. The party will form a "shadow
cabinet" so that new leadership could emerge in the party, he
said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about BNP reaction to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's
call for seeking cooperation, the BNP MP said, "We are not still
clear about the formation of the government."
</P>
<P>
"We will first confirm whether it is a coalition government or
a national government. Thereafter we would decide what we would do
over the question of lending cooperation," he added.

<HEADLINE> Spain, China to Seek Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Spain must continue developing good
relations with China which "will become one of the biggest
economic powers in the world in the next 25 years," the local
newspaper "El Pais" said today.
</P>
<P>
El Pais (The Nation) was one of the influential Spanish
newspapers that carried articles on Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's four-day official visit to Spain beginning today.
</P>
<P>
The papers, which included El Mundo (the World) and ABC, said
that the Chinese president's trip is of great significance in the
history of Spanish-Chinese ties and will further strengthen
political and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders also hailed Jiang's visit.
</P>
<P>
Enrique Fanjul, president of the Spanish-Chinese Enterprise
Committee, told Xinhua that Jiang's visit "is a new milestone in
the political and economic relations between Spain and China."
</P>
<P>
"President Jiang's visit comes at an important moment as China
is now carrying out its new five-year economic plan. Many Spanish
entrepreneurs hope to take the advantage of the current visit to
play a bigger role in China's economic development during this
period," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Jiang is expected to meet King of Spain Juan
Carlos I and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to discuss bilateral
and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Spain is the first leg of Jiang's six-nation European and Asian
tour, which will also take him to Norway, Romania, Uzbekistan,
Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.

<HEADLINE> One Million SADC Citizens to Become S.African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- About one million citizens
from member states of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) are expected to qualify for permanent residence in South
Africa, the Home Affairs Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said the total number of illegal immigrants in
south Africa was estimated to be between two and four million
people.
</P>
<P>
''We expect that about one million of them will qualify for
permanent residence in terms of the recent cabinet decision in
this regard,'' he told a press conference in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
In a statement in Pretoria earlier today, Home Affairs
Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi invited such aliens to apply for
exemption.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, citizens from Angola, Botswana,
Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe would qualify if they complied with
four criteria.
</P>
<P>
They should be able to demonstrate or provide evidence of
continuous residence in South Africa from July 1991, be engaged
in productive formal or informal economic activity, have
dependent children born or residing lawfully in the country, and
have no criminal record.
</P>
<P>
The South African government will implement new immigrant
regulations starting from July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said the exemption excluded contract workers such as
miners as these persons had temporary residence status in south
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Applications should be made at any office of the Department of
Home Affairs between July 1 and September 30 this year, he added.

<HEADLINE> Some 1,130 to Run in Japan's Next General Election: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- About 1,130 candidates will run in
the next House of Representatives election, which will be held
under a new electoral system, a Kyodo News survey said today.
</P>
<P>
About 1,050 candidates will vie for 300 seats under the
single-seat constituency system, and the figure includes some 30
who are also slated to be listed as candidates for the
proportional representation system, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 will join only the race in the proportional
representation system, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will field nearly 280
candidates, including 259 officially sanctioned and three
recommended candidates, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Japan's main opposition party will compete for almost all
single-seat constituencies in densely populated prefectures,
including Kanagawa, Tokyo, Aichi, Osaka and Fukuoka, the survey
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Although the Social Democratic Party (SDP) has decided to field
150 candidates for single-seat constituencies, fewer than its
previous goal, it has picked 80 candidates, the survey
said.

TOKYO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
said here today that his just-concluded visit to South Korea
established a bilateral relationship under which the top leaders
of the two countries can meet for "frank talks."

<HEADLINE> International Symposium on Natural Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A four-day international symposium
on sustainable use of natural resources started here today,
attracting at least 100 delegates from 20 African countries.
</P>
<P>
Opening the symposium, Zimbabwe's Deputy Minister for
Environment and Tourism Edward Chindori-Chininga stressed African
countries need to actively promote the full range of natural
resource utilisation opportunities existing at local level.
</P>
<P>
''Options such as eco-tourism, cultural tourism,
bird-watching, as well as the harvesting and processing of
secondary products such as mopane worms, thatch and termites all
need to be explored,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in pursuing the various options and
developing multiple-use management strategies, emphasis should be
made on maximising local employment and local income generation.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''our eyes need to be kept firmly on the
socio-economic principles essential to sustainable natural
resource management. No strategy will ever be accepted at the
community level unless locally secured benefits exceed the
locally borne costs, and unless the profit margins are
competitive with other land use options."
</P>
<P>
The symposium is being jointly organised by the University of
Zimbabwe, the World Conservation Union and the Organisation of
French Technical Cooperation. enditem

understanding, increase trust, expand common ground and promote
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
In a written statement at the airport, Jiang, who was greeted
by Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes and other senior

<P>
He said that in recent years, bilateral cooperation in all

<HEADLINE> No One Can Split ANC-SACP-COSATU Alliance, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 24 (Xinhua) --South African President
Nelson Mandela today emphasised the close relationship between
the African National Congress (ANC), the South African Communist
Party (SACP) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions
(COSATU), saying no one could split ANC-SACP-COSATU alliance.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of ANC supporters at an election rally in
Inzinga of Kwazulu/Natal Province, Mandela said there is a
powerful common purpose linking the alliance between the three
organisations.
</P>
<P>
''Nobody can induce us to part with the SACP and COSATU. We
fought together. We will hold their hands,'' said the president.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's comments came after a recent upsurge of criticism by
opposition parties about the forthcoming Kwazulu/Natal local
government elections on Wednesday to distance ANC from both
COSATU and the SCAP.
</P>
<P>
Inkatha Freedom Party Leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on
Sunday the ANC is heavily influenced by ''marxist'' thinking,
particularly with regard to economics and religion.
</P>
<P>
Howeverr, Mandela told the crowd that COSATU and the SACP had
made significant contributions to the struggle against apartheid
and are important allies of the ANC.
</P>
<P>
''We will not listen to advice from those who folded their
arms while we were fighting,'' said the president, adding no
decent freedom fighter could do that.

<HEADLINE> Talks Held Between Pak Gov't, Business on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Talks between the Pakistani
government and the business community started here today to solve
the problems facing the business community in the national budget
1996-97.
</P>
<P>
The official Associated Press of Pakistan said that the meeting
was held in a cordial and amiable atmosphere with common
understanding.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) was led by its President Ilyas
Bilour while the government team was headed by Asif Ali Zardari,
chairman of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Council and
husband of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government announced the budget for the fiscal
year of July 1996 to June 1997 this month, imposing the heaviest
tax in the country's history, which drew protest from many
sectors, especially the business community.
</P>
<P>
Bilour said after the meeting that the attitude of the
government team was very responsive, sympathetic and accommodating
towards business and trade community regarding their problems
pertaining to the budget.
</P>
<P>
Bilour expressed the hope for a positive and concrete result of
the three-day meeting on the budget.
</P>
<P>
The opposition called for a countrywide strike against the
budget Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, the FPPCI decided not to participate in the strike and
accepted the government's invitation for talks on the budget.
</P>
<P>
The main demands of the FPPCI presented to the government
included exemption of one house and one shop from wealth tax,
continuation of fixed sales tax scheme on 28 industries, reduction
in the rate of general sales tax and other issues pertaining to
sales tax and income tax and removal of anomalies in customs and
excise duty.
</P>
<P>
Four out of six major demands, the FPPCI president said, were
discussed today in detail as both sides were fully equipped with
arguments.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would continue Tuesday to take up issues relating
to customs and central excise.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after the meeting, Zardari said he was
confident of a positive outcome of the talks.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The business community is cooperating very well and
so is the government cooperating with them," adding, "I am very
satisfied with the FPCCI response."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA),
Pakistan Tanners Association and Presidents of three stock
exchanges in Pakistan also held separate meetings with the
government team led by Zardari.
</P>
<P>
They discussed their problems and difficulties relating to the
respective sectors and presented their proposals regarding the new
budget.

SEOUL, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean National Red Cross
(KNRC) plans to send medical supplies to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), a KNRC spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Pending DPRK's acceptance, the medical aid, to be sponsored by
a group of female South Korean pharmacists, will include vitamins,
the Red Cross spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
It could be the first time that medical supplies are sent from
South Korea to DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul government has asked all private South Korean donors
to channel their aid through the KNRC to help alleviate the severe
food shortage caused by flooding late last year in DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, since November, the KNRC has sent 10,000 blankets,
100,000 servings of instant noodles, 20,000 pairs of socks and
186,000 litres of edible oil to DPRK.
</P>
<P>

worth of wheat flour.

<HEADLINE> Dan Tichon Elected Israeli Parliament Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Dan Tichon, member of the
hardline Likud party, was elected today the new speaker of Israeli
Knesset (parliament) and pledged to end the tradition of stormy
parliamentary politics.
</P>
<P>
Tichon, former deputy speaker, defeated three other close
contenders to become the speaker of the 14th 120-member Knesset,
which was elected in the May 29 elections. He promised that he
would work to "calm things down" in the often stormy Knesset.
</P>
<P>
"You'll have to see, and you have already seen the calm in
today's (session) of Knesset," Tichon said, pointing to the
relative calm in today's plenum.
</P>
<P>
Today's session was opened against the background that Likud's
members of Knesset defied Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
request to postpone the vote.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu intended to pass the so-called Norwegian law to
bring his favorite Ovadia Eli, who was not elected, to the post of
speaker. If the Norwegian law is passed, all Likud's members
of Knesset holding cabinet portfolios will resign from the Knesset
to vacate their seats to other party members on lower places in
the party list.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Likud member of Knesset Uzi Landau was elected head
of the powerful Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, and Naomi
Blumenthal, chairwoman of the Immigration and Absorption
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Landau told reporters that he would beef up cooperation with
the newly created cabinet National Security Council. However, he
expressed regret that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher,
who is to arrive here Tuesday, has come here earlier.
</P>
<P>
He said that Christopher's visit was better made after his
committee "deliberating properly the details and characteristics"
of Israel's foreign policies.

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Base Referendum Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Okinawa prefectural
government today announced a referendum to ask local residents
whether or not they support a reduction in U.S. bases in Japan's
southernmost island prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The prefectural government also set up a special task force for
the referendum, which was voted for last week by the prefectural
assembly, Kyodo news service said.
</P>
<P>
The 13-member task force comprises three groups, one each to
take charge of public relations, coordination with local
governments, and general affairs, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bill for a special ordinance for the referendum was
proposed by the Okinawa branch of the Japanese Trade Union
Confederation (Rengo), Japan's largest labor organization,
following a petition backed by 34,500 signatures for the
residential vote, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is the first of the kind in a prefecture.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of all land used by the U.S. military in Japan
is concentrated in Okinawa Prefecture, although the island
prefecture makes up only 0.6 percent of Japan's total land area.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached in April between Japan and the
United States, the U.S. military will vacate some 20 percent of
the land it now occupies in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Defense Facilities Administration Agency asked
Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota to carry out the legal procedure for
forced rental of land in Okinawa for U.S. forces in place of the
heads of local governments who have refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
The request came after the heads of nine of the 10 cities,
towns and villages concerned refused to conduct the procedure
required to secure forced land rental contracts after the current
ones expire in May next year.
</P>
<P>
Ota, who himself has refused to cooperate with the central
government on forced land leasing in Okinawa for U.S. bases, is
expected to give the agency the cold shoulder, according to the
Kyodo report.
</P>
<P>
A public campaign was kicked off to press for a reduction in
the U.S. military base in Okinawa after a Japanese school girl was
raped in September last year by three American GIs based in the
island prefecture.

<HEADLINE> New Evidence Found Against Former South Korean President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President Chun
Doo-hwan was found to be involved in the illegal replacement of
the Combat Arms Training Command (CATC) commander during the
military crackdown in May 1980.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by defendant Choo Young-bock, former defense
minister, when responding to cross-examination by his defense
attorney at the 16th trial session on mutiny and treason.
</P>
<P>
Charges of mutiny and treason were made against Chun Doo-hwan
and his successor Roh Tae-woo as well as some former high-ranking
officers at the Seoul District Court here today.
</P>
<P>
"Then Martial Law Commander Lee Hui-sung reported to me that he
had consulted with Chun Doo-hwan prior to replacing CATC Commander
Yun Hung-jyong with So Joon-yeol," Choo testified.
</P>
<P>
At today's trial session, defense attorneys finished cross
examining four defendants involved in the 1980 crackdown, which
happened in Kwangju, capital of the country's South Cholla
Province.
</P>
<P>
During the session, prosecutors presented more than 1,000
pieces of evidence related to the incident.
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyers, who did not present any evidence of their
own, objected to most of the evidence submitted by the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen former South Korean army officers including Chun and
Roh have been indicted for mutiny or treason, or both.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges respectively stemmed from their
roles in the military revolt on December 12, 1979 and in the
brutal suppression of the Kwangju uprising on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled the nation until
February 1988. He was followed by Roh who stepped down in February
1993.
</P>
<P>
The two former presidents, who were arrested last year, have
also been indicted for graft since they received illegal funds
from businessmen while in office.

<HEADLINE> UK Students Choose Jobs over Classes: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- More and more British students are
taking up part-time work and damaging their studies in the
process. Yet the reason for this is not financial hardship,
according to a report today on students and employment.
</P>
<P>
The report by Dr Catherine Hakim, a senior academic at the
London School of Economics, says that the number of British
students with part-time jobs has doubled over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
Between 1984 and 1994 those with part-time jobs jumped from
343,000 to 671,000 and from seven percent to 11 percent of the
workforce.
</P>
<P>
However, the main reason for this dramatic rise is not
financial, but social and cultural.
</P>
<P>
The report, the result of a two-year study funded by the
Economic and Social Research Council, says that the jobs the
students take are mainly in catering, sales and other service jobs
such as cleaners and shelf-fillers in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
White students, the report says, are almost twice as likely as
those from ethnic minorities, particularly Chinese and Asian, to
undertake paid work while in full-time education. Working students
are not more likely to come from poorer families.
</P>
<P>
Dr Hakim argues that any differences must lie in their
attitudes to work, money and education.
</P>
<P>
"Ethnic minority groups generally are less well off than the
dominant white community, yet they are more likely to ensure that
their children devote themselves exclusively to their studies,"
she said.

<HEADLINE> Papandreou to be Buried in Honor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Former Greek prime minister Andreas
Papandreou, who died at 77 of heart attack Sunday morning, will be
buried in honor on Wednesday, according to the country's Interior
Ministry here today.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, whose funeral is to be safeguarded by Greek
military servicemen, will be buried in Athens next to his father.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Greek people paid their last respect to the
country's veteran leader today, who founded the first Greek
socialist party -- Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou became prime minister in 1981, when he led his PASOK
to win the same year's parliamentary election. He continued his
post until 1989 thanks to his foreign policy of keeping distance
from the United States, which gained him great support from the
Greek people.
</P>
<P>
After four years out of the government, Papandreou returned to
power in 1993. He resigned because of his failing health, but
still held the presidency of the socialist party.
</P>
<P>
The PASOK party will hold a congress on Thursday to discuss the
post-Papandreou era issues such as electing a new party leader.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian FM on Talks With Commonwealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi
said today that Nigeria's delegation to the Commonwealth meeting
will discuss four main issues with the Commonwealth Ministerial
Action Group (CMAG).
</P>
<P>
The issues are Nigeria's suspension from the association,
sanctions, importance of dialogue and Nigeria's political
transition program, Ikimi said, quoted by the News Agency of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Commonwealth to recall its decision on the
suspension of Nigeria from the association, emphasising that
resolving the crisis is in the common interest of both parties.
</P>
<P>
According to him, it is not necessary talking about sanctions
against Nigeria because it has not done anything the
international community could say warranted imposition of
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The minister identified terrorism, aparthied and genocide as
some of the offences that could attract imposition of sanctions,
stressing that Nigeria has never been involved in any of these
offences.
</P>
<P>
On transition to civil rule, Ikimi said that it is Nigeria's
choice to democratise, adding that the program is on course and
irreversible.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the military will give power to a
civil government elected by the public in october 1998. The
election of local governments has been completed throughout the
country and the registration of political parties will begin
soon.
</P>
<P>
For the transition program, the minister said Nigeria will not
need any financial assistance from the Commonwealth because it
has enough human and material resources to manage the program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Commonwealth does not have enough resources to
assist Nigeria, a country more complex than the association
thinks, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, who is leading a 17-member
delegation in London to participate in the meeting, Nigeria
agreed to attend the meeting on the basis that the Commonwealth
recognizes it is between Nigeria and the association, because ''
at this time, technically, Nigeria is not a member of the body''.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Nigerian delegation is not in London ''to face
any inquisition or any charges,'' Ikimi said, adding that ''We
have come here freely as a free country to discuss with open
mind.''

<HEADLINE> Link between El Nino and Rainfall in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- El Nino, the periodic abnormal
warming of surface water in the eastern equatorial Pacific, now
appears that its effects reach as far as the Middle East,
according to a report of Weizmann Institute of Science, based in
Rehovot near Tel Aviv, today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that El Nino, which has been notorious for the
devastation it often inflicts on South America, may actually be
positive.
</P>
<P>
By studying tree rings, satellite cloud images and rain water,
an Israel research team led by Dr. Dan Yakir of the Weizmann
Institute has discovered a striking correlation between El Nino
and rainfall in central Israel over the past 20 years. Their
results, which may prove valuable in predicting rainfall, are
reported in the current issue of Global Change Biology.
</P>
<P>
Yakir said, "It is perhaps befitting that El Nino -- Spanish
for the Christ Child -- should have a link to the Holy Land."
</P>
<P>
He conducted this study together with Dr. S. Lev Yadun, then a
post-doctoral fellow at the Weizmann Institute's Plant Genetics
Department, and Prof. A. Zangvil of the Blaustein Institute for
Desert Research in Sde Boker.
</P>
<P>
The scientists found that between 1975 and 1995, winters with
above-average rainfall in central Israel coincided with El Nino
events. For example, the record rainfall in Israel for this
century, in the winter of 1991-1992, coincided with one of the
most devastating El Nino appearances in recent years. Conversely,
relatively dry winters in Israel have coincided with below-average
ocean surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific.
</P>
<P>
El Nino events, which take place on average once in four to
five years, are marked by a massive increase in ocean surface
temperature, which leads to storms and floods that wreak havoc on
the coasts of Ecuador and Peru and may cause other large-scale
climatic upheaval, primarily in the tropics. In Israel, by
contrast, heavy rains are a welcome blessing.
</P>
<P>
The researchers also found that El Nino-associated variations
in Israel's rainfall were significant for local plant growth. They
revealed a strong correlation over the past 20 years between El
Nino and the width of annual rings of pine trees growing near
Jerusalem. (In the normally dry Middle East, even a minor increase
in rainfall can produce marked increases in the width of tree
rings.)
</P>
<P>
Going back in history, the scientists noted that no El Nino
events were recorded during the crippling, decade-long drought
that affected Israel in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
To offer an explanation for this long-distance climatic
connection between the eastern Pacific and Israel, the scientists
proposed a mechanism based on regional satellite cloud images and
isotopic analysis of rain in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The satellite images helped identify a previously unnoticed
strip of clouds which, under certain conditions, forms a nearly
straight line connecting equatorial Africa, known to be
influenced by El Nino, with Israel. It is possible that during El
Nino winters, changes in atmospheric circulation over parts of
Africa and the adjacent ocean allow more of the high-altitude
clouds to cross the Sahara Desert and reach the Middle East,
contributing to Israel's rainfall.
</P>
<P>
This hypothesis is supported by the isotopic analysis of
local rain water over the past 20 years. The results indicate
that during El Nino years, changes in atmospheric circulation
over the eastern Mediterranean allow moisture from Africa to
penetrate the region and contribute to local rainfall.
</P>
<P>
If the findings of Yakir and his colleagues are substantiated,
it may be possible to take advantage of El Nino forecasts, based
on advanced computer models developed in the United States, to
predict rain patterns in Israel more than a year in advance. This
is of great significance for Israel's water management and
agriculture, which -- in a region plagued by water shortages --
are critically dependent on careful planning.

<HEADLINE> Nation Party Is Disappearing, Says Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela said today the National Party (NP) belonged to the past and
was slowly disappearing.
</P>
<P>
Addressing about 150 pupils in the mainly Indian residential area
of Phoenix north of Durban, Mandela said the NP despised the Indian
community and was trying to woo them and use them as ''voting
cattle'' in the Kwazulu/Natal local government elections scheduled
for June 26.
</P>
<P>
The NP, South Africa's ruling party since 1948, would withdraw
from the government of national unity on June 30, because it claimed
that the new constitution did not provide the powersharing mechanism
in the executive branch of the government.
</P>
<P>
The government led by the African National Congress (ANC) was
successful because it had several Indian representatives, said
the president.
</P>
<P>
There are about one million Indians in South Africa, about 2.5

<HEADLINE> Crime Strategy Needs To Address ''Immediate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 24 (Xinhua) --South Africa's National Party
(NP) maintains that the national crime prevention strategy should
put its emphasis on ways to address "immediate crisis" rather than
focus attention on prevention of crime over a long term.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today in Pietersburg, Northern Province,
NP leader Andre Fourie said South Africa is being held hostage by
a criminal element worse than anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
Andre Fourie called upon President Nelson Mandela to make
urgent intervention to ensure co-ordination between the
departments of safety and security, justice, and correctional
services in the fight against crime. He noted: ''Words on paper,
plans and strategies alone will not smash crime, rid the country
of gangersters or restore faith in the police and courts.''
</P>
<P>
He also called for more severe penalities for crime and
reinstatement of the death penalty, which had been abolished last
year, for murder, armed robbery and rape.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of crime had increased by 61 percent since the
moratorium on the death penalty in 1989.
</P>
<P>
''Unless we show political will and guts, crime will destroy
this country,'' he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Apartheid Generals Accept Responsibility for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A number of South Africa's
former security force generals have accepted collective
responsibility for 20 human rights violations during the
apartheid era, the South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted informed sources as saying that the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, chaired by Abchbishop Desmond Tutu,
had received a letter from former Police Commissioner Van Der
Merwe and a number of the generals, in which they had accepted
''collective responsibility'' for 20 crimes.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the group claimed to have the support of
former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok.
</P>
<P>
The letter, a copy of which has been sent to the Transvaal
attorney-general, also named the ''foot soldiers'' who carried
out the crimes on the orders of their seniors.
</P>
<P>
In a response to the matter, truth commission Deputy Chairman
Alex Boraine said: ''I understand we have received a letter from
lawyer on behalf of some very top people. If it is true, then it
is very exciting indeed, as the commission has urged perpetrators
to come forward.'' enditem

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Government Okays Election law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government tonight
ratified the election law in an extraordinary cabinet session
chaired by President Elias Hrawi and attended by all the 30
members of the half-Moslem-half-Christian Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the new law at the end of the meeting, Interior
Minister Michel al-Murr said that the number of seat in the next
parliament will remain 128, a decision to clear up annoyance
irritated by a suggestion of adding four seats to the half-Moslem-
half-Christian unicameral house.
</P>
<P>
He said the country would be divided into four constituencies
with the exception of the Mount Lebanon governorate where
elections will be held on the basis of the districts that make it
up, underlining that the exception would be "once and the last."
</P>
<P>
"The four constituencies include Beirut, the North, Beqaa and
another comprising the two governorates of the South and
Nabatiyeh," said the interior minister, who is also the deputy
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the mandate of the next parliament would be
extended to four years and eight months from the constitutional
four years in order to make the 1996 parliamentary election the
last to be held in summer and to remove future elections from this
golden touring season in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"So this exceptional extension is also once and no more," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
A draft of the election law was put for the first time before
cabinet ministers when they met in the presence of the president
last Wednesday but they refused to discuss it on the grounds that
the interior minister failed to hand the draft over to them before
48 hours.
</P>
<P>
No major amendments can be found comparing the passed election
laws with the draft which were deliberately leaked to the local
press a couple of months ago to inspire reaction of the public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts believe the exception in the constituency
division was aimed at appeasing Walid Jumblat, the minister of the
displaced and Druze leader, who has been seeking to protect his
influence in the Christian-predominated Mount Lebanon where his
Druze community is a minority but concentrates in the district of
Chouf.
</P>
<P>
A hot atmosphere had shrouded the Presidential Palace in
Beirut's western suburb of Baabda before the two-hour cabinet
session began tonight.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister, a Greek Orthodox, affirmed that the new
election law would be issued at the end of the meeting, and
Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz, a Maronite Catholic and son-in-law
of the president, stressed his opposition to the draft law.
</P>
<P>
Though a collective position on the election law has not been
taken by Lebanon's strong Christian community, sharp criticism was
sounded by some Christian leaders, including Cardinal Nasrallah
Butros Sfeir, patriarch of the Lebanese Christian Maronites.
</P>
<P>
In his Sunday sermon, Sfeir said that the new election law
"lacks equality and justice and categorizes the citizens into
distinct classes" since it "divides the Lebanese into two types
of voters and two types of deputies before the law."
</P>
<P>
Despite his sharp criticism, the Maronite patriarch did not
call for a boycott of the upcoming elections which were slated to
be held in August.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued this morning, the Lebanese Christian
mainstream Phalange Party called on the Christians to participate
in the general polls, saying that their "participation in the
coming elections is the normal threshold to rectify imbalance in
parliamentary representation."
</P>
<P>
Most Christians boycotted the last parliamentary elections in
1992 on the grounds that no just elections could be held in this
country with the presence of Syria's 35,000-strong forces on the
Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
Since then, some Christian leaders claimed that the boycott
had led to Christian misrepresentation in the current
parliament.

<HEADLINE> DP Deserves Title of Official Opposition: Leon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Party (DP) of
South Africa had been influential in the face of power and
deserved the title of official oppsition, DP leader Tony Leon
said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an election rally in Pietermaritzburg, Leon said
the title of ''leader of the opposition'' should be earned
through ''performance, vigilance and courage'' and not merely
conferred by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
''The most successful opposition to power is not in the
numbers and strength of its members, but in the numbers and
strength of its ideas,'' said Leon.
</P>
<P>
Leon said President Nelson Mandela and Inkatha Freedom Party
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi had acknowledged the role played by
the DP in both the constitutional assembly and parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, Leon conceded that while the DP was far from having
power, it did have real influence in changing the way the people
of the country thought, citing the DP's influence had been for
the good. enditem

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Returns after Intensive Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
returned home today after a two-week trip that took him to
Switzerland, the United States, Britain and Italy for intensive
contacts on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, Clerides met with U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, U.S. President Bill Clinton, British
Premier John Major and European Union (EU) leaders.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival at the Larnaca Airport, the
president reiterated the view that a great deal of ground work
needs to be done before both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides
sit around the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to coordinate all moves aimed at making
headway in the Cyprus peace process and underlined the importance
of dealing with security concerns as one of the most important
aspects of the Cyprus question.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides told reporters that there must be "intense
preparation to find common ground on the fundamental aspects of
the problem before we embark on a dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, it was established that initiatives to
break the current deadlock, including a proposed Canadian
initiative, should be coordinated.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish-Cypriot community in
the north and the Greek-Cypriot community in the south since 1974
when Turkey sent troops and occupied the northern part of the
island following a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greek.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that the issue of security for the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot communities comprises demilitarization, the
establishment of an international force whose mandate will be
determined by the U.N. Security Council and the form of future
guarantees, without which there can be no Cyprus solution.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, the president said the issue of the
instability in the Turkish government and how it could affect
negatively the Cyprus peace effort were discussed extensively
during his talks with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his contacts with EU leaders on the sidelines of
the EU summit in Florence, Italy, the Cypriot president said the
conclusions of the summit reaffirmed that Cyprus and the EU will
begin membership talks six months after the Intergovernmental
conference.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that the Cyprus question would not be affected by
the controversy over the post of the U.N. Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
"We shall be content if Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali retains his
current post. We have no complaints," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He was saddened by the death of former Greek Premier Andreas
Papandreou and said that "Greece has lost a remarkable politician
and Cyprus a real supporter."
</P>
<P>
He will fly to Athens Wednesday to attend the funeral of
Papandreou.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Hand over 144 Remains of War Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is ready to hand over
a total of 144 remains of war victims to Iran during a
meeting of joint committee for searching for remains of the
Iraq-Iran war victims to be held in Iran Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Foreign Ministry said in a press statement issued
here today that the meeting comes following Iraq's initiative to
contact the Iranian government to study ways of hastening
searching operations.
</P>
<P>
The initiative proves Iraq's fulfillment of its obligations
toward the humanitarian international law and the Islamic
principles, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Baghdad's efforts to search for the Iranian
soldiers died during the 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war have resulted in
finding hundreds of them.
</P>
<P>
Previously Iraq asserted that it no longer holds any Iranian
prisoners of war (POWs). The POWs issue has remained unsettled
between the two countries since the end of Iraq-Iran war, which
has overshadowed the full normalization of the bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Ekeus Confident Accord With Iraq on Future Access to Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief weapons
inspector Rolf Ekeus said today that he had full confidence that
an accord he reached with Iraq regarding future access would hold.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the accord was reached in Baghdad
Saturday for full, immediate, unconditional access for U.N.
weapons teams to sites they wished to inspect.
</P>
<P>
But on the other side, he said, the U.N. inspection teams would
carry out their tasks "with full respect for the legitimate
security concerns of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"I have confidence that this will hold," he said. "Obviously,
we will test it and we will act soon to test it by continuing
operation."
</P>
<P>
He said that he believed Iraq was still concealing weapons,
components and documents concerning its prohibited arms programs
and playing a hide-and-seek game with the U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is not only concealing by static means," he said. "We are
concerned about moving things -- sensitive items may be stored
upon trucks or other means of transport."
</P>
<P>
Ekeus visited Baghdad last week after the Security Council
condemned Iraq's refusal earlier this month to give U.N.
inspectors access to a number of sites which Iraq said were
sensitive from the point of view of national security and
sovereignty.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of Baby-Friendly
Hospitals around the world has almost doubled from 4,282 at the
end of 1995 to 7,779 now, according to the United Nations
Childrend's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, a UNICEF/WHO joint
endeavor, is aimed at encouraging hospitals to promote exclusive
breastfeeding through specific practices such as rooming-in and
the prohibition of free and low-cost supplies of breastmilk
substitutes.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF estimates that over 1 million infants die every year and
millions more succumb to illness and malnutrition because they are
not adequately breastfed.
</P>
<P>
Since the launch of the campaign in 1992, the Baby-Friendly
Hospital Initiative has been embraced by 171 countries, with
numbers of hospitals designated as Baby-Friendly more than
doubling each year.

<HEADLINE> Mayors Condemn Church Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Conference of Mayors
being held in Cleveland, Ohio, today condemned the church fires
and urged President Bill Clinton to meet with mayors from
communities where churches have been burned.
</P>
<P>
"We have almost zero information on where the investigation is
going," The Associated Press quoted Knoxville, Tennessee, Mayor
Victor Ashe, as saying in an interview. "Really, it's the mayors
who are on the front lines of this."
</P>
<P>
The Inner City Church in Knoxville went up in flames this past
January, and arson is suspected.
</P>
<P>
The conference, in its annual meeting, unanimously condemned
the fires.
</P>
<P>
"Be it resolved that the U.S. Conference of Mayors publicly
denounces the individuals involved in these crimes," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton discussed the fires with a group of Southern governors
at the White House last week.
</P>
<P>
In a speech in Cleveland Saturday, Clinton told the mayors to
continue speaking out against the fires being investigated by more
than 250 federal agents, in addition to state and local law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
"I am very hopeful that the president will want to meet with
the mayors on this," Ashe said. "All of us need to work together
to put an end to this scourge. It's putting a terrible blight on
the country."
</P>
<P>
Other mayors said the fires are a consequence of the political
climate.
</P>
<P>
The mayors' resolution also urged officials to encourage local
educators to use the fires to teach about diversity and the
consequences of hatred and racism.
</P>
<P>
Among the other policy statements, mayors expressed support for
the COPS community policing program, drug courts, the assault
weapons ban, an increased federal minimum wage and legislation
creating a 2 billion dollar program to clean up abandoned
industrial sites.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today called on the
Commonwealth to recognise the basic principle of non-interference
in the internal matters of its members.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth should encourage Nigeria in its transition to
civil rule, said Foreign Affairs Minister Tom Ikimi, who is
leading a 17-member high-powered delegation to attend the meeting
with the Commonwealth ministerial action group in london.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth should be as supportive as other
multi-lateral organisations such as the United Nations and the
Organisation of African Unity, said the minister, quoted by the
News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi said that the UN had sent a fact-finding mission, whose
report had been made public, to nigeria and that Nigeria had
since then done a lot to address the recommendations of the UN
mission.
</P>
<P>
It is outside the schedule of the Commonwealth to go from
nation to nation to try to dictate time-frames for their
transition to democracy without recognising the special
circumstances that exist in those countries, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Christopher leaves for Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher left for the Middle East today to discuss with both
Israeli and Palestinian leaders how to move forward with the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He started his Middle East tour right after Arab leaders held a
summit in Cairo, which sent a clear message in its communique to
Israel's new hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: agree to
a land-for-peace formula or change rules and say good-bye to the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, a right-wing Likud leader who ousted peace advocator
Shimon Peres in the May election, however, rejected the
Arab-Israeli peace initiatives made over five years by refusing
the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Golan Heights and the
creation of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
He made a harsh reaction to the Arab summit, saying the peace
process should not be made "hostage to any prior conditions," as
is "incompatible with peace negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Christopher's mission is to patch the rift now ripped wide
apart as the Israeli new government is going to renege on its
promise, which would endanger the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said upon the departure of Christopher that
U.S. policymakers would "accentuate the positive" side of Arab
and Israeli stances so as to keep the momentum of the peace
process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Both the Arab leaders and Benjamin Netanyahu are dancing
roughly around the same set of issues and roughly in the same
direction," said the official.
</P>
<P>
"They are all talking about how to move forward with the peace
process. They're not down in the mud spitting at each other," he
added.

WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana has been meeting here with senior U.S. officials for talks
on the military alliance's role in Bosnia and its eastward
enlargement, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The meetings are part of Solana's regular series of
consultations with the U.S. and other NATO allies, Department
spokesman Glyn Davies said at a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the NATO secretary-general met with U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher early this morning for talks
focused on "three principal sets of issues," including NATO's
"successful implementation of the Dayton peace agreement and IFOR
(International Peace Implementation Force)'s continuing role in
Bosnia," next steps in the alliance's internal reforms as well as
the NATO enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
Davies disclosed that Solana will also meet with U.S. Secretary
of Defense William Perry, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff John Shalikashvili and Congress leaders during his visit to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the alliance's enlargement, Davies said that this
is "an ongoing process, under way for some time."
</P>
<P>
"It has some ways yet to go. I think NATO's meetings further
down the pike, especially in December, will perhaps contain a bit
more news on that front," the spokesman predicted.

<HEADLINE> UN Secretary-General to Meet British PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali will meet with British Prime Minister John
Major at Downing Street Tuesday during a visit to London prior to
the meeting of the G7 group later this month in Lyon, France.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Ghali will put forward the question of
the NATO-led IFOR peacekeeping force in Bosnia and will try to
persuade Britain, a major contributor to the IFOR force, that
foreign troops must remain in Bosnia after December 20, the date
set for the IFOR peacekeeping force to pull out.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the UN Secretary-General was quoted as saying
that Ghali "feels it will be extremely necessary for an
international presence to continue after the IFOR mandate
expires," according to reports here today.
</P>
<P>
However, Britain thinks at the moment that all international
troops should pull out of Bosnia simultaneously, instead of one
country withdrawing its troops while others remain.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will also discuss problems such as how to
strengthen international development institutions, and the
refugees in the Great Lakes area of Africa.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman reportedly denied that Ghali will seek
Major's support for him to run for a second term as the UN
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the 73-year-old secretary-general announced
that he would stand for a second five-year term when his current
term expires in December.

<HEADLINE> US Trade Group: Foreign Aid Helps US Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. trade organization today
urged the U.S. Congress to increase foreign aid to poor countries
and said that foreign aid helps the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
In a study released by the Business Alliance for International
Economic Development, a coalition of more than 1,000 U.S.
businesses, the group said that more than 80 percent of U.S.
foreign aid money is spent in the United States, on American goods
and services.
</P>
<P>
It said that in 1994 alone, U.S. aid programs translated into
200,000 jobs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. economic assistance helps developing countries build the
kind of physical, human and institutional infrastructure necessary
to spur their economies, to foster trade and to attract private
investment," the report said. Those are "the very things that make
possible American exports and thereby, American jobs."
</P>
<P>
The study said the United States already has earned billions of
dollars from the millions sent as aid to some Asian countries in
the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Congress to increase the aid by 50 percent to
about 18 billion dollars for the next fiscal year starting October
1.
</P>
<P>
In the current fiscal year, the U.S. Congress allocated 12.1
billion dollars for foreign aid and it is expected to cut further
for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend of U.S. foreign assistance was highlighted
last week in another study, issued by a Paris-based consortium of
aid donor countries, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development.
</P>
<P>
That study said the United States has dropped from first place
to fourth in donations to the world's needy. The top three
countries are Japan, France and Germany.

<HEADLINE> Bogus Cigarettes Go Up in Smoke in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 42,115 cartons of fake
brand cigarettes were burned up here today, in a new move by
China's largest city to stop the production of counterfeit
cigarettes being sold on its major streets.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yiren, a vice mayor who put the match to the pile, said
that the city's brand-name cigarettes have been badly hurt by
false and smuggled brands.
</P>
<P>
"The healthy development of the tobacco industry is
endangered," Jiang said. "The spread of fake cigarettes does not
suit Shanghai's image of an international metropolis."
</P>
<P>
He promised that Shanghai will increase efforts to crack down
on fake cigarettes, and that illegal cigarette markets have been
banned on the city's major thoroughfares in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 20,000 cartons of fake cigarettes were
discovered and five underground cigarette manufacturing shops were
destroyed in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Dong Haolin, director of the Municipal Tobacco Monoploy Bureau,
said that, working together with law enforement departments, they
would make the city's major streets fake-cigarette-free before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The fake cigarettes burned up today were brought in as the
result of the city's legal checks done randomly in over 100
commodity markets and on streets so far this year, according to
Dong.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Calls for Businessmen's Role in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba today called for cooperation from the business
community in the country's effort to alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual general meeting of the Federation of
Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) here, Deuba
said that industrialists and businessmen should fulfill their
responsibility to help the government meet the nation's goal of
poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
"If all of us shirk our responsibilities by blaming each other,
the state of the nation would deteriorate further," he added.
</P>
<P>
Deuba said that the government is going to remove the current
octroi tax system and introduce a new value added tax (VAT) to
increase national revenue.
</P>
<P>
The government's earlier decision to implement the VAT from the
coming fiscal year beginning in mid-July had drawn strong
opposition from the business community.
</P>
<P>
"The problem concerning the VAT system would be ironed out
through a task force," Deuba told businessmen today.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern over the country's widening trade
deficit and urged Nepali exporters to become more competitive in
the international market.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's trade deficit is expected to reach nearly one billion
US dollars by the end of the current fiscal year in mid-July,
compared with the 300 million dollars four years ago, according to
FNCCI President Padma Jyoti.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Revises Tax Cut Scheme on Luxury Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet today approved a
further revision of its tax reduction scheme on luxury goods, a
press release from the Government House said here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised scheme, import tariffs on perfume and
cosmetics, leather shoes and sports shoes, and crystal for
tableware and decoration, will soon be restored to 20 percent,
while tariffs on artificial jewelry will be lowered to 20 percent
beginning on January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, import tariffs on raw materials for production of
perfume and cosmetics will be reduced to 5 percent, while tariffs
on raw materials for tanned leather and artificial leather will be
cut to 5 percent and 20 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet on May 7 made a decision on cutting import
tariffs on 13 categories of luxury goods in a bid to reduce the
country's high current account deficit and turn Thailand into a
shopping center in Southeast Asia, which brought about strong
reactions from local manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier this month restored the import tariffs
on textiles and garments to 30 percent.

<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Completion of repairs on the east
runway at Capital Airport in Beijing, one of two, was signalled
today when technicians tested more than 1,000 sets of navigation
lights early this morning.
</P>
<P>
According to airport authorities, test flights will soon be
done and the east runway will be ready for operation in early July.
</P>
<P>
Because of wear and tear, the 3,800-meter-long, 60-meter-wide
runway was closed for an overhaul by the Civil Aviation
Administration of China in April, resulting in the cancellation of
more than 370 flights each week, sources said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the repair work, the runway is now able to
accommodate the largest airliners in the world, and technical
indexes, such as friction and smoothness, are at or surpass design
requirements.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the repairs, new drainage and fire-fighting
systems have been added to the airport, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The entire project called for 23,000 tons of cement, more than
750,000 tons of sand and gravel, and more than 700 tons of asphalt.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Spokesman: Security Is Not the Only Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides said here today that the security issue is
one of the five most important aspects of the Cyprus problem, but
it will not be the only issue to be discussed in efforts for a
Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no negotiations for an overall solution if talks
between the two sides are confined to only one aspect of the
Cyprus problem," he told reporters at a daily briefing.
</P>
<P>
The briefing was held after President Glafcos Clerides'
two-week trip abroad that took him to Switzerland, the United
States, Britain and Italy for intensive contacts on the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the United States places emphasis on
the issue of security, while Britain is not eager for direct talks
between the two communities before common ground is reached.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, President Clerides met with
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, U.S. President Bill
Clinton, British Prime Minister John Major and European Union
leaders.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides said upon his arrival Monday that the issue
of security for the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities
comprises demilitarization, the establishment of an international
force whose mandate will be determined by the U.N. Security
Council and the form of future guarantees, without which there
can be no Cyprus solution.
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman also noted that no specific proposals
on the substance of the Cyprus problem are expected to be made and
that there will be no solution plan within the framework of the
U.S. initiative.
</P>
<P>
He said that he considers the U.S. intention of having
discussions on the Cyprus problem with the Turkish military
and the Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to be serious.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides expressed the view that the Turkish President and
the National Security Council can play a leading role in the
security issue and that contacts with Ankara should not be
discouraged even before the formation of a stable government in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Britain's attitude towards the Cyprus settlement,
Cassoulides said that Britain is not eager for the two sides
involved in the Cyprus problem to come to direct talks before
some agreement is achieved during separate negotiations with the
Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the initiatives on the Cyprus issue displayed
by the U.N., the U.S., Britain and the European Union, the
spokesman said that the Cyprus government is satisfied by the
fact that they all accept the need for coordination between
them.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took control 37 percent of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved despite the U.N.
and international community's peace efforts for the past 22
years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Picture Tube Producer Offers B Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, june 25 (Xinhua) -- A major Chinese color picture
tube producer went global today when it offered 80 million B
shares, which are restricted to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Electronics Group got approval from the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange to list the shares, at a par value of 2.39 Hong
Kong dollars per share, on the bourse after July 17.
</P>
<P>
Company executives say they expect the issue to raise 187
million yuan (about 22 million US dollars) in funds, which will be
used to expand the firm's annual production of color tubes to 2.4
million units.
</P>
<P>
The China Nanfang Securities Co. Ltd is the major underwriter
of the issue, which will be coordinated by Barings Bank.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the B-shares, the group will also float 25
million A shares, which are restricted to domestic investors, this
year.
</P>
<P>
The SEG-Hitachi Color Tube Co. Ltd, a subsidiary of the
company, is China's largest manufacturer of color picture tubes
for 21-inch TV sets.
</P>
<P>
The subsidiary produced 2.1 million tubes for 21-inch TV sets
in 1995, about 30 percent of the national total. The 21-inch set
currently dominates China's color TV market, accounting for about
45 percent of national sales.

<HEADLINE> Munitions Depot Catches Fire in Russian Far East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A fire broke out at a munitions
depot in Russia's Far East today, causing artillery shell
explosions and forcing the evacuation of a nearby village, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
No casualties have been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
There were no chemical or nuclear weapons at the open-air
depot, which was surrounded by a dirt embankment, 15 kilometers
outside the city of Nakhodka in the Partizansk region and near the
Boyets Kuznetsov railway station, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Firemen took almost three hours to prevent the blaze from
spreading and bring it under control, the reports quoted Vladimir
Aleksakhin, a duty officer there, as saying.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Emergencies Ministry in Moscow said
inhabitants of the village of Boyets Kuznetsov, near Partizansk in
the Primorsky region, had been evacuated.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear what caused the fire at the depot which
belongs to the Russian Pacific Fleet.
</P>
<P>
This is the second such incident in two years. In May 1994, an
aviation bomb depot belonging to the Russian Pacific Fleet blew up
near Vladivostok, the fleet's base, leading to the sacking of the
fleet commander.

<HEADLINE> Israel Insists on Presence In South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- "We shall remain in the security
zone as long as it is necessary, just as long as is needed to
ensure security for the north of Israel and for our friends in the
security zone," declared Yitzak Mordechai, new Israeli Defense
Minister, today.
</P>
<P>
The rightwing Likud government defense chief made the statement
when he was speaking to reporters during a visit to the joint
headquarters of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the
pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) in Marjayoun, south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, Mordechai said, "If the Lebanese government and those
standing behind it show an ability to prevent terrorist activity
against IDF/SLA and change the basic situation we now have in
Lebanon, of course it will be possible to sit down and reach an
agreement."
</P>
<P>
"I only wish that the Lebanese government was independent and
able to deal with the problems, then we could negotiate and find
solutions," he said. "Our policy is to continue, as we have said
many times, that Lebanon and others who are supporting Hezbollah
have a high responsibility for the situation in this area."
</P>
<P>
Mordechai warned: "As long as there are some terrorist groups
trying to damage the life here, we'll do everything to counter
attack and to find the people, their soldiers and their
headquarters and to do everything that is necessary."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would be more aggressive and take action
outside the "security zone," Mordechai replied that "it is better
to do, than to speak too much."
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in south Lebanon in 1985 as a buffer against cross-border
guerrilla attacks on its northern Jewish settlements. The zone is
routinely patrolled by Israeli troops and their allied SLA
militiamen.

<HEADLINE> Stepped-Up Search for AIDS Cure Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Efforts to find a cure for the
HIV/AIDS virus must be intensified to save the human race,
Zimbabwe Aids Network (ZAN) Chairman Ticharwa Masimira said
today.
</P>
<P>
Masimira said in a statement that any remedy, if ever found,
should be accepted regardless of whether it originates from a
village in Africa or a western capital.
</P>
<P>
He commended last week's statement by the ruling ZANU (pf)
Central Committee which pledged political support for the fight
against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Some one million people in Zimbabwe's population of about 10.5
million are believed to be infected with the virus that causes
AIDS and there are about 150,000 cases of full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Masimira said the ZAN, an umbrella body for most AIDS service
organizations in Zimbabwe, supported the aggressive stance taken
by the central committee and hoped that ultimately the government
would seriously take up the fight against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"ZAN hopes that as a matter of urgency, the government will
move swiftly to mobilize resources in human and monetary terms to
save our country from the AIDS menace," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added the government should seriously consider declaring
AIDS a "national disaster."

<HEADLINE> France Gears Up for Atlanta Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- France has been gearing up for the
Olympic Games in Atlanta by dispatching 320 or 330 athletes to
compete in 21 or 22 out of the 26 sports in the centenary games,
officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They will compete in the track and field, rowing, boxing,
canoe, cycling, equestrian, fencing, soccer, gymnastics, handball,
weightlifting, judo, wrestling, swimming, modern pentathlon,
tennis, table tennis, shooting, archery, yachting and beach
volleyball.
</P>
<P>
Yet, their preparation work started in June 1994 when France
sent its inspection team to tour the competition venues in
Atlanta, and even requested French to be one of the official
languages in the games.
</P>
<P>
Nowsdays, France is not to be considered as a sport power and
still not ready to compete against the United States, Russia and
Germany, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1988 Seoul Games, France ranked 10th in the tally with
16 medals including six golds, and jumped to the seventh spot four
years later in Barcelona on 29 medals including eight golds.
</P>
<P>
The gold medals for France in Barcelona were from their
traditional sports of fencing, yachting, equestrain and judo.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, they also hoped to make breakthrough in cycling,
canoe and handball.
</P>
<P>
Aiming to encourage its athletes to win medals in the games,
the French Olympic Committee offers 250,000 francs (50,000 US
dollars) for the gold medalist, with the second-placer getting
120,000 francs (24,000 US dollars) and the bronze medalist bagging
80,000 francs (some 16,000 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Develop Peat Land into Farm Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto said
here today that the government will start developing at least one
million hectares of peat land into farm fields in a bid to expand
the country's rice farms.
</P>
<P>
"The move however does not mean that the government's rice
intensification program will be given less importance," he told
the Indonesian Association of Agronomists at the opening of its
fourth congress at the State Palace.
</P>
<P>
He said the rice intensification program should continue to
ensure the nation's self-sufficiency in rice.
</P>
<P>
Food diversification, land rehabilitation, expansion and
intensification program have been responsible for the country's
food production and self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia became self-sufficient in rice in 1984. But it is
currently under threat as rice fields are being eaten away by
industrial expansion and disturbed by unfriendly weather.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't take steps to ensure our self-sufficiency, it is
not impossible that we will have to import rice again," noted the
president.
</P>
<P>
He said if the program of developing peat land into farm fields
succeeds, Indonesia will produce not only rice but also other
crops.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has set a target for rice production
this year which is 7.33 percent more than the 1995 target of
47.667 million tons of unhusked rice.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official here
today called for mobilizing all forces and positive factors to
ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition and sustained prosperity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium to mark the one-year countdown for Hong
 Kong's return to China, Zhou Nan, director of Xinhua News Agency
Hong Kong Branch, noted that as Hong Kong's handover has entered
the final stage, the overwhelming task for the period is to ensure
 the smooth transition and maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that with Hong Kong's return to the motherland, Deng
Xiaoping's great concept of "one country, two systems" will be
fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return, he said, will represent an important step
towards China's goal of achieving reunification and also provide a
 fine example for the world in settling disputes left over from
history.
</P>
<P>
He said that a growing number of people in the world turn to
believe in China's sincerity in implementing the "one country, two
 systems" concept and its determination and ability to ensure a
smooth transition in Hong Kong, and they share the view that Hong
Kong will continue to be prosperous and stable for a long time
after 1997.
</P>
<P>
The social stability and sustained economic growth in the
Chinese mainland will guarantee Hong Kong's sustained prosperity
and stability in future, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that since its inception, the Preparatory Committee
(PC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has
received full support from Hong Kong people in various sectors.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong people have raised valuable suggestions regarding
the formation of the Hong Kong SAR and many of them have already
been accepted and become the PC's decisions," he said. "Hong Kong
people have made great contributions to the preparatory work."
</P>
<P>
Zhou urged people of all circles in Hong Kong to continue
taking part in the preparatory work in the final stage of Hong
Kong's transition so as to lay a sound basis for "Hong Kong people
 running Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Sino-British relations, Zhou Nan said that
these relations on the whole have been improved and this momentum
should be continued.
</P>
<P>
He said, although the two sides still have some differences,
they should seek common ground while shelving the differences so
as to do a good job of Hong Kong's handover and ensure a smooth
transition in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was organized by the General Editorial Office of
Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, the Hong Kong Office of the
People's Daily and the Hong Kong Reporters' Office of the Chinese
Ministry of Radio, Film and Television.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 distinguished figures including PC Vice Chairman
Henry Fok Ying-tung and Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of
Commerce Chairman Tsang Hin-chi attended the symposium.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Sacks Seven Generals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today fired seven leading generals who had allegedly tried to
pressure him not to dismiss former Defense Minister Pavel Grachev,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Grachev was sacked by Yeltsin last Tuesday at the demand of
third-placed presidential candidate Alexander Lebed, whom he
appointed head of the powerful Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The removal of the seven generals was announced after talks
among Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Lebed and
Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov and came eight days before the
July 3 runoff vote between Yeltsin and communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
The sacked generals are:
</P>
<P>
-- First Deputy Chief of Staff Colonel General Viktor Barynkin,
who was also head of the Main Operations Department of the General
Headquarters;
</P>
<P>
-- Deputy Chief of Staff Colonel General Anatoly Bogdanov;
</P>
<P>
-- Deputy Chief of Staff Colonel General Vyacheslav Zherebtsov,
who was also head of the Main Organization and Mobilization
Department of the General Headquarters;
</P>
<P>
-- Deputy Chief of Staff Colonel General Dmitry Kharchenko, the
head of the Main Department for International Military Cooperation
of the General Headquarters;
</P>
<P>
-- Lieutenant General Sergei Zdorikov, the head of the Main
Department for Educational Work of the Defense Ministry;
</P>
<P>
-- Lieutenant General Vladimir Shulikov, Deputy
Commander-in-Chief of Ground Forces in charge of armaments;
</P>
<P>
-- Colonel General Valery Lapshov, Administration Chief of the
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Lebed last week accused the generals of trying to persuade
Grachev to put the army on alert in order to pressure Yeltsin not
to sack him.
</P>
<P>
He called four of the generals "GKChP-3" in a reference to the
state emergency committee which led a hardline coup attempt
against former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991.
He also said that all the GKChP-3 participants would be fired.
</P>
<P>
Some of the generals denied Lebed's charges.
</P>
<P>
In a separate decree, Yeltsin also dismissed Vladimir Rubanov
and Alexander Troshin, both deputy secretaries of the Security
Council now headed by Lebed. They were replaced by Vladimir
Denisov and Sergei Khalamov, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The presidential press service gave no reason for the
dismissals, which were effective immediately.

<HEADLINE> Russia Abandoning Pro-West Foreign Policy: Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, outlining the Kremlin's foreign policy, said today that
Moscow is abandoning its pro-Western stance but does not want to
return to "Cold War" confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot concentrate on one direction, no matter how
important it is," Primakov said in an interview with Russia's
"Trud" newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is abandoning its pro-Western foreign policy course as
it does not meet national interests and is going to play an
independent key role in international developments. However, there
will be no return to 'Cold War' confrontation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Without naming his pro-Western predecessor Andrei Kozyrev,
Primakov said that Kozyrev's calls for a strategic union with the
"club of civilized states" at any price contradicted Russia's
national interests.
</P>
<P>
After the end of the "Cold War" and the Soviet break-up, he
said, the United States worked to dominate the world, "to
subordinate the interests of other states to the interests of one
superpower."
</P>
<P>
"The world should be based on the interests of many states. In
a multi-polar world Russia has to be one of the poles and not join
the others," he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that China had become "a very important priority"
for Russia, as well as India, Latin America, the Middle East, Asia
and Pacific rim. "The European direction also plays a very big
role in our policy," he added.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Russia's opposition to NATO's planned eastward
expansion to Russian borders, but said that Moscow could reach a
compromise with NATO on other issues.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also said Russia will continue to promote integration
and reduce conflicts in the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) while preserving the sovereignty of all CIS member states.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today signed a decree ordering gradual military withdrawal from
the breakaway region of Chechnya as the July 3 runoff in which he
will face Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov draws near.
</P>
<P>
"Carry out gradual withdrawal of forces and material" from
Chechnya with immediate effect, Yeltsin's press secretary Sergei
Medvedev quoted the decree as saying.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal is to be completed by September 1 "in line with
the stabilization in regions and settlements of the Chechen
Republic," Medvedev added.
</P>
<P>
Reports said some Russian units to remain in Chechnya will be
reinforced.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops now in Chechnya are drawn from the St
Petersburg, Moscow, Volga and Ural military districts.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also ordered the government to aid the military
withdrawal and to build facilities for troops permanently
stationed in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how many Russian servicemen will stay in
Chechnya permanently.
</P>
<P>
Russia sent troops to Chechnya in December 1994 to crush the
region's bid for independence and restore Kremlin rule. The
Chechen war has claimed more than 30,000 lives so far.
</P>
<P>
Russian negotiators, led by Nationalities Minister Vyacheslav
Mikhailov, were due to fly to Chechnya's capital Grozny Wednesday
to resume talks with separatist delegates.

MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' garments exports,
the top dollar-earning product in the country, increased to 1.223
billion US dollars in the first half of 1996 from 1.199 billion
dollars posted in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine Garments and Textile Export Board
(GTEB), the increase of the garments exports should be
contributed to 14 percent jump in the Philippines' garments
exports to non-quota countries.
</P>
<P>
The GTEB said that garments exports to non-quota countries
reached 276 million dollars from 241 million dollars in the first
half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Japan led the non-quota countries with total imports of 74
million dollars, up by a hefty 36 percent increase from 54 million
dollars registered for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong followed with 58 million dollars, or 16 percent
higher from the 50 million dollars level registered in the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Philippines' garments shipments to quota
countries declined 1.13 percent to 947 million dollars as against
the 958 million dollars level in 1995. Quota counties include the
United States, European Economic Community and Canada.

BUCHAREST, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Romania started today to enforce
a law that protects intellectual property rights to fight
copyright piracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
With help from the World Intellectual Property Organization

<HEADLINE> Japan Raises Consumption Tax to 5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan has decided to raise the
consumption tax from the current 3 percent to 5 percent, effective
April 1, 1997, Kyodo News Service reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The planned raising of the consumption tax was authorized by
the cabinet of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto at its regular
meeting Tuesday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The tax hike plan is part of a comprehensive taxation reform
bill enacted in November 1994, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The new rate is smaller than the 6 percent or so vigorously
sought by the Finance Ministry as a way to build up the national
coffers amid the fiscal constraints.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, even the 5 percent hike will impose an additional
80,000 yen of expenses on a household with yearly earnings of
roughly 7 million yen, possibly curtailing actual household
spending by 1.8 percent in fiscal 1997, according to estimates by
private think tanks.

TOKYO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A group of manufacturers in Japan
have planned to install an antipiracy function in the digital
videodisks (DVDs) they are jointly developing, Kyodo News Service
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They will decide in July standard specifications for the
antipiracy function, the report quoted a Toshiba Corp. spokesman
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Toshiba is working with nine other companies, including
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Sony Corp., Philips
Electronics N.V. of the Netherlands and Thomson SA of France, to
develop DVDs, a next-generation memory device with an improved
capacity that provides better quality images.
</P>
<P>
An antipiracy function has been strongly desired by prospective
major users of DVDs in movie and video-related industries as well
as by computer manufacturers and software houses, particularly in
the United States, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Such prospective users of DVDs reportedly held a meeting in
Washington last week to discuss technological and legal ways to
prevent piracy of audiovisual products and computer software, and
a general agreement on the antipiracy function was reached.

JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The past year has been
particularly difficult for the South African gold mining
industry, which has come under pressure from falling productivity

There has also been the progressive depletion of ore reserves

In his annual review for the year ending on March 31, 1996,
Oppenheimer said: "In the first quarter of 1996, the increase in
the Rand price of gold brought some relief and more acceptable
levels of profitability."

AMGOLD reported total earnings of 472 million Rands (about 129
million U.S. Dollars) which was 14 percent lower than in the
previous year.

LUSAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's state-run copper company,
the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), will be on sale in
July on the Lusaka Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by the Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA).
ZPA Technical Director Stuard Cruickshank was quoted by the local
press today as saying that the sale of ZCCM's major divisions
would proceed from next month as his agency would start
advertizing the sale then.
</P>
<P>
Cruickshank said that ZCCM subsidiaries were likely to be sold
first as they were much simpler to handle and did not require
extensive diligent studies which would be the case in the core assets
of ZCCM.
</P>
<P>
Several major mining companies have shown interest in core
assets of ZCCM, according to the technical director.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM has been facing liquidity problems in recent years
because of the low copper production levels resulted from the
obsolete equipment the company uses in its mining production.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government is formulating a policy such as
privatization, along with the economic reform in the country, to
revitalize and promote copper production in the country.

LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's banking industry has lost
about 1.011 Billion Naira (1.12 million U.S. Dollars) despite the

unidentified commercial banks accounted for 62 percent of the
total amount lost last year, while 14 merchant banks also
sustained losses.
</P>
<P>
However, according to NDIC, the fraud profile is a significant
improvement over the previous year's when about 3.399 billion
Naira (4 million U.S. Dollars) was posted.
</P>
<P>
"The prevalence of frauds and forgeries in the Nigerian
banking system are indications of weaknesses in banks internal
control system and erosion of moral and ethical values in the
country," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Frauds and foreries undermine the safety, soundness and
stability of the banking system," it noted.
</P>
<P>
The most commonly reported cases of frauds and forgeries last
year were unauthorized overdraft, presentation of forged cheques,
posting of fictitious credits, suppression of cheques, and
fraudulent transfers and withdrawals and abuses of medical

TEHRAN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Air Force is to
conduct a large scale maneuver in a bid to confront the military
cooperation between Turkey and Israel, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Deputy Commander of the Iranian Air Force
Shahram Rostami, which was carried in today's Persian daily Iran.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that the Air Force facilities and equipment
will be used in the maneuver.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no specific date and specific area for
the maneuver, but only said that it will be carried out this year.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the exercises is to evaluate the combat
readiness of various airborne units and to display the combat
power of the Air Force, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rostami reiterated that with modern equipment and high morale
of the personnel, the Air Force is in a good shape and is ready to
confront any possible aggression.
</P>
<P>
Referring to self-sufficiency of the Air Force with regards to
pilot training, he voiced the force's readiness to train pilots
from other countries, especially from the Islamic states.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that a great part of military equipment used
by the Air Force is manufactured in the country.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question if the military accord signed by the
Turkish government and the Israeli regime would pose a danger to
Iran, Rostami said "Turkey is an Islamic state and Moslems have a
specific attitude towards the Zionist regime."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Turkey will pose a danger to Iran. However, we
are watching our enemies' moves and are ready to take retaliatory
measures if necessary," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Newspaper Accuses US of Fabrication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Gazette, the only
English-language daily of Egypt, today accused the United States
of fabricating a story in order to prevent the Arab summit, which
ended here Sunday, from sending warnings to Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an article written by its board chairman, Samir Ragab, the
state-run newspaper said that the United States "is making much ado
about nothing" by claiming, just before the two-day summit, that
Egypt had purchased Scud missiles from the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The paper, which has a daily column reserved for articles
written by Ragab, said the U.S. government concocted the
"implausible" story to apply pressure on Egypt, which hosted the
summit, so that the summit would not send a strong message to
Israel on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the largest gathering of Arab leaders since the
1991 Gulf war, had been aimed at closing Arab ranks and forging
a united Arab front to compel Israel to continue the peace process
based on the principle of land-for-peace.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed at the possibility that the summit "would send fiery
threats and warnings to Israel," Ragab said in the article,
"Washington thought of a maneuver to brace itself for the summit
outcome."
</P>
<P>
Ragab, whose articles are believed to usually reflect the
government's views, also wrote that "U.S. politics are not based
on unshaken principles, but frequently change according to the
circumstances."
</P>
<P>
"No sooner had Benjamin Netanyahu been elected to Prime
Minister's office in Israel, than Washington declared its
unconditional support to his policies, although the
U.S. administration backed Shimon Peres during his election
campaign," the article said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said in his policy guidelines that the new
Israeli government would take a tougher line in Israel's
negotiations with its Arab neighbors than that of the previous
government led by his predecessor Peres.
</P>
<P>
The summit issued a final communique saying that the Arab
states would reconsider their stance toward Israel if the Jewish
state does not stick to the land-for-peace principle.

<HEADLINE> S. Arabia Warns Israel against Deviating from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has warned Israel
not to drift away from the Middle East peace track and underlined
the need for resuming peace talks regarding all aspects in the
region on the basis of the 1991 Madrid conference.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency today sent a dispatch from Riyadh, capital
of Saudi Arabia, saying that a Saudi cabinet meeting chaired
Monday night by King Fahd discussed the results of the Arab summit
which convened on June 22-23 in Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Minister of Information Fuad Faresi reportedly said
in a statement after the meeting that the Arab foreign ministers
who met in Cairo prior the opening of the summit stressed that
Israel should abide by the peace foundations, namely, U.N.
Resolutions 242, 338 and 425 and the principle of land-for-peace
formula.
</P>
<P>
Faresi said such goals can only be achieved through a full
Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab lands, including Jerusalem,
the Golan Heights, south Lebanon and western Bekaa in addition to
allowing the Palestinian people to practice its right to
self-determination and establish an independent state.
</P>
<P>
He said King Fahd urged peace sponsors, the United
States and Russia, to press Israel towards respecting the peace
commitments, attach special importance to the issue of
Jerusalem and the problem of Palestinian refugees and their
rights to return home.
</P>
<P>
The king also called on the international community to
politically and economically help the Palestinian people and seek
an end to Israel's siege on Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
At the summit attended by 21 of the 22 Arab League
members, Arab leaders warned Israel's newly-elected right-wing
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that they would reconsider the
concessions they have made in the peace talks if he tries to
change the terms of the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says Clinton Proposal Not Honest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government stated
here today that the proposal by U.S. President Bill Clinton
for comprehensive talks with Tehran is not honest.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Maleki, Deputy Foreign Minister for Education and
Research, said at a press conference that the proposal by the
U.S. president was "concurrent with the ratification of the bill
by both the House of Representatives and the Senate regarding
the intensification of the sanctions against Iran."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday voted 415-0
to approve a measure that would sanction foreign oil firms
investing 40 million U.S. dollars or more in Iran in a
single year.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the deputy foreign minister serves is an
official response to what Clinton has said with London-based Arab
newspaper Sharq al-Owsat recently.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reiterated that his policy is not to confront Tehran
militarily, and specified that his intention is to somehow change
the behavior of the Iranian government and make it "more moderate."
</P>
<P>
Maleki said the latest sanctions by the United States will not
have a vital effect on Iranian oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
English daily "Iran News" published an editorial Monday,
saying "U.S. President Bill Clinton is desperately sending
conflicting signals to the Islamic Republic again."
</P>
<P>
The daily noted that Clinton's desperation is partly due to
the total failure of his anti-Iran policy which has caused a
serious rift between Washington and its European allies.
</P>
<P>
"For Tehran, these contradictory and conflicting statements and
measures from Washington have no meaning," it added.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that the Iranian nation has suffered
greatly due to imperialist policies of the United States both
before and after the culmination of the Islamic Revolution.

DAMASCUS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the
Damascus-based United Command of the Democratic Front for
Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) and the Popular Front for
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) today welcomed the outcome of the
Arab summit recently convened in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman described the summit as "a step in the right
direction toward restoring the balance of the Arab stand."
</P>
<P>
He called for an implementation of the Cairo summit resolutions
by halting the hasty steps of some Arab parties to deal with
Israel and stopping the process of normalizing relations with it.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also stressed the importance of strict Arab
adherence to the principle, which calls for a complete Israeli
withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, the right of the
Palestinian people to self-determination and setting up an
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital, and the right of
Palestinian refugees to return home in accordance with
U.N. General Assembly Resolution 194.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called for a solid Arab position on Israeli
withdrawal and rights of the Palestinian people, describing them
as two essential conditions for coping with the Israeli
intransigence expected from the Natanyahu government in view of
its aggressive and expansionist tendencies.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also called for an effective Arab action intended
to lift the U.N. embargo against Iraq and Libya.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li Peng Calls for Protection of Cultivated Land (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng today made a
national televised speech, saying that safeguarding China's
cultivated land is protecting the 'lifeline' of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Li's speech marked the Sixth National Land Day, and the tenth
anniversary of the implementation of the Land Management Law, both
falling today.
</P>
<P>
"The bottleneck of land, especially cultivated land, has long
curbed the growth of agriculture and the national economy in
China," Li said.
</P>
<P>
China has limited land resources in reserve, but its population
is expected to climb from the present 1.2 billion to 1.3 billion
by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
With economic growth and the growing population, the conflict
between humans and land will become even more acute in China, the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
"The protection of cultivated land presents a big issue, which
is of significance to the fundamental and long-term interests of
the whole nation, the survival and development of our generation
and our offsprings, social development and the stability of the
country," Li said, adding that "such an issue can never be
neglected."
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party and the Chinese government have attached
great importance to land management and the protection of
cultivated land. Since 1986, the country has implemented the Land
Management Law and a series of major principles, policies, laws
and regulations concerning land.
</P>
<P>
By protecting land, China has managed to feed 22 percent of the
world's population with only seven percent of the world's arable
land, and continued to develop its agriculture, yet the land
situation is still stark, Li warned.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li Peng Calls for Protection of Cultivated Land (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said that the space of arable land per head of population is
still on a decreasing trend. The phenomena of rampant development,
wilfully and rampantly occupying and misusing cultivated land, are
still widespread.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that cases with local governments wrongly
approving land-use rights in violation of the law occur
frequently; The difficulty in law enforcement has yet to be
solved; The space of reclaimed land is excessively small; and land
development apparently lacks input.
</P>
<P>
Li called on officials at various levels to adopt a correct
approach towards, and deal properly with, the relationship between
land protection and economic development.
</P>
<P>
"Economy must be developed under the prerequisite of protecting
farmland," he said. "Only by protecting cultivated land can the
national economy ensure a sustained, fast and healthy development."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier also called for a correct handling of the
relationship between cultivated land protection and urban
development. Based on China's basic conditions, he noted, measures
to control the scale of the large or medium-size cities are 'a
must', and moderate development of small or medium-size cities or
towns, and satellite cities was also necessary.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that it is essential to combine the
construction of township enterprises with the moderate development
of small cities.
</P>
<P>
"We can never resort to the practice of rampantly encroaching
on cultivated land at the cost of agriculture and developing
cities without restrictions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Every possible means should be used to save the land, even when
major construction projects are launched, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
In rural areas, township enterprises should use land in a
rational way, and land for building villagers' homes should be
strictly controlled. Transformation of century-old customs and
habits and land-occupying burial practices for the deceased are to
be encouraged, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We should also cope with properly the relationship between
planting, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries when we use
land," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is a must to center on the protection of cultivated land
when we arrange or readjust the land structure in agricultural
development. Encroachment upon large tracts of arable land,
especially land for growing cereal crops and vegetables, should be
prevented, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li also urged reform of the land management system and
strengthening of macro-control. China can attain its goal of land
protection, so long as its people carry out in real earnest the
Land Management Law and use and manage land according to the law.
</P>
<P>
"Protection of cultivated land is the sacred duty of every
citizen," he said.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the premier called on all citizens in China to
treasure and protect every inch of arable land, and repeating his
key message that "the protection of the cultivated land is to
protect our lifeline."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets AIPO Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
spoke highly of the important role of ASEAN in regional and
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with a delegation from the ASEAN's
Inter-Parliamentary Organization (AIPO), Li Peng said China
attached much importance to developing relations with ASEAN and
the Chinese people cherish friendly feelings for the peoples of
all ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was led by Booneua Prasertsuwan, AIPO'S chairman
and president of National Assembly of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed with great excitement that the friendly
relations between China and ASEAN has been developing continuously
and their cooperation has kept expanding," Li Peng said, adding
that the friendly exchanges between AIPO and China's National
People's Congress (NPC) is one evidence and an important part of
the good relations.
</P>
<P>
China and ASEAN countries had had similar suffering in
contemporary history, and now they all face the tasks of
developing economies and raising the living standards of their
people and all wish to maintain the trend of stability and
development, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Though China and the ASEAN countries have differences in social
systems, religion and ideology, yet all this will not impede the
development of friendly cooperative relations, Li stated.
</P>
<P>
Booneua said AIPO has had long-term friendly cooperation with
China's NPC. It has become a common understanding that AIPO should
continue to develop its relations with NPC so as to contribute its
share to advancing the relations between ASEAN countries and China.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived in Beijing on Sunday for its third visit
to China at the invitation of the NPC standing committee.

more actively conduct mutual beneficial cooperation with China and
increasingly involve itself in the competition on the huge Chinese
market.

<HEADLINE> Suzhou to Achieve Preliminary Modernization in 2000 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Suzhou City in Jiangsu Province,
one of the most developed areas in China, plans to achieve
preliminary modernization by the year 2000 and to match the level
of moderately-developed countries in economic output and quality
of life.
</P>
<P>
Meng Huanmin, deputy secretary-general of the Suzhou City
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said that at the turn of
the century, the city's gross domestic product (the value of goods
and services produced) will double the figure for 1995 to 187
billion yuan, rising at an average annual rate of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of this century, Suzhou's per-capita GDP will top
30,000 yuan, or about 3,500 US dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lying in the Yangtze River Delta in southern Jiangsu Province,
Suzhou administers six county-level cities and six districts,
covers an area of 8,500 square kilometers and has a population of
5.73 million.
</P>
<P>
Meng said that in the year 2000, revenues of the Suzhou city
government will amount to 11 billion yuan, increasing at an annual
rate of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the service sector will contribute 40 percent to the
GDP. He said that Suzhou plans to bring in 15 billion dollars in
overseas funds over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, scientific and technological progress will contribute
50 percent to increased production, and imports and exports will
amount to ten billion dollars annually, accounting for 40 percent
of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
"Then Suzhou will become a processing and manufacturing center,
a commodity and materials distribution center and a tourism and
vacationing center in southern Jiangsu," he said. "In five years,
both urban and rural residents in Suzhou will enjoy a relatively
comfortable living standard."
</P>
<P>
By then, per-capita annual income of urban workers and the net
income of rural residents will double the figures for 1995 to
14,000 yuan and 7,000 yuan, respectively.

<P>
Meanwhile, per-capita floor space of urban residents will
average 15 square meters, two sq m more than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meng said that last year per-capita floor space of rural
residents exceeded 40 sq m last year. "In the future rural
residents should try to improve their housing quality and interior
decoration."
</P>
<P>
He said that vigorous efforts will be made to speed up the
medical care and public health undertaking, improve medical care
facilities, introduce community medical care networks in urban and
rural areas and institute cooperative medical care system in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to enable everyone to enjoy medical care," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that work will be done to introduce and improve basic
social security systems in such areas as old-age pension, medical
care, unemployment and work-related injuries and increase the
old-age pension coverage to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, work will be done to increase commercial insurance
and expand the scope of social security so as to introduce a
social security system that will combine social relief and welfare
with mutual assistance and individual banking savings.
</P>
<P>
In the year 2000, middle school education will be made
universal throughout Suzhou, he said, adding that efforts will be
made to step up adult education, expand vocational and technical
education at the college level and improve educational facilities
and means.
</P>
<P>
He said, "To achieve these goals, we must introduce a new
managerial system and operational mechanism that will adapt to a
socialist market economic structure."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, economic operation and management must become
compatible with common practices in the rest of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must persist in opening wider to the outside world and
energetically expand an export-led economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Suzhou must also pursue the strategy of
invigorating its economy by means of science and education, take
the path of sustainable growth, persist in coordinated economic
and social development and advance both material progress and
cultural progress.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes "China Can Say No" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A book entitled "China Can Say No"
has hit Chinese book stands and is widely regarded by
intellectuals as a move to combat western pressures.
</P>
<P>
The 400-page-book, a collection of essays, lays down the idea
that the country should adhere to its own road, and always say
"no" when answering the irrational demands of western powers.
</P>
<P>
The book points out that the United States blames China over
the issues of human rights, Taiwan and trade, saying their claims
are "absurd". Any efforts to build an "Anti-China Club" will be
doomed to failure, the book adds.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to criticize the "American affection" and the
"to-be-a-slave mood" among some Chinese people, calling for strong
opposition of the invasion of colonial culture.
</P>
<P>
The book draws several conclusions, which include:
</P>
<P>
1. The United States is not able to be the leader of anyone
else, it can only be its own leader;
</P>
<P>
2. China never wants to be the leader of anyone else, it just
wants to lead its own people.
</P>
<P>
According to the book, what China wants is dialogue with
western countries on an equal footing, rather than confrontation
with them when it says "no".
</P>
<P>
The book was written by a group of reporters, university
teachers, poets and free-lancers, all around the age of 30, and
published by the China Industrial and Commercial Joint Publishing
House.
</P>
<P>
The authors and publishers said that the book is not a
declaration of nationalism, but a "reflection of extensive public
opinion".

<HEADLINE> HIV Patient Tests Negative After Herb Treatment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- An HIV-positive patient in China
tested negative after being treated with a Chinese herbal
medicine, doctors in Beijing have reported.
</P>
<P>
The health of other patients improved to varying extent after
two-month treatment.
</P>
<P>
Now the doctors are claiming that the clinical treatment has
demonstrated that traditional Chinese herbal medicine offers a
promising form of treatment for patients infected with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent Beijing conference on the diagnosis and
treatment of AIDS, China's pharmaceutical makers and hospitals
have shed more light on treating people infected with AIDS and HIV
carriers.
</P>
<P>
Between last December and June this year, the You'an Hospital
in Beijing received six patients, four of them confirmed to have
contracted AIDS, and the other two found to be HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in the hospital used Sedav, a new medicine made with
medical herbs. The medicine is produced by S-Debri Pharmaceutical
Development (Group) in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
A two-month treatment indicated the health conditions of all
six patients improved, and the antigen in one patient's serum
changed from positive to negative, according to tests made by AIDS
Research and Test Center under the Chinese Academy of Preventive
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Another patient has returned to work. Such effective treatment
met no precedents across the country, medical experts said.
</P>
<P>
Lu Weibo, a professor with the China Institute of Traditional
Chinese Medicine, revealed in his report to the conference that
there have also been promising cases at a test center in Tanzania
to treat AIDS with traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
In laboratory tests many kinds of traditional Chinese herbal
medicines have been proved able to kill the HIV virus and enhance
the human body's immunity, said the professor, adding that the
institute will conduct further research in this field.
</P>
<P>
Dai Zhicheng, head of the Disease Control Department under the
Ministry of Public Health, said that the conference indicated the
great attention the Chinese government has shown toward the
prevention, monitoring, control, and clinical diagnosis and
treatment of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS has to be controlled in China with the fact that the
number of AIDS patients and HIV carriers is on the increase," Dai
said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is imperative to step up the development of new
medicines, especially to improve the diagnosis and treatment of
AIDS, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chunming, director of the National Specialists' Committee
on Aids Prevention and Control, said at the conference that by the
end of last year 3,341 people had been found to be HIV carriers,
including 117 AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
But the actual number might be much larger, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
With more international exchanges, AIDS is practically poses a
threat to every person, and everyone should pay due attention to
AIDS control and treatment, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The conference was held at the joint sponsorship of the Disease
Control Department under the Ministry of Public Health and the
China Association for Venereal Disease and AIDS Control and
Treatment.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 82 percent of women
looking for work claimed that age discrimination had obstructed
their success, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade
Unions (HKCTU), more than 60 percent of women over 30 years old
felt discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
The survey was based on a random selection of 481 job seekers
with 376 women. Tam Tik-yan, HKCTU Women Committee's executive
secretary, said that age discrimination is an extreme urgent
problem for women.
</P>
<P>
She said that many women are forced to seek part-time or casual
work with no annual leave, sick leave or other forms of labor
protection.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that 53 percent of men seeking jobs felt
they could not find work because of their age.
</P>
<P>
The survey also featured copies of job advertisements in which
companies seeking office assistants, receptionists or sales
representatives specify 18 to 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
Tam said that at the moment there is no legislation in Hong
Kong protecting job seekers against age discrimination and she
urged the government to set a good example by employing women over
30 years of age.

<HEADLINE> HK's Advantages to be Developed Fully After 1997: Japan's Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The advantages of Hong Kong will
be fully developed after China resumes the exercise of its
sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, said a Japanese businessman in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Hiro Kawamura, resident managing director for the China
operations of Mitsubishi Corporation, made the remark in an
interview with Xinhua just one year before Hong Kong's return to
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He said that the corporation will gain new opportunities for
cooperation if the advantages of the mainland and Hong Kong are
combined after 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland has a large population with a giant
market, he said, while Hong Kong is superior in finance, trade and
water transportation and has an abundance of English language
talent.
</P>
<P>
China will benefit from the foreign trade and economic growth
that will be achieved after the advantages of Hong Kong and the
country's other port cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin are
combined, he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the five biggest Japanese corporations, Mitsubishi is
now mainly engaged in exporting machinery, air conditioners and
electrical generators to China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Hiro said, the trade volume between
Mitsubishi and China has increased annually by one billion US
dollars, and it is expected to hit five billion US dollars this
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Mitsubishi's investment in China has totalled 400
million US dollars, which are used in more than 100 projects,
including foodstuffs, cement, the chemical industry and machinery.
</P>
<P>
Hiro said that what impressed him most is the industrious
character of the Chinese people. He said he had worked in the
United States and some other Asian and Middle East countries
before he came to China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China has implemented a policy that has pushed the
country's economy into a period of sustained and stable growth, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Mitsubishi's business after 1997, Hiro said, "We will
adopt a special method toward the future, namely making good use
of Hong Kong's advantages, considering the market on the Chinese
mainland and the industrious Chinese people as well."
</P>
<P>
"If combining these advantages, our business in China will
surely get a fast take-off," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hiro said Mitsubishi will focus on the Chinese market and
further explore cooperation with the country in the fields of
chemical industry, automobile, petroleum and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He described the principle of "one country, two systems" as a
wise policy, and expressed the belief that this principle will be
implemented well by the Chinese leaders.

<HEADLINE> GM Market in China Will Overtake US Trade: Car Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A top boss of America's General
Motors, the world's biggest car maker, has predicted that GM's
business in China will be bigger than in the US in 20 years' time.
</P>
<P>
Rudolph A Schlais, Jr, president of General Motors China
Operations made the remark during an interview about the impact of
Hong Kong returning to China in a year's time.
</P>
<P>
The full implementation of "one country, two systems "
principle towards Hong Kong after 1997 by the Chinese government
will "not only be a contribution to the world, but also a big
contribution to the credibility of China", said Schlais.
</P>
<P>
He said that this principle was really "unique" in the world.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, with one year to go before the
return of Hong Kong to the motherland, Schlais said, "China has a
very positive opportunity to make it work."
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1908, General Motors maintains a close relationship
with both the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong. It has taken an active
part in producing automobile spare parts in China, and also set up
ten joint ventures in the country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years GM has invested or is committed to
spending a total of two billion U.S. dollars in China.
</P>
<P>
"In October 1994, we made the decision that Hong Kong and the
Chinese mainland should be looked at as one business. We moved our
main office to Beijing and still maintained a business company in
Hong Kong to serve as a sales and a parts warehouse," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are in China for the long term. We would be participating
in the Chinese market through partners in China. One of the areas
that we believe we can work with China is a global business. Our
partners in China now have access to global markets through us.
</P>
<P>
"We are the only auto manufacturer that is committed to bringing
technology to car design to China. We also see through the
universities in China that we have the ability to bring China's
research development to the rest of General Motors around the world,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mr Schlais said that he was optimistic about Hong Kong's
future, saying that the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong can help
each other after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a financial infrastructure and has the ability to
use such infrastructure for investment and trade, which can be
complementary to the Chinese mainland, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China has a very growing economy so that the two coming together
should be better than each one separated," he added.
</P>
<P>
Schlais quoted his company's chairman as saying during his
meeting with Chinese Premier Li Peng: "China is a modern
miracle. The growth that China has occurred to the control of
inflation is a miracle of this century."
</P>
<P>
He said his company is willing to continuously participate in
the China market and increase investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the business we do in China should be good
business for both China and General Motors. Our business in twenty
years in the China market would be larger than the market in the
United States," he predicted.

<HEADLINE> Disruption Should Not Be Mainstream of Sino-German Ties: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui
Tiankai said in Beijing today that prospects for Sino-German
relations will remain broad, so long as Germany takes measures to
stop actions harmful to bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning the issue at a routine
press conference, Cui said that on June 20 the German federal
parliament adopted an anti-China resolution on Tibet, in total
disregard of repeated representations made by China.
</P>
<P>
"It was an act that violated the norms of international law and
interfered in China's internal affairs," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He continued that all the recent developments that brought harm
to Sino-German relations were solely caused by a minority of
people of Germany, and even within Germany they were criticized.
</P>
<P>
Cui expressed regret over the recent developments that
negatively affected the development of Sino-German relations.
</P>
<P>
"However, disruption or sabotage made by a few people should
not be the mainstream of bilateral relations," he noted.
</P>
<P>
China has always attached great importance to Sino-German
relations and the maintenance and development of bilateral ties
serve the long-term and fundamental interests of both countries,
he reiterated.
</P>
<P>
"So long as Germany takes practical and effective measures to
prevent the recurrence of events that are detrimental to bilateral
relations, and restore bilateral ties to the track of healthy
development, there are still broad prospects for the relationship
between the two countries," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Committed to Co-operation with China: CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- US-based aircraft maker Boeing is
committed to continuing its co-operation with China, despite the
fact that China has decided to cooperate with Europe in the
100-seat passenger plane plan, Philip Condit, Boeing President and
CEO said today.
</P>
<P>
Condit said at a press conference that he expects China's share
of Boeing's total sales to increase over the next decade, as it is
an important part of the Asia-Pacific air transport market.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific region is moving to about 40 percent of the
world's total aircraft sales in the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
Boeing, the world's largest civil aircraft manufacturer,
currently accounts for 77 percent of western-made civil aircraft
market in China, and it has sold some 10 billion US dollars worth
of airplanes to China over the past ten years, said Michael
Zimmerman, president of Boeing China.
</P>
<P>
The company has also cooperated with the Civil Aviation
Administration of China in pilot and crew training, improvement of
China's air traffic control systems, and has established a plane
parts supply center in Beijing's Capital Airport and field service
bases in 16 Chinese cities, according to Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
Vowing to continue the "long-standing and successful
relationship with China's aviation industry leaders" after 25
years of cooperation, Condit said both parties would agree that
"there is much more to be done."
</P>
<P>
The Boeing president also expressed his company's
disappointment over China's decision to select a European partner
in the 100-seater project, the biggest Sino-foreign co-operation
project in aircraft manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
During Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to France last April,
China chose France's Aerospatiale and two other European aerospace
companies as its partner in the 100-seater plan, and placed an
order for 33 European Airbus planes worth some 1.5 billion US
dollars to Airbus Industrie, Boeing's arch-rival in both China and
the world market.
</P>
<P>
The current Boeing party, led by Boeing chairman Frank
Schrontz, will also visit Xi'an and Guangzhou before leaving China
on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Aerospatiale's Business with Mainland, HK to be Continued after 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Philippe Tattevin, deputy
general representative of the Beijing Office of the French
Aerospatiale Group, said he does not think there will be a lot of
changes in Hong Kong after 1997, because maintaining stability is
in China's best interests.
</P>
<P>
He said this during an interview with Xinhua, just one year
before Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Aerospatiale will conduct business as usual both on the Chinese
mainland and in Hong Kong after 1997, Tattevin said.
</P>
<P>
A leader in the French aviation industry and manufacturer of
Ariane, a 100-seat jet project, Aerospatiale has cooperated with
China for 30 years in the fields of aircraft, helicopters and
space development.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Tattevin showed journalists a photo of
the signing of a letter of intent for the new jet project. It was
signed by the Aviation Industries of China and the Aerospatiale
during Premier Li Peng's visit to France in April.
</P>
<P>
Aerospatiale is willing to participate in this cooperative plan
both in design and sales, and to establish a long relationship
with the aviation industries of China in the fields of technology,
industry and commerce.
</P>
<P>
Tattevin said his company also has businesses in Hong Kong, and
that most of the company's spare parts are imported to the
mainland via Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has a very favorable location. It is convenient for
foreign business because it is close to south China and efficient
in management. Hong Kong acts as a bridge between Europe and
China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aerospatiale reaped a total sales volume of ten billion US
dollars last year, with its export volume accounting for 70
percent of that amount. Its export to Asia claimed more than 25
percent of its total export.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Aerospatiale worked to increase its airbus jet
shares in China's market. The first group of the A320 airbus jets
has already been turned over to the Sichuan Airline for use. China
Eastern Airlines and Air China have also ordered 11 A340 airbuses,
which are scheduled to be handed over between 1997 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a training center now under construction in
Beijing will be completed next year.
</P>
<P>
"We have always followed the opening policy of China. The more
China is opened, the more we can participate in its opening," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Aerospatiale has been involved in so much cooperation with
China, which fully demonstrates its confidence in the country's
future after 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tattevin said he believes that after 1997, Aerospatiale's
cooperation with China will increase.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Iraq Exchange Remains of Soldiers Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today handed over the remains
of 144 Iranian soldiers killed during the Iraq-Iran war
(1980-1988) and received 200 remains of Iraqi soldiers from Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Iraqi News Agency, the exchange took
place in the area of Shalamja on the Iran-Iraq border.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Iraqi foreign ministry said that the
exchange came within an initiative made by Iraq at a meeting held
today by the Iraqi-Iranian Joint Commission established in
September, 1995.
</P>
<P>
For years, the POW's problem has been a main obstacle to the
normalization of relations between Iraq and Iran. They have
exchanged some 75,000 prisoners of war, but Iraq accused Iran of
still detaining some 20,000 Iraqi soldiers, while Iran said Iraq
is still holding at least 1,000 Iranian ones.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the two countries agreed to recover and return
bodies of soldiers missing from the eight-year war.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Out of professional courtesy
Dauchet Olivier sounds cautious and discreet while answering
questions, though he speaks perfect English.
</P>
<P>
Olivier, 32, is the head of the Beijing office of Gide Loyrette
Nouel, a French law firm founded in Paris in 1920.
</P>
<P>
"Gide is the first French law firm to have a China office," he
said proudly, "Not only because it is one of the leading law firms
in France and continental Europe, but also because it paid early
attention to China."
</P>
<P>
The Gide Beijing office won approval of China's Ministry of
Justice in April 1993. However Gide started the firm's efforts for
entry into China in as early as 1981.
</P>
<P>
"The forming of a 12-member China team in 1988 undoubtedly
helped us to get approval," Olivier noted, adding that Gide was
the 14th foreign law firm to be officially accepted in China.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice has forbidden foreign law firms from
handling China's domestic legal affairs, which include explaining
Chinese laws, appearing in Chinese courts, or serving as agents in
domestic lawsuits and disputes.
</P>
<P>
"This measure can avoid any major impact on domestic law
practitioners, and is also in line with international practice,"
said an official with the lawyer's affairs division of the Beijing
justice bureau.
</P>
<P>
"We mainly do three kinds of things in China: assisting foreign
companies in investment and trade in China, helping Chinese
companies doing business abroad, and advising the Chinese government
in foreign-related economic and financial projects," said Olivier.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, he said, Gide helped bring about 600 million US
dollars in investment from European countries like Belgium,
Netherlands, Luxemburg, Spain, and Italy to China.
</P>
<P>
"Business volume in the first six months indicated that the
figure is likely to reach 1.5 billion US dollars this year," he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Occasionally Gide offered its services to Chinese people
involved in overseas legal disputes. Though small in number, these
cases have brought great honor and a wide influence to the firm,
he added.
</P>
<P>
In March 1992, the European Union launched a suit against the
China National Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corporation,
and the China Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corporation on
charges of dumping stibium trioxide on the European market.

<HEADLINE> China To Strengthen Enforcement of Fishery Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- China is to strengthen the
enforcement of its Fishery Law, which came into effect in 1986, to
ensure sustainable development of fisheries, a government official
said today.
</P>
<P>
"The law has helped China's fishery industry develop rapidly in
the past ten years," said Zhang Yanxi, vice-minister of
Agriculture, at a meeting to mark the tenth anniversary of the
introduction of the law.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's output of aquatic products in the
past decade rose at an annual rate of 13.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China's output of aquatic products was 25.17 million
tons, accounting for one fourth of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the concept of protection of the fishery ecological
environment has been accepted by more Chinese with the
popularizing of the law.
</P>
<P>
Zhang admitted that there are still some problems in the
current fishery administration, noting that in some areas, local
governments paid too much attention to economic returns and little
or no attention at all to the fishery laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
"It's among the worst factor impairing further fishery
development, which need an urgent resolvement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile China is revising the current Fishery Law to keep the
law abreast of the times. The revised version is expected to take
effect next year, Zhang said.

<P>
The Gide Beijing office helped the two companies to answer the
suit. After three court hearings in more than two years, the
marathon case ended in June 1994, with the EU dropping the suit.
</P>
<P>
"The winning of the case was closely related to the efforts of
the French lawyers, who are very dutiful and conscientious," said
staff members of the two companies.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his feeling from a near two-year stay in China,
Olivier said:"There is something specific in China's legal service
market. But it is no harder for us to work here than in any other
country, including France."
</P>
<P>
He said he was deeply impressed by the fast progress of China's
legal system, especially in economic legislation, as well as the
high quality of the laws and the judicial work.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed strong appreciation of his Chinese
counterparts:"They know very well the laws and judicial system in
China. There is more cooperation than competition between us."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Beijing last month, Zhang Geng, vice
minister of justice, said that his ministry had given approval to
57 overseas law firms, mainly from Britain, the US, France,
Germany, Japan, Canada, and Australia, to open offices in China
since mid-1992.
</P>
<P>
He called the opening of these offices a "fairly successful"
experiment, which has not only helped China gain more foreign
investment, but has also provided a good experience for domestic
law firms in terms of management, operation, and staffing.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with China's first law on lawyers, which was
passed last month, his ministry will formulate as soon as
possible, concrete regulations on the management of Chinese
offices of overseas law firms, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yuliang, an official with the lawyer's affairs division
of the Beijing justice bureau, said that the forthcoming
regulations only aim at enhancing the management of the legal
service market after its opening, with no intention of limiting
the development of foreign law firms in China.
</P>
<P>
"They will see surging business in China, and enjoy more
convenience in providing legal services as well," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
His speculation was proved to be true, at least partly, last
Saturday, when the latest news from the Ministry of Justice showed
that the number of overseas law firms in China had surged to 73
within less than a month.

<HEADLINE> Dostum's Top Aide Killed in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Rasool Pahalwan, top aide of the
Afghan Uzbek Militia leader Rashid Dostum, was shot dead in
northern Afghanistan Monday, according to reports reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
One report said that Pahalwan was killed by his own bodyguards
in the Shor desert area near Mazar-i-Sharif, the Uzbek Militia's
headquarters, and his corpse was taken by helicopter to his home
province of Faryab early this morning.
</P>
<P>
However, another report said Pahalwan was killed along with his
15 bodyguards in an ambush near Mazar-i-Sharif on Monday night,
and the attackers have not been identified.
</P>
<P>
The cause of killing is not clear so far although some people
guessed that it had connection with the killing of several
Dostum's commanders two weeks ago by Pahalwan due to their refusal
to pay Pahalwan taxes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is another doubt which connected the killing
with the forthcoming event that Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, head of
Hezb-i-Islami, would enter Kabul and take oath as prime minister
of a new coalition government on Wednesday.

<P>
Both Hekmatyar and Dostum were important members of the
four-party Afghan opposition alliance.

Pahalwan, number two leader of the Uzbek Militia and a famous
hardliner, had been strongly criticizing Hekmatyar for
reconciliating with the Afghan government led by President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Pahalwan also had great influence on Dostum who has so far
rejected to follow Hekmatyar's lead, making alliance with Rabbani.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Iran Exchange Remains of Soldiers Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today handed over the remains
of 144 Iranian soldiers killed during the Iraq-Iran war
(1980-1988) and received 200 remains of Iraqi soldiers from Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Iraqi News Agency, the exchange took
place in the area of Shalamja on the Iran-Iraq border.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Iraqi foreign ministry said that the
exchange came within an initiative made by Iraq at a meeting held
today by the Iraqi-Iranian Joint Commission established in
September, 1995.
</P>
<P>
For years, the POW's problem has been a main obstacle to the
normalization of relations between Iraq and Iran. They have
exchanged some 75,000 prisoners of war, but Iraq accused Iran of
still detaining some 20,000 Iraqi soldiers, while Iran said Iraq
is still holding at least 1,000 Iranian ones.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the two countries agreed to recover and return
bodies of soldiers missing from the eight-year war.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Issue Forecast on Ultraviolet Ray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Meteorological
Service will soon issue a daily forecast on the amount of
ultraviolet (UV) rays that reach various parts of the country,
according to a press report here today.
</P>
<P>
Israel will thus join Canada, Australia and the United States, whose
residents have heard such forecasts for several years.
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that continual and uncontrolled exposure to the
invisible ultraviolet rays of the sun can cause serious health
dangers over one's lifetime. Not only does UV light age the skin,
but also it can cause cataracts and melanoma and other types of
skin cancer. The incidence of melanoma has increased by 300
percent during the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
An inter-disciplinary team of scientists from Israel's Rambam
Hospital, the Meteorological Service and the Haifa Technion's
school of Medicine and Architecture Faculty have developed a
technique to estimate the level of UV radiation from data
collected at 20 stations around the country.
</P>
<P>
The scale will range from below 4, when danger is low; 4 to
6.9, when the danger moderate; 7 to 8.9, when the danger high; and
over 9, when the danger extreme. The team aims at enhancing public
awareness of the danger of UV exposure.
</P>
<P>
The public will be warned to avoid exposure to the sun during
the peak hours from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and also to use sun screens,
wear broad-brimmed hats and light clothing with long sleeves. The
team is also planning to conduct research on the changes over the
years in the intensity of UV radiation in Israel and the Middle
East, and the effects on UV levels resulting from changes in the
stratospheric ozone layer due to air pollution.

<HEADLINE> S.Leonean Police Probe High Level Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Police in the Sierra Leonean
capital Freetown are investigating a series of high level
corruption involving a number of state officials and business
entrepaneurs in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Information and Broadcasting Minister George Banda Thomas told
a press conference on Monday that a connaivance between officials
of the Marine and Fishering Ministry "working in concert with big
fish barons have made the new government lose collosal sums in
foreign exchange through royalties, licensing and transhipment."
</P>
<P>
"Arrests and prosecutions of both state officials and people
in the business sector are now imminent," Banda Thomas announced.
</P>
<P>
The minister was speaking of a sum of two billion Leones
"disappearing mysteriously" from the government treasury. The
amount includes pensions, salaries and remittances.
</P>
<P>
The minister also disclosed that two contracts awarded to a
Lebanese businessman did not go through the government central
tender board.
</P>
<P>
The action was done by the former military government which
handed power to the civilian government in April.
</P>
<P>
One of the contracts was awarded to a compnay called Rokel
General Suppliers for the supply of school materials and
equipment for vocational institutions valued at over 1.9 million
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The second contract which was awarded to Ramesco for 2.7
million Pound Sterlings was fulfilled "in part" but as the
minister put it, "we have discovered that the two companies
belong to the same person although the companies were registered
in different names."
</P>
<P>
The government has ordered a temporary freeze on all payments
to the two companies and the money will be used to offset the
country's debt to international organiZations, according to the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The police will also investigate a number of defence contracts
valued up to 50 billion Leones or more signed by the former
military government, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The new civilian government of President Tejan Kabbah has
vowed to fight corruption and "bring back a clean government".

<P>
KHARTOUM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Information Minister al
Tayeb Ibrahim Mohammed Khier left here today for Cairo to
participate in the Arab cultural and information ministers' meeting
due to be held in Cairo this week.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Sudanese information minister will have
talks with his Egyptian counterpart Safwat el-Sherif on ways of
developing cultural and media cooperation between the two
countries, local newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
The papers quoted the Sudanese minister as saying that he would
discuss with Egyptian officials the foundations on which the
bilateral relations are based and the implementation of the Arab
summit which convened in Cairo on June 22-23.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir said Sunday night on his
return home from Cairo that his meeting with his Egyptian
counterpart Hosni Mubarak on the sidelines of the Cairo Arab
summit was a move intended to turn over a new page in the
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Egypt and Sudan have been strained after
Egypt accused Sudan of supporting terrorism and plotting to
assassinate Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in June 1995. But
Sudan has denied the accusations.

<HEADLINE> 10 More Nonhemophiliacs Infected With HIV in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 more patients who were
not hemophiliacs have been found infected with HIV after receiving
blood products that had not been heat-treated, Kyodo News Service
quoted the Health and Welfare Ministry as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is currently investigating how many nonhemophiliac
patients had received the dangerous products in the 1970s and the
1980s, by surveying medical institutions nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Of some 4,500 hemophiliacs in Japan, nearly 2,000 contracted
HIV through the imported, unheated blood products in the
1980s. Some 400 of them have died, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The ministry approved the production and sale of safer,
heat-treated blood products in 1985 but did not order drug
companies to recall unheated blood products at that time.
</P>
<P>
The unheated products were also widely used to treat people
other than hemophiliacs, including liver disease patients and
newborn babies, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Iran Not to Shake Hands with US for Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran declared here today it will
not shake hands with the United States for the issue of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Maleki, Deputy Foreign Minister for Education and
Research, told a press conference that "it is true that Iran
has influence in Afghanistan. But that does not mean Iran
must shake hands with those countries for Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the United States is now trying
its utmost to influence warring factions in Afghanistan by
holding hearings in the U.S. Congress in a bid to thwart
Iranian efforts to establish a pro-Tehran government.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question raised by Xinhua, the Iranian
deputy foreign minister said the Islamic Republic and the
United States will not have common efforts to deal with the
Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
He said they have their own strategies and policies and while
Iran is going to peruse its national interest in the region. "But
it is true that the influences are similar," he added.
</P>
<P>
Maleki noted that the United States had interest in
Afghanistan in the past in terms of disrupting the advance of the
Soviets and the Red Army. After the Soviet withdrawal, they began
to worry about the emergence of Islamic ideology.
</P>
<P>
"That is why they began to promote groups that depicted a bad
picture of Islam," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ali Khorrami, advisor to Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
and specialist on Afghanistan, said the United States is a super
power outside the region. "So, there is little possibility for
any cooperation between Iran and Afghanistan with the United
States," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States has something in their mind, then that
is something else," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the neighboring countries around Afghanistan
should have close cooperation and coordination in order to bring
peace to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Maleki also announced that Iran will
host an international seminar on Afghanistan from June 30 to July
1 in the capital of Tehran, and the event will be attended by
specialists and researchers from Afghanistan, Australia, China,
France, Italy, India, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey, the United States
and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
There will be 15 representatives from various Afghan
political parties for the international seminar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, representatives of some Afghan factions are going
to attend three days of hearings in the U.S. Congress
beginning Today, which is organized by Republican Senator Hank
Brown.
</P>
<P>
Maleki said that the gathering in the United States is
not very important and that is why Afghan leaders did not
participate. The U.S. conference was convened by the Senate and
not even by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
This week, Iranian authorities attacked the United States for
its attempt to establish a foothold in Afghanistan against the
Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Alauddin Boroujerdi, Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Oceania
Affairs, said Washington's attempts to mediate among Afghan
warring factions is "not out of benevolence, but a reaction
to Iran's successful mediation between the Afghan government and
Hezb-i-Islami, (the party) of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar."
</P>
<P>
"The train of peace has begun to move with the mediation
of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the White House is trying
to jump on the peace bandwagon on the one hand and undermine
the peace process on the other," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Cultivated Plant Fossil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Botanists in China have grown
thousands of yew tree, one of the oldest and the most precious
plant species in the world.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 yew trees have been grown by researchers in
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Yew tree is known as "plant fossil" among tree species by
botanists. Some countries, such as the United States, Britain and
France, have extracted from it yew alcohol as an expensive
anti-cancer medicine from the tree in recent years.
</P>
<P>
China has made great efforts to cultivate the trees in order to
obtain yew alcohol from these trees. But the natural yew grows at
such a slow speed that the plant diameter only reaches 10
centimeters after 100 years.
</P>
<P>
To provide more trees for yew alcohol, a local technology
development center started cultivation experiment since the
researchers found yew trees in the rural area of Benxi three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Some 40,000 yew trees, which have so far grown to 100
centimeters tall, were cultivated thanks to the successful
vegetative propagation in 1993.

<P>
CHANGSHA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Central-south China's Hunan
province is stepping up rice field management by applying more
fertilizers and pesticides to the fields, which suffered from rain
and pests earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
So far about 88 percent of the province's 165 hectares of early
rice are covered with first- or second-class rice seedlings which
have just begun sprouting.
</P>
<P>
A local source said that the rainy season and low temperatures
in the first few months of this year caused rice seedlings to rot,
or be afflicted with pests, in some parts of the province. The
problems were later remedied and improved by taking emergency
measures.
</P>
<P>
So far, virtually all the early rice fields have been applied
with fertilize and more than 200,000 ha of early rice have been
treated with chemical herbicides to strengthen the possibility for
an early rice bumper harvest in the province this year.

<HEADLINE> Mogadishu Death Toll Rises to Over 30 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Shooting continues for the
fifth day in south Mogadishu, the capital of horn of Africa
country Somalia, with the death toll rising to over 30.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 people were reported killed this morning and more
than 23 others wounded in the fighting between General Mohamed Farah
Aidid's loyalists and those of his former ally, Osman Hassan Ali
Atto.
</P>
<P>
Rival militiamen were using heavy artillery, anti-aircraft
missiles and heavy machine guns in the battle over the control of
the key K-7 junction, which fell to Osman Atto yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Casualties increased sharply as forces loyal to General Aidid
made a side cruise (an attack on the opponent from the back side
to kill both the moral and strength) on the former UN operation
strong base, Hunter Base, in Medina District.
</P>
<P>
Medina is a stronghold for militiamen in support of Aidid's
another arch-rival Ali Mahdi Mohamed. Eyewitnesses said six of
Aidid's armed wagons opened fire on the base currently as a
market.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest casualty reports from both hospital
and factional sources, over 30 civilians and militiamen on both
sides have been killed and more than 70 others wounded since
Saturday, when fighting re-eupted between the two south
Mogadishu strongmen.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims was an eight-month old child, who is being
under surgery at Dr Hassan Jiis Memorial Hospital after receiving
an anti-aircraft round in the Abdomen.
</P>
<P>
Adi Mohamed Hangul, the attending doctor, has expressed
pessimism about the recovery of the child, who was on his
mother's lap when a bullet hit all through his body.
</P>
<P>
The tension is very high in the war-torn city with no
negotiations going on between the warring parties. It is widely
feared that north Mogadishu warlord Ali Mahdi Mohamed will get
further involved in the fighting.

UNITED NATIONS -- U.N. chief weapons inspector Rolf Ekeus said
Monday that he had full confidence that an accord he reached with
Iraq regarding future access would hold. He told reporters that
the accord was reached in Baghdad Saturday for full, immediate,
unconditional access for U.N. weapons teams to sites they wished
to inspect.
</P>
<P>
But on the other side, he said, the U.N. inspection teams would
carry out their tasks "with full respect for the legitimate
security concerns of Iraq." He said that he believed Iraq was
still concealing weapons, components and documents concerning its
prohibited arms programs and playing a hide-and-seek game with the
U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus visited Baghdad last week after the Security Council
condemned Iraq's refusal earlier this month to give U.N.
inspectors access to a number of sites which Iraq said were
sensitive from the point of view of national security and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
LONDON -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher Monday
urged new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to establish
the same open dialogue with the Palestinians as his labor
predecessor had.
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that the prior government had very open
communications in various ways with Chairman Arafat and I'll be
urging Prime Minister Netanyahu to do that," he was quoted as
saying by reports reaching here from Shannon, Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But the top U.S. diplomat, due in Israel early Tuesday morning
for a brief visit, told reporters before a refueling stop in
Ireland that getting the Arab-Israeli peace process going again
would be slow work.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, defeating incumbent Shimon Peres by pledging to
crack down on terrorist strikes from Palestinian extremists in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, has said he would see Arafat only to
discuss security problems in the occupied territories.

TOKYO -- Japan's Okinawa prefectural government Monday
announced a referendum to ask local residents whether or not they

the referendum, which was voted for last week by the prefectural
assembly, Kyodo news service said.
</P>
<P>
The 13-member task force comprises three groups, one each to
take charge of public relations, coordination with local
governments, and general affairs, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bill for a special ordinance for the referendum was
proposed by the Okinawa branch of the Japanese Trade Union
Confederation (Rengo), Japan's largest labor organization,
following a petition backed by 34,500 signatures for the
residential vote, Kyodo said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Considers Insuring Air Force Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
asked the Defense Ministry to study the feasibility of insuring
the aircraft of the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF), Defense
Minister Syed Hamid Albar said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that the cabinet believed something has to be
done to cut the government's financial losses caused by a number
of mishaps that happened to RMAF aircraft in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Three RMAF planes crashed in the last two months -- an MB339A
training aircraft and an F5E jet that fell in the South China Sea,
and a Hawk 100 that crashed in Butterworth last week.
</P>
<P>
Syed said investigations revealed that the crashes of the
Italian-made MB339A and the US-made F5E were caused by technical
errors.
</P>
<P>
The minister ruled out poor maintenance as the cause of the
technical errors, adding that the two aircraft were "operational
and serviceable" before they were given the green light to fly.
</P>
<P>
He said the investigation into the crash of the Hawk 100 jet
trainer was still going on.

have been made in trade and economic cooperation between China and
Singapore since they established diplomatic relations in October
1990, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Minister of
Agriculture, Zhang Yanxi, announced here today new government
targets set for protection of farm and domestic animals and
poultry.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, the number of endangered animals will be
controlled within 15 percent from the current 15 percent to 20
percent. Varieties of domestic animals and poultry which will be
developed or used will account for 30 percent of all those under
protection.
</P>

China now has more than 570 varieties of domestic animals and
poultry.
</P>
<P>
To reach the target a national committee for domestic animals
and poultry genetic resources management has been set up. Members
of the committee include officials and experts from the relevant
government departments, research institutions, and teaching and
production units.
</P>
<P>
The committee will focus on protection of living animals and
poultry, to lay a foundation for reserving genes.
</P>
<P>
China has rich genetic resources of domestic animals and
poultry, which are important to the development of China's, and
even the world's, domestic animal and bird breeding industries,
Zhang Yanxi said.

<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A farmer who has had no training
in art opened his own painting exhibition today at the nation's
most renowned gallery.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Tiefeng, 44, has never attended an art school and only
began painting several years ago. But his works have won praises
from many Chinese art critics.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people were present at the opening ceremony of the
exhibition at the China Art Gallery, and most expressed their
curiosity over the phenomenon of Zhang's talent and popularity.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's works, done in traditional watercolor and ink, deal
mainly with rural life. Critics said that Zhang has successfully
illustrated the essence of life, which most academicians cannot
produce.
</P>
<P>
A native of Hebei province in north China, Zhang has practiced
kung fu since the age of 16. Experts said that he has worked the
laws of martial arts into his paintings.
</P>
<P>
People like Zhang who have special artistic talent are rare,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
"Zhang's attempt raised again the question of how to reform the
traditional Chinese painting, which the professional artists have
been thinking about for years," said Liu Bosu, president of the
Traditional Chinese Paintings Academy.
</P>
<P>
Watercolor and ink painting was the prominent style used in
Chinese art before the appearance of large numbers of western oil
paintings and watercolor paintings in the 19th century.

<HEADLINE> China To Use Uniform Plane Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- China will issue uniform airplane
tickets for both domestic and overseas airlines, now that its more
than 2,000 ticketing agencies have been connected with a global
distribution system.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one Chinese carriers are withdrawing their tickets from
agents and preparing to use uniform tickets. The Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC), in cooperation with the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), will set a
deadline for the use of different tickets for each airline.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid growth of China's air transport market, and
foreign airlines expanding their operations in China, airlines and
ticketing agents have had to deal with complicated settlement
procedures for lack of a unified reservation system and uniform
tickets.
</P>
<P>
China linked its air ticket reservation system with the global
system at the beginning of this year, which made it possible for
Chinese agents to sell uniform air tickets for all airlines.
</P>
<P>
The CAAC's efforts in recent years to spread ICAO's Billing and
Settlement Plan (BSP) in China have also facilitated the use of
the new tickets. BSP, a widely-used system to simplify selling,
reporting and settling procedures between carriers and ticketing
agencies, requires a neutral standard transport certificate in
business dealings.
</P>
<P>
China's first BSP data processing center formerly went into
operation at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 60 domestic agents have already begun to
use the new tickets.

BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- China Telecom donated four million
yuan to the Hope Project, a program to help dropouts return to
school.
</P>
<P>
The money, which was raised from selling specially-designed

</P>
<P>
The Hope Project was initiated in 1989. Since then, the

dollars) to provide financial assistance to 1.25 million poor
students and build 2,074 Hope Project primary schools.
</P>
<P>
To support the project, China Telecom issued the first set of
calling cards on June 1. The cards, which fall into two categories
titled, "I Want to Go to School" and "Under the Sunshine," cost 32
yuan, but have a face value of 30 yuan each. The extra two yuan
are donated to the Hope Project.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealanders will not need to
pay postage for their domestic ordinary letters next Monday as the
New Zealand Post today announced July 1 as a free post day.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after the state-owned company reported a
record after-tax profit of 75.2 million NZ dollars (50 million US
dollars) in the 1995/96 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The free postage day is being offered for all medium-sized
letters with a hand-written address posted before 5 PM (0500 GMT)
on that day.
</P>
<P>
However, the offer excludes fast post, international mail, bulk
mail, and parcel services.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Post said its higher-than-expected profit was
driven by volume increases in bulk and business mails, full rate
letters, and courier and parcel business.
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to the high profit were revenue from overseas
policy advisory services and increased financial transactions
through the Post Shop network, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Attorney General Amos Wako
has ruled out constitution reform before the next general
election due for next year.
</P>
<P>
Amos Wako said complete review of the constitution is a long
process and it could not possibly be concluded before the next
general election, "even if we started the process now."
</P>
<P>
He was meeting the outgoing American Ambassador to Kenya
Aurelia Brazeal here on Monday and was apparently reacting to the
persistence appeal to reform the constitution, made by opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that "everybody is tired of piece-meal
amendments, so far we have had about 32 and I think a national
consensus must be reached on how to review the constitution."
</P>
<P>
He said Parliament will discuss the best way to gather views
from the public so as to reflect the opinion of the grassroot
Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
In the new year message of 1995, President Daniel arap
Moi called on constitution experts from the west to assist the
the constitution reform.

KUNMING, South China, June 25 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The world record
holder in the women's 200-meter individual medley Lin Li of China
said Tuesday that she would quit after this summer's Centennial
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to retire after the Olympics and I have
discussed it with my coach Zhang Xiong." She said as training in
the Yunnan Provincial Swimming Pool, "he has agreed with my
opinion."
</P>
<P>
Lin, 26, who chalked up an Olympic gold for China four years
ago at the Barcelona Games with a world record-shattering time,
became the only third-time Olympian of China's swimming squad. She
will take part in the women's 200 meters breaststroke and 200
meters individual medley in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who had one-year lay-off from competitive swimmning after
the Hiroshima Asian Games in 1994, launched a strong comeback from
the beginning of this year. She stayed in Chinese Taipei (Taiwai
Province) for five months, teaching swimming in a sports school.
</P>
<P>
At the Olympic Trials in Tianjin last April, Lin finished
silver in both the 200m breaststroke and her speciality, the 200m
individual medley. She will not participate in any relay events.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the prospects of the upcoming Olympic Games, the
native of the Jiangsu Province said: "I am confident to clock a
personal best time at the Games."
</P>
<P>
Lin burst into the international screen finishing seventh in
both the 200m individual medley and the 200m breaststroke at her
first Olympic appearance in 1988. She gained instant fame after
grabbing a gold in the women's 400 individual medley at the World
Championships in Perth, Australia in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Tourism to Become Pillar of Anhui's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Tourism will become a leading
economic industry on the inland province of Anhui by the end of
this century or the beginning of the next.
</P>
<P>
Anhui plans to develop 40 major tourism projects in the next
five years, which require a total investment of 2.1 billion
yuan. The provincial government hopes to introduce overseas
capital to help fund these projects.
</P>
<P>
Anhui has drafted a plan for its tourism industry that includes
three key tourist belts in the southern, middle and northern parts
of the province.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is already flourishing in the east China province,
whose most famous tourist attraction is the Huangshan mountain in
southern Anhui. It is considered one of the most beautiful
mountains in China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, Anhui had five national tourist sites in
Huangshan, Jiuhua, Tianzhu, Qiyun and Langya mountains, nine
cultural relics and three historical cities of Xixian, Shouxian
and Bozhou under national protection.
</P>
<P>
To promote tourism, the province in recent years has built
tourism zones in Huangshan mountain and Jinpen Bay, and launched
several festivals that feature local culture.
</P>
<P>
About 765,000 overseas travelers visited Anhui in the past five
years, with an annual growth rate of 11.8 percent. Tourism brought
in 110 million US dollars in foreign exchange, while nearly 64.5
million domestic travelers came to the province in the same period
and contributed 2.37 billion yuan to its revenue.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A farmer who has had no training
in art opened his own painting exhibition today at the nation's
most renowned gallery.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Tiefeng, 44, has never attended an art school and only
began painting several years ago. But his works have won praises
from many Chinese art critics.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people were present at the opening ceremony of the
exhibition at the China Art Gallery, and most expressed their
curiosity over the phenomenon of Zhang's talent and popularity.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's works, done in traditional watercolor and ink, deal
mainly with rural life. Critics said that Zhang has successfully
illustrated the essence of life, which most academicians cannot
produce.
</P>
<P>
A native of Hebei province in north China, Zhang has practiced
kung fu since the age of 16. Experts said that he has worked the
laws of martial arts into his paintings.
</P>
<P>
People like Zhang who have special artistic talent are rare,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
"Zhang's attempt raised again the question of how to reform the
traditional Chinese painting, which the professional artists have
been thinking about for years," said Liu Bosu, president of the
Traditional Chinese Paintings Academy.
</P>
<P>
Watercolor and ink painting was the prominent style used in
Chinese art before the appearance of large numbers of western oil
paintings and watercolor paintings in the 19th century.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A law to bar people from
simultaneously holding positions in parliament and the armed
forces has been drafted by the government in a bid to
de-politicize the army in the run up to the 1998 general election.
</P>
<P>
"All parties are well aware that if the army is not really
neutral there will be problems in the next elections," Secretary
of State for Defense Ek Sereywath was quoted as saying in the
Cambodia Daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Co-Defense Minister Tea Banh, himself a three-star general and
member of the Cambodian People's Party steering committee said,
"Military personnel have to be neutral. They cannot be involved
with politics."

The law, which prohibits members of political factions from
holding positions in the armed forces, and armed forces personnel
from holding seats in the National Assembly, was approved by the
Council of Ministers last week.
</P>

by hardliners headed by Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri
in a bid to undermine moderate President Rafsanjani and his
liberal camp.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Press Court Monday voted by a clear
majority against Mohajerani, but decided to be lenient in imposing
a sentence on him considering his past performance in the public

Payam Daneshioo's managing director was found guilty as
charged, but again the court, taking into account his previous
promise to refrain from making libelous accusations, decided to
show leniency at the time of handing out a verdict and a
sentence.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Protest Commission Report on Plane Downings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Cuba is to make a formal protest
over the report of the commission investigating the February
downing of two U.S. civilian planes by Cuban fighters, the
country's official newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
Cuba will urge this week's meeting of the Council of the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to order the
investigating commission to complete the document, re-examine its
accuracy and contradictions as well as contribute additional
elements, the Juventud Rebelde newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The two planes, belonging to Brothers to the Rescue, a
Miami-based group opposed to Cuban President Fidel Castro, were
hit by air-to-air missiles fired by the Cuban fighters.
</P>
<P>
Cuba claimed the planes had flown into Cuban air space while
the U.S. government said they were beyond Cuba's jurisdiction. A
commission was set up to investigate the downing.
</P>
<P>
But last week at a White House briefing, U.S. Undersecretary of
State Peter Tarnoff said the commission's report, which had not
yet been officially released, concluded that the two planes were
over international waters when they were downed.
</P>
<P>
Tarnoff said the report also showed "that there was no
justification for that outrageous action and that the Cubans did
not attempt to follow standard international norms in warning the
aircraft."
</P>
<P>
Cuba had handed in documents, radar data, original recordings
of the conversations between the pilots and control tower and
interviews with witnesses which showed the planes were in Cuban
air space and that the intruders had been warned, Juventud Rebelde
said.
</P>
<P>
Cuba suspects the recordings given to the investigating
commission by U.S authorities "contain serious adulterations to
try to show that the incident took place beyond Cuban
jurisdiction."
</P>
<P>
"There is a certain inclination in the report to take as
God-given words anything that came from the American side," said
President of Cuba's parliament Ricardo Alarcon.
</P>
<P>
"There is a suspicion that there was a marriage between the
investigating commission and the United States," said Alarcon, a
member of the politburo of Cuba's Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the chief of Air Navigation of the ICAO, to whom
the head of the investigating commission reports, is a
U.S. representative.
</P>
<P>
Brothers to the Rescue, which has called for measures to bring
down Castro's socialist government, has flown into Cuban air space
several times in acts of defiance and organized routine weekend
patrols of the Straits of Florida to search for Cubans fleeing the
island on rafts and small boats.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Seek Cooperation of All Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Shiekh
Hasina has sought cooperation of all sections of people to
complete the unfinished task of Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman,
the first head of state after independence in 1971, to ensure the
basic needs of the people.
</P>
<P>
In her first address to the nation over radio and television
last night, the prime minister said Bangabandhu, who is also the
late father of the prime minister, had envisioned a society where
the people would get the facilities of food, clothings, housing
and education.
</P>
<P>
Improved life of the people was the dream of her father and
this objective could be achieved only through united efforts of
all, she said.
</P>
<P>
Hasina also unveiled the government's plans of action, giving
priority to enforcement of discipline in all spheres and assuring
foreign donors of honoring all bilateral accords in line with the
free market economy.
</P>
<P>
Privatization will be continued, the government's involvement
will be reduced, trust newspapers will be divested and electronic
media would be given autonomy, she pledged.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister called for a war on corruption and terrorism
menacing public life. "We had liberated this country unitedly at a
difficult juncture. With the same spirit, we will breathe
together, cherish same belief and march together in the struggle
to liberate the country from terrorism, corruption and misrule,"
she stressed.

<HEADLINE> Quebec Celebration Turns Into Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The St. Jean Baptiste holiday
celebrations degenerated into riots today in the historic city of
Quebec as over two thousand rioters broke windows, looted shops
and set fire to a legislative building.
</P>
<P>
The riot occurred shortly after an outdoor concert attended by
as many as 50,000 people, part of the holiday weekend celebrations
in the capital of Quebec province.
</P>
<P>
Rioters pelted the police with beer bottles and stones, and
police used teargas and water cannons to disperse the crowds,
according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)
Television report tonight.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 rioters were arrested during four hours of rioting and the
losses are estimated to be worth 360,000 U.S. dollars, CBC said.
</P>
<P>
St. Jean Baptiste Day, is celebrated only in the province of
Quebec every June 24 and is often used a rallying point for Quebec
nationalists who want to separate from Canada.
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame," said one person interviewed by CBC. "We don't like
it. It is bad," added another.
</P>
<P>
Today's riot is the second in only two months in Quebec City, which
saw its shops looted and windows smashed by over 1,500 youth on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jean-Paul L'Allier vowed that his city will do all it can to
prevent any recurrence of similar incidents.
</P>
<P>
Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard has ordered an investigation to the
riot to "know exactly what happened, why it happened and who did
that".

<HEADLINE> Kazakh President Values Visit by Jiang Zemin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said that a planned visit to the country by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin is bound to usher in a new era in the
history of bilateral relations between Kazakhstan and China.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Nazarbayev said that Jiang's
visit to Kazakhstan on July 4-6, the highest-level in the history
of bilateral ties, will greatly promote their political and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kazakh-Chinese relations have witnessed stable and
rapid development since the central Asian country declared
independence in late 1991.
</P>
<P>
There has been a frequent exchange of high-level visits between
Kazakhstan and China and the two neighbors have enacted all
legislation necessary for maintaining normal state relations,
Nazarbayev said.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh president spoke highly of a border treaty signed in
the Chinese port city of Shanghai in April 1996 by China,
Kazakhstan, Russia and two other former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
He praised the signing of the confidence-building treaty as "a
great event" for Kazakhstan which has a 1,700-kilometer-long
common border with China.
</P>
<P>
The treaty provides that troop movements in a 100-km zone along
either side of the five nation's 7,654-km borders may be carried
out only after informing the other side. Basic weapons and armor
in the zone must be made known to each other.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev also expressed thanks to the Chinese people for
providing a shortest trade route to the Pacific for his country.
</P>
<P>
The president said the Kazakh people are ready to get along
well with their Chinese neighbors for the restoration and the
prosperity of the historical "Silk Road."
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev reiterated that Kazakhstan recognizes China's
unification and territorial integrity while opposing any form of
separatism.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan supports all the measures taken by the Chinese
government in maintaining national unity, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev also briefed Xinhua reporters about his country's
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Since the issue of its own national currency in 1993, he said,
Kazakhstan has made some achievements in its economic reforms,
including a significant drop of inflation and an upturn in
production this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that rich in resources Kazakhstan attracts much foreign
investment and, in the previous year alone, western investors put
2 billion U.S. dollars in its oil and natural gas industries.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan hopes for investment by China's big companies, which
is mutual-beneficiary, he added.

WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A heavy storm lashed
Washington, D.C. Monday evening, toppling trees, destroying houses
and knocking out power for thousands of suburban residents.
</P>
<P>
Flights to the National Airport were postponed as the storm

OTTAWA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Official statistics released today

<HEADLINE> India to Export 2 Million Tons of Wheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- India is expected to export 2
million tons of wheat this year following its record wheat
production, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
India's wheat production for the year is now estimated at 65
million tons, 8 million tons more than that of the United States.
</P>
<P>
India has announced plans to export a further 2 million tons of
wheat at the end of May and it could gain at the expense of
exporters like the US, which have seen a production shortfall due
to adverse weather conditions, the same official said.
</P>
<P>
A record wheat crop is expected in India following favorable
growing conditions and increased fertilizer application.
</P>
<P>
Exports of wheat this year could mean greater profits with
average international wheat prices more than double those of the
previous year, said a report of the International Grains Council.

<HEADLINE> Thailand May Rely on Gas Imports Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand may face a total
dependence on foreign natural gas in the early next century as the
country has consumed nearly 40 percent of its proved gas reserves
over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the Department of Mineral Resources,
about 81.4 billion cubic meters (BCMS) of indigenous natural gas
had been extracted between 1981 and 1995 in the country, about 90
percent of which came from fields in the gulf of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The department estimated that the remaining 109.3 BCMS of the
proved gas reserves in Thailand is expected to be depleted over
the next decade as insatiable demand for energy is still rising in
the country.
</P>
<P>
locally-produced natural gas has been a major energy resource
for Thailand. It is used to generate nearly one-third of the
country's electricity as well as for mushrooming gas-related
industries like petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers earlier said the Thai government was planning
to purchase natural gas from the Middle East in the future and had
concluded related accords with some Middle East countries, which
would take effect after 2007 or so.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebel Suicide Squad Penetrated into Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 25 (Xinhua)-- A Tamil rebel suicide squad of 19
reportedly penetrated into Sri Lanka's capital Colombo under
direct orders of rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, intelligence
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader assigned them to attack several key
installations and target VIPs in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The National Intelligence Bureau has accordingly informed the
security forces and police to be on the alert for the members of
this suicide squad, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Following the failure of recent rebel attacks in Colombo, it is
reported that the intelligence wing of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has been disbanded and orders are now issued
directly by Prabhakaran, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to round up the suicide squad, the government
security forces are conducting a series of cordon and search
operations in and around Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The latest massive bomb blast in Colombo killed over 90 people
and injured some 1,400 when the LTTE rebel suicide bombers
detonated a vehicle bomb at the Central Bank on January 31 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 13-year war for a separate Tamil
state in the north and east of the country.

<HEADLINE> Basque Group Starts Week-Long Cease-Fire in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Madrid, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
said that the week-long unilateral cease-fire started today by the
militant Basque separatist group Eta is a propaganda stunt.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire, said the prime minister, was designed to
disrupt a upcoming meeting of Basque parties opposed to Eta, which
over the past 27 years has killed more than 750 people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Javier Mayor Oreja called on the
Eta, which has fought for a separate Basque state made up of four
northern Spanish provinces and three southwestern French
departments, to release prison officer Jose Ortega Lara it has
held for five months.
</P>
<P>
He urged the parties attending the Tuesday meeting to
concentrate on uniting against the Eta and not squabble over the
response to the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Iturgay, the Popular Party spokesman in the Basque
country, said talks with the Eta should not be considered.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Spanish Socialist Workers Party said the
week-long cease-fire was insufficient and that the Eta would have
to offer more before negotiations could be considered.
</P>
<P>
The Basque regional government, which is led by the moderate
Basque Nationalist Party, said the cease-fire provided a reason
for hope but called on the Eta to give up its arms altogether.
</P>
<P>
The Eta has said it will hold Ortega Lara until the government
changes its policy of placing Eta prisoners in jails outside the
Basque Country. Some 30 of the 600 Eta members in Spanish prisons
are due to be moved to the Basque country in coming weeks.

<HEADLINE> Australians Support Gun Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard has won broad support among voters for his push to
implement tough gun control laws in the country, according to
results of the latest public opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
The results of the Newspoll showed that 68 percent of the
polled Australians believed that Howard was right on gun issues
and that the proposed gun laws should be even stricter.
</P>
<P>
Six weeks after the police ministers of federal and state
governments agreed on principles of uniform national gun laws,
debate is still going on over whether the states should implement
the proposed laws.
</P>
<P>
New South Wales was the first state to pass a new gun law at
its parliament last weekend. But progress of the gun legislation
ran into strong resistance from gun lobbyists and gun owners.
</P>
<P>
The Newspoll showed that 48 percent of the voters said that
Howard's law was about right, 20 percent said that they should be
stricter. Only 23 percent said that the laws were too strict.
</P>
<P>
On May 10, the police ministers agreed to impose a national ban
on automatic and semi-automatic guns and set up a national
licensing and registration system of all weapons.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was prompted by the massacre of 35 persons by a
lone gunman at Port Arthur in Tasmania on April 28.
</P>
<P>
However, 56 percent of the people surveyed would support a
compromise being considered by the government to allow farmers
access to high-powered semi-automatic guns in special
circumstances, the Newspoll showed.
</P>
<P>
Queensland was the most pro-gun state in the country. The poll
showed that only 37 percent of the people surveyed in the state
regarded the new gun laws as right, while 64 percent supported a
compromise on the laws.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he would enact a referendum on the issue if the
states failed to pass the uniform national gun laws.
</P>
<P>
However, he said on Friday that he would consider proposed
comprises on the tough gun laws, including modification of
automatic weapons instead of surrendering them to the police.

<HEADLINE> EU, ACP to Explore Ways of Maintaining Special Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and 70
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries are to meet in West
Samoa Thursday to discuss ties after a major trade and aid
convention expires.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, according to reports reaching here
today from Luxembourg, the two sides will try to explore means of
maintaining special links between them after the Lome Convention
expires in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the convention, the ACP countries, most of which former
European colonies, enjoy preferential access to the EU market and
an annual aid of 4 billion U.S. dollars from the EU.
</P>
<P>
The ACP countries are concerned that they will lose the
privilege after the convention expires.
</P>
<P>
The ACP's share of the EU market, as shown in figures released
by European Commission, has slipped significantly to only 3
percent from 9 percent over the past 25 years despite efforts to
make ACP exports more competitive and to diversify trade.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the EU members are increasingly reluctant to
shoulder the burden of the ACP countries owing to the pressure of
the economic problems of their own.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention was first signed in Lome, Togo, in 1975 by
the nine countries of the European Economic Community (EEC),
predecessor of the EU, and 46 developing countries of the ACP.
</P>
<P>
The first convention allows free access to the EEC market of
all industrial and 94.2 percent of the agricultural exports of the
46 ACP countries. The convention has been updated every five
years.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Jewelry Exports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's jewelry exports in
1995 reached 31.5 million US dollars in value, almost 16 times
higher than the 1990 figure of 1.98 million US dollars, sources
from the Export Development Board said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the country's jewelry industry has now reached
a point where large investment was necessary to make headway into
the export arena.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's efforts in the past five years have made its
jewelry popular among buyers from Japan, Germany, US, Britain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Italy, and countries of the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
With its rich resources of precious and semi-precious stones,
Sri Lanka has an advantage over other countries in this industry,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, it was time to stop small scale production and to go
into capital intensive investment if the industry was to remain
competitive in the international market, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
They said new investment is needed to bring in the latest
technology and machinery to help manufacturers improve and adapt
their products to the requirements of overseas buyers.

BRUSSELS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has backed
Japan's proposal to set up an international "governmental forum"

Trade and Industry (MITI), who is in Belgium to brief the EU on
his talks last week with U.S. trade negotiators over U.S. access
to the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
Japan's agreement with the United States on access to Japan's
computer chip market expires on July 31. Tokyo is against
renewing the agreement and wants free market forces to prevail.
</P>
<P>
The EU also opposes the deal because of its exclusivity in
guaranteeing market access only to U.S. chips. Any new deal
should not favor U.S. manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
An EU spokesman said today that the commission was "cautiously
optimistic" that Japan's approach could work.
</P>
<P>
Sakamoto said the issue was likely to be raised at this week's
meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in Lyons,
France.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 garment workers were
killed and about 50 others injured in a fire incident that broke
out Monday afternoon in two garment factories at Mirpur in the
northwest of Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, of the victims 10 are young
women.
</P>
<P>
The fire severely damaged the garment factories which were
located in a 6-storey building, said the sources, adding that the
fire originated from the heated irons at the 3rd floor of the
building and soon spread to a pile of clothes when the workers
there left for lunch.
</P>
<P>
It engulfed the entire building quickly. A female worker said
that "we were looking for the way-out to save our lives soon after
the fire broke out. We can't remember anything more, even how we
could escape the incident."
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire
after 4 hours.
</P>
<P>
The damage was unofficially estimated at tk 20 million (about

<HEADLINE> Turtles Along Sri Lanka's South Coast In Danger Of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 25 (Xinhua)-- Turtle along the southern coastal
belt of Sri Lanka will be in danger of extinction if remedial
measures are not adopted early, according to experts here today.
</P>
<P>
Turtle egg selling and coral mining have contributed greatly
towards this, they said.
</P>
<P>
The experts stated that other factors are trawlers, fishing
craft, hotels, unauthorised structures, floodlights directed
towards the sea from tourist hotels and loud music from hotels
which disturb and scare away the turtles, the experts added.
</P>
<P>
Turtle has been a protected creature since 1970's. The fishing
of Turtles and disposing of turtle eggs, raw or boiled, have been
prohibited by law since 1972. But these activities go on unabated
along the coastal belt.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Urges Israeli-Palestinian Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher today urged new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to establish the same open dialogue with the
Palestinians as his labor predecessor had.
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that the prior government had very open
communications in various ways with Chairman Arafat and I'll be
urging Prime Minister Netanyahu to do that," he was quoted as
saying by reports reaching here from Shannon, Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But the top U.S. diplomat, due in Israel early Tuesday morning
for a brief visit, told reporters before a refueling stop in
Ireland that getting the Arab-Israeli peace process going again
would be slow work.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, defeating incumbent Shimon Peres by pledging to
crack down on terrorist strikes from Palestinian extremists in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, has said he would see Arafat only to
discuss security problems in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, starting his first trip to the Middle East since
Netanyahu's surprise election victory last month, said on his
plane en route to Tel Aviv that his brief visit would be aimed at
building with Netanyahu the sort of "working relationship"
Washington had with Peres.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. openly backed the re-election bid of Peres, who proved
a willing ally in the land-for-peace policies advocated by the
Clinton administration. But Netanyahu whipped up support for his
candidacy among hard-line Israelis by claiming Peres wanted to
trade biblically sacred lands for an insecure peace with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Although Netanyahu has said he is willing to negotiate with the
Arabs without preconditions, his policy statements have implicitly
rejected the "land-for-peace" approach. They have opposed
returning the Golan Heights to Syria, or allowing a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
After some 30 hours in Israel, Christopher is due to be in
Cairo Wednesday to meet with Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on last weekend's Arab summit which assessed the impact of
Netanyahu's election on peace prospects.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the first since the Gulf War broke out in 1991,
warned in a communique that Arab states might reconsider their
peace moves toward Israel if the Jewish state does not withdraw
from Arab lands.

<P>
KATHMANDU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A Royal Nepal Airlines flight to
Mumbai, India, was delayed for more than four hours on Monday
evening by an anonymous bomb claim that later proved to be a hoax,
the Kathmandu Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The flight RA 201, fully loaded with passengers, was ready to
take off at 6 PM local time (1215 GMT) but was grounded after the
air control office in the Kathmandu Airport received an anonymous
call claiming a time bomb aboard, the report said.

The caller warned that the bomb concealed in the Boeing 757 jet
was timed to explode when the plane would be on its return flight
to Kathmandu, an airport official was quoted as saying.

A thorough search by security personnel found no suspicious
device on board, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Center Helps Unemployed Women Find Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A special women's employment
agency has helped more than 50 laid-off woman workers find jobs
since it opened in the Chinese capital last month.
</P>
<P>
Some other 100 unemployed women, who have registered with the
Beijing Women's Employment Service Center, are also waiting for
new jobs as sales clerks, housekeepers and maids.
</P>
<P>
The center plans to run training courses, such as tailoring,
computer operation, cooking, housekeeping and economic management,
to upgrade skills and make their clients more competitive in the
job market.
</P>
<P>
But, the center workers have also had to convince some of the
women there is no shame in taking cleaning or labour jobs, which
are readily available, but most of their clients are reluctant to
accept, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, the estimated 108,000 women, mostly those
older than 35, had lost job due to industrial reform in the
capital, the report quoted Li Lingyan, vice-chairwoman of the
Municipal Women's Federation, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both their living standards and positions in the family have
dropped as a result of the cut in their income, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"But, although pressured by their unemployment, many women are
reluctant to accept jobs they think are 'indecent and low,' such
as housekeepers and street cleaners," the report said.

<HEADLINE> hke - Norway Expects Jiang's Visit to Promote Norwagian-China Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
forthcoming visit to Norway late this month will help promote the
cooperation between Norway and China in politics, economy, trade
and culture, Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal has said.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Chinese reporters, Godal said his
country is expecting Jiang's visit on June 27-29, which provides
an opportunity for China and Norway to exchange views on bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's scheduled visit is part of his six-nation European tour
which will also take him to Spain, Romania, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzia
and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Godal said recent years have seen frequent exchange of
high-level visits between China and Norway.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and
Chinese vice-premiers, Zhu Rongji and Li Lanqing, paid separate
visits to Norway.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland
visited China.
</P>
<P>
The relations between China and Norway developed rapidly
because both sides upheld the principle of mutual respect and
exchanging views through political dialogue, Godal said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the past few years, China and Norway have made
constructive and extensive contacts on issues in the political,
economic, trade and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Such contacts, he said, were very conducive to increasing
mutual understanding, and laid the basis for further bilateral
cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Godal said China, as an important trading partner of Norway,
occupies the most important place in Norway's "Asia Strategy,"
which was designed by the Norwegian government last year.
</P>
<P>
He added that the noticeable success of the Chinese economy in
recent years has provided the Norwegian businesses with the
opportunity to participate in Chinese economic construction.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed that the Norwegian government
encourages the Norwegian businesses to expand cooperation with
China in oil exploration, shipping equipment manufacturing,
information technology and chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
Though a small country, Norway boasts the world's first-class
technology in these fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian foreign minister spoke highly of China's progress
in legislation.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Norway's one-China policy and its support for
China's restoration of its status in the World Trade
Organization.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Sees Growing Number of Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of tourists visiting
Myanmar grew at an annual rate of 150 percent in the last few
years, the official New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Deputy Minister for Hotels and Tourism
Brig. Gen. Tin Aye at the opening ceremony of a tourist guide
course here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists exceeded 137,320 in the 1995-96 fiscal
year ending in March, up from only 5,000 in 1989-90, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the figure would exceed the target
of 500,000 in 1998-99 if this rate is maintained.
</P>
<P>
Licenses have been issued to 491 tour operators, 385 hotels,
motels, inns and guest houses, 1,344 passenger transport services,
and 1,598 tourist guides in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
This year has been designated as a Tourist Year for Myanmar,
which is to open in late November on a grand scale.

<HEADLINE>   Arab Summit Shouldn't Be Ignored, Says France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- France today described the Arab
Summit which ended in Cairo Sunday as "an important event that
deserves the greatest attention."
</P>
<P>
The summit conveys "the anxiety of Arab leaders at a critical
phase in the (Middle East) peace process" and "the legitimate
concern to harmonize and coordinate their positions," deputy
foreign ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said.
</P>
<P>
The summit has, at the same time, "reaffirmed the adherence of
Arab countries to the peace process, to the principles it is built
upon and the accords already concluded," said Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
The newly elected right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu "also reaffirmed his willingness to pursue the peace
process," Doutriaux noted.
</P>
<P>
France is considered the most influential European country in
the Middle East. It has close ties with many Arab countries,
partly owing to its colonial legacy and its agreement to allow
many exiled Arab leaders to live in France.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders held a two-day meeting in Cairo, Egypt, at the
weekend to assess the Middle East peace process after hardline
Likud leader Netanyahu defeated Labor chief Shimon Peres in the
general elections last month.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's strong rhetoric during and after his election
campaign sparked deep concern in the Arab world about the
continuation of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Despite Netanyahu's remarks that he will continue talks with
the Arabs without any preconditions, he was seen to have taken a
major step backward on positions already agreed by Israel in the
peace process, by refusing to return the strategic Golan Heights to
Syria, refusing to negotiate the status of Jerusalem and denying
the Palestinians' rights to establish an independent state.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo summit warned that Arab countries might reconsider
their peace moves toward Israel should it halt the
"land-for-peace" process.
</P>
<P>
Most observers believe that Netanyahu's election victory will
almost certainly lead to the slowing down of the Middle East peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Police Investigate Ex-Presidential Aide's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian police said
today that they are investigating the possibility that Paulo Cesar
Farias, top aide to a former Brazilian president, was killed to
keep him from testifying at the ongoing corruption trials.
</P>
<P>
Farias was found shot to death on Sunday reportedly along with
his girl-friend at his beach house in Maceio, about 2,100
kilometers northeast of Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
Farias was found in the chest and his girl-friend next to him
apparently dying from poisoning. Local reports had said that the
girlfriend shot Farias and then committed suicide. But some media
reports said both of them were assassinated.
</P>
<P>
Federal Police Director Vicente Chelotti said Monday that
"first indications are of a crime of passion, but because it is
Farias, we can not rule out the possibility that it was a 'burning
of files.'"
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old aide, who served as the Fernando Collor de
Mello's presidential campaign manager in 1989, was convicted of
corruption in the scandal that led to the impeachment of the
former president in december 1992. He was sentenced to five years
in prison in 1994 on tax evasion charges and was released on
parole seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
Farias was scheduled to testify on Friday in one of 106
corruption trials.

<HEADLINE> Kazakh President Values Visit by Jiang Zemin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said that a planned visit to the country by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin is bound to usher in a new era in the
history of bilateral relations between Kazakhstan and China.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Nazarbayev said that Jiang's
visit to Kazakhstan on July 4-6, the highest-level in the history
of bilateral ties, will greatly promote their political and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kazakh-Chinese relations have witnessed stable and
rapid development since the central Asian country declared
independence in late 1991.
</P>
<P>
There has been a frequent exchange of high-level visits between
Kazakhstan and China and the two neighbors have enacted all
legislation necessary for maintaining normal state relations,
Nazarbayev said.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh president spoke highly of a border treaty signed in
the Chinese port city of Shanghai in April 1995 by China,
Kazakhstan, Russia and two other former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
He praised the signing of the confidence-building treaty as "a
great event" for Kazakhstan which has a 1,700-kilometer-long
common border with China.
</P>
<P>
The treaty provides that troop movements in a 100-km zone along
either side of the five nation's 7,654-km borders may be carried
out only after informing the other side. Basic weapons and armor
in the zone must be made known to each other.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev also expressed thanks to the Chinese people for
providing a shortest trade route to the Pacific for his country.
</P>
<P>
The president said the Kazakh people are ready to get along
well with their Chinese neighbors for the restoration and the
prosperity of the historical "Silk Road."
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev reiterated that Kazakhstan recognizes China's
unification and territorial integrity while opposing any form of
separatism.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan supports all the measures taken by the Chinese
government in maintaining national unity, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev also briefed Xinhua reporters about his country's
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Since the issue of its own national currency in 1993, he said,
Kazakhstan has made some achievements in its economic reforms,
including a significant drop of inflation and an upturn in
production this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that rich in resources Kazakhstan attracts much foreign
investment and, in the previous year alone, western investors put
2 billion U.S. dollars in its oil and natural gas industries.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan hopes for investment by China's big companies, which
is mutual-beneficiary, he added.

PARIS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Big orders from the Middle East
boosted French arms sales to 33.5 billion francs (6.7 billion
U.S. dollars) last year, a 5.7 percent rise over 1994, the arms
procurement office said on Monday.

murder of the chief of the Mass Communication Organization of
Thailand (MCOT), the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Kazakh President Values Visit by Jiang Zemin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said today that a planned visit to the country by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin is bound to usher in a new era in
the history of bilateral relations between Kazakhstan and China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Nazarbayev said that Jiang's visit
to Kazakhstan on July 4-6, the highest-level in the history of
bilateral ties, will greatly promote their political and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kazakh-Chinese relations have witnessed stable and
rapid development since the central Asian country declared
independence in late 1991.
</P>
<P>
There has been a frequent exchange of high-level visits between
Kazakhstan and China and the two neighbors have enacted all
legislation necessary for maintaining normal state relations,
Nazarbayev said.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh president spoke highly of a border treaty signed in
the Chinese port city of Shanghai in April 1995 by China,
Kazakhstan, Russia and two other former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
He praised the signing of the confidence-building treaty as "a
great event" for Kazakhstan which has a 1,700-kilometer-long
common border with China.
</P>
<P>
The treaty provides that troop movements in a 100-km zone along
either side of the five nation's 7,654-km borders may be carried
out only after informing the other side. Basic weapons and armor
in the zone must be made known to each other.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev also expressed thanks to the Chinese people for
providing a shortest trade route to the Pacific for his country.
</P>
<P>
The president said the Kazakh people are ready to get along
well with their Chinese neighbors for the restoration and the
prosperity of the historical "Silk Road."
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev reiterated that Kazakhstan recognizes China's
unification and territorial integrity while opposing any form of
separatism.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan supports all the measures taken by the Chinese
government in maintaining national unity, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev also briefed Xinhua reporters about his country's
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Since the issue of its own national currency in 1993, he said,
Kazakhstan has made some achievements in its economic reforms,
including a significant drop of inflation and an upturn in
production this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that rich in resources Kazakhstan attracts much foreign
investment and, in the previous year alone, western investors put
2 billion U.S. dollars in its oil and natural gas industries.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan hopes for investment by China's big companies, which
is mutual-beneficiary, he added.

<HEADLINE> New Railroad Brings Great Opportunities to Poor Minority Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 25 (Xinhua Reporter Wang Changshan) -- Qianxinan
Miao and Buyi Autonomous Prefecture in southwest Guizhou Province
is a typical poverty-stricken area in China.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the eight counties under its jurisdiction are
impoverished, and 1.1 million of its 2.7 million population live
below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The area has suffered from poverty for many years, but finally
is seeing signs of hope with the construction of the
Nanning-Kunming railway, that spans the Yunnan and Guizhou
provinces, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
The Nankun railway will run a 187-kilometer-long section
through the prefecture on the borders between Yunnan, Guizhou and
Guangxi, and will set up more than 20 stations in the area.
</P>
<P>
"The railway will bring unprecedented opportunities for local
development," said Lei, a deputy commissioner of the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Weishe, a town in the prefecture, is a hub on the line. All
trains that pass through the town must be re-routed here before
they go north to inland China, west to Kunming, or east to
Nanning. The town has spearheaded the local government's
development drive.
</P>
<P>
High-rises under construction can be seen everywhere in Weishe,
and two 1.7-kilometer-long and 40-meter-wide roads connect the
various development zones. The town has improved its
infrastructure and attracted more businesses by increasing its
power and water supplies, and installing a program-controlled
telephone network.
</P>
<P>
Weishe also is building five major production bases for
livestock, nuts, fruit, vegetables and tung oil trees.
</P>
<P>
Dingxiao in Xingyi City, where the prefecture government is
located, is another major development area that will serve as an
important station for both cargo and passenger transport.
</P>
<P>
In a 9.2-square-kilometer area around the Dingxiao station, a
water plant with a daily supply capacity of 18,000 tons and a
10,000-kilovolt transformer substation have been built. And a
rural industrial subzone, a building materials subzone, and an
agricultural development complex zone either are under
construction or have gone into operation.
</P>
<P>
An economic corridor will be built along the Nankun railway
line, according to a local official.

<HEADLINE> Poor Small Town Turns over New Leaf Thanks to Nankun Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 25 (Xinhua Reporter Wang Changshan) -- If not for
the Nanning-Kunming railway, Qiaoma Town in the mountainous
Guizhou Province probably would remain poor indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Before the new 890-kilometer-long rail trunk stretched to
Qiaoma in 1992, its only access to the outside world was a muddy
road that became unusable during bad weather.
</P>
<P>
Villagers had never seen a television or a tape recorder, and
there was only one restaurant in the town.
</P>
<P>
When a railway worker presented a 50-yuan note in exchange for
sugar cane, the peddler rejected it, not realizing such a big note
existed.
</P>
<P>
Great changes have taken place there in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Not only have several restaurants and hotels appeared on the
streets, but also modern entertainment facilities, such as karaoke
and video shops.
</P>
<P>
A new primary school and a hundred-kilometer-long highway have
been built.
</P>
<P>
What's more, for the first time the town has access to
electricity and even a satellite station.
</P>
<P>
The town has established three sugar processing plants,
expanded its vegetable growing areas to 34 hectares, and tripled
chicken and hog production, which has helped increase the local
bank's savings to more than one million yuan (120,000 US dollars)
from 100,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The new rail link has brought us a new liberation," said the
town's top leader.
</P>
<P>
"We are working out an ambitious economic development plan," he
said.

<HEADLINE> New Rail Line to Fuel Development of Coal Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 25 (Xinhua Reporter Wang Changshan) -- The
Panxian area, a coal base in southern China, will see its local
coal industry expand with the construction of an important rail
link in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The 890-kilometer-long Nankun line, linking Nanning, the
capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, with Kunming, the
capital of Yunnan Province, will run a 58-kilometer rail through
Panxian County in Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
The area has a coal reserve of 9.6 billion tons, and a
potential reserve of 25 billion tons. The coal industry has led
the local economy since 1960s, providing 40 percent of local
revenues.
</P>
<P>
Annual coal production has been limited to several million
tons, due to an inadequate transporting capacity. But coal is in
great demand in southern China, and without a railroad, it has to
be shipped out of the mountainous area in trucks.
</P>
<P>
"With the Nankun railway to be open to traffic, coal mines here
are prepared to boost their production, and the annual coal
production of the area is soon to surpass 10 million tons," said
Wang Yunhe, commissioner of the area.
</P>
<P>
Hongguo, the starting point of the northern section of the
railway, will be the trans-shipping center for coal to other
places in China.
</P>
<P>
To further allow the local economy to take advantage of the
Nankun railway, the Panxian area government and its bureau of
mineral resources have been moved to Hongguo.

</P>
<P>
The first game of the doubleheader at Giants Stadium in New

<HEADLINE> Australians Wealthier, More Asian-Bonded: Statistics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Australian people are getting
wealthier, more urbanized and increasingly linked with Asia,
latest official statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian Social Trends report released by
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), 70 percent of the
country's households own or are purchasing their own homes.
Australia has one of the highest level of housing ownership in all
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 84 percent of Australian households had at
least one motor vehicle while more than 70 percent of the
Australians used a car every day.
</P>
<P>
Populations in big capital cities grew by 10 percent in the
eight years to 1994. But as a whole, the nation's population
growth was expected to slow down at least in the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Asian-born Australians account for over one-fifth of the
country's overseas-born population. In 1995, 38 percent of the
immigrants to Australia were from Asia.
</P>
<P>
Students from Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore make up 72
percent of overseas university students in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Tourists from Asia account for half of the country's tourism
income, an increase of 23 percent over a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Australian investment in Asia has grown to 17 percent of its
total investment abroad from nine percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Australian people are also better-educated than a decade ago.
The report showed that the 12-year-school completing rate among
young people rose to 72.2 percent from less than 50 percent in
1985.
</P>
<P>
However, the gap between the aborigines and the rest of the
population remained wide.
</P>
<P>
Average income of aborigines stood at 14,000 Australian dollars
(11,000 US dollars) per year, far below the average level of
20,000 Australian dollars (15,710 US dollars) per annum for
non-indigenous people, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of the houses in which aborigines live were
rented, comparing with the national average of 28 percent, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Championships Starts with Top Seeds Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND, June 24 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The 1996 Wimbledon
Tennis Championships opened here today with three American
super-tennis stars Andre Agassi, Michael Chang and Jim Courier
crashing out of the first round of the most influential tennis
Grand Slam events.
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang, who ranked 6th in the world, was beaten by
Alberto Costa of Spain 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (1-7) in a three hour
struggle at the number two court, known as The Graveyard for its
history of upsets in history, becoming the first seed to bow out
of the two-week long Championpionps.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old former French Open Champion, who was obviously
not in his prime form, won the first set before the 63rd-ranked
Spanish player launched fierce counter-attacks to grab the
following two sets.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the game, the Chinese American player said: "I
think what made it initially difficult was that my serve was kind
of on and off, (which) made things more difficult."
</P>
<P>
"I did have quite a few opportunities to break during the
match, but I just wasn't able to convert on those break points and
it makes a big difference on grass. You know technically it is
much easier to hold your serve on grass and much harder to
break," he added.
</P>
<P>
Just hours after Chang's defeat, the third-seeded tennis star
Agassi was shot down by his Amerian compatriot Doug Flach 6-2,
7-6, 6-4, 7-6, at the same "graveyard" number two court.
</P>
<P>
The American superstar, who won the 1992 Wimbledon Tennis
honour, was apparently lack of form and unable resist the attacks
from the world number 281 seed.
</P>
<P>
Ailing Agassi could not disguise his disappointment in saying,
"I was off my game and I don't have been feeling great, but if I'd
hit the ball a little better I think I could have pulled it out.
</P>
<P>
"I've got to shake it off, prepare for the Olympics and try to
turn things around," he added.
</P>
<P>
The third major victim of the Americans is Courier, who was
forced out of the Championships by another American player
Jonathan Stark by 2-6, 4-6, 6-2, 4-6.
</P>
<P>
The former French and Austrialian Open Chamipion was injured
after twisting his leg in the fifth game of the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Pete Sampras, going for its fourth
consecutive Wimbledon title also fought a very hard battle in
beating his American compatriot Richey Reneberg 4-6, 6-4, 6-3,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the women's top seeds, including Monica Seles,
Conchita Martinez, Kimiko Date, enjoyed a smooth sailing into the
second round by beating their opponents in straight sets in
today's events.
</P>
<P>
Top seed, Steffi Graf of Germany will start her quest for a
seventh Wimbledon singles title when she opens the Center Court
action on Tuesday against Czech Ludmila Richterova.

<HEADLINE> Study of Standard Chinese Spreading in Ethnic Minority Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 20 ethnic minority groups
inhabit Weixi Autonomous County in Yunnan. These include Tibetans,
the Lisu, the Bai, and the Yi.
</P>
<P>
They used to speak only their native languages, but the various
dialects posed problems for their daily exchanges. After having
been provided with language training by the local government, many
of them can now speak the national common language - standard
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
County governor Li Canguang said that the provincial government
adopted effective measures to increase the spread of standard
Chinese among 420 primary schools and nine secondary schools to
help children master standard Chinese.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20,000 textbooks have been published by local
publishing houses and 424 classes have been opened in the county
to help 13,000 adults become literate.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the spread of standard Chinese across the county,
especially in minority areas, is playing an important role in
fostering national unity and economic co-operation.

<HEADLINE> China Says Three Gorges Scenery Will Remain As It Is (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The scenery around China's
well-known Three Gorges area on the Yangtze River will not be lost
forever to sightseers, as some people have thought, said Guo
Shuyan, deputy director of the Three Gorges Project Construction
Commission.
</P>
<P>
In fact, construction of the gigantic Three Gorges dam project
will not have great impact on the grandeur of the surrounding
landscape, Guo told Xinhua, here today.
</P>
<P>
Out of the top 40 scenic spots in China, the Three Gorges ranks
first and attracts nearly one million tourists each year.
</P>
<P>
The 172-kilometer-long area of Qutang Gorge, Wuxia Gorge, and
Xiling Gorge, has sheer cliffs and steep mountains on both sides
of the twisting and turbulent river, which also has dangerous
shoals.
</P>
<P>
Ever since China began the dam project in 1993, people have
rushed for a final peek at the spot on "bye-bye tours", having
heard rumors that scenery there will go the way of the dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
"This is a complete misunderstanding," Guo said, "The Three
Gorges scenery will remain intact on the whole."
</P>
<P>
A similar view was expressed by a team of renowned hydrological
and geological experts who have studied the area for years for
possible changes. Their latest report states that a majority of
the sights will remain unchanged, and although 39 scenic spots
will eventually be under water, that represents only 13 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhenli, an expert on environmental protection, said that
after the reservoir fills up in 2009, the water in Xiling Gorge,
site of the dam, will rise 100 meters at most, which has very
little impact on the cliff sights there, which are several hundred
meters to 1,000 meters high.
</P>
<P>
When people view it from the valley of the Xiling Gorge, their
"feeling of a gorge" will only be decreased by one-tenth, he
noted. In Wuxia and Qutang, the "feeling of a gorge" will decrease
by not more than one-twentieth or even one-thirtieth, because the
water rise will be less when one goes from east to west, Dr. Huang
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Philippine newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- Eight suspects in the assassination of former Ilocos Norte
Vice Governor Rolando Abadilla were presented on Monday by
Interior and Local Government Secretary Robert Barbes to the media
in Quezon city.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Vietnam has formally applied for membership in the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and its bid is likely to be
granted this year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star:
</P>
<P>
-- Opposition to the rebel-led Southern Philippines Council for
Peace and Development snowballed on Monday with at least two
lawmakers claiming it will upset the present political setup in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The Business Daily:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine Finance Department has directed the Bureau of
Internal Revenue to expand its probe on bank tax liabilities from
the ongoing "selective" to an "industry-wide" audit, in order to
determine why the robust growth of the industry had not been
translated into additional tax collections.

<HEADLINE> China Says Three Gorges Scenery Will Remain As It Is (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Experts with the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee have
also pointed out that Quimen Cliff in Qutang Gorge and the Twelve
Peaks in Wushan Mountain in Wuxia Gorge will still give people a
feeling of grandeur since the water will only touch the foot of
the slopes.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Huang said that during the rainy season, the water current
sights will change little, while in the dry season, swirls and
rapids will disappear because of the water's being controlled by
the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
As the water level rises a broad lake will appear against the
185-meter high dam. The water discharged from this spectacular dam
will produce an amazing waterfall, Dr. Huang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that another widely-held but utterly wrong belief is
that the Three Gorges scenery will begin to disappear even before
the damming of the river, by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The damming of the river next year is actually meant to change
the water course, and will not immediately change the water
level," Dr. Huang said. "Before 2003, the water level of Yangtze
will remain where it is."
</P>
<P>
An official with the China National Tourism Administration has
said that before 2009, some of the scenic spots will be under
water, but the "cream" of landscapes in the Three Gorges will
still be there.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of tourism facilities and construction of
new scenic spots, as the project develops, more tourists will be
attracted to the Three Gorges not only for sightseeing, but also
for longer holiday stays, according to Guo, who is also
vice-director of the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will build new scenic spots in Yichang City,
Badong County, Wushan County, Fuling City, and Chongqing City over
the next five years to enrich the Three Gorges scenery.
</P>
<P>
As for cultural relics and places of interest in the
650-kilometer-long reservoir area, China is working against the
clock to save them by moving them or rebuilding them, Guo pointed
out.

<P>
GENEVA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Swimmer Jessica Foschi of the
United States has had a two-year drugs ban reimposed, the
International Swimming Federation (FINA) said in Lausanne on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
FINA said in a statement that its executive board met last
Friday to review the case and decided to suspend Foschi for two
years from August 5, 1995, the date she tested positive for
steroids.
</P>
<P>
15-year-old Foschi failed the drugs test at the U.S. national
swimming championships in Pasadena, California.
</P>
<P>
She was initially put on a two-year probation then had the
punishment hardened to a two-year ban.

<HEADLINE> Large Number of Cultural Relics Found near Xisha Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese archaeologists
has found 1,800 cultural relics dating back to the Tang Dynasty
(618-907) and eight ancient relic sites underwater in the
mid-western part of the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The discoveries came during a four-week study to the northeast
of coral islands of the Xisha group, more than 200 nautical miles
off the Chinese coast.
</P>
<P>
The team made a report on the results of the study Monday,
saying that 98 percent of the discovered objects are Chinese. They
started digging and diving on April 27, on and around 22 islets
and shoals and four groups of coral reefs of the Xisha Islands.
</P>
<P>
They collected a large number of pottery and porcelain
fragments dating from the Tang to the Qing dynasties. The
fragments include remains of bowls, jars, plates, dishes and cups.
</P>
<P>
The team excavated a site of the Tang and Song Dynasty
(960-1127) on Ganquan Island and unearthed a bowl of the Yuan
Dynasty (1271-1368) and erected a stone tablet to mark the site.
</P>
<P>
The site was discovered by Chinese archaeologists in 1974, but
no underwater project could be started at the time.
</P>
<P>
The team found some stone statues and stone materials, which
were said to be used in temple construction by overseas Chinese
during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), around a sunken ship near
Shanhu Island.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists say that the investigation proved that
historical records of islands in the South China Sea since the Han
Dynasty (206-220 B.C.) and the Tang are reliable and that China,
which was the first country to explore and develop the islands,
should have sovereign rights to the islands.

<HEADLINE> 3,341 AIDS Virus Carriers in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of people reported to
be carrying the HIV virus in China reached 3,341 by the end of
1995, according to a senior official.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chunming, an official with the National Specialists'
Committee for Preventing and Controlling AIDS, said that 117 of
the virus carriers were patients infected with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted in an address to a national seminar on the fatal
disease that "the actual figure could be much larger."
</P>
<P>
"As international exchanges increase, AIDS has actually
threatened everyone and the whole nation must pay careful
attention to it," she said.
</P>
<P>
Dai Zhicheng, an official with the Ministry of Public Health,
said that "speeding the development of medicines for AIDS and
improving the clinical diagnostic and treatment level has become
an urgent task."
</P>
<P>
Some medical experts reported at the seminar that Chinese
herbal medicines have proven effective in killing the AIDS virus
and increasing the human body's immunity in several cases in
Beijing and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Bullet in Old Man's Liver Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Surgeons in south China's
Guangzhou City have removed a bullet that was lodged in an elderly
man's liver for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Yan Jingchang, who is in his sixties, recovered from the June 5
surgery, and has been discharged from the Guangzhou No. 2 People's
Hospital, according to a report on the "Yangcheng Evening News."
</P>
<P>
The bullet was discovered in Yan's liver during an ultrasonic
scan performed in May, when he was hospitalized for cholecystitis.
</P>
<P>
Yan was a soldier in the Communist-led army during the
Liberation War (1946-1949) against the Kuomintang army. During a
battle in 1946, he was shot in the back, but it was not a
life-threatening injury, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
The bullet was not removed at the time, due to a lack of
surgical equipment. It has remained in Yan's body ever since, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Yan said the bullet has seldom caused pain in the past half
century, so he never considered removing it.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Home-made Sedan Cars Popular with Beijing Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Most residents in China's capital
want to buy cars that cost less than 180,000 yuan (about 20,000 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted earlier this month by the
Beijing Grand-View Social and Economic Investigation Company, 70.7
percent of the respondents said the acceptable price for a sedan
is under 180,000 yuan. However, 65.9 percent would choose to buy a
car for less than 100,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, domestic cars, which are comparatively cheaper,
will dominate the market, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
The survey company, associated with the Beijing Science and
Technology Consulting Association, is a special non-government
firm engaged in the study of social and economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
The survey sampled 600 people in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Those surveyed believe that the development of family cars, in
addition to road construction, will enhance the national auto
industry.
</P>
<P>
They are not satisfied with the fact that there are too many
imported cars on the streets, and that Beijing has no car
factories of its own, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
All of China's auto production bases are located in other parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
in 1993, 53 percent of all sedans were imported, according to
the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that 26.7 percent and 25 percent of those
surveyed want to buy their own cars in five or ten years,
respectively, and others plan to do so in 1-4 or 6-9 years,
bringing the total percentage of potential car buyers to 78.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the most popular cars on the market
include the Santana, manufactured by the Shanghai Volkswagen
Automotive Company Ltd. (15 percent); the Audi, made by the
FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Company Ltd. (11.7 percent); and the
Charade, which is produced by the Tianjin Automotive Industrial
Company (10 percent).
</P>
<P>
Cai Wenbin, office director of the Beijing Munitions Vehicle
Trade Company, said that 60-70 percent of its annual sales of
10,000 vehicles come from domestic cars.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Forge Long-Term Cooperative Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here tonight that China is willing to continue unremitting
efforts, together with Spain, for the establishment of long-term,
stable friendly and cooperative bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president made the remarks at a banquet hosted in
his honor by King Juan Carlos I of Spain here today. Jiang and his
wife arrived here earlier today on a four-day state visit at the
invitation of the Spanish king. Spain is the first leg of his
six European and central Asian nation tour which will also take
him to Norway, Romania, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyz and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Spain has a long history and splendid culture
and has made outstanding contributions to human civilization.
"Spain is no stranger to the Chinese people although it is far
apart," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he made a working visit to Spain 10 years ago.
"Now revisiting it, I was deeply impressed by your achievements in
economic and social development," he noted.
</P>
<P>
China always attaches great importance to developing friendly
cooperation with Spain, Jiang said. "We are pleased to see that
cooperation between the two countries in the fields such as
politics, economy, trade, science and technology and culture has
been expanded," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the two visits to China by the Spanish king and queen
had contributed a great deal to the friendship between the two
peoples and friendly cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is my belief that my current visit to Spain will deepen
mutual understanding and help bring our friendly cooperation to a
higher level," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
King Juan Carlos I said that the enhancement of friendly
relations with China is one of the priorities of the Spanish
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries have expanded their relations over
the past few years in the political, economic and trade domains
and Spanish entrepreneurs have developed their business in the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
However, "it would be more desirable if we tap the potential to
improve our cooperation in the fields of science, education, art,
sports and culture, and further consolidate our friendship," he
said.
</P>
<P>
King Juan Carlos I said China has sustained its unprecedented
economic growth, and its vast market prospects and favorable
economic policies have made the country a great attraction to
foreign investors and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The king said that the Asian-Pacific region, owing to its
culture, economy and population, has played a key role in the 20th
century, and it is expected to become even more important in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
He said that Spain and China have developed good relations over
the past few years. However, he said, "our initial contact
actually began several hundred years ago."
</P>
<P>
"We must spare no efforts to reduce arms and commit ourselves
to justice and peace in the international community. I believe
this is also China's goal and it will play an excellent role in
the world in the future," the king said.

<HEADLINE> Macro-Economic Policy Key to G-7: Financial Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the G-7
have been active in helping forge a new consensus about the
macro-economic policy requirements for financial stability and the
problem of capital inflows.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Lawrence Summers, deputy secretary of the
Treasury, at a press briefing here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Group of Seven comprises the world's seven
largest industrial countries: the United States, Japan, Germany,
Britain, France, Canada and Italy. It is to hold its annual summit
in Lyon, France, later this week.
</P>
<P>
The official also talked about the U.S. exchange rate policy
and the relationship between industrial countries and the emerging
market.
</P>
<P>
Answering the question about the convertibility of the China's
RMB yuan with other foreign currencies, Summers said, "In the
United States' position for some time, more complete financial
market liberalization including in particular a full
convertibility of the Chinese currency is an important priority."
</P>
<P>
"We believe it will contribute to more efficient investments in
China. It's an important priority because we believe it will give
U.S. firms an important financial opportunity in what will be the
world's largest market in the 21st century," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the management of capital flows to the developing world in
the aftermath of the Mexican economic crisis, he said the
international community has reached a common understanding that
countries should strengthen the financial system which is to
provide early warning and prevention mechanisms to reduce the risk
of future crises.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. agreed to lend Mexico 20 billion U.S. dollars last
year after the Mexican economy came to the edge of collapse
following a sharp peso devaluation at the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, the member countries of the G-7 are unlikely to
be willing to provide substantial amounts of official financial
assistance to deal with all liquidity crises like that of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the paper trading carries risk. "It is not the
responsibility of the IMF or the U.S. Treasury to insulate them
from that risk, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States cannot be the lender of last resort to the
world economy, he said. "We think this is a prudent step that will
help ensure that the United States does not have to bear a
disproportionate burden of any future financial crises."

<HEADLINE> Different Views on Qadhafi's Flights Expressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that it reguarded Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi's flights to and
from the Arab summit in Cairo this weekend as a violation of U.N.
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
But Arab leaders at the Cairo summit decried the U.N. sanction
as unjust.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. State Department spokesman said Qadhafi's flights were
in "flagrant violation of the will of the international
community." Washington viewed this "very dimly," he added.
</P>
<P>
The final communique adopted by the Arab summit, however,
said, "The Arab leaders called for lifting the sanctions imposed
on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriyya, as the continuation of the
sanctions could lead the Arab states to consider possible ways
to spare the libyan people further harm."
</P>
<P>
Qadhafi flew to Cairo last Saturday to attend the first Arab
summit in six years, which was convened to discuss the future of
the Middle East peace process as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu showed a different stance towards Arab-Israeli
relations, which contrasts his predecessor's.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street rose today,
but retreated from a stronger rally as investors remained hesitant
before this week's economic reports and next week's Federal
Reserve meeting on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.56 to 5,717.79, down
from an afternoon gain of about 37 points.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, new reports have spurred far less market
movement than in the winter and spring, with many investors
preferring to await the Federal Reserve's interpretation of the
latest data.
</P>
<P>
There is considerable concern that when the Fed's policy makers
meet next week, they will raise short-term lending rates to ease
inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 333.82 million
shares, down sharply from Friday's 516.41 million.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.99 to 358.01, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.01 to 668.85, and the American Stock
Exchange's market value index rose 0.19 to 585.14, snapping a
nine-session losing streak.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq market continued to recover from its recent slide as
key technology issues recovered further from worries about slack
demand in the computer industry. The Nasdaq composite index rose
7.46 to 1,182.90.
</P>
<P>
Consumer companies were among the day's best performers. The
Dow average's biggest gainers included Philip Morris, Coca-Cola,
and Procter &AMP; Gamble.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Political Balance Changed Following </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The death of former Greek Prime
Minister Andreas Papandreou has completely altered the political
balance in the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK).
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, the founder and president of the PASOK, died of
heart failure early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou's death came only four days before the ruling
party's upcoming fourth National Congress, at which Papandreou was
expected to keep the post as the party chief and a deputy chief
would be selected to assist Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
"Papandreou died at a completely unexpected moment," a senior
government official said.
</P>
<P>
It has become well known that Prime Minister Kostas Simitis and
Interior Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos, a loyalist to Papandreou,
had long been in a fierce competition for the post of deputy party
chief before Papandreou's death.
</P>
<P>
Simitis, elected to replace the hospitalized Papandreou as
premier in January, had maintained that the future deputy party
chief should enjoy the substantive power and be a potential
successor to ailing Papandreou while Tsochadzopoulos had insisted
on a power-sharing collective leadership, that is the split of
power between the party and the government.
</P>
<P>
"There is no single man in the PASOK who can play the role of
Andreas Papandreou as both premier and party leader," the interior
minister stated just last week.
</P>
<P>
He at the same time fiercely attacked Simitis, saying the
latter's behavior was more like that of a "party faction chief"
than a premier.
</P>
<P>
Local observers held that the death of Papandreou has made the
political situation in the PASOK much clearer than before.
Papandreou's death has forced the PASOK to confront the issue of
succession. It has also ruled out the possibility that Papandreou
would try to appoint a successor at the party congress, an act
which was widely believed to adversely affect the PASOK's
long-term unity.
</P>
<P>
One man who can tip the balance in the fighting for the post of
future party chief is Defense Minister Gerasimos Arsenis.
</P>
<P>
Arsenis, edged out of the parliamentary election of a new
premier in January, had not given any indication he would seek
election as deputy PASOK leader. But he appeared to take a
definite stand against Simitis at Sunday's meeting of the PASOK
executive bureau at which he proposed a collective leadership, or
political council, to head the party.
</P>
<P>
Simitis now hopes to consolidate his power at the congress. But
he could be blocked from fulfilling his ambition by other
Socialists, who are unwilling to place the reins in the hands of a
single leader.
</P>
<P>
Simitis and Tsochadzopoulos are measuring their strength now as
the election for the 4,500 delegates participating in the party's
National Congress has just been completed. Both camps however are
in conflict as to the results. Who intends to seek what at the
congress will remain unclear until after Papandreou's funeral on
Wednesday, one day before the party congress is scheduled to open.

<HEADLINE> NATO, US Air Force Near Accord on AWACS Upgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States Air Force and
NATO may cooperatively upgrade the E-3 Airborne Warning &AMP; Control
System (AWACS) aircraft, the latest issue of the U.S. weekly
newspaper Defense News quoted U.S. and NATO officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation agreement is expected to be signed as early as
this fall, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that they hope to merge as much as possible
NATO's planned Mid-Term Upgrade for its AWACS fleet with U.S. Air
Force plans for AWACS improvements.
</P>
<P>
The NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control Program Management
Agency's 800 million U.S. dollar Mid-Term Upgrade plan has not
been approved by its member states' national board, but there is
informal agreement on its basic contents, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The package of improvement includes: navigation equipment based
on the Global Positioning System satellite network; new
multifunctional displays and other cockpit changes to ease crew
workload; and new radios that will allow NATO AWACS planes to
operate with European nations of the former East bloc, NATO
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. goal is to "ensure that all of NATO's Mid-Term
Upgrade cam migrate to the U.S. fleet without the U.S. having to
redevelop the technology, U.S. Air Force officials responsible
for AWACS programs said.

WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires had burned 19,000
acres by Monday morning in northern and eastern Arizona, forcing
hundreds of people to flee their homes in the Grand Canyon
National Park, Arizona, local news reports said.
</P>
<P>
A fire near Flagstaff, started by lightning Thursday, had grown
to more than 10,000 acres. Residents of two neighborhoods about 12
miles north of Flagstaff were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Another fire at the Grand Canyon's North Rim, also sparked by
lightning Thursday, spread to 1,500 acres Sunday, prompting a
helicopter evacuation of 10 hikers.
</P>
<P>
Outside the Apache Sitgreaves National Forest in east-central
Arizona, some 200 to 400 residents were evacuated Sunday night as
a fire that had already burned 2,000 acres was threatening their
homes.
</P>
<P>
In Nevada, a fire broke out Sunday afternoon and has burned
4,000 acres, forcing 1,000 people to evacuate as it threatened 400
rural homes.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, a fire in Utah had burned about 8,000 acres in a
region 55 miles south of Salt Lake City. Three fires in Riverside
County, California, about 75 miles south of Los Angeles, had
burned 1,400 acres of brush.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters are battling on the fires, but as less as 10
percent of the fires were contained as strong wind was continuing
in the day.
