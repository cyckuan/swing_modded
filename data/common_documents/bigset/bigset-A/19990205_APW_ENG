<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall for Fifth Straight Day / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. Treasury bonds fell Friday for a fifth  
consecutive day, in its steepest weekly decline in four months, as 
a government report of a strong labor market raised expectations 
that the Federal Reserve will boost interest rates later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 15/16  
point, or $9.38 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.35 from 5.29 percent late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, 30-year bonds have fallen about 4 points, marking  
the worst decline since early October. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's first major economic report of the year, issued  
Friday by the Labor Department, said the unemployment rate in 
January held at 4.3 percent, matching a 28-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, along with private reports on auto and retail chain  
sales and manufacturing activity, shows the U.S. economy last month 
had considerable momentum after a growth spurt in the fourth 
quarter of 1998 that was the strongest in 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The resilience in what already is the nation's longest peacetime  
economic expansion raises questions about how much longer 
inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve can resist raising 
short-term interest rates. At the Fed's most recent meeting, this 
week, Fed policy-makers decided to leave rates unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	While inflation has remained dormant, there are fears that a  
tight labor market will drive up wages and prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising interest rates reduce the value of investments with fixed  
returns, such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders are also concerned about how well the market will absorb  
next week's auction of $35 billion in new Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were off between 1/16 point and 5/32 point, and intermediate 
maturities were down 9/32 point to 17/32 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.08 
points to 1,302.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.49 percent as the  
discount rose 0.03 percentage point from Thursday to 4.39 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.57 percent, as the discount rose 0.03 
percentage point to 4.42 percent. One-year yields were 4.64 percent 
as the discount rose 0.03 percentage point to 4.43 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, remained unchanged at 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/16 to 124 7/8. The average yield to 
maturity rose to 5.15 percent from 5.14 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Tyson Sentenced to Jail for Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Before sending Mike Tyson back to jail,  
Judge Stephen Johnson discussed the two sides of the former 
heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
	He had heard about the fragile family man who likes helping his  
community, and the volatile and angry monster who could snap at any 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the judge decided it wasn't possible to tell which  
Tyson would be walking the streets of a community at any given 
moment. He gave the 32-year-old fighter one year behind bars for 
assaulting two motorists, a sentence that jeopardizes the career of 
one of the boxing's greatest heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Witnesses say he is kind, caring and thoughtful,'' Johnson  
said. ``Unfortunately, this court cannot look into the defendant's 
mind. ... He repeatedly speaks and acts compulsively and 
violently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The standing-room-only crowd in the courtroom groaned in  
surprise when Johnson announced the sentence. Tyson slumped, but 
barely. His wife, Monica, was in tears. She tried to get to him, 
but couldn't push her way through a crowd of bailiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this was clearly a case of making an example of  
Michael one more time,'' said Michael Steele, Monica Tyson's 
brother. ``The prosecution in this case doggedly pursued this. He 
wanted to put one in his column -- `I got a celebrity, I'm making a 
point.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was placed in handcuffs, then had them removed so he could  
sign some papers. Then two sets of cuffs were placed on him, with 
his hands behind his back, and he was led away, showing little 
emotion the entire time. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson kicked one motorist and punched another after a minor  
three-car accident in Gaithersburg, Md., on Aug. 31. In December, 
Tyson pleaded no contest to two counts of second-degree assault -- 
meaning he neither protested the charges nor admitted guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson called it ``a tragic example of potentially lethal road  
rage.'' Tyson's lawyers, through a series of witnesses, portrayed 
it as the act of a man under stress because of mounting debts and 
the revocation of his boxing license. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt like he couldn't provide for us,'' testified Monica  
Tyson, fighting back tears. ``My husband is a good, kind person. 
He's got his life together, and he's doing the right things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses also said Tyson's career would be ruined if he sent to  
jail because it could lead to more prison time in Indiana -- where 
Tyson is still on probation -- and another revocation of his boxing 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who did not speak during the three-hour hearing, said as  
much himself in a letter to the judge, read aloud by Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jail,'' Tyson wrote, ``would mean I lose everything.''  
</P>
<P>
	The full sentence is two years in jail, with one year suspended  
on each count, to be served concurrently. Tyson was also fined 
$5,000 and will have to serve two years' probation and perform 200 
hours of community service upon release. With good behavior, he 
could be released in six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, authorities in Indiana must decide if Tyson has  
violated his probation from his 1991 rape conviction. Tyson was 
released in 1995 after serving three years of a six-year sentence, 
and his probation was set to expire in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judge is waiting for her paperwork to come from  
Maryland,'' said David Deputy, a bailiff in the court where Tyson 
was sentenced in Marion County, Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came three weeks after Tyson's successful comeback  
against Francois Botha, his first fight since he lost his license 
for biting Evander Holyfield's ears during a championship bout in 
June 1997. Tyson was scheduled to fight April 24 in Las Vegas 
against an opponent to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence could lead to a review of Tyson's license by the  
Nevada State Athletic Commission. Dr. James Nave, the only Nevada 
commissioner who voted against Tyson when the panel reinstated his 
license, said it was possible the five members would take no 
further action, especially since the license expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's going to be in jail for a year, there's not much need  
at this point for us to take action,'' Nave said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson can appeal within 30 days. If the appeal is granted, he  
would stand trial on the charges. He cannot be released on bail 
before Monday, when he can request a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they might not have pressed for jail had Tyson  
been more contrite. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a violent assault against two people,'' Montgomery  
County State's Attorney Douglas Gansler said. ``We don't tolerate 
violence and we don't tolerate road rage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two victims, Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick, settled  
out of court, and were against sending Tyson to jail. Both were at 
the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the witnesses were the head of a local homeless shelter  
where Tyson recently performed volunteer work, and Tyson's manager, 
Shelley Finkel. Finkel testified the fighter had $20 million in 
debts, mostly to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time at this point that he would be taken out of the ring  
would be a real death sentence,'' Finkel said. ``There is the 
likelihood that he would lose his license, which would be 
tantamount to banning him from boxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's lawyers also said the fighter was not taking his  
antidepressants at the time of the accident. Tyson, who has been 
undergoing therapy at Georgetown University Hospital, was taking 
medication to help control his volatile behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, however, hammered away at Tyson's violent past,  
referring to the fighter as a ``time bomb.'' They were unimpressed 
with Tyson's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about commerce,'' Carol Crawford, the assistant  
state's attorney, told the judge. ``The overriding concern 
shouldn't be the gross national product of Mike Tyson. It's about 
protecting the community.''

<HEADLINE>  BMW Names New Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- BMW's chief, blamed for heavy losses at  
the luxury automaker's Rover subsidiary, stepped down Friday during 
a daylong supervisory board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernd Pischetsrieder, an engineer who held the top job since  
1993, was replaced by BMW's former head of engineering and 
production, Joachim Milberg, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement gave no explanation for Pischetsrieder's  
resignation, but his departure had been rumored for days. Local 
media reported that the company's supervisory board blamed him for 
failing to stem the losses at Rover, the British carmaker that BMW 
bought in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment of Milberg was seen as a surprise. Analysts had  
pegged management board member Wolfgang Reitzle as the front-runner 
but Reitzle, who had been with BMW for more than 20 years, also 
resigned at Friday's meeting, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has invested more than $3.5 billion in Rover since the  
takeover, which was orchestrated by Pischetsrieder. Analysts expect 
Rover to post a pretax loss of about $590 million for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of Pischetsrieder's departure pushed BMW shares higher  
this week. Analysts attributed the trend to hopes that his leaving 
could open the way for BMW to join the current wave of carmarker 
alliances. Pischetsrieder had insisted BMW would not participate in 
any merger or joint-venture. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW is seen as an attractive takeover target, particularly for a  
U.S. car company, due to its strong position in the European luxury 
car market. 
</P>
<P>
	But a change of the top brass at BMW wouldn't necessarily mean a  
change in merger strategy, since the Quandt family, which owns 42 
percent of the company, would still have to approve. 
</P>
<P>
	British Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers said he  
planned to speak to the new chairman Saturday to stress the 
importance the government attaches to Rover and the Longbridge 
plant in Birmingham in particular, which workers fear BMW wants to 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	Byers earlier indicated that the government was prepared to  
offer financial help to modernize Longbridge, which employs 14,000 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government has a very constructive working relationship  
with BMW and I am sure that this will continue,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Debate Held on Lowering Air Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- As part of a national tour to turn the  
spotlight on the aviation industry, Transportation Secretary Rodney 
Slater led a debate here Friday on ways to lower air fares in 
medium-sized cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater chose Rochester because its air fares are the nation's  
fourth-highest in cost per mile. Six major airlines that fly out of 
Rochester's airport now have a virtual lock on the market and two 
of them, US Airways and Continental, carry 86 percent of all 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that the benefits of deregulation have not flowed  
to all cities and regions,'' Slater told representatives of 
business, government and airlines large and small at a one-day, 
round-table discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Businessman Larry Peckham said his software company spends $1  
million a year on air tickets. ``If we were in Baltimore, it would 
be one-fifth as much; we would save $800,000, which would double 
our profits,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, LPA Software Inc. is seriously considering  
relocating its 20-member sales staff to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline deregulation 20 years ago made fares ``very competitive  
in the big cities, and I believe the carriers are making up their 
money in the second-tier cities,'' Peckham said. ``It's getting a 
lot worse the last couple of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air passengers in Rochester pay an average of 31.1 cents a mile  
-- the highest in the nation after Richmond, Va., Charlotte and 
Greensboro, N.C. The per-mile cost in smaller cities often runs 
double that of larger cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater is holding eight ``listening sessions'' around the  
country to gauge all aspects of the aviation industry, from 
airports to cargo traffic to airline finances. The debate here will 
be the only one to focus entirely on airline competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is considering a variety of proposals in 1999 to induce  
carriers to improve service to secondary routes and to crack down 
on airlines that squash low-cost competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it can be the year of aviation,'' Slater said, just  
as 1998 became the ``year of highways'' with passage of the biggest 
road-building law in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Louise Slaughter, a Democrat whose district includes  
Rochester, reintroduced a bill last month designed to boost 
low-cost airlines by reallocating slots to them at major airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Discount carriers cannot cater to mid-sized markets ``if they're  
not allowed to land at places where people want to go,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	To save hundreds of dollars on cross-country flights, one in  
five customers of Geneseo Travel opt to fly out of other cities. 
That can mean a one-hour drive to Buffalo and or a three-hour slog 
to Toronto, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Others just ``grin and bear it'' or simply put off their  
business trips or vacations, said travel agent Juliann Koch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The airlines have us in a stronghold,'' Koch said. ``I do  
believe it's whatever the market will bear. People have to fly and 
if they're going to buy the tickets, they're not going to lower the 
fares.''

<HEADLINE> Notorious Bombers in Colo. Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Three of America's most notorious bombers  
spend much of their time in solitary confinement at a high-security 
prison on the edge of Colorado's Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	But for one hour a day, Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh,  
Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing, and 
Unabomber Ted Kaczynski share exercise time at the Administrative 
Maximum U.S. Penitentiary in Florence, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Yousef's attorney, Bernard Kleinman, said Thursday his client  
and McVeigh talk about movies they've seen on television, prison 
food and other minor matters. Kaczynski ``is there physically but 
he really doesn't discuss what they discuss,'' Kleinman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney described the conversations in the prison, dubbed  
``SuperMax'' because of its high-tech security, as ``innocuous'' 
because guards are always within earshot. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing conspiratorial about it at all,'' he said.  
``My client has only one person outside of his guards to talk to on 
the outside world and that's me,'' Kleinman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he is all of a sudden introduced to a situation to talk to  
another person other than a guard, he's going to take advantage of 
that opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yousef has complained in a $1.1 million lawsuit against the  
federal government that McVeigh gets far more privileges than he, 
even though McVeigh is a death row inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yousef is serving a sentence of life plus 240 years for  
masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that killed six 
people and injured more than 1,000. He was also convicted of 
plotting to bomb 12 U.S.-bound airliners. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski pleaded guilty last year to 13 federal charges -- 10  
related to two fatal attacks in Sacramento, Calif., and the 
woundings of two other men, and three related to a third death, 
which occurred in New Jersey. He is now serving four life 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh is awaiting execution for the Alfred P. Murrah Federal  
Building bombing, which killed 168 people April 19, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Bureau of Prison officials say McVeigh and Yousef never have  
direct contact and are kept in their concrete and metal 
maximum-security cells 23 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are the worst of the worst,'' said prison spokesman Todd  
Craig. ``They are kept separate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Craig said the prisoners could ``have incidental, verbal  
contact'' while being escorted from place to place. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Welch, who lost a niece in the Oklahoma City bombing, said  
she doesn't worry about Yousef and McVeigh being in close 
proximity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's probably in good company, don't you?'' Ms. Welch  
said. ``He might as well get it all out of his system, because he's 
not going to be there with those other guys for long. I have to 
have hope in that.''

<HEADLINE>  Tyson Sentenced to Jail for Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Before sending Mike Tyson back to jail,  
Judge Stephen Johnson discussed the two sides of the former 
heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
	He had heard about the fragile family man who likes helping his  
community, and the volatile and angry monster who could snap at any 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the judge decided it wasn't possible to tell which  
Tyson would be walking the streets of a community at any given 
moment. He gave the 32-year-old fighter one year behind bars for 
assaulting two motorists, a sentence that jeopardizes the career of 
one of the boxing's greatest heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Witnesses say he is kind, caring and thoughtful,'' Johnson  
said. ``Unfortunately, this court cannot look into the defendant's 
mind. ... He repeatedly speaks and acts compulsively and 
violently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The standing-room-only crowd in the courtroom groaned in  
surprise when Johnson announced the sentence. Tyson slumped, but 
barely. His wife, Monica, was in tears. She tried to get to him, 
but couldn't push her way through a crowd of bailiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this was clearly a case of making an example of  
Michael one more time,'' said Michael Steele, Monica Tyson's 
brother. ``The prosecution in this case doggedly pursued this. He

Tyson, fighting back tears. ``My husband is a good, kind person. 
He's got his life together, and he's doing the right things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses also said Tyson's career would be ruined if he sent to  
jail because it could lead to more prison time in Indiana -- where 
Tyson is still on probation -- and another revocation of his boxing 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who did not speak during the three-hour hearing, said as  
much himself in a letter to the judge, read aloud by Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jail,'' Tyson wrote, ``would mean I lose everything.''  
</P>
<P>
	The full sentence is two years in jail, with one year suspended  
on each count, to be served concurrently. Tyson was also fined 
$5,000 and will have to serve two years' probation and perform 200 
hours of community service upon release. With good behavior, he 
could be released in six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, authorities in Indiana must decide if Tyson has  
violated his probation from his 1991 rape conviction. Tyson was 
released in 1995 after serving three years of a six-year sentence, 
and his probation was set to expire in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judge is waiting for her paperwork to come from  
Maryland,'' said David Deputy, a bailiff in the court where Tyson 
was sentenced in Marion County, Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came three weeks after Tyson's successful comeback  
against Francois Botha, his first fight since he lost his license 
for biting Evander Holyfield's ears during a championship bout in 
June 1997. Tyson was scheduled to fight April 24 in Las Vegas 
against an opponent to be determined. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	``If he's going to be in jail for a year, there's not much need  
at this point for us to take action,'' Nave said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson can appeal within 30 days. If the appeal is granted, he  
would stand trial on the charges. He cannot be released on bail 
before Monday, when he can request a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they might not have pressed for jail had Tyson

<HEADLINE>  BMW Names New Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- BMW's chief, blamed for heavy losses at  
the luxury automaker's Rover subsidiary, stepped down Friday during 
a daylong supervisory board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernd Pischetsrieder, an engineer who held the top job since  
1993, was replaced by BMW's former head of engineering and 
production, Joachim Milberg, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement gave no explanation for Pischetsrieder's  
resignation, but his departure had been rumored for days. Local 
media reported that the company's supervisory board blamed him for 
failing to stem the losses at Rover, the British carmaker that BMW 
bought in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment of Milberg was seen as a surprise. Analysts had  
pegged management board member Wolfgang Reitzle as the front-runner 
but Reitzle, who had been with BMW for more than 20 years, also 
resigned at Friday's meeting, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has invested more than $3.5 billion in Rover since the  
takeover, which was orchestrated by Pischetsrieder. Analysts expect 
Rover to post a pretax loss of about $590 million for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of Pischetsrieder's departure pushed BMW shares higher  
this week. Analysts attributed the trend to hopes that his leaving 
could open the way for BMW to join the current wave of carmarker 
alliances. Pischetsrieder had insisted BMW would not participate in 
any merger or joint-venture. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW is seen as an attractive takeover target, particularly for a  
U.S. car company, due to its strong position in the European luxury 
car market. 
</P>
<P>
	But a change of the top brass at BMW wouldn't necessarily mean a  
change in merger strategy, since the Quandt family, which owns 42 
percent of the company, would still have to approve. 
</P>
<P>
	British Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers said he  
planned to speak to the new chairman Saturday to stress the 
importance the government attaches to Rover and the Longbridge 
plant in Birmingham in particular, which workers fear BMW wants to 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	Byers earlier indicated that the government was prepared to  
offer financial help to modernize Longbridge, which employs 14,000 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government has a very constructive working relationship  
with BMW and I am sure that this will continue,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Broker Admits Swindling Customers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An investment broker accused of swindling  
customers might have avoided charges if not for one, little lie. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Good told investigators that clients who complained about  
him were such good friends, they attended his mother's funeral. But 
when a quick check on the attendance revealed it wasn't true, 
federal authorities launched an all-out investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Good, wearing a gray pinstriped suit, polished  
wingtips and a gold signet ring on his little finger, pleaded 
guilty in federal court to 43 counts of fraud, conspiracy and money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	``He defrauded the young, he defrauded the old, he defrauded the  
rich, he defrauded the poor,'' prosecutor Stephen Huggard said. 
``Arthur Good has ruined an awful lot of people's lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the 51-year-old investment broker and his  
partners swindled $7 million from at least 100 victims by telling 
and retelling the same tale. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had met Bill Marriott, heir to the Marriott hotel  
fortune, on a plane. He claimed Marriott had taken a shine to him 
and offered him an investment opportunity for which he needed $3.5 
million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Good, a tall, impressive-looking man, told investors they could  
double or triple their money in six months at absolutely no risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Good and his still-unidentified partners were actually paying  
off early investors with money from later investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was ripping off money, is all it was,'' Huggard said.  
</P>
<P>
	One investor asked Good to introduce him to Marriott to ensure  
his investment would be safe. Good had a friend impersonate 
Marriott at a meeting held in a fancy restaurant in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Good spent the money on a home in an exclusive neighborhood in  
the Boston suburb of Quincy, as well as jewelry, office 
improvements, charitable donations and seven cars, including three 
1998 BMWs. 
</P>
<P>
	Those assets have been seized, but it is unlikely Good's victims  
will get anything more than pennies on the dollar, said U.S. 
Attorney Donald K. Stern. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are asking he get six to eight years in prison at  
sentencing in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Good was an unusually crafty con man, said Matthew Nestor, chief  
of enforcement for the Massachusetts Securities Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy presents a great image, he has the appearance of  
being trustworthy and honest and an upright citizen,'' Nestor said. 
``You can see how this could happen.''

<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- The Cuban government has said it will work to  
ensure the success of this month's gathering of Roman Catholic 
bishops from Latin America, the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cuban officials are committed to providing everything  
necessary to ensure that it turns out well,'' Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Five cardinals and 20 bishops will gather Feb. 14-17 in Cuba to  
celebrate the first anniversary of Pope John Paul II's historic 
visit to the communist nation. They will also discuss ways to 
improve ties between churches in Latin and North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Once officially atheist, the Cuban government is now secular.  
Church-state relations have warmed considerably in recent years.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Presidents of five Central American  
countries have met to lay plans for an upcoming visit by President 
Clinton and for the recovery from Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane killed almost 10,000 people in the region late  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Honduran Foreign Minister Roberto Flores Bermudez said the  
leaders also discussed how to ease foreign debt loads. The meeting 
was held Thursday in Tegucigalpa. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is scheduled to visit Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and  
El Salvador on March 8-11, in part to assess the damage caused by 
the hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting were Presidents Alvaro Arzu of Guatemala, Armando  
Calderon Sol of El Salvador, Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua, Miguel 
Angel Rodriguez of Costa Rica and Carlos Flores Facusse of 
Honduras.

	SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A court has cleared the capital's  
Roman Catholic archbishop of charges he discriminated against 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge late Thursday declared Archbishop Roman Arrieta  
innocent. The gay rights group Pink Triangle Association had 
charged that his criticism last year of a planned homosexual 
festival violated the law. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court said the archbishop had the right to preach church  
teachings about homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	In an Aug. 2, 1998, homily, Arrieta said he hoped officials  
``will find legal ways and forms'' to block the planned homosexual 
gathering, which was eventually canceled after heavy criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Pink Triangle accused him of violating clauses of a recent law  
on AIDS, which established possible fines for discrimination.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Honduras is likely to face a grave  
shortage of food this year due to devastation caused by Hurricane 
Mitch, the U.N. World Food Program has warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this moment, there is a deficit of 191,000 tons of basic  
grains in Honduras, and that means that there will be a food crisis 
this year,'' Giuseppe Lubatti, the program's representative in the 
Honduran capital, said Thursday at a news conference. ``The crisis 
probably will be sharpest between March and May of 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lubatti said the World Food Program was preparing $62 million  
worth of aid to help ease the problem with 2,500 tons of food a 
month over the next two years. It has donated about 20,000 tons of 
food in the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the hurricane that hit the country in late  
October and early November caused more than $1.7 billion in losses 
to the food sector and killed more than 5,600 people.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Takes Blame for Affidavit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky told House prosecutors in her  
videotaped deposition that she was to blame for a false affidavit 
denying her relationship with President Clinton -- a clip likely to 
be included in Saturday's first viewing of Lewinsky testimony at 
the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The session, the last before closing arguments, will give  
Americans watching on television a chance to see the former intern 
speaking some of the words that have dominated the nation's news 
for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Lewinsky tapes were readied for their first public  
airing, support also seemed to be growing Friday for opening final 
deliberations in the impeachment trial. A number of Senate 
Republicans embraced the idea, which most Democrats already 
supported, but a two-thirds majority will be needed to change rules 
that call for closed debate before the final votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The deliberations and vote had been expected by next Friday, but  
the grave illness of King Hussein of Jordan could change that. If 
the king dies in the next few days, a number of senators would be 
expected to fly to Jordan for the services, likely delaying the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecution team and the White House both were  
expected to show portions of Ms. Lewinsky's deposition on Saturday. 
Videotape of two others, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and 
White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, also may be shown at the 
televised proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a transcript of her deposition that was taken last Monday,  
released by the Senate on Friday, Ms. Lewinsky seems to retain 
sentimental feelings about her relationship with the president. At 
different times, her statements support and undercut his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	In one matter, she supports the president's contention that he  
never told her to file a false affidavit in the Paula Jones civil 
lawsuit denying their extramarital affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing a middle-of-the-night telephone conversation with the  
president, Ms. Lewinsky said that she thought to herself that she 
would deny the relationship because she and Clinton had always 
planned to use ``cover stories'' to conceal their affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I learned ... through those cover stories ... from  
what I learned in that conversation, I thought to myself I knew I 
would deny the relationship,'' Ms. Lewinsky explained. 
</P>
<P>
	But she also remained at odds with Clinton on other matters --  
including his denial that he touched her in intimate areas. While 
refusing to say whether the president lied, testifying she didn't 
``feel comfortable characterizing'' his comments as truthful or 
not, Ms. Lewinsky asserted: ``I know I've testified to what I 
believe is true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky has testified with explicit detail about her  
encounters with the president, contending he did touch her in ways 
that would have met the definition of sexual relations approved by 
the judge in Mrs. Jones' case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky expressed gratitude for some of the gifts Clinton  
gave her, particularly a hat pin. ``It was the first gift he gave 
me. It was a thoughtful gift. It was beautiful,'' she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	And when Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., asked her about ``the first  
so-called salacious occasion,'' she interrupted him, saying, ``Can 
you call it something else? ... I mean, this is my relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the drive to open deliberations, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,  
R-Texas, predicted ``the momentum is moving our way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Republican, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, said he supported  
openness because ``accountability is always there at the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of open deliberations have said senators would make  
speeches for the cameras, but Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who backs 
Hutchison's proposal, commented: ``If senators are going to mug for 
the cameras, they don't have to wait for the closing statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's deposition was spiced with moments of humor. She  
recalled with a laugh that during her first meeting with Frank 
Carter, the lawyer that Jordan found for her, ``I asked if I could 
sue Paula Jones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his testimony, also released Friday, Jordan described the  
dramatic weeks in December 1997 when Ms. Lewinsky was emerging as a 
potential witness in the Jones case at the same time Jordan was 
seeking a job in New York for her at the behest of the president. 
He recalled how Ms. Lewinsky called him in ``an emotional state'' 
when she got a subpoena in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was disturbed about not having, in her words, heard from  
the president or talked to the president. It was also in that 
meeting that it became clear to me that ... for lack of a better 
way to put it, that she had a 'thing' for the president,'' Jordan 
explained. He said, however, Ms. Lewinsky denied the relationship 
was sexual during the Dec. 18 conversation.

<HEADLINE> CBS Has $1 Million Quarterly Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. posted a $1 million fourth-quarter  
loss on severance payments to its former chief and losses from 
selling stakes in two cable networks, reversing an $861 million 
profit from a year earlier on gains from selling industrial 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the one-time gains or costs in both periods, CBS  
posted stronger profits from continuing operations in the latest 
quarter. Growth in its radio and outdoor advertising business 
offset lower television results, despite the NFL's successful 
return to the CBS network. 
</P>
<P>
	The profits from continuing operations exceeded Wall Street  
expectations. CBS shares were up 12 1/2 cents at $35.93 3/4 in midday 
trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS said its per-share results were breakeven for the quarter  
ended Dec. 31. In the same period a year earlier, CBS earned $1.25 
per share, but the profits came from an $871 million gain on the 
sale of the former Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s remaining 
industrial businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue jumped 22 percent to $1.79 billion from $1.47 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest quarter included $7 million in severance payments to  
former CBS chairman and chief executive Michael Jordan, who stepped 
down in October -- earlier than expected -- after transforming the 
former Westinghouse into a pure media company. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS also lost $7 million on sales of stakes in two cable  
networks. CBS sold its half of CBS Eye on People to Discovery 
Communications Inc. and sold a controlling stake in the 
Spanish-language news channel CBS TeleNoticias to Mexico's Grupo 
Medcom SA. 
</P>
<P>
	But excluding all special items, profits from continuing  
operations were $17 million, or 2 cents per share, in the 1998 
quarter, compared to a loss of $10 million, or 1 cent per share, in 
the 1997 period. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected CBS to post breakeven per-share results  
from continuing operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter operating profits rose 25 percent at Infinity  
Broadcasting Corp., its radio and outdoor advertising business, on 
strong advertising revenue and the acquisition of 98 stations from 
American Radio Systems Corp. CBS sold an 18 percent stake in 
Infinity to the public in December, raising nearly $3 billion in 
richest initial public offering ever made by a media company. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits at the televisions division -- the CBS network,  
television stations and cable channels -- dropped 81 percent. CBS 
blamed lower syndication revenue and smaller profits from 
programming other than the NFL, which the network regained this 
season after four years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, CBS lost $21 million, or 3 cents per share,  
compared to profits of $549 million, or 84 cents per share, in 
1997. Revenue rose to $6.81 billion from $5.37 billion.

<HEADLINE> Coleman Makes Plea in Battery Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- More than a decade after his last  
performance as the lovable Arnold in ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' former 
child actor Gary Coleman pleaded no-contest to disturbing the peace 
for punching an autograph-seeker in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman hung his head and wept as Municipal Court Commissioner  
Ulysses Burns sentenced him Thursday to a 90-day suspended jail 
sentence, fined him $400 and ordered him to attend 52 
anger-management classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, 30, had faced a battery charge, which could have meant  
up to six months in jail and a $2,000 fine if he had been 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``She expected me to treat her like gold (because she was a  
fan),'' Coleman said of his initial impression of Tracy Fields, the 
woman he admitted to punching in the eye. ``Like I was supposed to 
kowtow to her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Coleman's account, Ms. Field bristled, got huffy  
and blocked his path after he refused to embellish an autograph on 
July 30. He said he was afraid she was going to hit him. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I'm very small, very delicate, you know,'' he said. ``And  
I was getting real scared, so I thought it's either fight or flee. 
I thought if I distracted her with a blow I can flee. So I hit 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Field suffered a black eye. She has filed a civil suit  
against Coleman, claiming she has suffered from headaches since the 
attack.

<HEADLINE> Rykodisc Puts Music on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Showing its independent spirit, independent  
record label Rykodisc is distributing part of its catalog over the 
Internet using a music format shunned by its larger cousins in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for its unconventional artists such as David Bowie, Elvis  
Costello and Frank Zappa, Rykodisc announced it would license about 
175 songs to http://www.GoodNoise.com to be made available in the MP3 
format for 99 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always tried to get ahead of industry issues that are  
staring us in the face,'' said Lars Murray, director of new media 
for the Salem, Mass.-based Rykodisc. ``We have to do that because, 
as a smaller label, we're not in the position to set industry 
trends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The MP3 format allows for easy transfer of songs off the  
Internet and is proving increasingly popular with artists 
frustrated with the major record labels' distribution practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Major record labels view MP3 with suspicion because of its lack  
of copy protection. Once downloaded, a file can be copied endlessly 
and played on a $200 Walkman-like device called a Rio. This worries 
the recording industry, which fears the Internet could cut into its 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaction to Rykodisc's announcement was cool at the Recording  
Industry Association of America, a trade group that counts music 
giants Sony, Atlantic and Warner Bros. among its members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a free world,'' said RIAA spokeswoman Alexandra Walsh.  
``It's up to every individual company to decide what works best for 
them. They have to decide whether and how they're going to protect 
their product online or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recording industry set up the Secure Digital Music  
Initiative last December to develop a secure format for digital 
distribution by this fall, but Rykodisc's move indicates the 
smaller labels might not wait. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Hardie, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in  
Cambridge, Mass., called the Rykodisc move a ``huge boost'' for the 
company and MP3. ``It's a clear sign that indy music is willing to 
test the waters on a new form of distribution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, selling music over the Internet makes up only 0.3  
percent of total record sales, which hit $12.2 billion in 1997, but 
projections from Forrester show the Net could account for up to 30 
percent of all music sales by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray emphasized the MP3 offerings were not intended to bypass  
retailers, who handle more than half of all music sales, according 
to the Audit Bureau of Circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the business of selling CDs and what we hope this is  
going to do is let people get a taste of the artists and then go 
and buy the full length CD,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> ETrade Experiences Online Glitches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Online investors angered by a second straight  
day of trading problems at ETrade chose a familiar medium to lodge 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	In more than 1,500 e-mail messages and streams of nasty notes in  
Internet chat rooms, investors blasted the snags at ETrade, which 
says a software glitch caused outages Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On busy trading days, most online brokerages can experience  
delays in fulfilling trade orders, though ETrade's troubles had 
nothing to do with system capacity or heavy volume, a spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	New software installed Tuesday night malfunctioned Wednesday  
morning, knocking out the trading function for 75 minutes. About 5 
percent of ETrade's customers were unable to trade electronically 
throughout the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The system functioned normally for the first half-hour of  
trading Thursday before crashing again at about 10 a.m. EST. Some 
service was restored within an hour, and the system was entirely 
fixed within two hours, said Lisa Nash, vice president for customer 
management at the Palo Alto, Calif., brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade brokers were able to fill telephone orders, but many  
callers experienced lengthy delays, even as ETrade put more staff 
members onto telephone detail. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade set up a special e-mail address to handle customer  
complaints, and many investors turned to Internet chat rooms, 
disparaging the brokerage with nicknames like EtrytoTrade, EDelayed 
and ETrash. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Crisci, an ETrade customer who trades over the Internet  
several times a week, said he is frustrated enough to look into 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is both a legal and implied trust or contract to  
provide uninterrupted services during market hours,'' he said. 
Crisci said he lost money Wednesday when the system outage 
prevented him from canceling an order to buy stock. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade's woes have added fuel to a new inquiry into the booming  
Internet brokerage industry by New York state's attorney general. 
Citing a wave of complaints about system crashes, delayed trades 
and constant busy signals, Eliot Spitzer's office has asked a 
number of online trading firms to provide reports on their 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer, who took office in January, released a statement  
saying: ``The public knows that there are always risks involved in 
investing in the stock market. But part of that risk should not 
include questions about whether trades will be executed promptly or 
whether online brokerage firms can deliver on the services that 
they've promised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer's office has asked several online brokerages to provide  
information on their operations, but a spokesman wouldn't name the 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry follows a stream of warnings in recent weeks from  
state and federal securities regulators, who have urged online 
investors to use caution and be prepared for possible delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Arthur Levitt, chairman of the U.S. Securities and  
Exchange Commission, issued a warning to ordinary investors. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Red Wings' Murphy Sets Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit's Larry Murphy played the 1,447th game of  
his NHL career Friday night, breaking Tim Horton's league record 
for games by a defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy received a warm round of applause when his feat was  
announced during a timeout at 3:34 of the first period of the Red 
Wings' game with the Colorado Avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, who trails only Wayne Gretzky (1,467) in games played by  
an active player, sat out Wednesday night's game as a precaution 
after having his head slammed into the boards by New Jersey's 
Krzysztof Oliwa on Monday. That ended a string of 135 straight 
games for Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	In 19 seasons, Murphy has missed just 26 games and has never  
missed more than five in one season. Since the start of the 1992-93 
season, Murphy has missed just three of 509 regular-season games.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Eases Capital Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia is easing some of its  
much-criticized capital controls but imposed an ``exit'' tax 
intended to discourage foreign investors from yanking their money 
out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysia imposed sweeping capital controls last September in an  
effort to prevent the kind of investor flight that has wreaked 
havoc on other Asian nations like South Korea and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to fixing a peg for its currency, the measures also  
required investors to leave any money put into Malaysian stocks or 
bonds for at least one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian finance minister Daim Zainuddin said investors would  
be allowed to take funds out of Malaysian markets after less than a 
year but would have to pay an exit tax. No tax would be levied on 
funds left in the country for more than one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Daim made the announcement at a news confererence Thursday from  
which foreign reporters were barred. The new policy takes effect 
Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the new policy isn't likely to cause a mass exodus  
of foreign funds, as many had warned could happen if the 12-month 
lock-in requirement remained. But the new regulations might not 
boost investment either. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a whole, the new regulations show that Malaysia is moving  
back toward economic orthodoxy,'' said Kate O'Donoghue, regional 
economist at Barclays Capital in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Daim said the policy was based on meetings with top  
international fund managers and potential investors who met with 
the country's leadership last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southeast Asian nation has been trying to attract foreign  
investors back to help pull its economy out of its worst recession 
in a decade.

<HEADLINE> 9 Killed in Mich. House Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOMA TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- One day after a house fire killed  
six members of a southwestern Michigan family, including four 
children, a blaze 15 miles away killed three more children this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires occurred 15 miles apart in Berrien County. Neither  
house had a working smoke detector, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire at about 2 a.m. today broke out in a house in Benton  
Harbor, radio station WSJM reported. The three children killed were 
all under age five, and their mother was hospitalized in critical 
condition, the station said. Their identities were not given. 
</P>
<P>
	The house had a smoke detector but it did not have batteries,  
WSJM reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Thursday, four children and their parents were killed when  
they were trapped as fire swept through their small white home in 
Coloma Township. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke and flames had consumed much of the home Thursday by the  
time neighbor George Johnson Jr. and a sheriff's deputy arrived to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both tried to get through ... but there was so much  
smoke,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deanna Renee Simpson was found on the living room floor. Shane  
Jr., 3, Ryan, 5, and April, 5, were with their father, Shane 
Simpson, 30, and baby Jesse inside a back bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said no smoke detectors were found in the home,  
about 35 miles west of Kalamazoo in rural southwestern Michigan. 
The cause of the fire had not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears they were trying to get out,'' said police Officer  
Michael Prince. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's dog, which was chained outside, survived the fire.  
</P>
<P>
	It took firefighters nearly an hour to put the blaze out.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Simpson's relatives walked through the house Thursday  
afternoon to lay a bouquet of roses on what was left of its red 
deck. Her cousin, Eddie Jackson, said the fire was a tragic 
reminder to people to make sure they have working smoke detectors 
in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't have them, please get them now. If this ain't  
close enough to home, drive by here now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rykodisc Puts Music on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Showing its independent spirit, independent  
record label Rykodisc is distributing part of its catalog over the 
Internet using a music format shunned by its larger cousins in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for its unconventional artists such as David Bowie, Elvis  
Costello and Frank Zappa, Rykodisc announced it would license about 
175 songs to www.GoodNoise.com to be made available in the MP3 
format for 99 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always tried to get ahead of industry issues that are  
staring us in the face,'' said Lars Murray, director of new media 
for the Salem, Mass.-based Rykodisc. ``We have to do that because, 
as a smaller label, we're not in the position to set industry 
trends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The MP3 format allows for easy transfer of songs off the  
Internet and is proving increasingly popular with artists 
frustrated with the major record labels' distribution practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Major record labels view MP3 with suspicion because of its lack  
of copy protection. Once downloaded, a file can be copied endlessly 
and played on a $200 Walkman-like device called a Rio. This worries 
the recording industry, which fears the Internet could cut into its 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaction to Rykodisc's announcement was cool at the Recording  
Industry Association of America, a trade group that counts music 
giants Sony, Atlantic and Warner Bros. among its members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a free world,'' said RIAA spokeswoman Alexandra Walsh.  
``It's up to every individual company to decide what works best for 
them. They have to decide whether and how they're going to protect 
their product online or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recording industry set up the Secure Digital Music  
Initiative last December to develop a secure format for digital 
distribution by this fall, but Rykodisc's move indicates the 
smaller labels might not wait. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Hardie, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in  
Cambridge, Mass., called the Rykodisc move a ``huge boost'' for the 
company and MP3. ``It's a clear sign that indy music is willing to 
test the waters on a new form of distribution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, selling music over the Internet makes up only 0.3  
percent of total record sales, which hit $12.2 billion in 1997, but 
projections from Forrester show the Net could account for up to 30 
percent of all music sales by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray emphasized the MP3 offerings were not intended to bypass  
retailers, who handle more than half of all music sales, according 
to the Audit Bureau of Circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the business of selling CDs and what we hope this is  
going to do is let people get a taste of the artists and then go 
and buy the full length CD,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> USDA Defends Tainted Meat Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal food safety officials are defending  
their response to an outbreak of tainted meat at a Michigan meat 
processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Tainted meat from the Bil Mar plant in Zeeland has been linked  
to 11 deaths, five miscarriages and stillbirths and about 72 
illnesses in 14 states, according to the federal Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Bil Mar, a division of Chicago-based Sara Lee Corp., on Dec. 22  
recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and other packaged meat 
products sold under a variety of names. It said they could be 
tainted with listeria monocytogenes bacteria. The plant remains 
closed during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria are common bacteria but can pose a serious risk to  
people with weakened immune systems, as well as to the elderly, 
diabetics and pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and  
Inspection Service began investigating the plant Dec. 15 after 
consulting with the CDC on a rash of illnesses but did not have 
evidence of an ``intact'' contaminated product until several days 
later, said Margaret Glavin, associate FSIS administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lack of an absolutely firm link with the plant,''  
Glavin said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Glavin said the agency met with company officials Dec. 18  
and asked them to consider taking the product off the market. USDA 
does not have recall authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``They ultimately did do it,'' Glavin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee spokeswoman Theresa Herlevsen denied there was any such  
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not aware of any recommendations of a market withdrawal  
or a recall,'' Herlevsen said. ``It was a voluntary action ... in 
the absence of any recommendations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is not the first food safety issue at the plant, officials  
said. In 1997, the plant was closed for several days after 
inspectors found a series of sanitation discrepancies, Glavin said. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, company officials found evidence of listeria during  
environmental testing, but at that time, there was no evidence of 
listeria in the product, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the July testing, the company underwent ``very aggressive  
sanitizing and cleaning of all areas,'' Herlevsen said.

<HEADLINE>  Baseball Names Award After Aaron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Twenty-five years after he broke Babe Ruth's home  
run record, baseball is naming an award after Hank Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, honored at a gala dinner attended by President Clinton on  
Friday night, will have his name on an award presented annually to 
the best hitter in each league. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1999, the award will go to the hitter with the most hits,  
home runs and RBIs, commissioner Bud Selig said. In future years, 
it will be selected by a panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clearly for the best all-around hitter, not just for the  
power hitter,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, who turned 65 Friday, finished with 755 homers. He hit  
No. 715 in April 1974 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, and felt 
snubbed because commissioner Bowie Kuhn skipped the game. Aaron 
also received hate mail as he approached Ruth's record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say if race had anything to do with it and why I  
didn't get the recognition,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as recently as five years ago, Aaron said much more could  
have been done to publicize the sport by promoting the 715th home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the sad thing about the whole thing,'' he said in 1994.  
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has been criticized for its record on minority hiring  
and Selig says the sport must do more. In its last report, issued 
in 1996, baseball said 9 percent of front-office employees on the 
28 teams are black and 8 percent of on-field employees are black. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, a senior vice president with the Atlanta Braves, said was  
excited about the award. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hank Aaron Award is finally an honor that's worthy of your  
achievements,'' said Time Warner vice chairman Ted Turner, the 
longtime head of the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	The $500-a-plate gala, attended by Hall of Famers Ernie Banks  
and Frank Robinson, Sammy Sosa and heavyweight champion Evander 
Holyfield, was expected to raise more than $1 million for the 
Chasing The Dream Foundation that Aaron and his wife started in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation provide grants to children ages 9-12 to help them  
develop talents for which they have shown an ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``By April we'll have 44 kids in the program and eventually have  
755,'' Aaron said gathering, which included about a dozen of the 
children currently benefiting from the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron hit his 715th home run on April 8, 1974, off Al Downing.  
Downing, who lives in California, was invited to attend the gala 
but was unable to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has an ear infection,'' Aaron said. ``He was coming. But he  
did send me a nice letter.''

<HEADLINE> Miss New York Crowned Miss USA 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- A 21-year-old from New York who said she'd  
forsake her boyfriend to become Miss USA 1999 won the title Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Tennessee, Morgan Tandy High, was named first runner-up.  
Miss California, Angelique Breaux, was the second runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner, Kimberly Ann Pressler, broke up the audience when  
host Shemar Moore, from the soap opera ``The Young and the 
Restless,'' asked whether she would leave her boyfriend behind to 
wear the Miss USA crown and she quickly replied yes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if true love is there it will be there afterward,''  
she said as she waved to her boyfriend in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The field of 51 hopefuls was cut to 10 after an energetic  
15-minute opening musical number. Contestants from Indiana, 
Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Virginia 
also moved on in the pageant. 
</P>
<P>
	The ten finalists were then peppered with questions from a panel  
of interviewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 48-year-old pageant, sponsored by the Miss Universe  
Organization, was held in Branson for the first time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she can just enjoy it, enjoy her year and find time to  
squeeze everything in that she wants to do, she'll have the time of 
her life,'' said Miss USA 1998 Shawnae Jebbia hours before she 
placed the crown on her successor's head. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pressler is from Franklinville, N.Y., about 60 miles  
southeast of Buffalo.

<HEADLINE>  BMW Names New Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- German automaker BMW today named its  
former head of production, Joachim Milberg, to succeed Bernd 
Pischetsrieder as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of change at the helm of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG had  
been rumored for days. Pischetsrieder had been expected to step 
down because of losses at the company's Rover unit in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesmen said earlier that the supervisory board was  
officially meeting to discuss plans for closer cooperation between 
the BMW and Rover brands to boost Rover's profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has invested more than $3.5 billion in Rover since it  
acquired the British automaker in 1994. Pischetsrieder, an engineer 
who took BMW's top job in 1993, orchestrated the Rover takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect Rover to post a pretax loss of around $590  
million for 1998, including provisions for the work flexibility 
pact Rover sealed with the unions in December. 
</P>
<P>
	But BMW shares have risen this week, a trend analysts attributed  
to market hopes that Pischetsrieder's departure could open the way 
for BMW to join the current wave of carmarker alliances. 
Pischetsrieder has consistently ruled out BMW as a partner in any 
merger or joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW is seen as an attractive takeover target, particularly for a  
U.S. car company, due to its strong position in the European luxury 
car market.

<HEADLINE>  BMW Names New Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- German automaker BMW today named its  
former head of production, Joachim Milberg, to succeed Bernd 
Pischetsrieder as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of change at the helm of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG had  
been rumored for days. Pischetsrieder had been expected to step 
down because of losses at the company's Rover unit in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesmen said earlier that the supervisory board was  
officially meeting to discuss plans for closer cooperation between 
the BMW and Rover brands to boost Rover's profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has invested more than $3.5 billion in Rover since it  
acquired the British automaker in 1994. Pischetsrieder, an engineer 
who took BMW's top job in 1993, orchestrated the Rover takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect Rover to post a pretax loss of around $590  
million for 1998, including provisions for the work flexibility 
pact Rover sealed with the unions in December. 
</P>
<P>
	But BMW shares have risen this week, a trend analysts attributed  
to market hopes that Pischetsrieder's departure could open the way 
for BMW to join the current wave of carmarker alliances. 
Pischetsrieder has consistently ruled out BMW as a partner in any 
merger or joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW is seen as an attractive takeover target, particularly for a  
U.S. car company, due to its strong position in the European luxury 
car market. 
</P>
<P>
	But a changing of the top brass at BMW wouldn't necessarily mean  
a change in merger strategy, since the Quandt family, which owns 42 
percent of the company, would still have to approve.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Salutes Aaron on HR Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Major league baseball finally paid tribute to  
Hank Aaron, 25 years after he hit home run No. 715 and broke Babe 
Ruth's record. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig announced Friday that a Hank  
Aaron Award will be named after the slugger beginning this season. 
It will go to the best hitter in each league. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday night, President Clinton came to Atlanta to help  
celebrate Aaron's 65th birthday at a gala dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton hugged the graying and bespectacled Aaron upon the  
president's arrival at the downtown Atlanta hotel. He stayed for 
more than three hours until the party ended. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen former players, including Hall of Famers Reggie Jackson,  
Frank Robinson and Phil Niekro, plus Sammy Sosa, escorted a huge 
birthday cake to the dais, and singer Charlie Pride led the group 
in singing ``Happy Birthday,'' culminating the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``From Mobile to Milwaukee to Atlanta, through a segregated  
South, he (Aaron) moved through a changing America,'' Clinton said 
during a five-minute tribute to Aaron. ``And he changed the minds 
and hearts of Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron was born in Mobile and played major league baseball in  
Atlanta and Milwaukee during a 23-year career, breaking Ruth's 
record in 1974 and ending with 755. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us honor him not only for the power of his swing, but  
for the power of his spirit, and not only for breaking records but 
for breaking barriers,'' said Clinton, who introduced Aaron to the 
sellout throng of 1,400, which stood and cheered for a full minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am simply overwhelmed by your presence here this evening,''  
Aaron said. ``I want to say to you, Mr. President, what a great 
honor it is for me to have you here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron also thanked Selig for the hitting award to be named in  
his honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to thank the commissioner for the high honor that was  
bestowed upon me by major league baseball,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1999, the award will go to the hitter with the most hits,  
home runs and RBIs, Selig said. In future years, it will be 
selected by a panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clearly for the best all-around hitter, not just for the  
power hitter,'' Selig said prior to the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, a senior vice president with the Braves, hit home run No.  
715 in April 1974 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, but felt 
snubbed because commissioner Bowie Kuhn did not attend the game. 
Aaron also received hate mail as he approached Ruth's record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say if race had anything to do with it and why I  
didn't get the recognition,'' Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
	But as recently as five years ago, Aaron said not enough was  
done by baseball to publicize the sport by promoting the 715th home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the sad thing about the whole thing,'' he said then.  
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has been criticized for its record on minority hiring,  
and Selig said the sport must do more. In its last report, issued 
in 1996, baseball said 9 percent of front-office employees on the 
28 teams are black and 8 percent of on-field employees are black. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hank Aaron Award is finally an honor that's worthy of your  
achievements,'' said Time Warner vice chairman Ted Turner, the 
longtime head of the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	The $500-a-plate gala raised more than $1 million for the  
Chasing The Dream Foundation that Aaron and his wife started in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation provide grants to children ages 9-12 to help them  
develop talents for which they have shown an ability. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron hit his 715th home run on April 8, 1974, off Al Downing.  
Downing, who lives in California, was invited to attend the gala, 
but was unable to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has an ear infection,'' Aaron said. ``He was coming. But he  
did send me a nice letter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron will be honored again on April 8 in a pregame ceremony at  
Turner Field and throughout the season at major league stadiums 
across the country.

<HEADLINE> Could Boxing Knock Out Tyson? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Sports Analysis    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This could well be the final knockout loss of  
Mike Tyson's career. 
</P>
<P>
	For the third time since 1991, Tyson's colorful but often  
violent career was interrupted when a Maryland judge sentenced him 
Friday to a year in jail for assaulting two motorists last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	How long Tyson is away from boxing, or even if he fights again,  
depends on several factors: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Winning an appeal of the sentence and going to trial on  
assault charges; 
</P>
<P>
	-- Getting even more jail time for violating parole on a rape  
conviction in Indiana; 
</P>
<P>
	-- Getting his license revoked again by the Nevada State Athletic  
Commission, which took it away when he bit Evander Holyfield's ears 
on June 28, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, if Tyson gets out of jail on bond by Monday and then  
appeals, which he has 30 days to do, he might still be able to 
fight as scheduled April 24 against an unnamed opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	If he wins an appeal, however, he would have to go to trial.  
That could keep him out of the ring even longer and a conviction 
would further extend his layoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime at this point that he would be taken out of the ring  
would be a real death sentence,'' said Shelly Finkel, Tyson's 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	So Iron Mike's boxing future is cloudy, indeed. He will be 33 on  
June 30, and at his age, inactivity, especially time in prison, can 
only further erode already faded skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's gone through so much, I don't know if he can overcome  
it,'' said Angelo Dundee, who has trained many champions, including 
Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard. ``He can't be a factor in the 
heavyweight division any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It finishes him,'' said former heavyweight champion Larry  
Holmes, who has staged a few comebacks of his own, but has never 
again reached boxing's top rung. ``It doesn't finish him 
physically, but it finishes him mentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Stephen Johnson said in sentencing Tyson that the fighter  
``repeatedly reacts compulsively and violently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the first round of his fight against Francois  
Botha last month, his first since he bit Holyfield, Tyson got into 
an after-the-bell brawl. When told at a news conference after his 
fifth-round knockout victory that Botha said Tyson tried to break 
his arm, Tyson replied, ``That's correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How Tyson reacts to the latest development in a lifetime of  
problems remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Say, for example, that Tyson's next fight is on Feb. 28, 2000.  
That would be only his eighth fight in nine years. Ali was out of 
boxing for 3 1/2 years after being convicted for refusing to be 
drafted into the military. In his championship years, 1978-89, 
Leonard fought only 13 times. George Foreman was retired for 10 
years before resuming a highly successful career. 
</P>
<P>
	Those three, however, were not imprisoned and could live normal  
lives and train whenever they wished. Not so with Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tyson who dominated boxing in the late 1980s has been gone  
for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He lost that thing that he can't be beaten,'' Dundee said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's shot,'' Holmes said. ``That fight the other night  
(Botha), he had the mind-set, but nothing was happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson did look like an aging, small heavyweight until he nailed  
Botha with the knockout punch. 
</P>
<P>
	Ring rust, Tyson gave as the reason for his performance. How  
much rust can he handle? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's pretty much history,'' said Bob Arum, who did not  
promote Tyson. ``If anything, it's better for boxing because it 
allows the limelight to be on real fighters in the heavyweight 
division like Holyfield,(Lennox) Lewis and lighter weights like 
(Oscar) De La Hoya,'' an Arum fighter.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 0.26 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A continued slide of technology stocks brought  
the entire stock market lower Friday. Shares of Internet brokerages 
and computer-chip makers fell the farthest from investors' favor, 
but every part of the high-tech sector was hit in the selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	After a day of modest swings between positive and negative  
territory, the Dow Jones industrial average ended just 0.26 points 
lower, closing at 9,304.24. That brought its loss for the week to 
54.59. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Stock Market, dominated by technology stocks, had its  
third-biggest point drop of all time on Thursday and was lower 
throughout Friday's session. It fell 36.45 points to close at 
2,373.62, leaving it 5.5 percent below the record 2,510.09 reached 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology issues throughout the market fared poorly, led by  
Advanced Micro Devices. A disappointing earnings forecast Thursday 
prompted investors to send its shares down 2 1/16 to close at 16 
13/16 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD said its poor outlook was caused in part by price cuts by  
rival Intel, and as fears of a price war began to take hold, 
several competing chip makers followed AMD lower. Intel fell 2 9/16 
to close at 127 9/16, and Applied Materials fell 1 1/16 to close at 
60 11/16 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The continued decline of technology stocks has worried some  
analysts about the impact on the broader market. High-flying tech 
companies have been largely responsible for the market's overall 
advances, leading some to fear that if the technology bubble 
bursts, the entire market will cave in. 
</P>
<P>
	That was particularly true Friday of the Internet brokerages,  
which all paid a price for technical problems that plagued ETrade 
Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the online brokerages began tumbling Thursday after  
New York state's attorney general announced an inquiry into their 
business practices. In Nasdaq trading Friday, JB Oxford Holdings 
tumbled 4 3/16 to close at 11 11/16 and ETrade, which was hampered 
by technical difficulties on several occasions Wednesday through 
Friday, fell 4 9/16 to close at 48 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``The group has run way too far too fast,'' said Alfred E.  
Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc., 
in St. Louis. ``It's a balloon that's going to have the air let out 
of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman chalked up some of Friday's losses to investors hoping  
to cash in on the big gains of major technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor, analysts said, was a Labor Department report  
that showed the U.S. unemployment rate held steady in January at a 
28-year low of 4.3 percent. The report showed that virtually every 
sector except manufacturing is booming, leading some economists to 
rekindle fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates 
to cool off the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan expressed concern in congressional  
testimony last month that labor shortages would propel faster wage 
increases, which in turn would drive up inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Goldman said investors should not fear the long-running  
economic expansion is overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report paints a picture of an economy that's in a  
Goldilocks environment,'' he said. ``It's not too hot and it's not 
too cold. It's just right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi Automotive made a strong debut in its first day of  
trading. The Detroit-based auto parts supplier, owned by General 
Motors Corp., was the most actively traded stock on the NYSE on 
Friday, rising $1.43 3/4 from its offering price to close at $18.43 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi was just one of seven companies that had initial stock  
sales Friday, raising a total of $2.22 billion in the biggest round 
of one-day offering since last July, before the market's summer 
swoon began. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators kept their losses slim Friday. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 9.09 to 1,239.40, the NYSE composite 
index fell 3.76 points to 587.29, and the American Stock Exchange 
composite index fell 0.86 point to 706.26. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.07 points to  
412.72. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
NYSE, where volume totaled 866.46 million shares, vs. 859.73 
million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.4 percent before  
U.S. markets opened. As U.S. stocks sagged, major European markets 
lost ground from early gains. Germany's DAX index eked out a mere 
3-point gain, Britain's FT-SE 100 closed 1.4 percent lower, and 
France's CAC-40 ended 0.5 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Teen Guilty in Slaying of Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) -- A teen-ager who was charged with murder  
after shooting his father with a bow and arrow was convicted Friday 
of second-degree manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvatore Colavito, 18, faces a maximum of 10 years in prison  
for the October 1996 death of 41-year-old Leonard Colavito. The 
elder Colavito was found dead inside his home with a 15-inch arrow 
wound from his chest to his pelvis. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvatore Colavito claimed the shooting was an accident that  
happened after he stepped on the family cat while holding the 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors sought a murder conviction, pointing out that  
Colavito never called for help, hid evidence and lied to police. 
Prosecutor John Redway said the son had grown intolerant of his 
father and found him abusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Richard Brown described Salvatore Colavito as a  
young man who loved his father, and said any perceived cover-up was 
simply the action of a teen-ager confused and shocked by his 
father's death. 
</P>
<P>
	A murder charge would have carried a sentence of 25 years to  
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing was scheduled for April 13.

<HEADLINE> Like Son, Like Father at Senior PGA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) -- Robert Duval has a way to go to match  
his son, but at least he's trying. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Duval shot a 67 Friday in the Royal Caribbean Classic,  
leaving him one stroke behind leader Bruce Fleisher after the first 
round of the Senior PGA Tour event. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's son, David, is the hottest player on the PGA Tour,  
winning nine of his last 29 tournaments and shooting a record-tying 
59 two weeks ago in the final round of the Bob Hope Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had tears in my eyes when David shot the 59,'' said his  
52-year-old father, a career club pro until qualifying for the 
Senior Tour in 1996. ``Any time your son goes in the history books 
in a sport is something phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While most sons learn from their fathers, the elder Duval  
adopted some of his son's look, wearing Oakley sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought maybe I'd see something that he saw,'' the father  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	More significantly, he adopted David's even-keeled disposition.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a tendency to get high and low on the course,'' Robert  
said. ``I noticed David stays even-tempered at all times. I tried 
to do that today and it really worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David, 27, won four tournaments last season and led in the money  
standing at $2,591,031. His father also had a personal-best season, 
earning $734,573 with two runner-up finishes. Robert Duval is 
seeking his first professional win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I taught him how to play golf, but not the way he's playing  
now,'' Duval said. ``I don't have any problem being in David's 
shadow. I was paying his way to junior tournaments so he could get 
into this position.'' 
</P>

	While many siblings of legendary golfers -- Gary Nicklaus, Robert  
Floyd and Jack Snead -- have paled in comparison to their fathers, 
the elder Duval harnesses no illusions of living up to his son's 
success.

<P>
	``I beat him once last year,'' Robert Duval joked. ``I'm just

<HEADLINE> Doug Flutie Big Man at Pro Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Too short, too old, too long away from the NFL.  
</P>
<P>
	But there Doug Flutie was, wearing an all-star jersey, taking  
snaps in turn with John Elway and Vinny Testaverde during an AFC 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie may be the most unlikely Pro Bowl rookie ever.  
</P>
<P>
	``Most guys who are in the Pro Bowl for the first time are 24 or  
25,'' the Buffalo Bills' all-star said. ``It's just an interesting 
twist to my career, and I'm very thankful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie, 36, was in Hawaii about a year ago for a quite different  
reason, joining several other former Heisman Trophy winners, 
including Texas A&AMP;M's John David Crow and Michigan's Desmond 
Howard, who were honored at the Hula Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie, who had spent most of the '90s playing in the Canadian  
Football League, found out while he was in Hawaii that the Buffalo 
Bills, were interested in him. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10 quarterback told some of his fellow Heisman  
winners he wanted to give the NFL another try, and, he said, 
```They thought I was crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crazy or not, he was determined.  
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I learned Buffalo wanted to sign me, my competitive  
juices stared flowing because I knew this year was going to be 
something different,'' Flutie recalled. ``I believed all along that 
I could do it in the NFL, that I just needed an opportunity. The 
way things turned out was fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His long journey to the Bills wound through a year with the New  
Jersey Generals of the now-defunct United States Football League, 
and one season with the Chicago Bears before being traded to New 
England, where he spent most of three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He went to Canada in 1990 and had a successful eight years  
there, including being selected the CFL's Most Outstanding Player 
six times. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed with the Bills on Jan. 20, 1998, and went to camp as  
backup to Rob Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel real comfortable going in. It was like being a  
rookie all over again,'' Flutie said. ``I just was in a position 
where I was fighting for a job, trying to get a chance to get on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	When Johnson went down with an injury, Flutie got his chance and  
was outstanding, completing 202 of 354 passes for 2,711 yards and 
20 touchdowns and leading the Bills to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie was nervous when he first joined the Bills, worried about  
the transition to a new team and new offense, and getting used to 
new defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``But then I realized it was still a game of throw and catch,  
reading defenses and making the right decisions,'' he said. 
``That's the key for a quarterback at this level. I felt very 
confident in my skills and abilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being voted into the Pro Bowl by his peers provided another  
stamp of validity to Flutie's amazing year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very special, an acceptance from the other players,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie has been one of the most accommodating all-stars during  
the week leading up to Sunday's Pro Bowl, tirelessly signing 
autographs, and, at one point, kneeling down so he could look two 
young girls in the eye as he patiently answered their questions for 
a class project. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has obviously enjoyed the company of his teammates,  
teasing John Elway about getting the AFC No. 7 jersey. That's also 
Flutie's number with Buffalo, but he'll wear No. 6 in the all-star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Have you done anything to deserve it (the No. 7),'' Elway  
asked with a grin. Flutie replied, ``Just hanging in there, riding 
along.''

<HEADLINE> Cop Killer Suspect Caught in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The man wanted for gunning down a Georgia  
policeman who had stopped him on Interstate 20 was caught Thursday 
in Canada after more than two weeks on the lam. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey McGee of Schenectady, N.Y., was captured in Toronto by  
the Toronto Metro Fugitive Squad, FBI spokesman Jay Spadafore said. 
He couldn't provide any details of the capture. 
</P>
<P>
	McGee, 32, is charged with murder in the death of Villa Rica  
Police Capt. Robbie Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop, 35, was shot in the head Jan. 20 after stopping a  
vehicle on Interstate 20 in west Georgia. A copy of a warning 
ticket written to McGee was in Bishop's ticket book. 
</P>
<P>
	McGee is believed to have boarded a flight to Los Angeles in  
Birmingham, Ala., the day of the slaying. The plane made a stop in 
Houston, but investigators said they were unsure where McGee was 
headed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Thursday that McGee  
called his mother last week at her home in Schenectady. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him what happened, and he said, `Ma, does it really  
make a difference what I got to say? They already got me convicted 
and hung,' or words to that effect,'' Vera McGee Lewis told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	A $55,000 reward had been posted for information leading to  
McGee's capture and conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop hauled in a fortune in drug money and illegal drugs from  
drivers along Georgia interstates during a 12-year career. He also 
traveled to other states to teach his techniques to other police 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all just happy'' that McGee has been caught, said Robin  
Oehler, a secretary for the Villa Rica Police Department.

<HEADLINE> Three Lead Daytona 500 Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- If the first day of practice is any  
indication, competition will be fierce Saturday for a front-row 
spot at the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by two-time race winner Sterling Marlin, the 41 fastest  
drivers were within less than one second of each other after almost 
4 1/2 hours of practice Friday at Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlin, who started the season-opening race from the pole in  
1992, turned a fast lap of 193.995 mph, followed by teammates Rusty 
Wallace and Jeremy Mayfield at 193.878 and 193.632, Dale Jarrett at 
193.528, two-time defending NASCAR Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon 
at 193.245 and former Daytona pole-winner Kyle Petty at 193.108. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's about all we had, but the pole should be right in there  
at that speed,'' Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayfield looked at a sheet of paper listing the practice times  
and speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pole qualifying is going to be quite a show,'' he said. ``If  
we can both make just a few little improvements, maybe we'll have a 
Penske front row here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, who was fastest in winter testing on the 2 1/2-mile,  
high-banked Daytona oval, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both cars are running real strong,'' he said. ``If we get both  
cars on the front row, it's a lot easier to stay hooked up all day 
in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we plan, but plans never really seem to work  
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the unique Daytona qualifying format, time trials on Saturday  
will determine the front row for the Feb. 14 race. That session, 
along with further qualifying on Monday and Tuesday, will set the 
starting lineups for Thursday's twin 125-mile qualifying races, 
which in turn fill most of the 43-car race field. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace drew the No. 2 spot in Saturday's 58-car qualifying  
order. Mayfield will qualify fifth, Marlin 10th, Petty 20th and 
Jarrett 24th. 
</P>
<P>
	Pole qualifying is to begin at 12:30 p.m. EST and Wallace said  
the earlier the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it got hotter today as the day went on,'' Wallace  
noted. ``Going out second and fifth definitely isn't going to hurt 
anything at all. I believe the track will be cooler at 12:30 than 
it will be at 3 o'clock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the drivers near the bottom of the list are Winston Cup  
runner-up Mark Martin (43rd) and Gordon (56th). 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if that will be a problem or not,'' said Gordon,  
who won the Daytona 500 in 1997. ``But we don't have any choice but 
to go out and run the best lap we can and see where we stand. 
Hopefully, if we can't be on the front row, we can at least have a 
good starting spot for our qualifying race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Earnhardt finally won the Daytona 500 last year after  
failing in his first 19 tries. He hopes to repeat, even if he 
wasn't particularly fast on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt's lap of 190.937 was well down the list, but the  
seven-time Winston Cup champ was confident enough that his team put 
their Chevy up on jackstands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to go for it in qualifying,'' said Earnhardt,  
20th on the qualifying list. ``We didn't go out and practice any 
more and wear the car down or anything like that. We feel good 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the drivers have no shot at the front row, but that  
doesn't mean they take qualifying lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thursday's the key race,'' said Jimmy Spencer, who had a lap  
of 191.249 mph. ``You really have to run well in that race, and I'm 
glad of that because I don't think we have a shot at the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't really care about the pole and we're not worried  
about Thursday as much as getting our car driving real good and our 
pit crew up to where they need to be. If we can get all that stuff, 
hopefully, we're in the hunt for the 500.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Move Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were higher  
Friday in trading on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices gained in a continuation of low-volume,  
technical trading seen on Thursday. Prices were boosted by 
indications the current price of wheat is increasing export demand. 
At least three nations are expected to make U.S. wheat purchases in 
the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices were higher on good export business. South  
Korea purchased U.S. corn during the week, and Mexico is expected 
to enter the market in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices were higher, with a lack of farmer  
selling bolstering the market. However, the prospect of a bumper 
soybean crop in South American limited gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery was 1 3/4 cents higher at $2.69 1/2 a bushel;  
March corn was 1 1/4 cents higher at $2.18 1/2 a bushel; March oats were 
3/4 cent higher at $1.07 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans were 5 cents 
higher at $5.13 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and pork futures prices were higher in trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Live hog futures prices were higher on expectations the U.S.  
Agriculture Department will buy hogs as part of a food-aid package 
for Russia. Prices also received a boost from a slowdown in hog 
slaughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical factors and the expectation of higher cash prices in  
coming weeks gave a boost to cattle futures prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle for February delivery were .58 cent higher at 65.25 cents  
a pound; March feeder cattle were .47 cent higher at 74.77 cents a 
pound; February lean hogs were .97 cent higher at 43.42 cents a 
pound; February pork bellies were 2.45 cents higher at 62.10 cents 
a pound.

<HEADLINE>  Man Free After 16 Years on Death Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man who spent 16 years on death row for a  
double murder was freed today after college journalists uncovered 
new evidence and another man confessed to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook County Criminal Courts Judge Thomas Fitzgerald said there  
were ``news reports of significant evidentiary developments'' that 
would put into question whether Anthony Porter actually committed 
the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, 43, was allowed to leave prison without having to post  
bond. He will stay free while prosecutors study the new confession. 
</P>
<P>
	The release was based on a motion filed by the county state's  
attorney's office. However, Porter remains charged with the 1982 
murders of Jerry Hillard, 18, and Marilyn Green, 19, who were 
gunned down in a Chicago park. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter had his arms around his two attorneys as he heard the  
judge's decision. While he appeared elated by the news, he did not 
speak to reporters as he was taken back to the county Jail to be 
processed before leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Terri Marroquin, one of Porter's attorneys, said ``there was a  
lot of crying and a lot of hugging'' after the ruling. She said 
Porter was going to live with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the day after another man was videotaped confessing  
to the slayings, Porter had said: ``I'm not angry now. I thank God 
everything came out all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant State's Attorney David Erickson called it ``a good  
thing'' when reporters and others get involved in the criminal 
justice system and said, ``I commend the students.'' He said it was 
too early to say whether Porter would get an apology from 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter was scheduled to die by injection last September, but the  
state Supreme Court stopped the execution two days earlier amid 
questions about his mental fitness. Defense attorneys argued 
Porter, who has an IQ of 51, could not understand what was 
happening to him or help in his appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Then questions arose about the integrity of the conviction. A  
prosecution witness allegedly recanted his testimony implicating 
Porter, saying police had pressured him. 
</P>
<P>
	And two weeks ago, students in Northwestern University's  
investigative reporting class, who were looking into Porter's 
claims of innocence, tracked down a witness in Milwaukee who 
identified her ex-husband as the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, journalism professor David Protess, private  
investigator Paul Ciolino and several students visited the witness, 
Inez Jackson, who said her former husband, Alstory Simon, pulled 
the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
	They confronted Simon five days later with Jackson's statement  
and her signed affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon at first denied the shootings, but then said he fired at  
the two in self defense when he thought the male victim was 
reaching for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must have close to busted off about six rounds,'' Simon said  
on the videotape made by Ciolino. 
</P>
<P>
	``My students certainly feel that they've contributed to saving  
a life,'' Protess said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The case would not the first in which the professor and students  
of his saved a life. In June 1996, four men who had spent 18 years 
behind bars for murder were released after Northwestern students 
working with Ciolino discovered new evidence. Two of the four had 
been on death row. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter said Thursday he wanted to hug his mother, seven children  
and six grandchildren. He said he also wants to help people in his 
community and ``teach them right from wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A steak would be fine and maybe some dinner rolls,'' he said.

	Jobless Rate Holds at 28-Year Low  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American economy started the new year on a  
tear, creating 245,000 jobs in sales, construction, computers and 
other fields and holding the unemployment rate at a 28-year low of 
4.3 percent. The government's first major economic report of the 
year, issued today by the Labor Department, showed that January's 
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate matched the level achieved in 
December, last April and, before that, in 1970. The unemployment 
rate for whites was unchanged at 3.8 percent in January. But the 
rates for blacks, 7.8 percent, and Hispanics, 6.6 percent, fell to 
the lowest levels since the government began tracking them in the 
early 1970s. 

</P>
<P>
	Feds To Track Internet Sales  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department said today it will  
begin tracking sales on the Internet, which it called ``a major 
indicator of the nation's economic health.'' But even as the 
government touted figures showing that consumers spent $9 billion 
last year on the Internet, it warned that growth of electronic 
commerce will wane unless shoppers trust that personal information 
will be kept private. ``I wouldn't want people selling information 
about which books I buy, or what records I buy,'' said Robert 
Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.

	Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 0.26  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended lower today, as technology stocks  
continued to slide. Shares of Internet brokerages and computer-chip 
makers posted the steepest declines, but every part of the 
high-tech sector was hit by the selloff. The Dow Jones industrial 
average closed down 0.26 points at 9,304.24. The 
technology-dominated Nasdaq stock market was lower throughout the 
day. An overall weakness in technology stocks was compounded by the 
chip makers, which some analysts expect to launch a price war as 
competition heats up between Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. The 
Nasdaq Composite Index was down 36.42 to 2,373.65.

	Clinton Turns to Small Enterprise  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton urged Congress today to more  
than double the government's support for small enterprises -- to $83 
million from the current $32 million. The money would go for 
technical and training assistance for organizations that support 
microenterprise, which typically includes businesses that employ 
five or fewer people and need less than $25,000 in credit to get up 
and running. Individuals launching such ventures often need basic 
technical help to succeed.

	Court Backs FCC in Wireless Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Friday backed the  
Federal Communications Commission's decision to auction certain 
wireless licenses to provide mobile phone, paging, voice mail and 
other services. Nextel Communications Inc., based in McLean, Va., 
was the biggest winner in that 1997 auction for these ``specialized 
mobile radio service'' licenses using frequencies in the 800 
megahertz band. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia upheld the FCC's decisions to auction these licenses and 
to eliminate installment payments for bidders to pay for them. 
Fresno Mobile Radio and SMR WON, a trade association representing 
companies that already held some of these licenses before the 
auction, argued, among other things, that the FCC had exceeded its 
authority by requiring that new licenses be auctioned.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission is  
looking into whether Bell Atlantic is complying with 
government-imposed requirements that paved the way for the 
company's takeover of another regional Bell telephone company, 
Nynex. Bell Atlantic has said it is abiding by the conditions, 
which aim to foster local phone competition. But long-distance 
companies MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T have complained to the FCC that the 
company isn't.

	CBS Has $1 Million Quarterly Loss  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. posted a $1 million fourth-quarter  
loss on severance payments to its former chief and losses from 
selling stakes in two cable networks. The figure follows an $861 
million profit from a year earlier on gains from selling industrial 
businesses. Excluding the one-time gains or costs in both periods, 
CBS posted stronger profits from continuing operations in the 
latest quarter. Growth in its radio and outdoor advertising 
business offset lower television results, despite the NFL's 
successful return to the CBS network. The profits from continuing 
operations exceeded Wall Street expectations.

	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- There was something missing at the  
170-year-old Oslo Stock Exchange today -- brokers. They're still 
trading, but now their transactions go through a fully computerized 
system put into service today. Norway's financial community 
collectively held its breath when trading opened for the first time 
on the often-delayed new computer system. But Bernt Bangstad, the 
exchange's spokesman, said there wasn't the slightest technical 
problem. Under the new system, traders sit at remote locations and 
place their buy or sell orders through the computer.

	Brazil IMF Vow May Worsen Economy  
</P>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Stock and currency values eroded  
further today due to investor skepticism over the lack of details 
in Brazil's new belt-tightening commitments to the International 
Monetary Fund. Analysts said they feared the deal to salvage an 
IMF-led loan package of $41.5 billion would hobble Latin America's 
dominant economy with higher interest rates, worsening unemployment 
and deeper recession. The United States fears that continued 
economic turmoil in Brazil could stifle growth elsewhere in a 
region that accounts for a major share of U.S. exports. On the 
currency market, the real slipped to 1.84 to the dollar before 
rallying to close at 1.82. It opened trading at 1.81 to the dollar.

<HEADLINE> American Still Seeks Reno Air Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines and its pilots were unable to  
reach an agreement Friday over whether the company can more quickly 
absorb Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law bars a strike over the issue, but pilots can refuse  
to volunteer for overtime, which could force the cancellation or 
delay of flights. The pilot union did not call for action. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots say AMR Corp., the parent of the nation's  
second-largest airline, has disregarded a contract since purchasing 
the low-cost carrier for $124 million by not immediately paying 
lower-paid Reno pilots at American Airlines' rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite our best efforts, we were unable to reach agreement,''  
said Allied Pilots Association president Rich LaVoy, adding that 
the union board will be available for talks throughout the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR took over Reno six weeks ago. Airline officials said it will  
take at least a year to retrain Reno pilots and to reconfigure the 
low-fare carrier's planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline and the pilots have had a prickly relationship for  
several years, resulting in a brief strike in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, pilots decided last summer against accepting overtime to  
protest a passenger-sharing deal AMR made with Canadian Airlines 
Corp. That job action resulted in more than 450 flights being 
canceled during the busy summer season. 
</P>
<P>
	If pilots refuse to volunteer for overtime this time around,  
company leaders expect fewer canceled flights than last year's 
protest because planes are less full in the winter.

<HEADLINE> Train Loaded With Bombs Derails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURNS CITY, Ind. (AP) -- Four railroad cars, two of which were  
loaded with bombs, derailed today outside a Navy base in southern 
Indiana. No one was injured, and there were no explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center said the  
assortment of bombs, demolition charges and propellant charges in 
the two flatbed cars posed no danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't view it as an explosive threat,'' said Army Col.  
Lawrence J. Sowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities evacuated some homes in Burns City as a precaution,  
but many residents chose to stay. State Road 645 was closed to 
traffic at U.S. 231. 
</P>
<P>
	The four flatbed cars derailed during a switching operation a  
half-mile outside the Crane base, said John Bergene, a spokesman 
for the Canadian Pacific Railway. The two cars with the bombs 
tipped over, spilling eight shipping containers on the ground, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the derailment was under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	Many residents of Burns City disregarded evacuation orders and  
stayed in town. They included William A. Strange, a 76-year-old 
Crane retiree, and his wife, Mary, who went to a nearby beauty 
parlor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came to the door and said it would be better if we left,  
but if we left we couldn't come back. Goodness knows how long that 
could be,'' Strange said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Canadian Pacific crew was en route to begin clearing the  
spilled explosives and hoped to begin work later today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was at least the second derailment involving hazardous cargo  
at or near the base. In June 1997, a tanker car containing sulfur 
dioxide was among four cars of a Canadian Pacific train that 
derailed inside the Burns City gate. 
</P>
<P>
	The base, about 75 miles southwest of Indianapolis, is the  
Navy's second-largest in the continental United States, covering 
98.2 square miles of Martin, Greene and Lawrence counties. It has a 
civilian workforce of more than 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army operates a facility called the Army Ammunition Activity  
within the base. 
</P>
<P>
	Operations at the base conduct research and development on  
weapons such as aerial bombs and other areas including alternative 
fuel cell technology and chemical and biological warfare detection.

<HEADLINE> S. California Plans Stadium Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON, Calif. (AP) -- The $165 million outlay for a proposed pro  
football stadium and shopping mall would be recovered from ticket, 
parking and property taxes, the City Council said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, to be announced Saturday, does not involve any  
additional taxes on Carson residents, the Daily Breeze of Torrance 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The forum at the Carson Community Center deals with the city's  
participation in the proposal by Hollywood executive Michael Ovitz 
to obtain an NFL expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz is vying with another Los Angeles area group and bidders  
from Houston, all hoping to win a franchise that would begin play 
in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 16, NFL owners are to consider the proposals, and a  
winner could be announced in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's financial aid package to help build the 77,400-seat  
mission-style Hacienda Stadium, at a site 15 miles south of 
downtown Los Angeles, includes $18 million in cash from Carson's 
Redevelopment Agency, according to an eight-page color brochure 
city officials created for Saturday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Carson would spend another $16 million to extend Del Amo  
Boulevard to the site by building a bridge over the nearby Harbor 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining Carson commitment for the $585 million Hacienda  
stadium and mall will be in the form of bonds, but the brochure 
does not specify what kind. 
</P>
<P>
	Councilman Daryl Sweeney said mall developer Herbert Glimcher  
anticipates the retail center will generate 3,200 permanent jobs 
and 2,000 temporary construction jobs for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest financial windfall would come if Carson holds the  
2002 Super Bowl, Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the city pledged up to $180 million in October to back the  
Ovitz bid, City Council members met some criticism from residents 
for not specifying how the money will be raised and recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Some last-minute changes were requested by the NFL's expansion  
committee, Sweeney said, when team owners reviewed Ovitz's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz has said the stadium, mall and franchise fee of $300  
million to $400 million to be paid to the NFL will total about $1 
billion. He would own 35 percent of the franchise.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Readies for Super Bowl 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- New Year's Eve 1999 won't be the party to end all  
parties -- at least not in Atlanta, where folks are already excited 
about the Super Bowl bash to come a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	``The enthusiasm, a year out, has been incredible,'' said Robert  
Dale Morgan, head of the Super Bowl host committee. ``Having the 
Falcons in the game (last Sunday) has really heightened it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Atlanta has already had one Super Bowl, the Jan. 30 2000  
game will follow the Falcons' first Super Bowl appearance in their 
33-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of local residents -- even people without game  
tickets -- went to Miami last weekend. And Atlanta-area bars and 
restaurants were packed on game day as many people were caught up 
for the first time in the hype, excitement and partying a Super 
Bowl week generates. 
</P>
<P>
	``People grasp a little more now how big a Super Bowl is and how  
fun it is, and really, how everybody can get involved,'' said 
Falcons spokesman Charlie Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan said transportation logistics are a top priority as the  
host committee prepares for next year. He noted that Atlanta's mass 
transit rail system can be used and that hotels, restaurants and 
night spots are all near the Georgia Dome site. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Sunday's Super Bowl, in which activities were scattered  
through a good part of south Florida, ``the compactness we have 
here in Atlanta'' will keep most fans in the same area during the 
week, Morgan said. Atlanta's location and its transportation links 
make it easily accessible to a large segment of Americans, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan estimates that hosting the game will inject $250 million  
into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Falcons, who have already topped their 1998  
season-ticket total with about 35,000 sold for 1999, have a chance 
to make not only franchise history but NFL history if they reach 
the Super Bowl again. No host city's team has ever had its own team 
in the Super Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Pressured Over Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Pressure is growing for Brazil to  
announce new belt-tightening measures swiftly to prevent further 
damage to its frail economy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a day after the government and the International  
Monetary Fund announced that Brazil would move to make new savings, 
stock and currency values eroded. 
</P>
<P>
	The series of measures will help ensure that Brazil receives all  
of a $41.5 billion financial aid package from the IMF and other 
international lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders and analysts said uncertainty about what the  
measures would be triggered a decline on the Sao Paulo stock 
exchange, where share prices closed down 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need specifics,'' said Thomas Taterka, a head trader at Sao  
Paulo's Banco Cidade. ``International investors are still 
completely absent from Brazil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The real also slipped Friday, to 1.84 to the dollar, before  
rallying to close at 1.82. It had opened at 1.81. Brazil's currency 
has depreciated 34 percent since Jan. 13, when the government first 
moved to let it float freely on world exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's Finance Minister had said Thursday that the government  
was discussing ``new policy initiatives'' but did not elaborate. He 
ruled out announcing them within days. 
</P>
<P>
	Market analysts fear the government will make heavy spending  
cuts and tax hikes that will hobble the economy with higher 
interest rates, worse unemployment and deeper recession. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Deputy Director Stanley Fischer has said the ``critical  
issue'' was for the government to control inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Other key targets include a public debt of less than 46.5  
percent of GDP and a budget surplus of 3 percent of GDP by the end 
of 1999. The government is to reach its surplus target two years 
sooner than under a previous plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Marcio Pochmann of the University of Campinas said GDP  
will probably shrink by as much as 3.5 percent and that inflation 
could reach 10 percent in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Brazilians fear the return of inflation, which plunged from  
about 2,700 percent in 1993, when the government pegged the real to 
the dollar, to just 2 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pochmann also said the number of unemployed in Brazil -- 6.6  
million last year -- could jump to more than 10 million this year.

<HEADLINE> Internet Provider Closes Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- An Internet service provider shut down an  
anti-abortion Web site that an Oregon jury said constituted a 
threat to abortion providers. 
</P>
<P>
	The move Thursday night came a day after the creator of the Web  
site, Neal Horsley, said he planned to add video cameras at 
abortion clinics in five American cities as well as in England and 
Japan to monitor activities for the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site includes the names and addresses of abortion  
doctors and features photos of mangled fetuses and drawings of 
dripping blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Three times, doctors whose names appeared on the list were  
killed, most recently last October when Dr. Barnett Slepian was 
gunned down by sniper fire in his home outside Buffalo, N.Y. His 
name on the Web site was crossed out that same day. 
</P>
<P>
	MindSpring, which provided the Internet space for the Web site,  
said it shut it down for violating ``our appropriate use 
policies,'' spokesman Serge Clermont said Friday. ``We can't go 
into the details why because of the privacy of our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the violations listed on MindSpring's Web site is one  
prohibiting ``threats of bodily harm or destruction of property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pathway Communications, which has maintained the site, said in a  
statement that ``The Nuremberg Files'' site was knocked off-line 
without notice Thursday night. The company said it was informed 
Friday that it violated MindSpring's policy on ``threatening and 
harassing language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horsley called the move a ``temporary setback.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We feel privileged to take each and every lick and setback as  
they come, because the challenges only strengthen us in our resolve 
to present the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth 
about legalized abortion,'' according to the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury ruled Tuesday that the site constituted a threat  
to abortion providers and awarded the plaintiffs $107 million in 
damages. The plaintiffs said their next step would be to get an 
injunction shutting the site down.

<HEADLINE> Mir's Mirror Experiment Called Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian officials scrapped the Mir space station's  
much-hyped space mirror experiment today after the shiny metal 
object got stuck and failed to properly unfurl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mir crew sent the mirror, attached to a cargo ship filled  
with trash, into the earth's atmosphere this afternoon. After 
mostly burning up during re-entry, the husk dropped harmlessly into 
the Pacific Ocean, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure was a big disappointment for Russia's struggling  
space agency, which had billed the project as a display of its 
ability to conduct pioneering, ambitious projects despite a lack of 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror was supposed to work like an artificial moon,  
reflecting a beam of sunlight across the earth. But its petal-like 
segments failed to unfold Thursday after a deployment mechanism 
jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror, which was to reach 83 feet in diameter when fully  
extended, was attached to a Progress cargo ship and jettisoned 
Thursday from the Mir. Cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei 
Avdeyev then sent a remote command to unfold the mirror, made of a 
thin membrane covered with a silver metal layer. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror started rotating, and a system of weights and strings  
began to pull out the thin membranes on the flower-like structure. 
But the deployment mechanism jammed and the mirror stopped 
spinning. 
</P>
<P>
	Exasperated crew and ground controllers struggled for hours to  
fix the hitch, and even got the mirror rotating again by shaking it 
with repeated blasts of the cargo ship's jets -- only to see it stop 
a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, when it became clear that the mirror would not unfurl,  
Mission Control gave up on the experiment. By this afternoon, they 
still didn't know exactly why the mirror failed to unfurl. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mood here is very depressed,'' said Valery Lyndin, a  
spokesman for the Mission Control. ``The failure was especially 
painful because of huge worldwide interest that the experiment 
aroused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have forgotten the old principle of Russian space programs  
-- to do something first and boast about it only after,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Mission Control chief Vladimir Solovyov said another space  
mirror is sitting ready on earth, but the Znamya (Banner) 
experiment will not be repeated because there is no place for the 
object in upcoming cargo launches. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials did not rule out that the project would be  
retried on the future 16-nation international space station. That 
station is expected to be finished in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the experiment gone smoothly, the mirror would have shone  
light on a spot about 5 miles in diameter in a number of regions in 
the former Soviet Union, Germany and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	People looking at the correct sector of the night sky would have  
seen the mirror as an immobile pinpoint of light, only slightly 
brighter or larger than an ordinary star, for about 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian space experts hoped the mirror would serve as a  
prototype for much larger models that could illuminate sun-starved 
northern cities through the long Arctic night and spotlight 
disaster areas. They also dreamed of futuristic spaceships that 
would glide through space using similar structures as `sails' to 
catch solar wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics warn that both projects would require far bigger  
mirrors, which would be extremely difficult to unfold and maneuver.

<HEADLINE> Petr Korda Banned From Czech Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Petr Korda, who tested positive  
for a steroid at Wimbledon, was banned Friday by the Czech Tennis 
Association from playing in his home country for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czechs earlier had unsuccessfully demanded suspension of  
Korda, who escaped punishment from the International Tennis 
Federation when an ITF appeals panel accepted his explanation that 
he didn't know how the steroid Nandrolone got into his system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech federation suspension will have little effect on Korda  
since he gave up Davis Cup play for the Czech Republic last year 
and seldom appears at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Korda remains free to play anywhere else in the  
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a paradoxical situation,'' Czech Tennis Association  
chairman Karel Papousek told the Czech news agency CTK. ``ITF has 
its own policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our decision is based on the fact that we are signatories to  
the international agreements against doping.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson Sentenced to Jail for Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was  
sentenced to a year in jail today for assaulting two motorists 
after a traffic accident. The decision could lead to another 
sentence for violating parole in Indiana and places Tyson's boxing 
career in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson ``repeatedly speaks and acts compulsively and violently,''  
Judge Stephen Johnson said after a three-hour hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson handed Tyson a two-year sentence but suspended one year.  
The judge fined Tyson $5,000 and sentenced him to two years 
probation after his release from jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was taken away in handcuffs after the sentence was  
pronounced. His wife, Monica, was in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana authorities must now decide whether the 32-year-old  
fighter violated his probation for a 1991 rape conviction. Tyson 
was released in 1995 after serving three years of a six-year 
sentence, and his probation was set to expire in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence could also lead to a review of Tyson's boxing  
license by the Nevada Athletic Commission, which reinstated the 
fighter in October after a one-year suspension for biting Evander 
Holyfield's ear during a fight in June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, 32, kicked one motorist and punched another after a minor  
three-car accident in Gaithersburg, Md., on Aug. 31. In December, 
Tyson pleaded no contest--meaning he neither protested the charges 
nor admitted guilt. He could have received up to 20 years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The two victims, Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick, settled  
out of court, and were in favor of Tyson receiving no jail time. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor, Montgomery County State's Attorney Douglas  
Gansler, wanted Tyson behind bars, but was hampered by a plea 
agreement negotiated by his predecessor, Robert Dean. Dean had said 
he would recommend no jail time in return for the no contest plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler's memo to the judge called Tyson ``nothing less than a  
time bomb.'' Gansler detailed Tyson's 1991 rape conviction in 
Indiana, seven brushes with the law as a juvenile, and the infamous 
fight in which Tyson bit off part of Holyfield's ear. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was suspended from boxing for one year after the Holyfield  
incident. He returned to the ring last month, defeating Francois 
Botha last month in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	His next fight is tentatively set for April 24 in Las Vegas,  
against a yet-to-be-named opponent.

<HEADLINE>  Is Chelsea Clinton a Public Figure? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Clinton gushed about the time his  
daughter, Chelsea, asked if unmarried girls can have babies. 
Hillary Rodham Clinton chimed in, laughing, about Chelsea's plea to 
have her ears pierced. 
</P>
<P>
	That was 1992, in the heat of their first run for the White  
House, when the Clintons invited People magazine into their 
backyard for a cozy family photo shoot and extensive interview. 
</P>
<P>
	This is 1999, in the denouement of the crisis sparked by  
President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, when a similarly 
flattering People cover story -- ``Hillary &AMP; Chelsea: Grace under 
fire. An intimate look at the deep bond of love'' -- set the White 
House into an icy stew. 
</P>
<P>
	Press secretary Joe Lockhart, peppered with questions Thursday  
about an unusual statement from the president and first lady 
prefacing the release today of the 8-page magazine feature, refused 
even to entertain the question about whether Chelsea is, as People 
managing editor Carol Wallace called her, ``a valid journalistic 
subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We deeply regret and are profoundly saddened by the decision  
of People,'' the president and Mrs. Clinton in an official 
statement late Wednesday after their personal appeals to the 
magazine failed to kill the story. The White House refused to 
elaborate on those contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Media watchdogs cried foul.  
</P>
<P>
	``Chelsea is becoming fair game,'' said Marvin Kalb, director of  
Harvard's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public 
Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	From a gawky 12-year-old in braces to poised college student at  
Stanford University, Chelsea, nearly 19, has emerged as a sort of 
semipublic figure -- traveling on overseas missions, working the 
crowds alongside her parents, turning up in front of news cameras 
to hold her father's hand when the political stakes last year 
became critical. 
</P>
<P>
	So why the fuss over an article that, in trying to illustrate a  
close family bond, recalls slumber parties, messages from ``Mommy'' 
to Chelsea's elementary school and a beach picnic where Chelsea, 
unasked, draped her jacket around her mother's shivering shoulders? 
</P>
<P>
	``Chelsea has not taken on a public role,'' the Clintons said in  
their appeal meant to hold back the floodgates on coverage of their 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest People story follows sensational tabloid cover  
stories last year on Chelsea's breakup with her college boyfriend. 
But it is no more intrusive and no less flattering than the story 
the Clintons sanctioned in 1992, when they offered up everything 
from Chelsea's favorite TV sitcoms to her morning routine. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference between then and now? ``Nothing has changed, from  
Mrs. Clinton's point of view,'' said her spokeswoman, Marsha Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kalb and others point to vivid images from the past year  
that suggest mixed messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after Ms. Lewinsky burst into headlines last year,  
Chelsea flew 3,000 miles home from Stanford, where she was then a 
freshman. Photographs of her and Dad arm-in-arm departing for the 
Camp David presidential retreat helped bolster his initial denials 
of any marital wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven months later, she linked hands with both parents and --  
again before a bank of cameras -- held husband and wife together the 
day after Clinton publicly confessed his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chelsea is now being used to convey an image and the line then  
becomes more and more difficult to draw between what is 
journalistically acceptable and what is self-protective for family 
reasons,'' Kalb said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the coverage unfortunate. But journalism professor  
George Reedy, who was press secretary to President Lyndon Johnson, 
saw a public benefit to knowing the private lives of presidents and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the very important things the press must do is give the  
public a picture of what the man is really like -- what his 
personality is, is he honest, is he smart. And people are reflected 
in their children,'' Reedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a mirror the Clintons, unlike their predecessors, have  
tightly cloaked since the '92 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to answer any questions about her,'' Mrs.  
Clinton firmly told CNN's Larry King when he asked in 1996 whether 
Chelsea was dating. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea has never been interviewed, although reporters have been  
invited to off-the-record dinners with her during foreign trips. 
She only has spoken in public overseas, in roundtable discussions 
with other young people.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Prosecutor La Bella Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The federal prosecutor who led the  
investigation of President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign will 
leave the U.S. Attorney's office in May to work for an 
international investigative company. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles La Bella accepted a job with Decision Strategies/Fairfax  
International, the New York City-based company said in a news 
release Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	La Bella, 47, has said that he decided to resign after Attorney  
Janet Reno and her top deputy Eric Holder apparently lost 
confidence in him. Reno rebuffed La Bella's call for a special 
prosecutor to investigate possible fund-raising improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
	``After being a public servant for so many years it's tough to  
leave, but the circumstances dictated that I leave,'' La Bella 
said. ``I'm basically going from one dream job to another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Bella was named by Reno to the interim post after Alan Bersin  
resigned last spring to become San Diego schools superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	La Bella said the final straw was when Reno and Holder said they  
were planning to ask the federal court to replace him as interim 
U.S. attorney with Gregory Vega, a 12-year veteran of the U.S. 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	A 16-year-veteran of U.S. attorney's offices in New York and San  
Diego, La Bella will leave his post as the interim head of the 
Southern District of California on May 3 and continue living in San 
Diego.

<HEADLINE> Former Nursing Home Aide Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOWSON, Md. (AP) -- A former nursing home aide convicted of  
manslaughter faces up to 45 years in prison after a judge also 
found her guilty of cashing monthly checks sent to her elderly 
patient long after the woman died. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Thomas was convicted Thursday of manslaughter, abuse of  
a vulnerable adult, and two counts of felony theft -- for continuing 
to cash Marion Cusimano's $1,500 in monthly checks for 14 months 
after the woman died. 
</P>
<P>
	The state medical examiner had ruled that Ms. Cusimano, 66, died  
of neglect and malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore County prosecutors had sought a second-degree murder  
conviction from Circuit Judge John Grason Turnbull II, who ruled in 
the non-jury trial. They planned to seek the maximum 45-year prison 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is much more than neglect, this is a case where there's  
an extreme indifference to human life,'' Assistant State's Attorney 
James Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Stephen L. Miles said he was pleased with the  
manslaughter conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the best light, my client is guilty of some distasteful  
things,'' Miles said. ``My argument is she was not guilty of first- 
or second-degree murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cusimano had lived with Mrs. Thomas and her husband, Ronald,  
since 1993, when she left Ivy Hall Geriatric and Rehabilitation 
Center. Mrs. Thomas had worked at Ivy Hall as an aide, but later 
was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the home where Ms. Cusimano lived with the  
Thomases smelled of excrement, and that Mrs. Thomas ignored the 
elderly woman's pleas for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also said that social workers noted signs of  
possible financial exploitation, but those complaints were 
dismissed after Ms. Cusimano denied anyone was taking advantage of 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim's decayed body was discovered in April by Ronald  
Thomas, who claimed he found her beneath blankets in her bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who was not charged in the case, told police that  
neither he nor his wife had spoken to the elderly woman since June 
1997.

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Career on Brink of Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Sports Analysis    	
</P>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson's career was teetering even before a  
Maryland judge sent him to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's on the brink of collapse as he heads into his third  
enforced absence from boxing since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who once terrorized the heavyweight ranks is beset by  
problems both inside and outside the ring, leading some to question 
whether his future will be as a contender or a mere curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's pretty much history,'' veteran promoter Bob Arum  
said. ``It may very well be we've seen the last of Tyson as a major 
fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exposed by Francois Botha only a few weeks ago as a rusty and  
aging fighter, Tyson's skills figure to deteriorate even further if 
he spends his 33rd birthday in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also the possibility of further prison time in Indiana  
if a judge revokes his parole. And Nevada boxing authorities now 
seem a bit embarrassed that they ever gave him his license back 
last October after revoking it for biting Evander Holyfield's ears. 
</P>
<P>
	That's important in itself because the same commissioners who he  
told he did not hit anyone following the Maryland traffic accident 
will be the ones deciding whether he can box again upon his release 
from jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime at this point that he would be taken out of the ring  
would be a real death sentence,'' said Shelly Finkel, Tyson's 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Tyson isn't imprisoned again and is allowed to fight  
once more, there are real questions about how much fight he still 
has left in him. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighter whose mere presence intimidated most opponents in  
his heyday is long gone, dealt a final blow by two losses to 
Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has slipped so much that Botha was taunting him in the  
ring and easily outboxing him before Tyson landed a single right 
hand that temporarily, it turns out, rescued his latest comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's shot,'' former heavyweight champion Larry Holmes said.  
``That fight (against Botha), he had the mindset, but nothing was 
happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's ability to sell tickets may also be slipping, even  
though the fight with Botha did enough business for him to make 
some $20 million. The pay-per-view sales were half what they were 
for his first comeback fight against Peter McNeeley, and the MGM 
Grand hotel-casino had to give away a few thousand tickets to fill 
up the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an indication Tyson's act is wearing thin, even on his  
devoted fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were fascinated with his whole story, and there was  
this whole Tyson phenomenon,'' Arum said. ``But that is pretty much 
gone now, and people really don't care about him any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was supposed to fight again April 24, against an unnamed  
opponent at the MGM Grand. That fight is in jeopardy, even if Tyson 
gets out of jail on bond and files an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada boxing commissioners, who took Tyson at his word when he  
said he didn't hit anyone in Maryland, were upset at his no-contest 
plea. They don't figure to let him fight again without, at the very 
least, another disciplinary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Maryland situation was one of the main things influencing  
my vote,'' said Dr. James Nave, the lone commission member who 
voted against Tyson's relicensing Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	At the hearing, Tyson was asked specifically if he had hit or  
kicked anyone in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	His answer was meandering, but at two different points he denied  
the altercation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not have done that,'' he told commissioners. ``No,  
sir, I did not do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boxers generally lose their skills as they get older, and Tyson  
appears to be no exception. Inactivity can even be worse, and Tyson 
will now be going on this third enforced absence from the sport in 
less than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has fought only seven times in the last eight years, and  
was coming off a 19-month absence from the ring against Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse yet, Tyson's psyche is still very fragile, as evidenced by  
his boorish behavior before the Botha fight and a report by a team 
of Boston psychiatrists who found him to be depressed and lacking 
in self esteem. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes is certainly no psychiatrist, but he has an insight into  
what makes a champion in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It finishes him,'' Holmes said. ``It doesn't finish him  
physically, but it finishes him mentally.''

<HEADLINE> Utah Seeks Olympic Committe Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Gov. Mike Leavitt confirmed Friday that he  
has met with Mitt Romney, the Boston businessman widely considered 
the front runner in the search for a new Olympic committee leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a universally held view that he's an able guy.  
Whether he's willing to do this or not is not something we can 
answer,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a ways to go before anyone is announced.''  
</P>
<P>
	Romney has declined comment on whether he would leave his  
lucrative venture capital company, Bain Capital Inc., and move 
full-time to Utah, where his family has roots. Romney owns a second 
home in Park City. 
</P>
<P>
	He reportedly visited Utah last weekend and met with Leavitt and  
other SLOC board members, then traveled with Leavitt to a speaking 
engagement in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told the Deseret News on Friday that  
Romney is interested in the job and will likely take it. ``I think 
we can get him,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know him well. He would be a tremendous asset to Utah and  
the Olympics,'' Hatch said. ``He would be the person who could pull 
us out of this mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, the son of former Michigan Gov. George Romney, is best  
known as the Republican who gave Sen. Ted Kennedy a scare in his 
successful 1994 reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney graduated from Brigham Young University and from Harvard  
with law and business degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, Leavitt said, it will be up to the Salt Lake  
Organizing Committee's board of trustees to decide who is the next 
chief executive officer and president. 
</P>
<P>
	The quest for a new leader began Jan. 8 when Frank Joklik  
resigned, along with Senior Vice President Dave Johnson amid the 
burgeoning Olympic scandal. Joklik remains on the job until a new 
chief is found, and says he resigned to separate the committee's 
past from its future. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigations have revealed that Salt Lake's bid committee gave  
more than $1 million in cash, free medical care, travel and 
scholarships to International Olympic Committee members or their 
relatives before the 1995 IOC vote giving Salt Lake the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan Karras, Leavitt's representative on the SLOC executive  
committee, said Romney is one of four or five candidates being 
considered for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC board of trustees has two meetings next week. It will  
receive the report of its ethics panel, which has been 
investigating the bid spending, on Tuesday, and is expected to 
discuss that and a board reorganization proposal on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said he has not been briefed on the ethics panel's work,  
but is cautious about overselling it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have not had subpoena power. They have not been able to  
talk with everyone. I've been told that there are some who have 
just been unwilling to meet with them because of the Justice 
Department probe so I suspect there will be some facts that will 
not be available to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said he's disappointed the IOC report beat Salt  
Lake to the punch by more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the world knows the IOC got all their information from  
us -- almost all of it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Offers Support to NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Macedonian Prime Minister Ljupco Georgijevski  
says his country is prepared to expand its role as a NATO staging 
area if the alliance decides to deploy peacekeeping forces in 
neighboring Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO already uses Macedonia as a base for aerial surveillance of  
Kosovo and for a security force to protect its 2,000 ground 
observers in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it is debating sending peacekeeping forces into the region,  
where ethnic Albanians are agitating for independence from Serbia. 
Georgijevski said Friday that ``we have provided logistical support 
in the past and we are prepared to do so in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With peace talks on Kosovo beginning Saturday in France, he  
called for a quick solution ``by way of dialogue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the National Press Club, Georgijevski said most of  
his conversation on Thursday with Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright concerned Kosovo. He also met Wednesday with Defense 
Secretary William Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgijevski said Albright also expressed her concern about  
Macedonia's decision to recognize Taiwan, saying it might cause 
problems at the United Nations when it came time to extend the 
mandate of 1,000 U.N. soldiers deployed along his country's 
volatile borders. 
</P>
<P>
	China, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has  
warned Macedonia it might end support for the U.N. mission unless 
the government withdraws its decision to recognize Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgijevski said China was putting pressure on Macedonia to do  
this ``but the decision of the government is clear and we do not 
intend to reverse it at this time. We'll find a way out of this 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He defended the decision last month to recognize Taiwan, saying  
businessmen from the island would build factories in Macedonia and 
help reduce its high unemployment rate. 
</P>
<P>
	A Taipei newspaper reported Sunday that Taiwan has promised  
Macedonia more than $300 million for its decision to establish 
diplomatic ties, but a Taiwan government official denied this. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter that was handed to Georgijevski during a visit to  
Capitol Hill Wednesday, eight members of members of House's 
Albanian issues caucus welcomed an amnesty bill passed by the 
Macedonian parliament that included release from prison of two 
ethnic Albanian mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers called on Georgijevski's government to take steps  
to further integrate the Albanians into Macedonia by making them 
part of the police force in the western part of Macedonia where 
most of the Balkan nation's 550,000 Albanians live. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was signed by Reps. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y.; Christopher  
Smith, R-N.J.; Michael Forbes, R-N.Y.; Donald Payne, D-N.J.; Peter 
King, R-N.Y.; Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif.; Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and 
James McGovern, D-Mass.

<HEADLINE> Magic Signs Dominique Wilkins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The Orlando Magic don't need a ``Human  
Highlight Film.'' They'll settle for Dominique Wilkins being a 
consistent scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-time All-Star signed with Orlando and was in uniform  
for Friday night's season opener against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dominique brings us veteran leadership, as well as depth at  
the small forward position,'' general manager John Gabriel said. 
``He is a skilled perimeter shooter and has had a storybook career. 
We look forward to his contributions in a Magic uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins, 39, is the NBA's eighth career leading scorer with  
26,534 points in 14 seasons. He spent part of last season in Italy 
and last played in the NBA two years ago with the San Antonio 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte Hornets, who have lost two starters to injuries,  
also pursued Wilkins and were offering more playing time. But the 
Magic were able to offer the same money -- the $1 million minimum 
salary for veterans with at least 10 years experience -- plus a 
chance to play with younger brother, Gerald. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilkins duo is the NBA's career leading brother scoring  
tandem with 38,268 points before Friday night's game. Dominique is 
also reunited with former teammate Tree Rollins, an assistant coach 
who sold him on the idea of signing with Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins said he nearly signed with Charlotte before his brother  
and Rollins made their push on behalf of the Magic, who wanted to 
add another scoring option to Penny Hardaway, Nick Anderson and Ike 
Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I can do is take pressure off Penny and the other guys,''  
Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still do all the things I've always done. I just pick my  
spots when I do it. But my game is still there. People ask how much 
I still have in the tank. It isn't a question of what I have left. 
It's a question of producing and being productive. And I've always 
been productive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins appeared in nine straight All-Star games from 1996-1994  
and was an All-NBA first team after averaging 30.3 points per game. 
Except for the two years Michael Jordan took off to play baseball, 
Wilkins is the last player other than Jordan to lead the league in 
scoring.

<HEADLINE> Sneaker Co. Nixes Super Bowl Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sneaker retailer Just for Feet Inc. scrapped  
plans to keep running its Super Bowl commercial that showed a 
barefoot African marathon runner who was tracked down like an 
animal and tricked into wearing shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to shelve the ad after only one showing illustrates  
the unexpected risks involved when advertisers try to rise above 
the crowd on the premiere annual event for Madison Avenue as well 
as the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Birmingham, Ala.-based shoe store chain made its first Super  
Bowl appearance last Sunday and had hoped to run the same 
commercial on other programs for about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Harold Ruttenberg, chairman and chief executive, said the ad  
won't run again because of criticism of how a runner is treated in 
the commercial that was intended to celebrate the retailer's 
passion for protecting feet. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time an advertiser has scrapped plans to keep  
running an ad after a splashy Super Bowl debut. Holiday Inn dropped 
an ad it ran on the telecast two years ago after some complained 
about its use of a transsexual to draw attention to the hotel 
chain's makeover. 
</P>
<P>
	The Just for Feet commercial showed a four-member ``search and  
rescue'' team tracking a Kenyan runner in a Humvee as he trained 
over rugged terrain. 
</P>
<P>
	The trackers found his footprint, and drove ahead to offer a cup  
of water laced with a knockout drug as he passed by. Shortly after 
he drank it, the runner staggered and fell on his back. While he 
lay unconscious, the trackers put sneakers on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The runner cried ``No'' when he awoke with shoes and he appeared  
to be trying to kick them off as he jogged away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're Just for Feet -- to preserve and protect feet,'' a  
narrator said as the ad ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad drew mixed reviews. USA Today's Super Bowl Ad Meter  
panelists ranked it in the middle of the pack of the 52 commercials 
that ran in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But critic Bob Garfield wrote in the trade magazine Advertising  
Age that it was ``the worst spot on the Super Bowl'' and called it 
``probably racist'' and ``certainly condescending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Have these people lost their minds?'' he wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	The ad was created by the Rochester, N.Y., office of the  
advertising agency Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency spokesman Michael Traphagan said it was intended as a  
humorous takeoff on how Just for Feet employees can be so 
passionate about their jobs that they sometimes ``do the wrong 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruttenberg faulted himself for failing to take a closer look at  
the finished commercial before it ran. He said he was unaware it 
showed the trackers drugging the runner's water and thought the 
ending would have shown the runner smiling about how the shoes 
felt. 
</P>
<P>
	He vigorously denied the ad was racist. He said the ad depicted  
a Kenyan because Kenyans have been marathon champions many times in 
recent years. He said the trackers included a Hispanic man and 
black woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea was to put shoes on his feet and show him how good  
these shoes felt,'' the Just for Feet founder said. ``In hindsight, 
the critics may very well be correct. But it was not the way we saw 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just for Feet, founded 23 years ago with a single store in  
Birmingham, Ala., has about 330 stores nationwide with 1998 sales 
of $775 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Was the Super Bowl money wasted? Ad time in the game sold for an  
average of $1.6 million for each half-minute commercial -- three 
times the price for top-rated regular series in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruttenberg said it was too early to tell. The company ran a  
sweepstakes tied to the Super Bowl ad and offered a Humvee to the 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Saatchi's Traphagan said there were 2.5 million responses by  
phone or computer to the contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we have gone a long way in putting Just for Feet in  
people's minds,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Auburn Buys Out of FSU Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn's football season opener won't be  
Bowden vs. Bowden or even Tommy Tuberville vs. Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	The school has opted to pay $500,000 rather than face Florida  
State, the team coached by the father of ousted Auburn coach Terry 
Bowden. The move will actually cost Auburn $1 million since it will 
lose a $500,000 guaranteed payment from Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn athletic director David Housel said Friday he knows it is  
a controversial decision, but now that Terry Bowden is no longer 
Auburn's coach, playing against Bobby Bowden's Seminoles isn't too 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will catch a lot of heat and criticism the next few  
weeks,'' Housel said, ``some of it fair, some of it unfair, but 
after that we can get on with our football program. This was an 
institutional decision, not just an athletic decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Bowden, who said just two days ago the Sept. 2 game would  
go on, told The Mobile Register on Friday that he was unaware of 
the game being called off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing that Auburn hasn't contacted us about it,'' he  
said. ``We had to juggle our conference schedule. We did this five 
years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State athletic director David Hart said Friday he  
received no formal notice of Auburn's decision. He said a voice 
mail message was left on his home answering machine Friday night 
that said Housel ``was instructed to send me a fax informing me of 
this decision. And if he did, it was sometime after 5:20 p.m. 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said he would not comment until he received proper  
notification and talks with the conference commissioner, television 
partners and others affected by the action. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn's season opener against Florida State was scheduled to be  
televised on ESPN. Under the contract, Auburn could buy out the 
game by paying $500,000 to Florida State. Housel said Auburn could 
recoup the payment by scheduling a seventh home game at Jordan-Hare 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``ESPN is aware of and is understanding our situation,'' Housel  
said. ``ESPN has been working since November to help us find a 
solution that was mutually agreeable to all concerned, but it 
didn't work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Housel said if the game was played, the controversy surrounding  
the game and the turmoil of last season would be rehashed again and 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The controversy would become bigger than the game, and that  
would be unfair to the players and coaches on both sides,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to back out of the game doesn't necessarily mean  
the schools will never face off again, Housel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to keep the contract with Florida State intact,  
just move it back a few years so that the personal controversies 
can die down a bit, but that will be Florida State's call,'' he 
said. ``This is not about Florida State. It is about the turmoil 
and controversy that would surround this year's game, and this 
year's game only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Bowden, who won his first 20 games after taking the reins  
at Auburn in 1993, resigned after the Tigers started the 1998 
season with a 1-5 record. He said he was fired, but Housel and 
other university officials have said he was not forced to resign. 
Tuberville was named the new head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn reached a financial settlement with Terry Bowden on  
Monday, which bans the former Tigers coach and his wife from 
criticizing the school.

<HEADLINE> Reluctant Witnesses Friends to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In need of friends to help him through the  
impeachment crisis, President Clinton could have done a lot worse 
than Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	After many grueling sessions with Kenneth Starr's prosecutors,  
all three witnesses gave almost no new information to House 
managers who were trying to change the course of Clinton's Senate 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In her seventh month as a prosecution witness against Clinton,  
Ms. Lewinsky testified that he was a president she respected and 
admired. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal recalled Clinton's demeanor a year ago when the  
Lewinsky scandal erupted: ``I thought he was a man in anguish,'' 
Blumenthal said of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	And Jordan made few concessions.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``may have asked'' about the job search for Ms. Lewinsky  
in the same conversation when Jordan was reporting to the president 
about the former intern signing an affidavit in the Paula Jones 
case, Jordan testified. 
</P>
<P>
	But the president's friend emphasized that there was no linkage  
between the job search and the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``had been concerned about her getting employment in New  
York, period,'' said Jordan. ``I don't know that'' her signing the 
affidavit was a ``concern'' to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	In her Jan. 7, 1998, affidavit, a document first suggested by  
Clinton in a middle-of-the-night phone call to Ms. Lewinsky three 
weeks earlier, the former White House intern denied having had 
sexual relations with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you still respect the president, still admire the  
president?'' House manager Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., asked Ms. 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' Ms. Lewinsky replied.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do you still appreciate what he is doing for this country as  
the president?'' Bryant asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' she replied.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the lines of inquiry focused on Blumenthal's contacts  
with the news media. House managers were trying to prove that 
Blumenthal fed reporters Clinton's account of Ms. Lewinsky being 
known as a ``stalker.'' Blumenthal denied passing along the 
derogatory information. 
</P>
<P>
	He even put off journalists who asked him about her, Blumenthal  
insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal said a journalist ``asked me my views, and I told  
him, in no uncertain terms, that I wouldn't talk about her 
personally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked about Monica Lewinsky with all sorts of people, my  
mother, my friends, about what was in the news stories every day, 
just like everyone else, but when it came to talking about her 
personally, I drew a line.''

<HEADLINE> 5th-Grader Busted for Selling Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDDLETOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- An 11-year-old boy was charged with  
selling marijuana and fake crack to his fifth-grade classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Students told a teacher at Maple Hill Elementary School on  
Wednesday that the boy had been distributing small amounts of 
marijuana and clumps of bar soap passed off as crack. 
</P>
<P>
	``Best case scenario is it's limited to five or six kids,''  
Middletown Superintendent Robert Sigler said. ``Worst case 
scenario, it's as many as 20 or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was released to his mother pending an appearance Feb. 12  
in Orange County Family Court. He was charged with criminal sale of 
marijuana and the sale of an imitation controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
	State Police Investigator Michael DeWitt said police are still  
trying to determine how the boy obtained the marijuana. He said the 
boy had mixed the small amount of marijuana with oregano to try to 
make more money. 
</P>
<P>
	Middletown is 55 miles northwest of New York City.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Jordan Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts of Vernon Jordan's deposition testimony from Feb. 2:  
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutor Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.: You have  
testified, I believe, five times previously before the federal 
grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And so I know that probably about every question  
that could be asked has been asked, but there are a number of 
reasons I want to go over additional questions with you, and some 
of them will be repetitious of what's been asked before. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to coming in today, though, have you had the opportunity  
to review your prior testimony in those five appearances before the 
grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I have done some preparation, congressman.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And let me start with the fact that the oath that  
you took today is the same as the oath that you took before the 
federal grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe that's correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And, Mr. Jordan, what is your profession?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I am a lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And how is it that you are able to obtain enough  
business for 800 lawyers? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I don't think that's my entire responsibility. I'm just  
one of 800 lawyers, and that is what I do in part, but I'm not 
alone in that process of making rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: When you say 'making rain,' that's the terminology  
of being a rainmaker? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I think even in Arkansas, you understand what rainmaking  
is. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: We've read Grisham books.  
</P>
<P>
	And so, when you say making rain or being a rainmaker, that is  
to bring in business so that you can keep the lawyers busy 
practicing law? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, that is -- that is part and parcel of the practice  
of law. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: When you did bill by the hour, what was your  
billable rate the last time you had to do that? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe my billable rate at the last time was  
somewhere between $450 and $500 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, would you describe --  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Not bad for a Georgia boy. I'm from Georgia. You've  
heard of that state, I'm sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: It's probably not bad from Washington standards.  
Would you describe the nature of your relationship with President 
Clinton? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: President Clinton has been a friend of mine since  
approximately 1973, when I came to your state, Arkansas, to make a 
speech as president of the National Urban League about race and 
equal opportunity in our nation, and we met then and there, and our 
friendship has grown and developed and matured and he is my friend 
and will continue to be my friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And just to further elaborate on that friendship,  
it's my understanding that he and his -- and the first lady has had 
Christmas Eve dinner with you and your family for a number of 
years? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Every year since his presidency, the Jordan family has  
been privileged to entertain the Clinton family on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And has there been any exceptions in recent years to  
that? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Every year that he has been president, he has had, he  
and his family, Christmas Eve with my family. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And have you vacationed together with the Clinton  
family? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes. I think you have seen reels of us playing golf and  
having fun at Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And so you vacation together, you play golf together  
on a semi-regular basis? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Whenever we can. We've not been doing it recently, for  
reasons that I think are probably very obvious to you, counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Well, explain that to me.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Just what I said, for a time, I was going before the  
grand jury, and under the advice of counsel and I'm sure under 
advice of the president's counsel, it was thought best that we not 
play golf together. So, from the time that I first went to the 
grand jury, I don't think -- we have not played golf this year, 
unfortunately, together. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Have you had any private conversations with the  
president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes, I have, as a matter of fact.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And has this been on the telephone or in person?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I've talked to him on the telephone, and I talked to him  
at the Vineyard. He was at my house on Christmas Eve. There were a 
lot of people around, but, yes, I've talked to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you discuss your testimony before the grand  
jury or his testimony before the grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I did not.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: If I understand your question about whether or not the  
president of the United States and I talked about my testimony 
before the grand jury or his testimony before the grand jury, I can 
say to you unequivocally that the president of the United States 
and I have not discussed our testimony. I was advised by my 
counsel, Mr. Hundley, not to discuss that testimony, and I have 
learned in this process, Mr. Hutchinson, to -- to take the advice of 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Did you, subsequent to your last testimony before  
the grand jury, talk to the president in which you discussed 
conversation that you have had with Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I have not discussed a conversation that I have had with  
Monica Lewinsky with the president of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And have you had any discussions about Monica  
Lewinsky with the president of the United States since your last 
testimony before the grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I have not.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I had not at any time discussed the Lewinsky matter with  
-- with Howard Gittis. And so I had breakfast with him to tell him 
that reporters were calling, that this would obviously involve 
Revlon, which had responded to my -- my efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky 
employment, and so Howard Gittis is a friend of mine. Howard Gittis 
is a fellow board member with me at Revlon. He is the Vice Chairman 
of McAndrews &AMP; Forbes, and I thought it -- I thought I had -- it was 
incumbent upon me to stop and say, `Listen, there's trouble 
a-brewing.' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Was there some news stories that had mentioned your  
name in reference to Ms. Lewinsky and the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe that my name has been an integral part of this  
process from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you in fact have the breakfast meeting with  
Mr. Gittis? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes, I did.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And what information did you convey to Mr. Gittis  
concerning Ms. Lewinsky at that breakfast meeting? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I just simply said that the press was calling about Ms.  
Lewinsky; that while I had not dealt with him, I had dealt with 
Richard Halperin, I had dealt with Ronald Perelman. I had not dealt 
with him, but that he ought to know and that I was sorry about 
this. And I also said that it would probably be even more 
complicated because early on I had referred Webb Hubbell to them to 
be hired as counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And I want to get to that in just a moment, but you  
indicated that you said you were sorry. Were you referring to the 
problems that this might create for the company? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, I was obviously concerned. I am a director. I am  
their counsel. They're my friends. And publicity was breaking. I 
thought I had some responsibility to them to give them a heads-up 
as to what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, is it true that your efforts to find a job for  
Ms. Lewinsky that you referenced in that meeting with Mr. Gittis -- 
were your efforts carried out at the request of the president of 
the United States? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: There is no question but that through Betty Currie, I  
was acting on behalf of the president to get Ms. Lewinsky a job. I 
think that's clear from my grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Okay. And I just want to make sure that that's  
firmly established. And in reference to your previous grand jury 
testimony, you indicated, I believe, on May 28th, 1998, at page 61, 
that 'She' -- referring to Betty Currie -- 'was the one that called 
me at the behest of the president.' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct, and I think, congressman, if in fact  
the president of the United States' secretary calls and asks for a 
request that you try to do the best you can to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And you received that request as a request coming  
from the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I -- I interpreted it as a request from the president.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And then, later on in June of '98 in the grand jury  
testimony at page 45, did you not reference or testify that `The 
president asked me to get Monica Lewinsky a job'? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: There was no -- there was no question but that he asked  
me to help and that he asked others to help. I think that is clear 
from everybody's grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Do you believe that you were acting in the company's  
interest or the president's interest when you were trying to secure 
a job for Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, what I knew was that the company would take care  
of its own interest. This is not the first time that I referred 
somebody, and what I know is, is that if a person being referred 
does not meet the standards required for that company, I have no 
question but that that person will not be hired. And so the 
referral is an easy thing to do; the judgment about employment is 
not a judgment as a person referring that I make. But I do have 
confidence in all of the companies on whose boards that I sit that, 
regardless of my reference, that as to their needs and as to their 
expectations for their employees that they will make the right 
decisions, as happened in the American Express situation. American 
Express called and said: We will not hire Ms. Lewinsky. I did not 
question it, I did not challenge it, because they understood their 
needs and their needs in comparison to her qualifications. They 
made a judgment. Revlon, on the other hand, made another judgment. 
I am not the employer, I am the referrer, and there is a major 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And when you had your conversation with Mr. Perelman  
... you do not believe you told him you were calling for the 
president -- 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe that I did not tell him.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: -- but you assumed that he knew?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: No. I did not make any assumptions, let me say. I said:  
Ronald, here is a young lady who has been interviewed. She thinks 
the interview has not gone well. See what you can do to make sure 
that she is properly interviewed and evaluated -- in essence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you reference her as a former White House  
intern? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Probably. I do not have a recollection of whether I  
described her as a White House intern, whether I described her as a 
person who had worked for the Pentagon. I said this is a person 
that I have referred. I think, Mr. Hutchinson, that I have 
sufficient, uh, influence, shall we say, sufficient character, 
shall we say, that people have been throughout my career able to 
take my word at face value. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And so you didn't need to reference the president.  
The fact that you were calling Mr. Perelman -- 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That was sufficient.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: You knew and the president knew that Ms. Lewinsky  
was under subpoena in the Jones case, and that information was not 
provided to either Mr. Halperin or to Mr. Perelman; is that 
correct? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That's correct.  
</P>
<P>
	... I think, on the other hand, that had she been a defendant in  
a murder case and I knew that, then I probably wouldn't have 
referenced her. But her being a witness in a civil case I did not 
think important. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Despite the fact that you were acting at the request  
of the president, and this witness was potentially adverse to the 
president's interest in that case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I didn't know that. I mean, I don't -- I don't know what  
her position was or whether it was adverse or not. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Ms. Lewinsky has made reference to a meeting that  
occurred in your office on November 5, and that's the meeting that 
you have no recollection of? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct. We have no record of it in my office,  
and I just have no recollection of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And in your first grand jury appearance, you were  
firm, shall I say, that the first time you met with Ms. Lewinsky, 
that it was on December 11th? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes. It was firm based on what my calendar told me, and  
subsequently to that, there has been a refreshing of my 
recollection, and I do not deny that it happened. By the same 
token, I will tell you, as I said in my grand jury testimony, that 
I did not remember that I had met with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And in fact today, the fact that you do not dispute  
that that meeting occurred is not based upon your recollection but 
is simply based upon you've seen the records, and it appears that 
that meeting occurred? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	How did the meeting on December 11 of 1997 with Ms. Lewinsky  
come about? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Ms. Lewinsky called my office and asked if she could  
come to see me. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And was that preceded by a call from Betty Currie?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: At some point in time, Betty Currie had called me, and  
Ms. Lewinsky followed up on that call, and she came to my office, 
and we had a visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Ms. Lewinsky called, set up a meeting, and at some  
point sent you a resume, I believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe so.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you receive that prior to the meeting on  
December 11th? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I -- I have to assume that I did, but I -- I do not know  
whether she brought it with her or whether -- it was at some point 
that she brought with her or sent to me -- somehow it came into my 
possession -- a list of various companies in New York with which she 
had -- which were her preferences, by the way -- most of which I did 
not know well enough to make any calls for. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Many times I will be listed as a reference, and they  
can take that to any company. You might be listed as a reference 
and the name 'Vernon Jordan' would be a good reference anywhere, 
would it not? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I would hope so.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And so, even though it was a company that you might  
not have the best contact with, you could have been helpful in that 
regard? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, the fact is I was running the job search, not Ms.  
Lewinsky, and therefore, the companies that she brought or listed 
were not of interest to me. I knew where I would need to call. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And that is exactly the point, that you looked at  
getting Ms. Lewinsky a job as an assignment rather than just 
something that you were going to be a reference for. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I don't know whether I looked upon it as an assignment.  
Getting jobs for people is not unusual for me, so I don't view it 
as an assignment. I just view it as something that is part of what 
I do. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: You're acting in behalf of the president when you  
are trying to get Ms. Lewinsky a job, and you were in control of 
the job search? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: During the course of the meeting with Ms. Lewinsky,  
what did you learn about her? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Uh, enthusiastic, quite taken with herself and her  
experience, uh, bubbly, effervescent, bouncy, confident, uh -- 
actually, I sort of had the same impression that you House managers 
had of her when you met with her. You came out and said she was 
impressive, and so we come out about the same place. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did she relate to you the fact that she liked  
being an intern because it put her close to the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I have never seen a White House intern who did not like  
being a White House intern, and so her enthusiasm for being a White 
House intern was about like the enthusiasm of White House interns -- 
they liked it. She was not happy about not being there anymore -- 
she did not like being at the Defense Department -- and I think she 
actually had some desire to go back. But when she actually talked 
to me, she wanted to go to New York for a job in the private 
sector, and she thought that I could be helpful in that process. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Did she make reference to someone in the White House  
being uncomfortable when she was an intern, and she thought that 
people did not want her there? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: She felt unwanted -- there is no question about that. As  
to who did not want her there and why they did not want her there, 
that was not my business. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: If there was a discussion subsequent to Monica  
Lewinsky's visit to me on December the 11th with the president of 
the United States, it was about the job search. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right. And during that, did he indicate that he  
knew about the fact that she had lost her job in the White House, 
and she wanted to get a job in New York? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: He was aware that -- he was obviously aware that she had  
lost her job in the White House, because she was working at the 
Pentagon. He was also aware that she wanted to work in New York, in 
the private sector, and understood that that is why she was having 
conversations with me. There is no doubt about that. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And he thanked you for helping her?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: There's no question about that, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And on either of these conversations that I've  
referenced that you had with the president after the witness list 
came out, your conversation on December 7th, and your conversation 
sometime after the 11th, did the president tell you that Ms. Monica 
Lewinsky was on the witness list in the Jones case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: He did not.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you consider this information to be  
important in your efforts to be helpful to Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I never thought about it.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Was there a time that you became aware that Ms.  
Lewinsky had been subpoenaed to give a deposition in the Jones 
versus Clinton case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: On December 19th when she came to my office with the  
subpoena -- I think it's the 19th. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: How did it come about that you met with Ms. Lewinsky  
on December 19th? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Ms. Lewinsky called me in a rather high emotional state  
and said that she needed to see me, and she came to see me. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And she called you on the telephone on December  
19th, in which she indicated she had received a subpoena? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That's right, and was emotional about it and asked, and  
so I said come over. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And what was your reaction to her having received a  
subpoena in the Jones case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Surprise, number one; number two, quite taken with her  
emotional state. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you see that she had a problem?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: She obviously had a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	... She was -- she was disturbed about the subpoena. She was  
disturbed about not having, in her words, heard from the president 
or talked to the president. It was also in that meeting that it 
became clear to me that the -- that her eyes were wide and that she, 
uh, that -- let me -- for lack of a better way to put it, that she 
had a 'thing' for the president. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: From your conversation with her, did you determine  
that in your opinion, there was a fascination on her part with the 
president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: No question about that.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And I think you previously described it that she had  
a 'thing' for the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: 'Thing,' yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you make any specific inquiry as to the  
nature of the relationship that she had with the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes. At some point during that conversation, I asked her  
directly if she had had sexual relationships with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And is this not an extraordinary question to ask a  
24-year-old intern, whether she had sexual relations with the 
president of the United States? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Not if you see -- not if you had witnessed her emotional  
state and this 'thing,' as I say. It was not. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And her emotional state and what she expressed to  
you about her feelings for the president is what prompted you to 
ask that question? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That, plus the question of whether or not the president  
at the end of his term would leave the first lady; and that was 
alarming and stunning to me. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And she related that question to you in that meeting  
on December 19th? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That's correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, going back to the question in which you asked  
her if she had had a sexual relationship with the president, what 
was her response? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: No.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And I'm sure that that was not an idle question on  
your part, and I presume that you needed to know the answer for 
some purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I wanted to know the answer based on what I had seen in  
her expression; obviously, based on the fact that this was a 
subpoena about her relationship with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And so you felt like you needed to know the answer  
to that question to determine how you were going to handle the 
situation? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: No. I thought it was a factual data that I needed to  
know, and I asked the question. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And why did you need to know the answer to that  
question? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I am referring this lady, Ms. Lewinsky, to various  
companies for jobs, and it seemed to me that it was important for 
me to know in that process whether or not there had been something 
going on with the president based on what I saw and based on what I 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, let me just go back as to what signals that you  
might have had at this particular point that there was a sexual 
relationship between Ms. Lewinsky and the president. Was one of 
those the fact that she indicated that she had a fascination with 
the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did she relate that 'He doesn't call me enough'?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And was the fact that there was an exchange of gifts  
a factor in your consideration? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, I was not aware that there had been an exchange of  
gifts. I thought it a tad unusual that there would be an exchange 
of gifts, uh, but it was just clear that there was a fixation by 
this young woman on the president of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And was it also a factor that she had been issued a  
subpoena in a case that was rooted in sexual harassment? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, it certainly helped.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And that was an ingredient that you factored in and  
decided this is a question that needed to be asked? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: There's no question about that.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, heretofore, the questions or the discussions  
with Ms. Lewinsky had simply been about a job? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Had been about a job.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And I think you indicated that you didn't have to be  
an Einstein to know that this was a question that needed to be 
asked after what you learned on this meeting? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes, based on my own judgment, that is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, at this point, you're assisting the president  
in obtaining a job for a former intern, Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Right.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: It comes to your attention from Ms. Lewinsky that  
she has a subpoena in a civil rights case against the president. 
And did this make you consider whether it was appropriate for you 
to continue seeking a job for Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Never gave it a thought.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Despite the fact that you were seeking the job for  
Ms. Lewinsky at the request of the president when she is under 
subpoena in a case adverse to the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I -- I did not give it a thought. I had committed that I  
was going to help her, and I was going to -- and I kept my 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: So it's your testimony that if Ms. Currie had known  
that Ms. Lewinsky was under subpoena, you would have expected her 
to tell you that information? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: It would have been helpful.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And likewise, would you have expected the president  
to tell you if he had any reason to believe that Ms. Lewinsky would 
be called as a witness in the Paula Jones case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That would have been helpful, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And that was your expectation, that he would have  
done that in your conversations? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: It -- it would certainly have been helpful, but it would  
not have changed my mind. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And yet, according to your testimony, the president  
did not so advise you of the fact that Ms. Lewinsky was on the 
witness list despite the fact that he had conversations with you on 
two occasions, on December 7th and December 11th? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I have no recollection of the president telling me about  
the witness list. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, Mr. Jordan, you indicated you had this  
conversation with the president at about 5:01 p.m. out of the 
presence of Ms. Lewinsky. Now, during this conversation with the 
president, what did you tell the president in that conversation? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That Lewinsky -- I'm sure I told him that Ms. Lewinsky  
was in my office, in the reception area, that she had a subpoena 
and that I was going to visit with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you advise the president as well that you  
were going to recommend Frank Carter as an attorney? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I may have.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And why was it necessary to tell the president these  
facts? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I don't know why it was not unnecessary to tell him  
these facts. I was keeping him informed about what was going on, 
and so I told him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Why did you make the judgment that you should call  
the president and advise him of these facts? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I just thought he ought to know. He was interested it --  
he was obviously interested in it -- and I felt some responsibility 
to tell him, and I did. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right. And what was the president's response?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: He said thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: During this conversation with Ms. Lewinsky, she also  
made reference to the first lady? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And that was another question of concern when she  
asked if you thought that the president would leave the first lady 
at the end of his term? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And what was your reaction to this statement?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: My reaction to the statement after I got over it was  
that -- no way. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Did it send off alarm bells in your mind as to her  
relationship with the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I think it's safe to say that she was not happy.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: You're speaking of Ms. Lewinsky?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That's the only person we're talking about, congressman.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, based upon all of this, was it your conclusion  
the subpoena meant trouble? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Beg your pardon?  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Based upon all of these facts and your conversation  
with Ms. Lewinsky, was it your conclusion that the subpoena meant 
trouble? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, I always, based on my experience with the grand  
jury, believe that subpoenas are trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: I think you've used the language, 'ipso facto' meant  
trouble? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes, yes, right.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, would you describe your conversation with the  
president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: We were upstairs, uh, in the White House. Mrs. Jordan --  
we came in by way of the Southwest Gate into the Diplomatic 
Entrance -- we left the car there. I took the elevator up to the 
residence, and Mrs. Jordan went and visited at the party. And the 
president was already upstairs -- I had ascertained that from the 
usher -- and I went up, and I raised with him the whole question of 
Monica Lewinsky and asked him directly if he had had sexual 
relations with Monica Lewinsky, and the president said, 'No, 
never.' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right. Now, during that conversation, did you  
tell the president again that Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, we had established that.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right. And did you tell him that you were  
concerned about her fascination? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I did.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you describe her as being emotional in your  
meeting that day? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I did.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you relate to the president that Ms.  
Lewinsky asked about whether he was going to leave the first lady 
at the end of the term? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I did.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And as -- and then, you concluded that with the  
question as to whether he had had sexual relations with Ms. 
Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: And he said he had not, and I was satisfied -- end of  
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, once again, just as I asked the question in  
reference to Ms. Lewinsky, it appears to me that this is an 
extraordinary question to ask the president of the United States. 
What led you to ask this question to the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, first of all, I'm asking the question of my friend  
who happens to be the president of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you expect your friend, the president of the  
United States, to give you a truthful answer? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I did.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Did you rely upon the president's answer in your  
decision to continue your efforts to seek Ms. Lewinsky a job? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believed him, and I continued to do what I had been  
asked to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Well, my question was more did you rely upon the  
president's answer in your decision to continue your efforts to 
seek Ms. Lewinsky a job. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I did not rely on his answer. I was going to pursue the  
job in any event. But I got the answer to the question that I had 
asked Ms. Lewinsky earlier from her, and I got the answer from him 
that night as to the sexual relationships, and he said no. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: If you would refer to my testimony before the grand jury  
when asked about a breakfast with Ms. Lewinsky on December 31st, I 
testified that I did not have breakfast with Ms. Lewinsky on 
December 31st because I did not remember having had breakfast with 
Ms. Lewinsky on December 31st. It was not on my calendar. It was 
New Year's Eve. I have breakfast at the Park Hyatt Hotel three or 
four times a week if I am in town, and so I really did not remember 
having breakfast with Ms. Lewinsky. And that's an honest statement, 
I did not remember, and I told that to the grand jury. It is clear, 
based on the evidence here, that I was at the Park Hyatt on 
December 31st. So I do not deny, despite my testimony before the 
grand jury, that on December 31st that I was there with Ms. 
Lewinsky, but I did testify before the grand jury that I did not 
remember having a breakfast with her on that date, and that was the 
truth. My recollection has subsequently been refreshed, and -- and 
so it is -- it is undeniable that there was a breakfast in my usual 
breakfast place, in the corner at the Park Hyatt. I'm there all the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right. And so -- and that would be with Ms.  
Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Do you recall a discussion with Ms. Lewinsky at the  
Park Hyatt on this occasion in which there were notes discussed 
that she had written to the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I am certain that Ms. Lewinsky talked to me about notes.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: On this occasion?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And would these have been notes that she would have  
sent to the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I think that there was -- these notes had to do with  
correspondence between Ms. Lewinsky and the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And would have she mentioned the retention or copies  
of some of that correspondence on her computer in her apartment? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: She may have done that.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you ask her a question, were these notes  
from the president to you? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I understood from our conversation that she and the  
president had correspondence that went back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you make a statement to her, 'Go home and  
make sure they're not there'? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Mr. Hutchinson, I'm a lawyer and I'm a loyal friend, but  
I'm not a fool, and the notion that I would suggest to anybody that 
they destroy anything just defies anything that I know about 
myself. So the notion that I said to her go home and destroy notes 
is ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Well, I appreciate that reminder of ethical  
responsibilities. It was -- 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: No, it had nothing to do with ethics, as much as it's  
just good common sense, mother wit. You remember that in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Was this a meeting that was set up at her request or  
your request? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I'm certain it was at her request. I am fairly certain  
that I did not call Ms. Lewinsky and say will you join me at the 
Park Hyatt for breakfast on December 31st, on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: The president was obviously interested in her job  
search. We had talked about the affidavit. He knew that she had a 
lawyer. It was in the due course of a conversation. I would say, 
`Mr. President, she signed the affidavit. She signed the 
affidavit.' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And what was his response when you informed him that  
she had signed the affidavit? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: 'Thank you very much.'  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: So she was able to secure the job based upon your  
call to Mr. Perelman? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Based upon my call, from the time that I called Halperin  
through to Mr. Perelman. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I take credit for that.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right. Now, in fact, you've used terms like `the  
Jordan magic worked'? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: It -- it has from time to time.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And it did on this occasion?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe so.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And then, you also informed Ms. Betty Currie that  
the mission was accomplished? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And after securing the job for Ms. Lewinsky, you did  
inform Betty Currie of that fact? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: And the president.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right. And was the purpose of letting Betty  
Currie know so that she could tell the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: She saw the president much more often that I did.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And -- but you wanted to inform the president  
personally that you were successful in getting Ms. Lewinsky a job? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Ms. Currie is concerned enough that she leaves the  
White House and goes to see Mr. Vernon Jordan, and she raises an 
issue with you and, according to your testimony, you told her 
simply, you need to go see Mike McCurry or Bruce Lindsey. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And it's your testimony that she never raised with  
you any issue concerning the -- Mr. Isikoff inquiring about gifts 
and records of gifts by Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I stand by what I -- what you just read to me about --  
from my testimony about tapes conversations. I have no recollection 
about gifts or gifts under the bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Okay. Are you saying it did not happen, or you have  
no recollection? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I certainly have no recollection of it.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Well, do you have a specific recollection that it  
did not happen, that she never raised the issue of gifts with you? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: It is my judgment that it did not happen.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: You had already secured a job for Ms. Lewinsky?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And you --  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Found a lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And a lawyer. And, as you had said at one point, job  
finished -- fini. Why is it that you felt like you needed to join in 
the search for Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: If you had been sitting where I was, and all of a sudden  
you found out, after getting her a job and after getting her a 
lawyer, that there's a report that says that she's been -- she's 
been taped by some person named Linda Tripp, I think just -- mother 
wit, common sense, judgment would have suggested that you would be 
interested in what that was about. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And were you trying to provide assistance to the  
president of the United States in trying to locate Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I was not trying to help the president of the United  
States. At that point, I was trying to satisfy myself as to what 
had gone on with this person for whom I had gotten both a job and a 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	White House counsel David Kendall: Was your assistance to Ms.  
Lewinsky which you have described in any way dependent upon her 
doing anything whatsoever in the Paula Jones case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: No.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Impeachment Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts of deposition testimony by Monica Lewinsky and Vernon  
Jordan, introduced by House prosecutors Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky (on Oval Office secretary Betty Currie picking up  
gifts): ``I received a call from Betty and to the best of my memory 
she said something like, `I understand you have something for me.' 
... I remember her saying either `I know you have something for me 
or the president said you have something for me.' 
</P>
<P>
	``And to me ... I mean ... the gist of the conversation was that  
she was going to go visit her mom in the hospital and she'd stop by 
and get whatever it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.: ``Did you question Ms. Currie or ask  
her what are you talking about or what do you mean?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``No.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Why didn't you?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Because I assumed that it meant the gifts.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant (asking about the time the gifts were retrieved): ``Do  
you know what kind of time frame it covered?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I think it was afternoon. I know I've testified to  
around 2 o clock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Could it have been later?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Sure.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant (on who initiated the gift pickup): ``I mean is there ...  
any doubt in your mind that she (Mrs. Currie) called you to come 
pick up the gifts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I don't think there is any doubt in my mind.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 

</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Your meeting with Vernon Jordan on Dec. 31, 1997. Was that  
to go back and talk about the job again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``A little bit, but ... for me, the point of that  
meeting was I had gotten to a point where Linda Tripp wasn't 
returning my phone calls, and I felt I needed to devise some way 
... to ... cushion the shock of what would happen if Linda Tripp 
testified all the facts about my relationship, since I had never 
disclosed that to the president. So that was sort of my intention 
in meeting with Mr. Jordan, was hoping that I could give a little 
information and that would get passed on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``And that was at a meeting for breakfast at the Park Hyatt  
Hotel?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Did you discuss other things, other than Linda Tripp and  
your job search?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I think we talked about what each of us were doing  
New Year's Eve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Specifically about some notes that you had at your  
apartment?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Oh, yes. That was really in relation to discussing  
Linda Tripp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``There is no question but that through Betty Currie I  
was acting on behalf of the president to get Ms. Lewinsky a job. 
...
</P>
<P>
	``I think, congressman, if in fact the president of the United  
States' secretary calls and asks for a request, that you try to do 
the best you can to make it happen. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I interpreted it as a request from the president. ...  
</P>
<P>
	``There was no question that he asked me to help and that he  
asked others to help. I think that is clear from everybody's grand 
jury testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``The fact is I was running the job search, not Ms.  
Lewinsky, and therefore, the companies that she brought or listed 
were not of interest to me. I knew where I would need to call.''

<HEADLINE> Oslo Stock Exchange Streamlined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- There was something missing at the  
170-year-old Oslo Stock Exchange on Friday -- brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	They're still trading, but now their transactions go through a  
fully computerized system put into service Friday. That means they 
no longer turn up for work in the stately old building in downtown 
Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernt Bangstad, the exchange's spokesman, admitted that it was  
strangely quiet when he turned up for work at the exchange, which 
the brokers abandoned the previously evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the knowledge that we had successfully gone over to a much  
better system sort of pushes all sentimentality aside,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's financial community collectively held its breath Friday  
when trading opened from the first time on often-delayed new 
computer system. Many feared that despite months of testing, the 
slightest bug could stop trading for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't had the slightest technical problem,'' a clearly  
relieved Bangstad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new system, traders sit at remote locations and place  
their buy or sell orders through the computer. Under the old 
system, the brokers would close deals by telephone, and then log 
them into the computer at the exchange.

<HEADLINE> McNamara Named ADM President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- Archer Daniels Midland Co. named John D.  
McNamara as its new president Friday, continuing changes in top 
management that began with the retirement of longtime chairman 
Dwayne Andreas. 
</P>
<P>
	McNamara replaces Allen Andreas, who in January was named  
chairman and chief executive officer of the giant grain processor 
following his uncle's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	McNamara was a vice president of ADM and headed the company's  
North American oilseed processing division. He joined the company 
in 1985 as merchandising manager and at one time headed ADM's 
Canadian subsidiary, ADM Agri-Industries Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	In other moves, ADM named Charles Bayless special assistant to  
Allen Andreas, in addition to his executive vice president duties. 
John Rice was appointed group vice president and president of the 
North American oilseed processing division. Brian Peterson was 
appointed president, ADM protein specialties division, in addition 
to heading up the bioproducts division. 
</P>
<P>
	ADM employs 23,000 worldwide, owns 274 processing plants and had  
net sales in 1998 of more than $16 billion, company officials said. 
ADM produces everything from soybean oil to high-fructose corn 
syrup to cocoa powder.

<HEADLINE> Blumenthal Deposition Excerpts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts of Sidney Blumenthal's deposition testimony from Feb.  
3: 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutor Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif.: After you related the  
conversation that you had with the first lady to the president, 
what do you remember saying to the president next about the subject 
of Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Well, I recall telling him that I understood he felt  
that way, and that he did help people, but that he should stop 
trying to help troubled people personally; that troubled people are 
troubled and that they can get you in a lot of messes and that you 
had to cut yourself off from it and you just had to do it. That's 
what I recall saying to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Do you also remember in that conversation saying to him,  
`You really need to not do that at this point, that you can't get 
near anybody who is even remotely crazy. You're president'? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Yes. I think that was a little later in the  
conversation, but I do recall saying that. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: When you told the president that he should avoid contact  
with troubled people, what did the president say to you in 
response? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I'm trying to remember the sequence of it. He -- he  
said that was very difficult for him. He said he -- he felt a need 
to help troubled people, and it was hard for him to -- to cut 
himself off from doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Do you remember him saying specifically, 'It's very  
difficult for me to do that, given how I am. I want to help 
people'? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I recall -- I recall that.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: And when the president referred to trying to help people,  
did you understand him in that conversation to be referring to 
Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I think it included Monica Lewinsky, but also many  
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Right, but it was your understanding that he was all -- he  
was specifically referring to Monica Lewinsky in that list of 
people that he tried to help? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I believe that -- that was implied.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Mr. Blumenthal, did the president then relate a  
conversation he had with Dick Morris to you? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: He did.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: What was the substance of that conversation, as the  
president related it to you? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: He said that he had spoken to Dick Morris earlier  
that day, and that Dick Morris had told him that if Nixon, Richard 
Nixon, had given a nationally televised speech at the beginning of 
the Watergate affair, acknowledging everything he had done wrong, 
he may well have survived it, and that was the conversation that 
Dick Morris -- that's what Dick Morris said to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Did it sound to you like the president was suggesting  
perhaps he would go on television and give a national speech? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Well, I don't know. I didn't know.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: And when the president related the substance of his  
conversation with Dick Morris to you, how did you respond to that? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I said to the president, `Well, what have you done  
wrong?' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Did he reply?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: He did.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: What did he say?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: He said, `I haven't done anything wrong.'  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: And what did you say to that response?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Well, I said, as I recall, `That's one of the  
stupidest ideas I ever heard. If you haven't done anything wrong, 
why would you do that?' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Did the president then give you his account of what  
happened between him and Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: As I recall, he did.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: What did the president tell you?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: He, uh -- he spoke, uh, fairly rapidly, as I recall,  
at that point and said that she had come on to him and made a 
demand for sex, that he had rebuffed her, turned her down, and that 
she, uh, threatened him. And, uh, he said that she said to him, uh, 
that she was called 'the stalker' by her peers and that she hated 
the term, and that she would claim that they had had an affair 
whether they had or they hadn't, and that she would tell people. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Do you remember him also saying that the reason Monica  
Lewinsky would tell people that is because then she wouldn't be 
known by her peers as 'the stalker' anymore? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Yes, that's right.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Do you remember the president also saying that -- and I'm  
quoting: 'I've gone down that road before. I've caused pain for a 
lot of people. I'm not going to do that again'? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Yes. He told me that.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: And that was in the same conversation that you had with  
the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Right, in -- in that sequence.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Can you describe for us the president's demeanor when he  
shared this information with you? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Yes. He was, uh, very upset. I thought he was a man  
in anguish. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: And at that point, did you repeat your earlier admonition  
to him as far as not trying to help troubled people? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I did. I -- I think that's when I told him that you  
can't get near crazy people, uh, or troubled people. Uh, you're 
president; you just have to separate yourself from this. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Do you remember the president also saying something about  
being like a character in a novel? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I do.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: What did he say?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Uh, he said to me, uh, that, uh, he felt like a  
character in a novel. Uh, he felt like somebody, uh, surrounded by, 
uh, an oppressive environment that was creating a lie about him. He 
said he felt like, uh, the character in the novel ``Darkness at 
Noon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Did he also say he felt like he can't get the truth out?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Yes, I -- I believe he said that.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Politicians are always loathe to confess their ignorance,  
particularly on videotape. I will do so. I'm unfamiliar with the 
novel ``Darkness at Noon.'' Did you -- do you have any familiarity 
with that, or did you understand what the president meant by that? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I -- I understood what he meant. I -- I was familiar  
with the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: What -- what did he mean by that, per your understanding?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Uh, the book is by Arthur Koestler, who was somebody  
who had been a communist and had become disillusioned with 
communism. And it's an anti-communist novel. It's about, uh, uh, 
the Stalinist purge trials and somebody who was a loyal communist 
who then is put in one of Stalin's prisons and held on trial and 
executed, uh, and it's about his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Did you understand what the president was trying to  
communicate when he related his situation to the character in that 
novel? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I think he felt that the world was against him.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: I thought only members of Congress felt that way.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutor Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.: That's where you  
start talking about the story that the president told you. Knowing 
what you know now, do you believe the president lied to you about 
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I do.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: Now, you've stated, I think, very honestly, and I  
appreciate, that you were lied to by the president. Is it a fair 
statement, given your previous testimony concerning your 30-minute 
conversation, that the president was trying to portray himself as a 
victim of a relationship with Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I think that's the import of his whole story.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: What type reaction did the White House have when this --  
as you recall -- when this article came to light? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I -- I think the White House was overwhelmed with  
press inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: Was there a sense of alarm that this was a bad story?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Graham: And wasn't there a sense of reassurance by the president  
himself that this was an untrue story? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: The president did make a public statement that  
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: And I believe White House officials on his behalf denied  
the essence of this story; is that correct? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Graham: And basically, you were passing along what somebody you  
trust and admire told you to be the case, and from the White House 
point of view, that was the response to this story, that we deny 
these allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: And this is after the president recants his story --  
recounts his story -- to you, where he's visibly upset, feels like 
he's a victim, that he associates himself with a character who's 
being lied about, and you at no time suggested to your colleagues 
that there is something going on here with the president and Ms. 
Lewinsky you need to know about. Is that your testimony? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I never mentioned my conversation. I regarded that  
conversation as a private conversation in confidence, and I didn't 
mention it to my colleagues, I didn't mention it to my friends, I 
didn't mention it to my family, besides my wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: Did you mention it to any White House lawyers?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I mentioned it many months later to Lanny Breuer in  
preparation for one of my grand jury appearances, when I knew I 
would be questioned about it. And I certainly never mentioned it to 
any reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: Do you know how, over a period of weeks, stories about  
Ms. Lewinsky being called a stalker, a fantasizer, obsessed with 
the president, called the name `Elvira'-- do you know how that got 
into the press? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Which -- which -- which question are you asking me?  
Which part of that? 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: Okay. Do you have any idea how White House sources are  
associated with statements such as 'She's known as Elvira,' 'She's 
obsessed with the president,' 'She's known as a flirt,' 'She's the 
product of a troubled home, divorced parents,' 'She's known as 'The 
Stalker''? Do you have any idea how that got in the press? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: ... I have no idea how anything came to be  
attributed to a White House source.

<HEADLINE> Writers To Get Pct. of Box Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Columbia Pictures and a group of top  
Hollywood screenwriters have brokered a rare deal that gives the 
writers a percentage of box office receipts in addition to the fee 
paid for their scripts. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Thursday was hammered out with 33  
writers but could apply to hundreds more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's groundbreaking. A big moment in the movie business,''  
said Gary Ross, whose writing credits include ``Dave'' and ``Big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, only a few studios have offered screenwriters a  
percentage of box office receipts, or points, when negotiating 
contracts. Such deals are far more common for actors and directors. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is considered a boost for screenwriters, who long have  
been shut out of the financial success of blockbuster movies while 
actors and directors earn millions through the point deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, the 33 writers agreed to deliver one  
script each -- an original screenplay, an adaptation, or a rewrite -- 
to Columbia within the next three years. Each writer can either 
commit to one of five projects the studio proposes or give Columbia 
their own idea. 
</P>
<P>
	A writer receiving sole screen credit is guaranteed 2 percent of  
gross box office receipts -- a figure calculated after the studio 
recoups its production, marketing and distribution costs. If there 
is a co-writing screen credit, the writer gets 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal extends to potentially hundreds of other writers who  
have either received at least $750,000 for a writing assignment, 
sold a screenplay for at least $1 million, or been nominated for an 
Academy Award or Writers Guild of America award. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Pascal, Columbia's president, predicted that both her studio  
and writers will benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, it's like getting first-look deals from all these  
great writers,'' she said. ``I think this was going to happen at 
some point. If not us, they would have gone somewhere else.''

<HEADLINE> Court Backs FCC in Wireless Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Friday backed the  
Federal Communications Commission's decision to auction certain 
wireless licenses to provide mobile phone, paging, voice mail and 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
	Nextel Communications Inc., based in McLean, Va., was the  
biggest winner in that 1997 auction for these ``specialized mobile 
radio service'' licenses using frequencies in the 800 megahertz 
band. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld  
the FCC's decisions to auction these licenses and to eliminate 
installment payments for bidders to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresno Mobile Radio and SMR WON, a trade association  
representing companies that already held some of these licenses 
before the auction, argued, among other things, that the FCC had 
exceeded its authority by requiring that new licenses be auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, using other means, had previously licensed companies to  
provide similar services on the same frequencies as the companies 
receiving licenses at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, meanwhile, ruled against the FCC in its decision to  
apply different ``interim coverage'' requirements for companies 
that received their licenses at auction and for companies that held 
licenses before the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, companies licensed before the auction were  
required to provide service to everyone in their licensed area 
within two years of receiving a license. Companies winning licenses 
at auction were required to provide service to one-third of the 
people in their licensed area after three years and two-thirds of 
the people after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the FCC failed to adequately explain this  
disparate treatment and ordered the commission to revise this part 
of its rules. Southern Company, which had received licenses before 
the FCC decided to auction them, challenged that part of the FCC 
rules.

<HEADLINE> Alfonzo, Mets OK $18.4M Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Proclaiming Edgardo Alfonzo a key part of their  
team, the New York Mets avoided arbitration with the infielder by 
agreeing Friday to an $18.4 million, four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo is being moved from third base to second this year to  
make way for Robin Ventura, the Mets big free agent acquisition. 
Alfonzo hit .278 last season and set career highs with 17 homers 
and 78 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel good we were able to lock in place what we feel will  
be one of the best infields in baseball this year,'' Mets general 
manager Steve Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo, who made $1.75 million last year, had asked for $3.85  
million in arbitration and had been offered $2.5 million. The deal 
calls for a $500,000 signing bonus -- $300,000 payable now and 
$200,000 in January 2000 -- and salaries of $2,675,000 this year, $4 
million in 2000, $5.5 million in 2001 and $5,725,000 in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal contains escalators and bonus clauses that could raise  
its total value to $24.8 million if Alfonzo becomes a four-time 
All-Star and wins four Gold Gloves and Silver Sluggers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 25 years old and improving, and showed some power  
potential later in the year,'' Phillips said, referring to 
Alfonzo's seven home runs in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo, who would have been eligible for free agency after the  
2000 season, was out of the country and unavailable for comment, 
``attending to his cows and building a house in Venezuela,'' 
according to the player's agent, Peter Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard cows mooing in the back when I've talked to him,''  
Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo played third base during the winter league, not wanting  
to displace Houston's Carlos Hernandez at second. But Greenberg 
said Alfonzo worked out at second before and after games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not have any concern about it at all,'' Phillips said.  
``Edgardo is cautious and humble in talking about it. I know inside 
he's confident about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York, with a payroll more than $60 million, had thought  
about negotiating a one-year contract and an extension after 
opening day, or even putting together a tentative multiyear deal 
and announcing it after the opener. That way, the later years 
wouldn't count toward the luxury tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe in doing a deal and holding it,'' Phillips  
said. ``One, it's against the rules. Two, there are so many assumed 
risks, both on the player's part and the club's part, that it's not 
worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three Mets remain in arbitration: shortstop Rey Ordonez and  
pitchers Turk Wendell and Armando Benitez. The Mets haven't gone to 
a hearing since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still believe we're going to have at least one case this  
year that winds up going,'' Phillips said. ``I don't view it as a 
problem. It's just part of what we have to do in this game.''

<HEADLINE> Senate To Show Lewinsky Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though senators chose not to call her for live  
testimony, Monica Lewinsky makes clear in her videotaped deposition 
that she now has ``mixed feelings'' for President Clinton and 
insists he never suggested she file a false affidavit to deny their 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	With Clinton's impeachment trial a week or less from completion,  
Ms. Lewinsky, in testimony obtained by The Associated Press late 
Thursday, cast doubt on Clinton's sworn testimony that he told her 
she might have to turn over presidential gifts if they were 
subpoenaed in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did the president ever tell you to turn over the gifts?'' Rep.  
Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., asked in the Monday deposition. ``Not that I 
remember,'' Ms. Lewinsky answered. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors are trying to show that the president's  
efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job were linked to her filing a 
false affidavit denying their affair and that the hiding of gifts 
he had given her was part of a scheme by Clinton to obstruct 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky at times helped both the prosecutors and the  
president in the deposition, which was scheduled for public release 
today. Snippets of the videotape will be played to television 
viewers at the trial on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	After rejecting live testimony Thursday, the Senate voted to  
release the complete transcripts of Ms. Lewinsky, presidential 
friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors originally wanted live testimony by all three  
witnesses. But with many Senate Republicans content to admit only 
the videotape into evidence, the managers scaled back their request 
to Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, the Senate responded with a stinging rebuke,  
rejecting the proposal on a 70-30 vote. Twenty-five Republicans 
joined all 45 Democrats in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was in recess today, so both sides could prepare for  
Saturday's presentations, which also may include White House use of 
the videotape. Closing arguments will be held Monday, and then 
deliberations, with a vote expected next Friday or sooner on 
conviction or acquittal of the president on perjury and obstruction 
of justice charges. Republicans and Democrats agree that the 67 
votes needed to convict and remove Clinton are lacking. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday was a day of retreat both for the House managers and  
Senate Republicans, who abandoned proposals for ``findings of 
fact'' that would have declared presidential wrongdoing without 
removing Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think it's time we get to a vote and we move on'' to  
other issues, Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said some language to disapprove Clinton's conduct was  
still under consideration by Republicans, but it was unclear 
whether any GOP proposal would mesh with a planned Democratic 
censure resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	In her deposition, Ms. Lewinsky testified that in a  
middle-of-the-night telephone call initiated by Clinton on Dec. 17, 
1997, the president suggested she could file an affidavit to avoid 
being deposed in the Jones case. Clinton told her in that 
conversation that she had been made a potential witness by the 
Jones attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked whether the president suggested what she might  
say in the affidavit, Ms. Lewinsky responded, ``There was no 
discussion of what would be in an affidavit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I necessarily thought at that point it would  
have to be false,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	The questioning turned personal when Bryant asked Ms. Lewinsky  
whether she still had ``feelings for the president'' a year after 
she was thrust unwillingly into the impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have mixed feelings,'' she replied. She answered ``yes''  
twice when asked if she still admired the president and appreciated 
``what he is doing for this country as the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Dec. 17 conversation, Ms. Lewinsky testified that Clinton  
``said it broke his heart ... that my name was on the witness 
list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky then asked, ``Can I take a break please. I'm  
sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the questioning resumed, Ms. Lewinsky was asked to describe  
her reaction when she learned she might be called as a witness in 
the politically charged Jones case against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was scared,'' she responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky testified that Clinton at one point in the  
conversation also reminded her of the cover stories they had 
devised earlier to hide their affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the president said something like, ``You can  
always say you were coming to see (Oval Office secretary) Betty 
(Currie) or bringing me papers,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, was that in connection with the affidavit?'' Bryant  
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe so, no,'' she said, striking down a theory  
prosecutors have held that the cover stories had been suggested to 
her to encourage her to file a false affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about a Dec. 28, 1997, meeting Clinton, during which they  
discussed what to do with the subpoenaed gifts, Ms. Lewinsky 
replied: ``And as I've testified numerously, his response was 
either ranging from no response to 'I don't know or let me think 
about it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Later that day, Mrs. Currie came to Ms. Lewinsky's apartment to  
pick up the gifts. House prosecutors concluded that Clinton sent 
his secretary to get them, but there is no direct testimony to 
support that. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has attacked the prosecution case on the gift  
retrieval, especially the House's reliance on a brief phone call 
from Mrs. Currie to Ms. Lewinsky about 3:30 p.m. that day. White 
House lawyers noted Ms. Lewinsky testified the transfer took place 
about 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	But in her deposition, Ms. Lewinsky said she had additional  
phone conversations with Mrs. Currie that day and they discussed 
``when she was coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her 2 p.m. estimate may have been wrong.

<HEADLINE> Government To Track Internet Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government said Friday it will  
begin tracking annual consumer sales across the Internet, but the 
figures from last year's shopping won't be available until the 
middle of 2000 -- a virtual eternity in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said its next annual Census survey,  
which will be mailed to retailers nationwide in January 2000, will 
include specific questions about online shopping. It now lumps 
those figures together with catalog sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``As 'e-tailing' takes off, retailers, manufacturers and  
investors will have a need for ever more accurate statistics,'' 
Commerce Secretary William Daley said. ``It's an acknowledgment 
that this is worthy of separating out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But because the current retail survey was mailed last month  
without any questions about Internet sales, the department said 
online shopping figures for 1998 and 1999 won't be released until 
mid-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay means last year's figures will be fully 18 months old,  
the equivalent of several generations in fast-changing ``Internet 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``On the Internet, the cycle is so unbelievably fast,'' said  
Juliana Nelson, an analyst with International Data Corp. who 
produced a private study earlier this week about Internet shopping. 
``You have to learn to dance in that time frame. If you can't, 
forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said government estimates will be ``a nice affirmation 18  
months later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another private analyst, James McQuivey of Forrester Research  
Inc., said the announcement indicates the government attaches 
importance to Internet shopping, which represents less than 1 
percent of all retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It validates this category of sales,'' McQuivey said. ``The  
government doesn't do anything quickly. For them to realize they 
need to measure this, it sends a pretty strong signal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even as the government cited private industry figures  
showing consumers spent $9 billion online last year, it warned that 
growth of electronic commerce will wane unless shoppers trust that 
personal information -- their names and buying preferences -- will be 
kept private. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't want people selling information about which books I  
buy, or what records I buy,'' said Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the 
Federal Trade Commission. ``The Internet is probably going to grow, 
anyway. It's just not going to grow as fast until these concerns 
are addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers have to feel as comfortable doing business in  
cyberspace as they do on Main Street,'' Daley added during a joint 
news conference at the FTC's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Daley and Pitofsky lauded the online industry generally for  
improving the protection of consumer privacy on the Internet. But 
they said the Clinton administration wants continued efforts, and 
they warned that new privacy legislation could be passed to mandate 
such protections. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has taken some strong prodding,'' Daley said. ``This year,  
I want to see more progress, especially among smaller companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has criticized the online industry for its failure to  
protect privacy rights, and the agency successfully pressed last 
year for a new law that prohibits Web sites from collecting 
personal information from children without their parents' 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, merchants probably aren't paying enough  
attention to this,'' McQuivey said. ``I hope the warnings work. My 
worst-case scenario is that regulation becomes required.''

<HEADLINE>  Philippines Executes Child Rapist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A house painter convicted of raping  
his 10-year-old stepdaughter was executed today, the first inmate 
to be put to death in the Philippines in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Echegaray, whose execution had set off a furious debate here  
over the death penalty, died by lethal injection at the national 
penitentiary in the Manila suburb of Muntinlupa. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was tight around the prison. Nearby schools were closed  
and barbed-wire barricades were erected at the prison gates to hold 
back large numbers of reporters and demonstrators for and against 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said Echegaray's final words  
were: ``I ask forgiveness from the Filipino people for the crimes I 
am accused of. A Filipino has killed a fellow Filipino,'' an 
apparent reference to his execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Echegaray's case had set off an emotion-packed debate over the  
country's resumption of capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Filipinos back the death penalty because of exasperation  
over widespread crime. But others, led by the Catholic Church, said 
killing is wrong and there is no proof that capital punishment 
reduces crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Death penalty advocates outside the prison lit candles near a  
row of pictures of victims of violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Starting today, criminals will think twice,'' said Rafael  
Caransehas, a motorcycle taxi driver. ``This is the signal 
Filipinos have been waiting for the government to send.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the  
Philippines, Oscar Cruz, called it a ``sad day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is taken away -- not by accident, not by sickness, not  
even by a criminal. But by no less than the state,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty International said the execution ``marks a huge step in  
the wrong direction for human rights in the Philippines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Joseph Estrada had steadfastly refused to stop  
Echegaray's execution, despite pleas from the Vatican, European 
Union and human rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's execution is proof of the government's determination  
to maintain law and order,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But he left open the possibility he might grant clemency to  
other death-row inmates if their crimes were committed as a result 
of extreme poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	ABS-CBN, the country's largest television network, had broadcast  
a countdown timer showing how many hundredths of seconds remained 
until Echegaray's death. 
</P>
<P>
	At a jail in suburban Quezon City, prisoners formed a human  
rosary and prayed. When the news came that Echegaray was dead, they 
lit candles and pinned black ribbons on their chests. 
</P>
<P>
	Echegaray's wife, Zenaida, told The Associated Press his last  
words to her during a meeting Thursday: ``Tell the people that I'm 
innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The execution had originally been scheduled for Jan. 4. But just  
three hours before Echegaray was to be put to death, the Supreme 
Court ordered a six-month delay so that Congress could reconsider 
the death penalty law. Congress later voted not to revise the law, 
and the court ordered the execution to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Echegaray's lawyers had tried to postpone the  
execution with a last-minute appeal to the Supreme Court, saying 
they had not received a copy of the government's revised rules for 
executions. The appeal was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippines abolished the death penalty in 1987 but restored  
it in January 1994 in response to widespread crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, 915 people have been sentenced to death. Eight of  
them could be executed this year, officials said.

	Echegaray's wife, Zenaida, told The Associated Press his last  
words to her during a meeting Thursday: ``Tell the people that I'm 
innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The execution had originally been scheduled for Jan. 4. But just  
three hours before Echegaray was to be put to death, the Supreme 
Court ordered a six-month delay so that Congress could reconsider 
the death penalty law. Congress later voted not to revise the law, 
and the court ordered the execution to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Echegaray's lawyers had tried to postpone the  
execution with a last-minute appeal to the Supreme Court, saying 
they had not received a copy of the government's revised rules for 
executions. The appeal was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippines abolished the death penalty in 1987 but restored  
it in January 1994 in response to widespread crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, 915 people have been sentenced to death. Eight of  
them could be executed this year, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Starr Lawyers Discuss Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two former and one current member of Kenneth  
Starr's prosecutorial team insisted they did not leak the story of 
the independent counsel's belief that he has the authority to 
indict President Clinton while the president remains in office. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was silent when asked if there is a sealed indictment  
against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``To read that people in the office were leaking was  
demoralizing,'' said Michael Emmick, associate independent counsel. 
``It made me want to start strangling people. It was mortifying. I 
hope it turns out it was all a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick, a former member of the U.S. attorney's office in Los  
Angeles, was a panelist Thursday at a program titled ``Starr 
Gazing.'' It was sponsored by the Los Angeles County Bar in 
conjunction with the American Bar Association's midwinter meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick and former Starr staff members Karin Immergut and Thomas  
Bienert fielded a barrage of questions from fellow lawyers and 
reporters. Earlier, Emmick used a large chart to present the case 
for preserving the independent counsel law, which is due to expire 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does the (independent counsel) act create monsters --  
overzealous, obsessive, independent counsels on a mission to 'get' 
their targets,'' one chart read. 
</P>
<P>
	His answer was no. But he was challenged by panelists Neil  
Eggleston, a counsel to the Office of the President, and Ted Wells, 
the defense attorney who won an acquittal on corruption charges for 
former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monsters?'' Wells said. ``These three people seem very nice at  
dinner. But something happens to you when you go to the independent 
counsel office. ... They become crazed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said unlimited finances and time allotted to the independent  
counsel is ``an invitation to a witchhunt'' and he called some of 
their legal positions ``wacky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immergut, who served with Starr for four months in 1998, said  
when she arrived there was ``a siege mentality which emanated from 
the White House attitude toward Ken Starr. ... We were so concerned 
with leaks. We only had each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immergut, now a state prosecutor in Portland, Ore., said she  
almost declined the request to work for Starr because ``I thought I 
would never get a job again. ... People thought that I was crazy 
because I would be branded part of the right wing conspiracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moderator Laurie Levenson, associate dean of Loyola University  
Law School, challenged both Emmick and Immergut on their treatment 
of Monica Lewinsky and asked whether the key witness was ``broken'' 
during questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Immergut said she asked all the personal questions and  
complained that ``as I asked those questions I did not anticipate 
that was for dissemination over the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick, who was the first to quiz Lewinsky in a Washington hotel  
room, acknowledged it was ``a stressful and traumatic day for 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He confirmed that Lewinsky was advised not to call a lawyer who  
had been representing her in civil depositions. He defended the 
action, citing a later court decision that Lewinsky's right to 
counsel was not violated because no charges had been brought 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick said he and other members of the team believed that her  
civil lawyer, Frank Carter, did not handle criminal litigation, a 
statement greeted with some skepticism by his questioners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Didn't she ask to speak with him?'' asked a lawyer in the  
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes and gosh I'm glad you asked that question,'' said Emmick  
who then cited the ruling by U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway 
Johnson on the issue. ``We actually gave her the names of a public 
defender and a legal aid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of Lewinsky's treatment, he said, ``When you're asked to  
cooperate in an investigation of this kind it's going to be hellish 
no matter how nice you are to her. It's a nightmare. That's one of 
the ugly truths about law enforcement. It's very ugly at times. We 
tried to make it as undifficult as we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the explicit sexual detail contained in Starr's report,  
Bienert said, ``For my taste, I would like to have seen less 
detail.'' But he blamed President Clinton for putting at issue the 
definition of what is sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``It forced the office to get into details,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Levenson's final question -- ``Is there a sealed indictment?'' --  
elicited only silence from all members of the panel.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Holds at 28-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate held at a  
28-year low of 4.3 percent in January with retailers, financial and 
real estate firms and construction companies all reporting job 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted rate matched the level achieved in  
December and last April, and before that in 1970, the Labor 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers added 245,000 jobs to their payrolls -- nearly 100,000  
more than projected by economists -- on top of 298,000 in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The report shows the U.S. economy entering the new year with  
considerable momentum after growing during the final three months 
of 1998 at the fastest rate in 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	It could raise questions in financial markets about how much  
longer the Federal Reserve can resist raising short-term interest 
rates. At Fed policy-makers' most recent meeting, this week, they 
decided to hold rates unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	But Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan expressed concern in  
congressional testimony last month that labor shortages would 
propel faster wage increases, which in turn would drive up 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The traditional danger signals for the Fed, strong job growth  
and rising wages, are flashing, but I think the Fed is struggling 
because there still are no clear signs of inflation,'' said 
economist Bill Cheney of John Hancock in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates rose in U.S. credit markets after the figures  
were released. Yields on 30-year bonds, a barometer of long-term 
borrowing costs for consumers and business, climbed to 5.33 percent 
from 5.29 percent just before the data were released. The Dow Jones 
average of industrial stocks rose 41 points in the first hour of 
trading to 9,346. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's report showed the average hourly wages of nonsupervisory  
workers rising 6 cents in January to $13.04. It was the largest 
monthly increase since August. Over the year, hourly earnings have 
increased 50 cents, or 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate for whites was unchanged at 3.8 percent in  
January. But the rates for blacks, 7.8 percent, and Hispanics, 6.6 
percent, fell to the lowest levels since the government began 
tracking them in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner,  
Katharine G. Abraham, January job gains were led by services. 
Engineering and management services continued their strong growth, 
with payrolls rising by 27,000 and 17,000 jobs, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance and real estate each added 11,000 jobs. Retail  
employment rose by 30,000. Payrolls increased by 13,000 at trucking 
firms, 11,000 at communications companies and 36,000 in local 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The booming construction industry added a seasonally adjusted  
15,000 jobs even though severe weather in the Midwest and Northeast 
halted some work. Since September, construction has added 184,000 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, job losses continued in manufacturing. Payrolls fell by  
13,000 jobs, bringing job losses since last March to 285,000, 
reflecting the loss of export sales to troubled economies, 
principally in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	One bright spot was lumber and wood-products manufacturing,  
which gained 8,000 jobs, reflecting the brisk pace of construction, 
and auto manufacturing, up 6,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mining reported a drop of 9,000 jobs, reflecting the impact of  
low prices on oil production. 
</P>
<P>
	Employment gains in health services -- 6,000 -- were weak. Gains  
at medical offices were offset by a drop in home health care. 
Hospital employment was unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Miller, Jacobs Win Millrose Duels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Inger Miller and Sevatheda Fynes were all alone.  
Regina Jacobs and Suzy Hamilton might as well have been. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller joined her father as a Millrose Games champion Friday  
night, edging Fynes in a unique women's 60-meter match race, while 
Jacobs pulled away from Hamilton in the mile in another 
head-to-head battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, cheered on by father Lennox Miller, beat Fynes by 0.004  
seconds, finishing in 7.194 seconds. Miller and Fynes, who won 
their four-woman heats to reach the final, were officially timed in 
7.20. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so close, I didn't know who won,'' Miller said. ``It  
was different with just the two of us out there all alone. But you 
don't think about it when you're running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory made the Millers the first father-daughter winners  
in the meet's 92-year history. Lennox Miller won the 60-yard dash 
in 1968 and 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a thrill to be here and see her compete,'' Lennox Miller  
said. ``It brings back a lot of memories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs outdueled Hamilton in the mile, taking the lead with two  
laps remaining on Madison Square Garden's banked wood track and 
pulling away in the final half-lap 
</P>
<P>
	``Not to discount the other competitors, but it was just me and  
her,'' said Jacobs, who beat Hamilton by about 14 yards in the 
11-lap race with a time of 4:31.65. Hamilton finished in 4:33.63. 
</P>
<P>
	The rivals shook hands, and took a victory lap together.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Suzy and I made the race, so why not take a lap  
together,'' said Jacobs, who finished second to Hamilton last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say it's a love fest, but we're being more  
civil,'' Hamilton said. ``After the race, she said, `Suzy, do the 
lap with me.' That was the first time she ever said anything to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 60, Maurice Greene solidified his position as the  
world's top sprinter, overcoming a slow start to defend his title 
in 6.51 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have control at the start,'' said Greene, the 1997  
world champion. ``I didn't rush it. I just stayed calm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He failed to match his 1998 time of 6.46, the fastest ever in  
the United States, and was far short of his world indoor record of 
6.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenya's William Tanui won the Wanamaker Mile, passing Richie  
Boulet with less than a half-lap remaining and finishing in 
3:59.24. 
</P>
<P>
	Reggie Torian won the 60-meter hurdles in 7.59. Larry Wade  
finished second in 7.72, and Olympic decathlon champion Dan O'Brien 
was third in 7.76. Mark Crear, the world's top-ranked hurdler, 
false-started twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Pole vaulter Melissa Mueller set an American record, clearing 14  
feet, 8 3/4 inches -- the highest ever indoors in the United States by 
a woman -- to break the mark of 14-8 1/4 set by Stacy Dragila in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the fourth time I jumped at it, so I knew it was  
coming,'' Mueller said. ``I was going to do it sooner or later. I'm 
glad it was sooner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dawn Ellerbe broke her American record in the 20-pound weight  
throw, with a heave of 75-3 1/4. Her previous mark was 75-2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Everett won his ninth Millrose title and fourth at 500  
meters, finishing in 1:01.70. Lance Deal won his seventh Millrose 
title in the men's 35-pound weight throw with a toss of 77-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Connie Price-Smith earned her eighth Millrose title, tying the  
meet record for women held by Diane Dixon, winning the women's shot 
put at 61-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon, a quarter-miler, was inducted into the Millrose Hall of  
Fame on Friday night, along with pole vaulter Bob Richards, hurdler 
Harrison Dillard, miler Eamonn Coghlan and high jumper John Thomas.

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Has New Beer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. has combined the  
flavors of tequila and lime to make its new beer, Tequiza, due on 
store shelves Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The name of the beer is a cross between tequila and the Spanish  
word for beer, ``cerveza.'' Anheuser-Busch said it created the beer 
because many beer drinkers squirt lime in their beer and drink 
tequila on the side. 
</P>
<P>
	The alcohol content of Tequiza is no higher than that of  
Budweiser -- 5 percent. A 12-ounce bottle has 140 calories. 
</P>
<P>
	Tequiza appears to be Anheuser-Busch's response to Corona, the  
Mexican beer that has skyrocketed in popularity in the United 
States. Like Corona, Tequiza is packaged in a clear-glass bottle, 
something unusual for an Anheuser-Busch beer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to go beyond Corona,'' said Tom Pirko, head of the  
beverage industry consultant Bevmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch owns 50.2 percent of Corona's parent company. But  
it lost a recent bid to have Corona sold through Anheuser-Busch 
distributors.

	``Spanish Flea'' was recorded by Alpert and more than 60 others.  
It was used as the theme for television's ``The Dating Game'' and 
has been heard on everything from commercials to films and 
television shows.

	Wechter played marimba for Martin Denny in Hawaii for four years  
after college, returning to Los Angeles to do studio work with the 
Beach Boys, Sonny &AMP; Cher, the Righteous Brothers. That led to a 
spot in Alpert's band. 
</P>
<P>
	At Alpert's urging, Wechter formed the Baja Marimba Band, whose  
trademark song was ``Comin' in the Back Door.'' The nine-person 
group recorded 18 albums in five years.

<HEADLINE> How Health Poll Was Conducted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on health care is based on telephone  
interviews with 1,008 randomly selected adults from all states 
except Alaska and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The interviewing was conducted Jan. 29-Feb. 2 by ICR, of Media,  
Pa. The results were weighted to represent the population by key 
demographic factors such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the  
sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 percentage points 
from the answers that would be obtained if all Americans were 
polled. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll questions (because of rounding, sums may not total  
100 percent): 
</P>
<P>
	1. Which one statement best applies to your household?  
</P>
<P>
	An employer pays most or all of our health insurance, 46  
percent; you pay most or all of the costs of health insurance, 19 
percent; you are enrolled in a government health care plan such as 
Medicare or Medicaid, 19 percent; you do not have health insurance, 
14 percent; don't know/refused, 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	2. How satisfied are you with the quality of your health  
insurance coverage? 
</P>
<P>
	Very satisfied, 51 percent; somewhat satisfied, 37 percent; not  
very satisfied, 7 percent; not at all satisfied, 4 percent; don't 
know, 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	3. In your view, who has the bigger say in your health care:  
your doctor or your insurance company? 
</P>
<P>
	Doctor, 48 percent; insurance company, 41 percent; neither, 6  
percent; don't know, 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Which one of the following items is your biggest concern  
about health care? 
</P>
<P>
	The ability to pick the doctor of your choice, 28 percent; the  
quality of medical care, 23 percent; the cost of health care, 22 
percent; you have no major concerns about health care, 18 percent; 
your ability to get health insurance coverage, 8 percent; don't 
know, 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Compared to five years ago, do you believe the health care  
system in this country is: 
</P>
<P>
	Better than it was, 24 percent; worse than it was, 34 percent;  
about the same as it was, 36 percent; don't know, 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Has Tough Week at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A difficult week for Microsoft Corp. at its  
antitrust trial grew more trying when the government discredited a 
video demonstration the software giant hoped would help recoup its 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft played a new videotape at its trial Thursday, but it  
failed to include an important assertion from the original video 
that the government had challenged. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the overall results vindicated its arguments  
that government efforts to disable Internet functions within its 
Windows software cause serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft recorded the new demonstration overnight Wednesday at  
its law firm here, under the scrutiny of government lawyers and 
computer experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The video showed an IBM laptop behaving oddly, causing strange  
crashes and unusual flashing screens in parts of Windows after the 
government modified it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the system is in a very confused state,'' Microsoft  
senior vice president James Allchin said during the demonstration. 
``It's definitely not well right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The video also showed several ways to browse the Internet  
despite government attempts to prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally ``tied'' its  
Internet browser software into Windows, which forced consumers who 
use its computer operating system also to use its browser. It 
sought to modify Windows to refute Microsoft's claims that its 
browser is inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft acknowledged that it was unable to duplicate one  
disputed segment that purported to show that the government's 
tinkering caused its Internet software to run dramatically slower. 
</P>
<P>
	On the original video, another Microsoft employee said: ``It's  
taking a very long time, however -- unusually long -- to access that 
Web site. That's a result of the performance degradation that has 
occurred because of running the (government) program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Department lawyer David Boies showed that a title  
bar for the Internet software suggested Microsoft's test actually 
used a version of Windows unaltered by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	When Windows was tested with the government's changes, ``you  
didn't have this delay,'' Boies charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said Thursday it could not guarantee in its overnight  
tests that identical laptops achieved comparable connection rates 
to the Internet, which would have ensured a fair demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phone situation was a real mess,'' Allchin explained. He  
said on the new video that the obviously slow Internet performance 
``has nothing to do'' with the government's changes. 
</P>
<P>
	But spokesman Mark Murray maintained that in the company's  
previous tests, Allchin had ``personally witnessed the degradation 
under lab conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had criticized  
Microsoft's earlier video demonstration as unreliable after Boies 
pointed out inconsistencies during a single four-minute segment 
during two days of dramatic courtroom confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin eventually explained that Microsoft had edited together  
video segments of several different computers so it appeared a 
single computer was being tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said Thursday that the flawed video had been intended as  
``an illustration of what we found in the laboratory.'' Microsoft 
lawyer Steven Holley called it ``now infamous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resumes Monday.

<HEADLINE> Louisville Postseason Ban Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Louisville is back in the race for an  
NCAA tournament berth. The question is, are the Cardinals good 
enough for an invitation? 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA on Friday overturned a postseason ban for the first  
time, giving Louisville's basketball team a chance to play in a 
March tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	An NCAA appeals committee cited ``procedural error'' in the case  
of NCAA violations by former Louisville assistant coach Scooter 
McCray. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said Louisville and McCray were not adequately  
warned about the seriousness of the violations, and that may have 
altered their defense before the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been something that's been held over our head, and  
we've been penalized in a lot of ways,'' Louisville coach Denny 
Crum said. ``But we're happy now that it's over, that it's all 
behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling makes the Cardinals eligible for postseason play just  
four weeks before the start of the Conference USA tournament, which 
Louisville would have missed under the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Crum ranks third in NCAA tournament history with 21 appearances  
and 42 victories. His teams have a history of strong runs in 
February, and Crum said this team (11-7, 6-3 Conference USA) has a 
``legitimate shot'' at reaching the NCAA tournament despite a 
recent slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to prove that we belong in the tournament,'' said Nate  
Johnson, the Cardinals' leading scorer who recently was sidelined 
with a foot infection. ``When we score 80 and above points, it's 
hard to beat us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals beat Memphis 89-76 Thursday night to snap a  
four-game losing skid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy we can go on with the season,'' said Cameron Murray,  
a senior guard given one last chance to play in the NCAA 
tournament. ``It's another emotional high for us after our win last 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville did not appeal its other penalties, including a  
three-year probation and the loss of three scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	In its investigation, the NCAA found that McCray secured a  
discounted hotel room in September 1996 for Fred Johnson, the 
father of forward Nate Johnson, and later provided his personal 
credit card to keep him from being evicted because of a delinquent 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really got caught up in it ... it's just fortunate  
that it came out on our side,'' Nate Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville President John Shumaker said his school was  
handicapped by not knowing the infractions committee considered the 
violations ``major.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Stein, acting chairman of the appeals committee, compared  
the situation to a trial in which a person charged with a 
misdemeanor was found guilty of a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an error that occurred here,'' Stein said. He said  
it was the first time the NCAA had lifted a postseason ban. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, NCAA investigator Rich Hilliard said the enforcement  
staff didn't consider Louisville a ``repeat violator'' because he 
didn't consider the violations major. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville was already on probation because of former player  
Samaki Walker's use of two cars in 1995. The school didn't argue 
the point, but it became the crux of the committee's assessment of 
severe penalties. Louisville was deemed a ``repeat violator,'' 
receiving a postseason ban and other penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	McCray, who has since been reassigned in the athletic  
department, shared in the victory. In a separate appeal involving 
McCray, the NCAA said the former assistant also was not adequately 
warned and lifted a requirement that any school wanting to hire 
McCray needed NCAA permission.

<HEADLINE> The '60s: Not Much To Dig </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The '60s, according to ``The '60s,'' began with  
JFK and ended, right on cue, with love and peace and a backyard 
barbecue. What a long, strange trip it isn't. It's a miniseries for 
the February sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
	But any TV drama that tries to shrink-wrap into just three hours  
(minus the commercials) a complex, still-argued-over era -- well, 
such an undertaking is almost certain to prove shallow, 
self-conscious and, worst of all, safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The '60s'' is all that and less. Airing Sunday and Monday from  
9 to 11 p.m. EST on NBC, this is not so much a drama as a survey 
course: The '60s for Dummies. Soundtrack album optional. 
</P>
<P>
	A simple view of the 1960s is: bad war, social wrongs, revved  
kids, alarmed adults. Plus rock music, and drugs and sex to go with 
it. So put that in your bong and smoke it. Which ``The '60s'' does. 
It just doesn't inhale. 
</P>
<P>
	Safe for children, reassuring for grownups, ``The '60s'' is  
network TV at its most patronizing. (Brace yourself for this 
sanitized version of the '60s battle cry: ``Up against the wall, 
mother!'') Nothing we believe is challenged or enlarged upon, just 
reiterated. Can you dig it? ``The '60s'' will probably be a hit. 
Maybe spawn a sequel. 
</P>
<P>
	As noted above, ``The '60s'' begins its rote journey with a  
glimpse of 1960 presidential candidate John F. Kennedy. Then it 
skips to 1962, hooking up with the about-to-be-shattered Herlihy 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	In their working-class Chicago neighborhood, Bill (Bill  
Smitrovich) and Mary (Annie Corley) are scandalized when their 
16-year-old daughter dances the Twist at her Catholic high school 
prom. Branded a libertine, Katie (Julia Stiles) will drop out and 
turn on in the Summer of Love. 
</P>
<P>
	Football hero son Brian (Jerry O'Connell) joins the Marines --  
``Ahhh, that's OK, Ma, we're not even at war with anybody.'' Then 
he'll return from 'Nam a husk of his former happy-go-lucky self. 
</P>
<P>
	And soft-hearted Michael (Josh Hamilton) eases into the civil  
rights cause. Then, much to his father's disgust, he embraces the 
anti-war movement -- and, by the way, a chaste romance with Sarah 
(Jordana Brewster), a fellow student activist. 
</P>
<P>
	No less schematic is the B-story, which centers on the Rev.  
Willie Taylor (Charles Dutton), an almost saintly black minister 
preaching nonviolence in segregated Greenwood, Miss. After his 
church is torched, he takes his family to the Watts community of 
Los Angeles for a fresh start, where, of course, more trouble 
awaits. 
</P>
<P>
	A long, strange trip? ``The '60s'' is connect-the-dots history  
with hopscotch locales, populated by a miserly clutch of extras 
(which makes The Movement seem oddly small-time) and patched 
together with archival footage. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, paving the way for that much-hyped soundtrack album, ``The  
'60s'' grooves to the music of its day. 
</P>
<P>
	When President Kennedy is killed, Simon &AMP; Garfunkel's ``Old  
Friends/Bookends'' telegraphs the nation's sense of loss. The 1965 
Watts riot becomes a music video for Bob Dylan's ``Like a Rolling 
Stone.'' Draft induction? The Moody Blues' ``Tuesday Afternoon.'' 
Chicago, 1968? ``Break on Through'' by the Doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Music is always in the air, rushed to the scene to substitute  
the ready-made appeal of those anthems for what the film fails to 
dramatize with any authenticity: the events that inspired those 
songs. Despite the producers' talk of ``reappraising'' the decade, 
``The '60s'' settles for a pop-culture trip down memory lane. 
</P>
<P>
	And the final destination? On a gentle afternoon in 1969, family  
and friends munch hot dogs and play touch football at the 
Herlihys', where all is forgiven. The film aims to leave us 
satisfied that, with the end of both the '60s and ``The '60s,'' 
everyone lived happily ever after. And that whatever future bummers 
loomed -- like, say, the Kent State shootings in May 1970 -- they 
need not concern us. That's for some other TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a cramped auditorium on Dec. 1, 1969 -- smack within the  
purview of ``The '60s'' -- Selective Service representatives plucked 
366 dates from a large glass bowl, then posted each card in order 
on a board. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in college dorms and living rooms across the land,  
young men huddled before TV sets to learn where fate would rank 
their birthdays in this, the first draft lottery since World War 
II. For anyone who wondered, here was proof: The '60s weren't about 
to end. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no consensus, even today, on when it did. But this much  
is clear: What we call the '60s conforms to no calendar. And if 
``The '60s'' had chosen to do otherwise, maybe it wouldn't be quite 
such a cop-out. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	GRIEVING PARENTS: Judy and Dennis Shepard talk publicly about  
last October's beating death of their son Matthew on ``Dateline 
NBC' tonight at 9 p.m. EST. The Shepards tell Katie Couric they 
regard Matthew as their son, not as a gay murder victim, and they 
don't want activists to use him to further their political agendas. 
``It's a very frightening concept as a parent that your son now 
becomes a martyr, a public figure for the world. He's just our 
son,'' Judy says.

<HEADLINE> NASA Reschedules Shuttle Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA was forced to rearrange its  
entire shuttle flight schedule Friday because of trouble with an 
X-ray telescope and Russia's inability to get a crucial piece of 
the international space station into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	That will mean five shuttle flights in 1999 instead of six.  
That's fewer than the seven or eight per year desired by NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	That also will mean a gap of nearly six months between shuttle  
launches, from last December until May, when the next mission is 
now targeted. That's the longest gap since the 2 1/2-year hiatus 
following the 1986 Challenger disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks ago, NASA discovered faulty circuit boards in its  
$1.5 billion Chandra X-ray telescope. What's more, the cash crunch 
in Russia has led to another delay in completing the crucial 
service module for the international space station. 
</P>
<P>
	The X-ray telescope was supposed to soar aboard space shuttle  
Columbia in April. But NASA on Friday postponed the launch until 
July because it will take weeks and perhaps months to replace the 
four bad circuit boards. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful Chandra, named after a Nobel-winning  
astrophysicist, is intended to detect faint sources of cosmic 
X-rays, such as quasars, exploded stars and possibly black holes. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said that instead of Columbia, Discovery will be the next  
shuttle to lift off, ferrying supplies to the international space 
station in late May. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia will follow on July 9 with the first female shuttle  
commander, Eileen Collins, at the helm. That's nearly a year past 
the original launch date, a delay that already has cost NASA $39 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian service module, which contains all the life-support  
systems for the fledgling station, is expected to be launched no 
earlier than September. The Russians had promised to have it ready 
by July; that's already more than a year late. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the delays, NASA on Friday bumped Atlantis' station  
ferry flight from August to October and Discovery's ferry flight 
from October to December. Those missions cannot be accomplished 
until the service module is in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other shuttle flight this year is a radar-mapping  
mission by Endeavour in September.

<HEADLINE> Vernon Jordan Annoyed by Questioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From the outset, it was clear that  
presidential friend Vernon Jordan was more than a little annoyed 
about answering questions again regarding his job search for Monica 
Lewinsky -- especially from a Republican House prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Transcripts released Friday from Jordan's deposition earlier  
this week reveal glimpses of a famous, powerful lawyer who is 
treated with great respect by the House prosecutor, Rep. Asa 
Hutchinson of Arkansas. Jordan, meanwhile, seems by turns jovial 
and dismissive. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the questioning, Hutchinson told Jordan, ``I've looked  
forward to this opportunity to meet you,'' to which Jordan jokingly 
replied: ``I can't say that the feeling is mutual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly understand,'' Hutchinson commented as those in the  
room laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, Jordan reacted with apparent disdain when  
Hutchinson asked him to define what ``making rain'' means at the 
800-lawyer firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think even in Arkansas you understand what rainmaking is,''  
Jordan said before defining his job as one that brings in new 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've read (John) Grisham books,'' said Hutchinson, referring  
to the lawyer-turned-novelist who wrote ``The Rainmaker,'' which 
was made into a movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Jordan said he once charged upwards of $500 an hour but  
now has moved beyond billing clients. ``Not bad for a Georgia 
boy,'' he said. ``I'm from Georgia. You've heard of that state, I'm 
sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Jordan's testimony covers familiar ground: that he  
helped Ms. Lewinsky look for a New York job using high-level 
contacts at Revlon and elsewhere and that he often helps people 
find jobs; that President Clinton was concerned and was kept 
apprised of the search; that Ms. Lewinsky denied to him that she 
was having a sexual relationship with Clinton, and that the job 
search was not linked to Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit denying the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, Jordan said he called Clinton the day Ms. Lewinsky  
signed the affidavit because the president ``was obviously 
interested in her job search ... I would say, 'Mr. President, she 
signed the affidavit. She signed the affidavit.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``And what was his response?'' Hutchinson asked.  
</P>
<P>
	```Thank you very much,''' Jordan replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan was forced to correct earlier testimony denying that he'd  
met Ms. Lewinsky for breakfast at the Park Hyatt hotel on Dec. 31, 
1997, after Hutchinson confronted him with credit card receipts. 
And although Jordan acknowledged they talked about love notes Ms. 
Lewinsky had written the president, Jordan flatly denied telling 
her to get rid of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Hutchinson, I'm a lawyer and I'm a loyal friend, but I'm  
not a fool, and the notion that I would suggest to anybody that 
they destroy anything just defies anything that I know about 
myself,'' Jordan said. ``So the notion that I said to her, `Go home 
and destroy notes,' is ridiculous.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Down 12.10 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower today, as some modest swings  
in the Dow Jones industrial average were outweighed by the 
continued slide of technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was off 12.10 at 9,292.40.  
Through most of the day, it stayed within a narrow range, from 20 
points higher to 20 points lower than Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, which was hit Thursday with the  
third-biggest point loss in its history, faltered again. The 
technology-dominated index fell 31.91 to 2,378.16. 
</P>
<P>
	An overall weakness in technology stocks was compounded by the  
chip makers. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices fell 2 1/16 to 16 
13/16, as investors reacted to a disappointing earnings forecast 
released Thursday and fears of an impending price war. AMD dragged 
its competitors lower as well, with Micron Technology falling 5 3/4 to 
69 7/8, and Texas Instruments down 2 3/8 to 93 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The continued decline of technology stocks has worried some  
analysts about the impact on the broader market. High-flying tech 
companies have been largely responsible for the market's overall 
advances, leading some to fear that once the technology bubble 
burst, the entire market will cave in. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, however, many analysts said the losses were primarily  
due to investors cashing in their technology stocks to lock in some 
of their recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology wasn't the only weak sector today. Brokerage stocks  
were lower across the board, from blue-chip firms like Merrill 
Lynch, which fell 2 11/16 to 70 3/8, to online brokerages, which began 
tumbling Thursday after New York state's attorney general announced 
an inquiry into their business practices. ETrade Group Inc., which 
was hampered by technical difficulties on several occasions 
Wednesday through Friday, fell 5 7/8 to 47 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also held back today by a government report that  
showed the U.S. unemployment rate held steady in January at a 
28-year low of 4.3 percent. The strong report rekindled fears that 
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, yields on 30-year bonds climbed to 5.33 percent from  
5.29 percent just before the data were released. The price, which 
moves in the opposite direction, tumbled early in the day before 
recovering during the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower today, although their  
losses were slim. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 8.54 points at 1,239.95,  
and the Russell 2000, which is dominated by small-company stocks, 
was down 3.74 at 414.05. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 4.31 points at 586.74, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was off 1.41 points at 
705.71. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to a brisk 713.7 million 
shares, ahead of Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.4 percent.  
European markets seemed to pick up on the weakness in the U.S. 
stock market, giving up early gains to finish mostly lower. 
Germany's DAX index eked out a mere 3-point gain. Britain's FT-SE 
100 closed 1.4 percent lower, and France's CAC-40 ended 0.5 percent 
lower.

<HEADLINE> States To Divide $5B Tobacco Trust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Tobacco states have tentatively decided how  
to divide a $5.15 billion trust fund for farmers struggling to 
survive in a shrinking market. Now, they have to decide how to 
define a tobacco farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	At a closed door session Thursday, about 70 people from 14  
tobacco-growing states tentatively agreed to slice up the trust 
fund using a basic quota system already employed by the federal 
Department of Agriculture, said North Carolina Attorney General 
Mike Easley and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most equitable way and what our farm groups want  
here. All states come out pretty much even with that,'' Easley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The private trust fund was created last month by tobacco-growing  
states and cigarette-makers as part of the landmark $206 billion 
settlement between the tobacco industry and 46 states. The fund's 
purpose is to aid tobacco farmers, sure to be squeezed by the 
higher cigarette prices and curbs on tobacco promotion that are 
part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, North Carolina, the largest flue-cured tobacco  
state, and Kentucky, the biggest burley tobacco producer, would 
receive the biggest shares -- 38.34 percent, or about $1.97 billion, 
and 29.97 percent, or $1.54 billion, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	But one issue that remains unresolved is how each state will  
define a tobacco farmer. Is it the holder of the quota -- the 
government's license to market tobacco -- or the tenant farmer who 
tends to the land? 
</P>
<P>
	``When it leaves here and goes back to the state level, that's  
when the civil war starts,'' said Danny McKinney, chief executive 
officer of the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative in Lexington, Ky. 
``It's going to get pretty hateful pretty darn quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to North Carolina and Kentucky, other states and  
their percentages of funds received under the quota system would 
be: Tennessee, 7.65 percent, or $394 million; South Carolina, 7.01 
percent, or $361 million; Virginia, 6.65 percent, or $342 million; 
and Georgia, 5.91 percent, or $304 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio would get 1.37 percent; Indiana, 1.17 percent; Florida,  
1.16 percent; Missouri, 0.43 percent; West Virginia, 0.28 percent; 
and Alabama, 0.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Each state likely would give up a small portion for Maryland and  
Pennsylvania tobacco farmers, who are not part of the federal 
government's quota system.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Has Tough Week at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A difficult week for Microsoft Corp. at its  
antitrust trial grew more trying when the government discredited a 
video demonstration the software giant hoped would help recoup its 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft played a new videotape at its trial Thursday, but it  
failed to include an important assertion from the original video 
that the government had challenged. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the overall results vindicated its arguments  
that government efforts to disable Internet functions within its 
Windows software cause serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft recorded the new demonstration overnight Wednesday at  
its law firm here, under the scrutiny of government lawyers and 
computer experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The video showed an IBM laptop behaving oddly, causing strange  
crashes and unusual flashing screens in parts of Windows after the 
government modified it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the system is in a very confused state,'' Microsoft  
senior vice president James Allchin said during the demonstration. 
``It's definitely not well right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The video also showed several ways to browse the Internet  
despite government attempts to prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally ``tied'' its  
Internet browser software into Windows, which forced consumers who 
use its computer operating system also to use its browser. It 
sought to modify Windows to refute Microsoft's claims that its 
browser is inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft acknowledged that it was unable to duplicate one  
disputed segment that purported to show that the government's 
tinkering caused its Internet software to run dramatically slower. 
</P>
<P>
	On the original video, another Microsoft employee said: ``It's  
taking a very long time, however -- unusually long -- to access that 
Web site. That's a result of the performance degradation that has 
occurred because of running the (government) program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Department lawyer David Boies showed that a title  
bar for the Internet software suggested Microsoft's test actually 
used a version of Windows unaltered by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	When Windows was tested with the government's changes, ``you  
didn't have this delay,'' Boies charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said Thursday it could not guarantee in its overnight  
tests that identical laptops achieved comparable connection rates 
to the Internet, which would have ensured a fair demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phone situation was a real mess,'' Allchin explained. He  
said on the new video that the obviously slow Internet performance 
``has nothing to do'' with the government's changes. 
</P>
<P>
	But spokesman Mark Murray maintained that in the company's  
previous tests, Allchin had ``personally witnessed the degradation 
under lab conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had criticized  
Microsoft's earlier video demonstration as unreliable after Boies 
pointed out inconsistencies during a single four-minute segment 
during two days of dramatic courtroom confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin eventually explained that Microsoft had edited together  
video segments of several different computers so it appeared a 
single computer was being tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said Thursday that the flawed video had been intended as  
``an illustration of what we found in the laboratory.'' Microsoft 
lawyer Steven Holley called it ``now infamous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial resumes Monday.

<HEADLINE> Amoco To Cut 1,500 Chicago Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- BP Amoco said it expects to cut 1,500 management  
and non-management jobs in the Chicago area in the next 18 months, 
eliminating almost one in four positions here. 
</P>
<P>
	The move stems from the merger of British Petroleum Co. and  
Amoco Corp. last year and from the continuing slump in world oil 
prices, the company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the cuts will be at the company's downtown Chicago  
skyscraper, the former Amoco headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based conglomerate said the majority of those losing  
jobs will be gone by the end of April. But a few decisions won't be 
made until early 2000, said BP Amoco spokeswoman Vicky Kastory. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the company promised that 200 jobs will move  
to Chicago over the next 18 months, and it pledged to make Chicago 
the world headquarters for its chemical operations, which would 
bring more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes six months after the company suggested  
that the merger would result in Chicago gaining jobs. But 
continuing low energy prices have helped turned an expected gain 
into a loss, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been struck by a continuation of low worldwide oil  
prices. There will be some job reductions as a result of reduced 
spending (and) as a result of low energy prices,'' Kastory said. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco employs close to 6,300 people in the Chicago area

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Gives Oil Producers Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Gov. Frank Keating signed a bill Friday  
providing $29 million in emergency tax relief to Oklahoma's oil 
industry, which has been ailing because of some of the lowest oil 
prices since the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature approved the measure overwhelmingly during a  
special session called by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation reduces the levy on oil from 7 percent to 4  
percent when the price drops between $14 and $17 a barrel. The tax 
falls to 1 percent when the price goes below $14 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil prices in Oklahoma have hovered between $8 and $9.75 for the  
last several weeks. Keating said the break-even point for oil 
producers is $12 to $14 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill simply says the tax man is not coming until you are  
making a profit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay for the tax relief, lawmakers approved budget cuts  
averaging 3.6 percent for the last four months of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill, in and of itself, will not save the oil industry,''  
Keating said. ``But it certainly will assist operators and mineral 
owners through this struggle. The oil industry is one of Oklahoma's 
most vital of job providers and tax providers.''

<HEADLINE> Jesse Ventura, Garrison Keillor Feud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A book titled ``Me'' has Gov. Jesse  
Ventura asking: What about ME? 
</P>
<P>
	Garrison Keillor, host of public radio's ``A Prairie Home  
Companion,'' wrote the book, a political satire based loosely on 
Ventura's election. Keillor said the book is a ``rather genial 
novel, not mean at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ventura, the former pro wrestler who won election as a  
third-party candidate in November, said that ``writing a book based 
upon me, without my permission, without any of my involvement'' 
amounts to ``cheating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tension already exists between Keillor and Ventura.  
</P>
<P>
	In a Time magazine essay after the election, Keillor called the  
governor ``this great big honking bullet-headed shovel-faced mutha 
who talks in a steroid growl and doesn't stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Ventura proposed gradually eliminating state money  
for public radio and television. And on Monday, he singled out 
Keillor's income for criticism. ``I'd like to see his W-2,'' 
Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keillor said he is sorry to hear the governor is steamed.  
</P>
<P>
	``A Minnesota humorist would be crazy to ignore Mr. Ventura,''  
Keillor said. ``He is the best show in town. Every 10-year-old in 
Minnesota does a Jesse imitation.''

<HEADLINE> Man Free After 16 Years on Death Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man who spent 16 years on death row for a  
double murder was freed today after college journalists uncovered 
new evidence and another man confessed to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook County Criminal Courts Judge Thomas Fitzgerald said there  
were ``news reports of significant evidentiary developments'' that 
would put into question whether Anthony Porter actually committed 
the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, 43, was allowed to leave prison without having to post  
bond. He will stay free while prosecutors study the new confession. 
</P>
<P>
	The release was based on a motion filed by the county state's  
attorney's office. However, Porter remains charged with the 1982 
murders of Jerry Hillard, 18, and Marilyn Green, 19, who were 
gunned down in a Chicago park. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter had his arms around his two attorneys as he heard the  
judge's decision. While he appeared elated by the news, he did not 
speak to reporters as he was taken back to the county Jail to be 
processed before leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Terri Marroquin, one of Porter's attorneys, said ``there was a  
lot of crying and a lot of hugging'' after the ruling. She said 
Porter was going to live with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the day after another man was videotaped confessing  
to the slayings, Porter had said: ``I'm not angry now. I thank God 
everything came out all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant State's Attorney David Erickson called it ``a good  
thing'' when reporters and others get involved in the criminal 
justice system and said, ``I commend the students.'' He said it was 
too early to say whether Porter would get an apology from 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter was scheduled to die by injection last September, but the  
state Supreme Court stopped the execution two days earlier amid 
questions about his mental fitness. Defense attorneys argued 
Porter, who has an IQ of 51, could not understand what was 
happening to him or help in his appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Then questions arose about the integrity of the conviction. A  
prosecution witness allegedly recanted his testimony implicating 
Porter, saying police had pressured him. 
</P>
<P>
	And two weeks ago, students in Northwestern University's  
investigative reporting class, who were looking into Porter's 
claims of innocence, tracked down a witness in Milwaukee who 
identified her ex-husband as the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, journalism professor David Protess, private  
investigator Paul Ciolino and several students visited the witness, 
Inez Jackson, who said her former husband, Alstory Simon, pulled 
the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
	They confronted Simon five days later with Jackson's statement  
and her signed affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon at first denied the shootings, but then said he fired at  
the two in self defense when he thought the male victim was 
reaching for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must have close to busted off about six rounds,'' Simon said  
on the videotape made by Ciolino. 
</P>
<P>
	``My students certainly feel that they've contributed to saving  
a life,'' Protess said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The case would not the first in which the professor and students  
of his saved a life. In June 1996, four men who had spent 18 years 
behind bars for murder were released after Northwestern students 
working with Ciolino discovered new evidence. Two of the four had 
been on death row. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter said Thursday he wanted to hug his mother, seven children  
and six grandchildren. He said he also wants to help people in his 
community and ``teach them right from wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A steak would be fine and maybe some dinner rolls,'' he said.

<P>
	CROSSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Byron (Low Tax) Looper pleaded innocent  
Friday to charges of murdering his political rival, state Sen. 
Tommy Burks, two weeks before the fall election. 
</P>
<P>
	Looper, the former county property assessor, was arrested days  
after Burks, 54, was killed by a single gunshot at his farm on Oct. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
	Looper, 34, remains held without bond until prosecutors decide  
whether they will seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing is scheduled for Feb. 18 on more than 60 motions,  
including a defense request to move the trial to a neighboring 
county because of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides say they have strong cases.  
</P>
<P>
	``We absolutely intend to show (Looper's innocence) at trial. I  
think the proof will show that when all is said and done,'' defense 
attorney Doug Trant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Bill Gibson said, ``It's not a case I sit up nights  
sweating about. It is a solid case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burks' wife won a write-in campaign to keep the seat Burks had  
held for two decades. Meantime, Looper -- who had his name legally 
changed to Byron (Low Tax) Looper -- was ousted as property assessor 
and Burks' daughter, Kim Burks Blaylock, is considered the 
front-runner to replace him.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Rejects Big Ten Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Notre Dame will still stand alone in football, as  
it has for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
	The university rejected an invitation to join the Big Ten on  
Friday, intent on preserving its unique national identity and 
fearing the move would hurt football recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	University trustees followed the recommendation of university  
president Edward Malloy and nine senior university officials and 
voted unanimously Friday against the Big Ten's overture. 
</P>
<P>
	The storied football program, independent for 111 years, is  
perhaps the nation's most successful and visible football school, 
featuring a coast-to-coast schedule and impassioned alumni across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notre Dame has a distinct identity that is the product of more  
than a century and a half of institutional independence,'' Malloy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Catholic university with a national constituency we  
believe independence continues to be our best way forward, not just 
in athletics, but first and foremost in the fulfillment of our 
academic aspirations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was announced in connection with the dedication  
this weekend of Notre Dame's new academic center just off Trafalgar 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Football coach Bob Davie, speaking in South Bend, Ind., said the  
decision was bigger than football. 
</P>
<P>
	``It involved a reinforcement of the heritage and culture of the  
institution -- not only looking back into the past, but also 
projecting where Notre Dame expects to be in the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Malloy presented the Big Ten proposal in October to the  
55-member board and said the issue had drawn the most interest of 
any during his term as president. The school's alumni association 
reported 99.5 percent of its members opposed changing Notre Dame's 
``brand name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the move was opposed by students, alumni and the athletic  
department, it had some support in academic circles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Ten affiliation would have made Notre Dame a member of  
the Committee on Intercollegiate Cooperation, a consortium of all 
11 Big Ten schools and one-time conference member the University of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the school's Faculty Senate voted 25-4 in favor of  
joining the CIC, but made no mention of the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a slam dunk by any stretch of the imagination,''  
said Rev. William Beauchamp, the school's executive vice president. 
``It was very complex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame athletic director Mike Wadsworth said his department  
unanimously opposed the move despite more and more bowls aligning 
with conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	By joining the Big Ten, he said the Irish would have received  
between $1 million and $4 million less in income in 2007 -- the 
first year they would have played a full Big Ten schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our projection indicated a small economic disadvantage of  
joining, but it was not a material difference when you look at 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That loss would have been ``inconsequential'' in a budget  
projected to be $500 million in 2007, Wadsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the football program has been the engine that has  
driven the athletic department for so many years, that concern 
outweighed the other advantages,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wadsworth said the move would have hurt football recruiting, a  
suggestion backed up by football safety Tony Driver, a sophomore 
from Louisville, Ky., who termed Notre Dame as having ``mystic'' 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would take some of the uniqueness out of the university,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk so much internally about recruiting and the nature of  
our admissions requirements and being a smaller school,'' Wadsworth 
added. ``One of the things we always had as an advantage is the 
selling of the national program, that and television exposure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By joining the conference, Notre Dame would have been competing  
against state universities three or four times its size with 
``essentially open admission policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if being an independent would eventually lock the Irish  
out of bowls, Wadsworth said: ``We feel that we have to have 
basically the same kind of record to play our way in as an 
independent that we would have to have to win the Big Ten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an independent, Notre Dame keeps all its gate receipts, all  
bowl proceeds and an estimated $7 million annually in an exclusive 
TV contract with NBC -- expected to jump to $8 million a year for 
the 2000-2005 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	As a Big Ten member, Notre Dame would have been part of a  
revenue-sharing program that divides part of each school's gate 
receipts from football and basketball, bowl revenues, TV contracts 
and proceeds from the NCAA basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Ten is expected to woo other schools -- with Syracuse or  
Missouri reportedly the likely candidates -- to give the conference 
12 members instead of an unwieldy 11.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- President Nelson Mandela opened  
Parliament for the last time today and said he hoped to set South 
Africa's second all-race elections for this May. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement, in a speech many saw as his valedictory  
address as president, was his most specific statement yet on the 
timing of the vote. Parliament still must work out constitutional 
wrinkles before he can formally fix the day.

consultations, that we aim to select a day for our second national 
election in the period between the 18th and 27th of May,'' Mandela 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first national balloting since the fall of apartheid in  
1994's all-race vote had long been expected to be in May, the 
beginning of a 90-day window set by the constitution for elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials want them to take place before the southern hemisphere  
winter sets in to ensure higher turnout. South Africa's political 
parties have been pressing for a date to be set so the campaign can 
begin in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela plans to retire after the elections, and the next  
parliamentary session will almost certainly be opened by Deputy 
President Thabo Mbeki, Mandela's heir apparent who is the heavy 
favorite to win the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's ceremony provides South Africans with a chance to look  
back on the ``Mandela era,'' which transformed the country from a 
racist, pariah state to a major, regional diplomatic power. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Mandela lauded the achievements of his African  
National Congress party in bringing basic services to millions of 
poor blacks ignored under apartheid's racist laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In five years, the government has brought clean water to 3  
million people and connected more than 2 million people to the 
electricity grid, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said the work to create a better standard of living  
for all South Africans was not completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not time to pause. The long walk is not yet over. The  
prize of a better life has yet to be won,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela acknowledged that much of the euphoria that greeted the  
1994 vote has worn off in the face of continuing racial divisions, 
high violent crime rates and economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned that racial tension was destroying the country and  
souring its image abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``This must come to an end. For, indeed, those who thrive on  
hatred destroy their own capacity to make a positive 
contribution,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On crime, Mandela insisted that police were doing a good job. He  
said murder rates had fallen 10 percent since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me reiterate. The battle against crime has been joined and  
we have no doubts at all who the victors will be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela also raised the issue of a spate of bombings on police  
in Cape Town, believed to be linked to an Islamic vigilante group, 
People Against Gangsterism and Drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Mandela did not mention the group by name, his  
implication was clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``This campaign is rotten to the core. It is misguided and its  
attempts to invoke religion is blasphemous,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In keeping with his lifelong message, Mandela's key theme was  
one of hope and building for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The foundation has been laid. The building is in progress,''  
he concluded. ``With a new generation of leaders and a people that 
rolls up its sleeves in partnerships for change, we can and shall 
build the country of our dreams.''

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted of Triple Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A married man who admitted strangling  
his mistress and their two small boys to keep her silent about the 
affair has been convicted of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Contos, 34, faces an automatic life prison sentence  
without possibility of parole on the three first-degree murder 
convictions. He was to be formally sentenced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agreed Contos' double life led to the September 1997  
killings of Catherine Rice, 35, and their two boys -- Benjamin Rice, 
4, and 2-month-old Ryan Contos. 
</P>
<P>
	Contos admitted he strangled all three at their Lowell home, and  
that he then stuffed the boys' bodies in his locker at Otis Air 
National Guard Base in Bourne on Cape Cod. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Stephen Hrones, a former technical sergeant at  
the base, argued the crime happened in the heat of the moment and 
was manslaughter, which would have carried a sentence with a 
maximum of 20 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Contos and his wife lived in Stoneham while he kept up an affair  
with Rice. She allegedly was threatening to expose the relationship 
to his wife when Contos killed her. 
</P>
<P>
	Hrones portrayed Contos as the product of a troubled childhood,  
saying he simply snapped when confronted with the possible loss of 
the wife he loved. He said Contos had planned to talk with Rice -- 
not kill her -- when he went to her house the night of the murders. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors depicted Contos as a cold-hearted Don Juan who  
bragged about his ability to keep a mistress -- allegedly telling a 
buddy, ``It's good to be king.''

<HEADLINE> NFL, Arena League Establish Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The National Football League has agreed to an  
option to purchase an equity interest in the Arena Football league. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Benson, owner of the New Orleans Saints, who holds that  
city's Arena League franchise, said the announcement would be made 
on Monday when the two leagues have scheduled a joint 
teleconference. Benson's associates also have the rights to an 
Arena League franchise in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``An announcement will be made on Monday concerning an agreement  
with the Arena League,'' NFL spokesman Vince Casey said on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arena league completed its 13th season last summer with  
Orlando's 62-31 win over Tampa Bay in the Arena Bowl last Aug. 23. 
The 14-team league tends to draw young fans to high-scoring games. 
</P>
<P>
	The field is 50 yards long, with 8-yard end zones. It's 85 feet  
wide, with just another 5 feet to the wall -- and the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no punting, and balls kicked or passed off the netting  
at the back of the end zone can be caught as a live ball.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended the week lower  
Friday on the back of a drop on Wall Street overnight and continued 
concerns over rising Japanese interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks fell for the fifth straight day. The benchmark  
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 188.77 points, or 1.34 percent, 
ending the day at 13,898.08. On Thursday, the average closed down 
74.46 points, or 0.53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from worries about rising interest rates, prices were also  
pushed down by the overnight fall on Wall Street, which prompted 
Japanese institutional investors to sell in the stock futures 
market, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,304.50  
points, down 62.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 112.06 yen in late  
afternoon trading in Tokyo, down 1.72 yen from late Thursday in 
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 112.21 yen 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market will continue to monitor movements of interest  
rates and the dollar-yen rate,'' said Shoji Hirakawa, a strategist 
at Kokusai Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed sharply lower.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chip stocks, fell 248.45 points, or 2.6 percent, to close at 
9,190.20. On Thursday, the index had edged up 18.80 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Worries about a correction in the U.S. market are putting  
pressure on Hong Kong stocks,'' said Johnson Hui, research head at 
BOCI Securities Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian share prices also tumbled, with the key index falling  
3.2 percent as foreign investors began selling their stocks ahead 
of Feb. 15 -- the date they can begin repatriating frozen funds 
according to newly introduced tax regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Malaysian Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin announced  
the details of an ``exit tax'' on investment withdrawals to replace 
a one-year moratorium on foreign capital outflow which was imposed 
at the beginning of September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's benchmark Composite Index fell  
18.52 points to 555.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan share prices closed lower, with the key index  
falling to a new 33-month low as investors continued to stay away 
from the market amid fears of more corporate failures. The Weighted 
Stock Price Index fell 40.10 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,474.79, 
the lowest level since April 5, 1996, when it finished at 5377.19. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The benchmark  
NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 5.95 points, or 0.2 percent, to 
2,211.81. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares finished lower, dragged down by  
worse-than-expected inflation figures for January. The Philippine 
Stock Exchange index of 30 selected companies lost 8.46 points, or 
0.4 percent, to 1,977.84. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian stock prices gave back some of their recent  
record gains, closing lower on profit-taking despite stronger 
commodity prices overnight. The All Ordinaries Index fell 28.6 
points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,911.9. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share price closed slightly higher on bargain-hunting.  
The main Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 1.24 points, or 0.2 
percent, to 551.39. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower. The Straits Times  
Index fell 1.4 percent, or 18.72 points, to 1,360.18. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower, shrugging off an  
announcement that Japan will give $2.4 billion to help the 
Southeast Asian country balance its budget. The Composite Index 
fell 3.469 points, or 0.8 percent, to 405.553. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed marginally lower in moderate  
trading. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index slipped 0.31 
point to 337.96.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell for the fifth straight day today  
on continued worries about rising Japanese interest rates and the 
dollar's weakness against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 188.77 points,  
or 1.34 percent, ending the day at 13,898.08. On Thursday, the 
average closed down 74.46 points, or 0.53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 112.06 yen at late afternoon, down 1.72 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 112.21 yen overnight. During the day, it ranged from 111.31 yen 
to 112.34 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market will continue to monitor movements of interest  
rates and the dollar-yen rate,'' said Shoji Hirakawa, a strategist 
at Kokusai Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in yields has pushed the dollar lower. Higher yields  
have weighed on stocks as it increases corporate borrowing costs, 
while the stronger yen hurts the earnings of exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 2.360 percent from Thursday's finish of 2.190 percent, 
driving its price down to 95.79 yen from 96.97 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on Japanese government bonds have risen recently on  
nervousness over the government's plans to finance its economic 
stimulus steps by boosting the bond supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar in the afternoon was largely stuck between supportive  
remarks from senior Japanese financial officials and strong selling 
by Japanese exporters and foreign funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the United States and  
Japan agree on currency policy and the U.S. stance on currencies 
hasn't changed. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.88 yen, down  
from 128.52 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices were also weighed on by the  
overnight fall on Wall Street, which prompted Japanese 
institutional investors to sell in the futures market, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,304.50  
points, down 62.31. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 6.13 points, or 0.56 percent, to 1,084.64. The 
TOPIX closed down 6.38 points, or 0.58 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors were avoiding major moves ahead of the release  
later today of U.S. unemployment data for January. 
</P>
<P>
	Export-oriented blue chips were mostly lower this session on the  
dollar's weakness and the fall on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 366 million shares,  
up from 337.58 million shares Thursday. Declining issues 
overwhelmed advancers 766 to 341, with 182 issues unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Stars Mourn Director Alan Pakula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Film director Alan Pakula, killed in a highway  
accident when a pipe crashed through his windshield, was remembered 
by the stars who worked with him as a passionate man who always 
kept his word. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 friends and family attended a memorial service  
Thursday for Pakula, whose 16 flims included ``All the President's 
Men,'' ``Klute,'' ``Sophie's Choice'' and ``To Kill a 
Mockingbird.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners at the Broadhurst Theater included Gregory Peck, Meryl  
Streep, Kevin Kline, Harrison Ford, Glenn Close and Candice Bergen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alan was organized, civilized, passionate, unhurried,'' said  
Ms. Streep, who won an Oscar for her work in ``Sophie's Choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peck, who played Atticus Finch in ``Mockingbird,'' said the  
director ``kept his word, he made no false promises, he didn't take 
credit for the contributions of others, he stayed off the set.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pakula, 70, died Nov. 19 after a truck dropped a 7-foot pipe and  
a car kicked it up as Pakula drove by. The director's family has 
offered a reward to anyone with information on either the truck or 
its driver.

<HEADLINE> NY To Host Woodstock Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- It used to be home to bomb-toting Cold War  
B-52s. This summer, the former Griffiss Air Force Base will be the 
scene for three days of peace, love and music. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials reached a preliminary agreement Thursday to host  
the 30th anniversary of Woodstock. As many as 300,000 people are 
expected to attend the music festival at the decommissioned air 
base July 23-25. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Joe Griffo heralded the economic benefits of the show, and  
said the concert could double Oneida County's population while 
injecting as much as $30 million into the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	No acts have been lined up yet. Promoter Michael Lang said he  
hopes to have most in place by April 1. He said ticket prices would 
be comparable to the 1994 Woodstock anniversary, around $135. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents doubted a financial windfall courtesy of young  
music-lovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're lucky if they can afford the price of the ticket, a  
hot dog and a sleeping bag,'' said Nancy Graves.

<HEADLINE> USDA Defends Tainted Meat Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal food safety officials are defending  
their response to an outbreak of tainted meat at a Michigan meat 
processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Tainted meat from the Bil Mar plant in Zeeland has been linked  
to 11 deaths, five miscarriages and stillbirths and about 72 
illnesses in 14 states, according to the federal Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Bil Mar, a division of Chicago-based Sara Lee Corp., on Dec. 22  
recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and other packaged meat 
products sold under a variety of names. It said they could be 
tainted with listeria monocytogenes bacteria. The plant remains 
closed during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria are common bacteria but can pose a serious risk to  
people with weakened immune systems, as well as to the elderly, 
diabetics and pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and  
Inspection Service began investigating the plant Dec. 15 after 
consulting with the CDC on a rash of illnesses but did not have 
evidence of an ``intact'' contaminated product until several days 
later, said Margaret Glavin, associate FSIS administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lack of an absolutely firm link with the plant,''  
Glavin said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Glavin said the agency met with company officials Dec. 18  
and asked them to consider taking the product off the market. USDA 
does not have recall authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``They ultimately did do it,'' Glavin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee spokeswoman Theresa Herlevsen denied there was any such  
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not aware of any recommendations of a market withdrawal  
or a recall,'' Herlevsen said. ``It was a voluntary action ... in 
the absence of any recommendations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is not the first food safety issue at the plant, officials  
said. In 1997, the plant was closed for several days after 
inspectors found a series of sanitation discrepancies, Glavin said. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, company officials found evidence of listeria during  
environmental testing, but at that time, there was no evidence of 
listeria in the product, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the July testing, the company underwent ``very aggressive  
sanitizing and cleaning of all areas,'' Herlevsen said.

<HEADLINE>  Compliments for New Pebble Beach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The No. 5 hole at Pebble Beach  
finally is what it was meant to be 80 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The new par-3 hole at Pebble Beach Golf Links, designed by Jack  
Nicklaus, hugs Stillwater Cove and the crashing waves of the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really impressed,'' said Phil Mickelson, who got his  
first look at the new hole this week while tuning up for the AT&AMP;T 
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.''I thought it looked like it had been 
here since the first, you know, when the course was created back in 
the early 1900s. Just amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new hole was placed where developer Samuel F. B. Morse -- a  
descendant of telegraph inventor -- originally envisioned it. But 
alas, he had sold the oceanfront site before his dream of creating 
a golf course was realized. 
</P>
<P>
	Morse tried to buy the property back, but balked at the $20,000  
asking price. Pebble Beach was opened on Feb. 22, 1919, with a No. 
5 hole that played uphill and inland from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast forward to a few years back, when the Pebble Beach Golf Co.  
was able to acquire the property for more than $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, who won a U.S. Amateur, a U.S. Open and three Pro-Ams  
at the course, designed the hole with the surroundings in mind. The 
green has a back pin position, guarded from southerly breezes by a 
buffer of trees. 
</P>
<P>
	The hole plays 187 yards for the pros, and 138 yards for the  
amateurs. The two tees are separated by a quaint bridge over a deep 
ravine that spills into the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The scenic hole was not without controversy. Environmentalists  
protested plans to remove an old oak tree where the green was to 
be. The oak turned out to be diseased, and cut down anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionalists complained about altering the course, which has  
hosted the National Pro-Am since 1947 when the tournament was known 
as the Crosby Clambake. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the pros were skeptical. But upon playing the hole this  
week, many were pleasantly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``It now flows with the rest of the golf course. It's a fair  
hole, you can now see the pin,'' said Brett Quigley, the co-leader 
with a 6-under 66 after Thursday's first round. ``At the old hole 
you were hitting over the bunker there and you were never really 
sure where you were going.''

	Traditionalists complained about altering the course, which has  
hosted the National Pro-Am since 1947 when the tournament was known 
as the Crosby Clambake. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the pros were skeptical. But upon playing the hole this  
week, many were pleasantly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``It now flows with the rest of the golf course. It's a fair  
hole, you can now see the pin,'' said Brett Quigley, the co-leader 
with a 6-under 66 after Thursday's first round. ``At the old hole 
you were hitting over the bunker there and you were never really 
sure where you were going.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Eyes Bell Atlantic-Nynex Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission is  
looking into whether Bell Atlantic is complying with 
government-imposed requirements that paved the way for the 
company's takeover of another regional Bell telephone company, 
Nynex. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic has said it is abiding by the conditions, which  
aim to foster local phone competition. But long-distance companies 
MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T have complained to the FCC that the company 
isn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC said Friday it will let public and industry groups weigh  
in on the matter. The first round of comments are due to the 
commission on March 8 with the last round due on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, on August 14, 1997, approved Bell Atlantic's takeover  
of Nynex provided that the company took various steps to foster 
competition. Those steps, among other things, pertain to prices the 
company charges rivals to hook into its network to provide 
competing services and to computer systems rivals use to bill and 
service customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic now has plans to merge with GTE Corp. The FCC is  
currently reviewing that merger.

<HEADLINE> Perfect Weather for NASA's Comet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Perfect weather is forecast for  
Saturday's launch of Stardust, a NASA spacecraft that will fly to a 
comet and hopefully bring back comet dust. 
</P>
<P>
	A Boeing Delta rocket is scheduled to blast off with Stardust at  
precisely 42 seconds past 4:06 p.m. NASA has only one second each 
day to send the spacecraft on its seven-year, 3 billion-mile 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever invented the term `Chamber of Commerce weather' has  
Florida's current weather in mind,'' Air Force weatherman Joel 
Tumbiolo said. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be NASA's first attempt to gather comet samples and  
bring them back to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for Stardust to meet up with Comet Wild-2 in  
2004, collecting tiny comet chips on a pop-up racket covered with a 
transparent glass foam called aerogel. If all goes well, the 
samples will return to Earth in a capsule in 2006 for scientific 
study.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Committee To Reorganize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Gov. Mike Leavitt and Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee Chairman Robert Garff unveiled a sweeping reorganization 
plan for running the 2002 Winter Games that is more open and has 
better oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization announced Thursday would include 17 or 18 new  
spots on the SLOC board of trustees. The board's executive 
committee would be replaced with a management group ordered to keep 
a tight rein on planning. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal by Garff and Leavitt will be voted on next week by  
the full board. That vote will come two days after it gets a report 
from an independent ethics panel investigating Salt Lake City's 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have found the bid committee gave more than $1  
million in cash, free medical care, travel and scholarships to IOC 
members or their relatives before the 1995 IOC vote giving Salt 
Lake City the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff said he and Leavitt have not offered the job of SLOC chief  
executive to anyone, and refused to discuss Mitt Romney, the man 
believed to be the front-runner. Romney is a Boston venture 
capitalist and former Republican Senate candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chief executive would replace Frank Joklik, who resigned  
Jan. 8 but remains on the job until he is replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The new board members, to be chosen by Leavitt and Mayor Deedee  
Corradini, likely would be ready to join the board on Feb. 11, 
Garff said. ``We have a reasonable expectation it will be 
approved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff and Leavitt declined to say whether board members who also  
were on the bid committee will remain on SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to see if any of those people are implicated,''  
Garff said. ``We will review those facts and then take decisive 
action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roles of First Security Corp. Chairman Spence Eccles and  
PacifiCorp Vice President Verl Topham, both on the executive 
committee, have come under question. They were enlisted during Salt 
Lake's bidding for the games to watch over staffers now blamed for 
excesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt declined to say whether restructuring of the board might  
mean ridding it of businessmen who are doing business with SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics committee investigating the scandal also has  
looked at contracts awarded by the SLOC board to some of its 
members. A $23.2 million contract went to a construction company 
headed by board trustee Alan Layton to build a roof for a speed 
skating oval. SLOC board member Earl Holding is owner of Snowbasin 
ski resort, where the downhill races will be staged. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization is designed to broaden community  
representation and give more responsibility to the management 
committee. However, the enlarged board of trustees would lose its 
decision-making authority, playing only an advisory role for the 
management committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the seven at-large members elected by the full board,  
the management committee would include Leavitt, Garff, Corradini, a 
new SLOC president and chief executive, four athletes, three U.S. 
Olympic Committee officials and two IOC representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt also elaborated on a statement that he knew little about  
the excessive spending on International Olympic Committee members 
by a few bid executives. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he met about 50 IOC members and their families, posed  
for photographs and gave obligatory gifts of diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not ever personally see a gift of great value,'' Leavitt  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not know that the international students he met  
were sons and daughters of IOC members, some supported by bid 
money, and he repeated an earlier assertion that the lavish 
spending was hidden from him and the bid committee by bid 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was there a pattern of deception? Yes,'' Leavitt said. ``They  
had to hide it. I didn't see it and I don't know of anyone else who 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt dismissed allegations to the contrary by Tom Welch, the  
former bid committee president who has been blamed for the 
excesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not unexpected from someone who is feeling a lot of  
pressure because of past actions,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sydney Olympics organizing president Michael Knight announced a  
full independent investigation of the city's winning bid for the 
2000 Games, to be completed by March 11. Knight said the inquiry 
was intended to ``clear the air on Sydney's bid once and for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Welch denied he told CNN that the bid committee took $50,000 in  
cash to Budapest, where the IOC chose Salt Lake for the games. 
Welch said he told CNN that he didn't know about any cash, but if 
it was carried to Budapest, it was to pay routine expenses of the 
Salt Lake delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. Merrill Cook, R-Utah, said the $150 million Congress has  
approved so Utah can prepare its highways, airport and mass transit 
systems before the Olympics is safe. Rep. John Dingle, D-Michigan, 
has asked the General Accounting Office to determine whether Salt 
Lake is being rewarded with federal dollars after using shady means 
to get the games. 
</P>
<P>
	That money cannot now be withdrawn, and neither can the  
legislation that authorizes the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to 
give funding priority in coming years to Salt Lake and other host 
cities, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, securing money might be harder in the future, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	--The Washington Post said FBI agents and Olympic ethics  
investigators are examining evidence that Salt Lake Olympic 
organizers used airline tickets to disguise illicit payments to 
several IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the tickets, bought at premium prices by the Salt Lake  
committee, in some instances were cashed in or traded for 
less-expensive fares. Investigators were examining whether there 
was an understanding between some IOC members and Salt Lake 
organizers that the tickets would serve as a form of payoff in 
return for supporting the city's bid, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	--USA Today, citing unidentified sources, said the Salt Lake bid  
committee made thousands of dollars in questionable payments to a 
company linked to former U.S. Olympic Committee official Alfredo La 
Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said La Mont, who resigned Jan. 14 as senior  
director of international relations, used a company named Citius to 
receive payments that amounted to at least $2,500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont was the middleman in efforts by Welch to buy  
intelligence about IOC members in Latin America, sources told The 
Associated Press at the time of his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	--The New York Times said it had obtained copies of letters  
written by Joklik and another member of the Salt Lake bid 
committee's board of trustees, James Beardall, seeking to get a 
forestry job for the husband of a Finnish member of the IOC. The 
letters to Weyerhauser Company on behalf of Bjarne Haeggman were 
sent in 1993 when Salt Lake was seeking the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik and other board members have insisted they were unaware  
such tactics were part of an aggressive campaign to win over IOC 
members who would vote on the site selection. 
</P>
<P>
	--An IOC member from South Korea denied today that Salt Lake  
Olympic officials helped find a job for his son in the United 
States and reimbursed part of his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Un-yong, the only member of the IOC's executive board  
implicated in the Salt Lake scandal, said the allegations against 
him were part of a plot to discredit him and his close ally, 
Olympic chief Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim spoke in reaction to USA Today's report that Kim's only son,  
Kim Jung-hoon, was employed by a Utah company, Keystone 
Communications, at the request of Salt Lake officials.

<HEADLINE> Ritts Resigns as LPGA Commissioner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The LPGA Tour wanted Jim Ritts as its commissioner because of  
his background in television. It's losing him for the very same 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritts, the marketing whiz who helped women's golf nearly double  
its television exposure in just three years, resigned Friday to 
become chief operating officer of Digital Entertainment Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital Entertainment delivers television-quality programming to  
the Internet. Ritts joins a management team led by former Walt 
Disney Television Network president David Neuman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was really a difficult decision because of my passion for  
the LPGA,'' Ritts said from LPGA headquarters in Daytona Beach, 
Fla. ``But everybody knows what's occurring with the Internet. This 
is really a chance to maybe shape that part of the world in 
entertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ritts will stay with the LPGA for 45 days and then be replaced  
by Ty Votaw, the tour's vice president of business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes on the final day of voting for sweeping  
changes in the criteria for the LPGA Hall of Fame, which has been 
in the works for 14 years. Also, the LPGA recently signed up a 
development tour -- similar to the Nike Tour in men's golf -- that 
was one of Ritts' projects when he became commissioner in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But his legacy in just three years will be television. The LPGA  
had only 19 events televised in 1995, compared to 33 this year. As 
a result, purses increased nearly 50 percent during his tenure, 
from $24.4 million in 1995 to $36.2 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``His vision and marketing savvy have propelled the LPGA to the  
forefront of women's sports,'' said Andrew Shepard, chairman of the 
LPGA Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritts came to the LPGA in 1996 after serving as president for  
network affairs at Channel One Communications, where he worked with 
Neuman and Edward Winter, now the chief marketing officer for DEN. 
</P>
<P>
	He also spent six years with the New York advertising agency of  
Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, Inc., where at age 27 he became its 
youngest vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we are in the beginning stages of a communication,  
information and cultural revolution, perhaps only seen previously 
during the Industrial Revolution,'' Ritts said. ``I am not willing 
to sit on the sidelines while these momentous changes unfold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, the LPGA went through some big changes during his  
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the increase in television exposure -- a record 238 hours  
last year -- came in an agreement with Mercury to show as many as 10 
events on ESPN. He also managed to replace title sponsors whenever 
the LPGA lost them. 
</P>
<P>
	His arrival coincided with the emergence of foreign stars on the  
LPGA such as Annika Sorenstam, Karrie Webb and Se Ri Pak. Along 
with more television, Ritts launched the tour's first national 
advertising campaign to promote its players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the places I've been, the LPGA experience has been the  
one I treasure and value the most,'' Ritts said. ``I feel very much 
in my heart that we left it better than we found it. And we've left 
it in very good hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Votaw, a 37-year-old lawyer, came to the LPGA in 1991. He was  
general counsel and special assistant to former commissioner 
Charlie Meacham, and later worked on tournament sponsorship and 
television negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows the LPGA from the inside out,'' said Cindy McCurdy,  
president of the LPGA executive committee. ``We could have spent 
months and months looking, but I know we would not find a better 
candidate than Ty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The LPGA also said it would restructure its front office by  
creating a new position -- chief operating officer -- to assist 
Votaw.

<HEADLINE>  New No. 5 at Pebble Beach Course  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- As the waves wash up on the beach  
below the fifth hole at Pebble Beach, seagulls frolic on the 
fairway. And that's just the way Samuel F.B. Morse envisioned it 80 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The brand-new par-3 hole at Pebble Beach Golf Links, designed by  
Jack Nicklaus, is winning raves from the professionals and amateurs 
in town for the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone is the old No. 5, an uphill battle that was designed out of  
necessity because the oceanfront land where the new hole sits was 
private property. 
</P>
<P>
	``It now flows with the rest of the golf course. It's a fair  
hole, you can now see the pin,'' pro Brett Quigley said. ``At the 
old hole, you were hitting over the bunker there and you were never 
really sure where you were going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new hole was put where developer Morse -- a descendant of  
telegraph inventor -- originally wanted it. But alas, he had sold 
the oceanfront site before his dream of creating a golf course was 
realized. 
</P>
<P>
	Morse tried to buy the property back, but balked at the $20,000  
asking price. Pebble Beach was opened on Feb. 22, 1919, with a No. 
5 hole that played uphill and inland from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast forward to a few years back, when the Pebble Beach Golf Co.  
was able to acquire the property for more than $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, who won a U.S. Amateur, a U.S. Open and three Pro-Ams  
at the course, designed the hole with the surroundings in mind. The 
green has a back pin position, guarded from southerly sea breezes 
by a buffer of trees. 
</P>
<P>
	The hole plays 187 yards for the pros, with the amateur tees  
separated by a quaint foot bridge over a deep ravine that spills 
into the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The scenic hole was not without controversy. Environmentalists  
protested plans to remove an old oak tree where the green was to 
be. The oak turned out to be diseased, and cut down anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionalists complained about altering the course, which has  
hosted the National Pro-Am since 1947 when the tournament was known 
as the Crosby Clambake. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the pros were skeptical. But upon playing the hole this  
week, many were pleasantly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really impressed,'' Phil Mickelson said. ``I thought it  
looked like it had been here since the first, when the course was 
created back in the early 1900s. Just amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love III played the No. 5 with his foursome during the  
second round of the tournament on Friday. Love went into a sand 
trap on the right of the green, but was able to save par and earned 
a round of applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate it -- because I missed the green,'' Love said jokingly.

<HEADLINE> Blumenthal Tries Hard Not to Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House prosecutor was polite, but White  
House aide Sidney Blumenthal didn't seem to be in a cooperative 
mood. 
</P>
<P>
	With a profusion of ``Thank yous,'' Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif.,  
tried to elicit answers from Blumenthal about White House meetings 
on damage control concerning Monica Lewinsky and conversations he 
had with President Clinton on the subject, according to transcripts 
of the deposition released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But three times in the first minutes, Blumenthal said he  
couldn't remember. So Rogan gently referred to previous grand jury 
testimony and asked him to read it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to trick you or anything,'' Rogan said. Then, a  
bit later, he said, ``Let me see if this helps to refresh your 
recollection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, Blumenthal answered abruptly with little  
elaboration, twice saying ``mm-hmm'' and ``could be'' and at one 
point answering simply ``No'' 18 times in answer to a series of 
questions about Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky regarding gifts, telephone 
conversations, previous grand jury statements and possible 
cover-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal confirmed that Clinton told the White House aide that  
Ms. Lewinsky had ``come on to him,'' demanded sex and been turned 
down and that she told him she was known as ``the stalker'' and 
might claim she'd had an affair with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's when I told him that `You can't get near crazy  
people, uh, troubled people,''' Blumenthal said. ```You're 
president. You just have to separate yourself from this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning from Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Blumenthal  
also repeated that Clinton never retracted those statements about 
Ms. Lewinsky. Despite that, Blumenthal insisted he did not leak bad 
information about her to the press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea how anything came to be attributed to a White  
House source,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he now believes the president lied to him, Blumenthal  
said, ``I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham began his questioning by promising ``direct, to the  
point'' queries ``so we can all go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But several times, the senators presiding over the deposition --  
Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Democrat John Edwards 
of North Carolina -- were asked to rule on objections to questions 
in part because of their vagueness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps you can avoid it just by pinpointing it a little  
more,'' Specter told Graham about one question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes. We'll try to be laserlike in these questions,'' Graham  
replied. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  New No. 5 at Pebble Beach Course  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- As the waves wash up on the beach  
below the fifth hole at Pebble Beach, seagulls frolic on the 
fairway. And that's just the way Samuel F.B. Morse envisioned it 80 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The brand-new par-3 hole at Pebble Beach Golf Links, designed by  
Jack Nicklaus, is winning raves from the professionals and amateurs 
in town for the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone is the old No. 5, an uphill battle that was designed out of  
necessity because the oceanfront land where the new hole sits was 
private property. 
</P>
<P>
	``It now flows with the rest of the golf course. It's a fair  
hole, you can now see the pin,'' pro Brett Quigley said. ``At the 
old hole, you were hitting over the bunker there and you were never 
really sure where you were going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new hole was put where developer Morse -- a descendant of  
telegraph inventor -- originally wanted it. But alas, he had sold 
the oceanfront site before his dream of creating a golf course was 
realized. 
</P>
<P>
	Morse tried to buy the property back, but balked at the $20,000  
asking price. Pebble Beach was opened on Feb. 22, 1919, with a No. 
5 hole that played uphill and inland from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast forward to a few years back, when the Pebble Beach Golf Co.  
was able to acquire the property for more than $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, who won a U.S. Amateur, a U.S. Open and three Pro-Ams  
at the course, designed the hole with the surroundings in mind. The 
green has a back pin position, guarded from southerly sea breezes 
by a buffer of trees. 
</P>
<P>
	The hole plays 187 yards for the pros, with the amateur tees  
separated by a quaint foot bridge over a deep ravine that spills 
into the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The scenic hole was not without controversy. Environmentalists  
protested plans to remove an old oak tree where the green was to 
be. The oak turned out to be diseased, and cut down anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionalists complained about altering the course, which has  
hosted the National Pro-Am since 1947 when the tournament was known 
as the Crosby Clambake. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the pros were skeptical. But upon playing the hole this  
week, many were pleasantly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really impressed,'' Phil Mickelson said. ``I thought it  
looked like it had been here since the first, when the course was 
created back in the early 1900s. Just amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love III played the No. 5 with his foursome during the  
second round of the tournament on Friday. Love went into a sand 
trap on the right of the green, but was able to save par and earned 
a round of applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate it -- because I missed the green,'' Love said jokingly.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Sign Center Stanley Roberts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Houston Rockets signed center  
Stanley Roberts to a free-agent contract Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts averaged 6.2 points and 4.9 rebounds in 74 games for  
Minnesota last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot, 290-pound Roberts came to the Timberwolves last  
season after an injury-riddled stint with the Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was limited to 14 games with a ruptured right Achilles tendon  
during the 1993-94 season and the injury sidelined him during the 
entire 1994-95 season. He averaged 7.0 points and 3.2 rebounds in 
51 games for the Clippers during the 1995-96 season, but a back 
injury kept him out of all but 18 games the following season before 
he was traded to the Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	In his six-year career, Roberts has also played for Orlando.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky's Still Fond of Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Careful not to give away too much, Monica  
Lewinsky refused to elaborate on the ``mixed feelings'' she still 
holds for the president a year after their last, curt phone call. 
Eighteen pages of her newest words about him suggest lingering 
fondness tinged with a hint of exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after all she's been through, Ms. Lewinsky still spoke  
sentimentally of the president's first gift to her -- a hatpin 
valued at $3, according to an appraiser hired by Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a thoughtful gift. It was beautiful,'' Ms. Lewinsky  
told her House questioner, Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., in the 
deposition published in the Congressional Record Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But -- in what reads like the chin-up bravado of an ex-girlfriend  
who has moved on -- she also took a swipe at Clinton. Bryant opened 
the way with, ``You think he's a good president, and I assume you 
think he's a very intelligent man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky corrected him: ``I think he's an intelligent  
president.'' The remark elicited laughter from the gathering of 
lawyers and senators in the room. Ms. Lewinsky had already made it 
clear to them she differentiated between Clinton the man and 
Clinton the president. 
</P>
<P>
	She also pointed out that she urged Clinton to settle Paula  
Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit -- a move that could have saved her 
and the president from the whole mess that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said she was so angry at being dragged into the  
Jones case that she wanted to ``sue Paula Jones'' at the time. Her 
disdain survives. She told Bryant, ``I don't believe Paula Jones' 
version of the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five-hour interview carried echoes of the confessional style  
of Ms. Lewinsky's extensive earlier questioning before a federal 
grand jury. But the new testimony, recorded in a ritzy Washington 
hotel last Monday, was much more guarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant told the Senate that Ms. Lewinsky's words ``were  
carefully chosen and relatively few'' and that she seemed ``almost 
protective'' of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	He compared her to the Marlene Dietrich character in the classic  
courtroom movie ``Witness for the Prosecution'' -- a sultry, 
mysterious wife whose seemingly incriminating testimony actually 
helps her husband avoid conviction for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	That seems an overstatement. But Ms. Lewinsky does seem to have  
matured in the year since her sometimes overwrought, sometimes 
giggly voice was secretly caught on tape by Linda Tripp. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old, who is awaiting a Barbara Walters interview and  
has teamed with a biographer, skillfully batted away some of 
Bryant's more prying questions and responded to the majority with a 
simple ``Yes'' or ``Correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what she felt for Clinton now, Ms. Lewinsky, who has said  
she once loved and dreamed of marrying the president, said, ``I 
have mixed feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Bryant tried to probe further, she cut him off cold: ``I  
think what you need to know is that my grand jury testimony is 
truthful irrespective of whatever those mixed feelings are in my 
testimony today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She bristled when Bryant referred to her first sexual encounter  
with Clinton as ``the first so-called salacious occasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you call it something else?,'' she interrupted. ``I mean,  
this is my relationship. ... I don't really see it as my first 
salacious -- that's not what it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And she held Bryant to his promise not to question her about  
details of the intimate encounters. When one question alluded to 
sexual telephone conversations with the president, she reminded him 
that was ``a topic I thought we weren't discussing here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant dropped the subject.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky recalled her fear, anger and tears in late December  
1997 and early January 1998, when she worried that discovery of 
their relationship was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I was beyond paranoid at this point,'' she said,  
explaining how she came up with a codename to use when contacting 
Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky was called from her desk at the Pentagon public  
affairs office on Dec. 19, 1997, to receive a subpoena in the Jones 
case. She broke into tears. When the process server tried to 
explain that the envelope included money to cover her expenses at a 
witness, she recalled declaring, ``I don't want their stinking 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky had testified previously that she was angry with  
Clinton during their last conversation, on Jan. 5, because she had 
seen news photos of him and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
``being romantic on their holiday vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That last conversation, in which Ms. Lewinsky confirmed that she  
would sign an affidavit denying their affair, ended on a sour note, 
she elaborated to the congressmen. She recalled, ``I said goodbye 
very abruptly.''

<HEADLINE> Is Chelsea Clinton a Public Figure? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Clinton gushed about the time his  
daughter, Chelsea, asked if unmarried girls can have babies. 
Hillary Rodham Clinton chimed in, laughing, about Chelsea's plea to 
have her ears pierced. 
</P>
<P>
	That was 1992, in the heat of their first run for the White  
House, when the Clintons invited People magazine into their 
backyard for a cozy family photo shoot and extensive interview. 
</P>
<P>
	This is 1999, in the denouement of the crisis sparked by  
President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, when a similarly 
flattering People cover story -- ``Hillary &AMP; Chelsea: Grace under 
fire. An intimate look at the deep bond of love'' -- set the White 
House into an icy stew. 
</P>
<P>
	Press secretary Joe Lockhart, peppered with questions Thursday  
about an unusual statement from the president and first lady 
prefacing the release today of the 8-page magazine feature, refused 
even to entertain the question about whether Chelsea is, as People 
managing editor Carol Wallace called her, ``a valid journalistic 
subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We deeply regret and are profoundly saddened by the decision  
of People,'' the president and Mrs. Clinton in an official 
statement late Wednesday after their personal appeals to the 
magazine failed to kill the story. The White House refused to 
elaborate on those contacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Media watchdogs cried foul.  
</P>
<P>
	``Chelsea is becoming fair game,'' said Marvin Kalb, director of  
Harvard's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public 
Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	From a gawky 12-year-old in braces to poised college student at  
Stanford University, Chelsea, nearly 19, has emerged as a sort of 
semipublic figure -- traveling on overseas missions, working the 
crowds alongside her parents, turning up in front of news cameras 
to hold her father's hand when the political stakes last year 
became critical. 
</P>
<P>
	So why the fuss over an article that, in trying to illustrate a  
close family bond, recalls slumber parties, messages from ``Mommy'' 
to Chelsea's elementary school and a beach picnic where Chelsea, 
unasked, draped her jacket around her mother's shivering shoulders? 
</P>
<P>
	``Chelsea has not taken on a public role,'' the Clintons said in  
their appeal meant to hold back the floodgates on coverage of their 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest People story follows sensational tabloid cover  
stories last year on Chelsea's breakup with her college boyfriend. 
But it is no more intrusive and no less flattering than the story 
the Clintons sanctioned in 1992, when they offered up everything 
from Chelsea's favorite TV sitcoms to her morning routine. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference between then and now? ``Nothing has changed, from  
Mrs. Clinton's point of view,'' said her spokeswoman, Marsha Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kalb and others point to vivid images from the past year  
that suggest mixed messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after Ms. Lewinsky burst into headlines last year,  
Chelsea flew 3,000 miles home from Stanford, where she was then a 
freshman. Photographs of her and Dad arm-in-arm departing for the 
Camp David presidential retreat helped bolster his initial denials 
of any marital wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven months later, she linked hands with both parents and --  
again before a bank of cameras -- held husband and wife together the 
day after Clinton publicly confessed his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chelsea is now being used to convey an image and the line then  
becomes more and more difficult to draw between what is 
journalistically acceptable and what is self-protective for family 
reasons,'' Kalb said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the coverage unfortunate. But journalism professor  
George Reedy, who was press secretary to President Lyndon Johnson, 
saw a public benefit to knowing the private lives of presidents and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the very important things the press must do is give the  
public a picture of what the man is really like -- what his 
personality is, is he honest, is he smart. And people are reflected 
in their children,'' Reedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a mirror the Clintons, unlike their predecessors, have  
tightly cloaked since the '92 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to answer any questions about her,'' Mrs.  
Clinton firmly told CNN's Larry King when he asked in 1996 whether 
Chelsea was dating. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea has never been interviewed, although reporters have been  
invited to off-the-record dinners with her during foreign trips. 
She only has spoken in public overseas, in roundtable discussions 
with other young people.

<HEADLINE> American Bar Challenges IOC Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The president of the American Bar Association  
said Friday that the independent counsel law, which the group once 
brought to life, should be allowed to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ABA has been a parent of the independent counsel law going  
back to Watergate,'' Philip S. Anderson said at the group's 
midwinter meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was believed it would restore public confidence in  
government and take politics out of high level investigations. We 
have to ask ourselves if it has done that. I do not think it served 
the purpose it was designed to serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the ABA's decision to recommend doing away with the law  
will not be official until the House of Delegates votes on the 
issue Monday, Anderson said, ``I have heard of no support in the 
ABA for continuation of the independent counsel act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government  
Act is scheduled to expire in June unless it is renewed by 
Congress. The House of Delegates will also consider five 
recommendations for changes in the law if it is reauthorized by 
Congress.

<HEADLINE> Baltimore Apartment Fire Kills 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Terrified residents ran to the roof of a  
high-rise apartment building early today to escape an eight-alarm 
fire that killed one person and injured several others. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke billowed from the Charles Towers, a 28-story building in  
downtown Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	One person died after suffering cardiac arrest, fire officials  
said. At least nine people were taken to hospitals and paramedics 
treated people at the scene for smoke inhalation and minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	It took 168 firefighters about two hours to control the fire,  
which began on the 15th floor and caused extensive damage on the 
14th through 17th floors. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire was not immediately known.  
</P>
<P>
	Battalion Chief Hector Torres said firefighters were hampered by  
the lack of a sprinkler system. The high-rise was built in 1967 
before sprinklers were mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked up, and the 14th floor was just in flames. It was  
like a scene from a movie,'' said Neeraj Bhargava, 25, a health 
care consultant who lives on the fourth floor. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he saw panicked people above the burning floors waving  
towels, desperately trying to get firefighters' attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Those people were directed to the roof, where they waited for  
firefighters to escort them down stairwells. Police helicopters 
hovered above the building, but no one was airlifted from the roof. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters searched the building floor by floor and said all  
400 or so residents had gotten out. 
</P>
<P>
	One resident said people who had been trapped inside were  
screaming, and some threatened to jump out of windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``One lady was waving a white flag, asking if she should jump,''  
said Annette Castelle, a computer specialist who lives on the 14th 
floor. ``Everybody yelled, `No!'''

<HEADLINE> Brazil IMF Vow May Worsen Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Stock and currency values eroded  
further Friday due to investor skepticism over the lack of details 
in Brazil's new belt-tightening commitments to the International 
Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said they feared the deal to salvage an IMF-led loan  
package of $41.5 billion would hobble Latin America's dominant 
economy with higher interest rates, worsening unemployment and 
deeper recession. The United States fears that continued economic 
turmoil in Brazil could stifle growth elsewhere in a region that 
accounts for a major share of U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the lack of specifics in the government's pledge  
Thursday to reduce its public debt and achieve a budget surplus 
triggered a decline on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, where share 
prices closed down 2.5 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the currency market, the real slipped to 1.84 to the dollar  
before rallying to close at 1.82. It opened trading at 1.81 to the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The real has depreciated by 34 percent since Jan. 13, when the  
government first moved to let the currency float freely on world 
exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Thursday by Finance Minister Pedro Malan  
and the IMF's Deputy Director Stanley Fischer revised earlier 
financial targets to account for the precipitous devaluation of 
Brazil's currency, the real. The central bank abandoned efforts to 
prop up the currency in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The slide in the real has rekindled fears of inflation, which  
plunged from about 2,700 percent in 1993, when the government 
pegged the real to the dollar, to just 2 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint statement by IMF and Brazilian officials made clear that  
the government will resort to high interest rates in an effort to 
control inflation, but it avoided a commitment to firm year-end 
figures. Malan sidestepped the issue, saying only that the 
annualized rate of inflation would amount to less than 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While both Malan and Fischer avoided details on the specific  
steps Brazil would need to take in order to meet the goals, but 
analysts foresee cuts in government spending as well as higher 
taxes. The result, they say, is that gross domestic product will 
shrink by even more than the 1 percent originally forecast by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Marcio Pochmann of the University of Campinas said GDP  
will probably contract by as much as 3.5 percent and that inflation 
could reach 10 percent. ``Instead of last year's 6.6 million 
unemployed, we'll have more than 10 million,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The key targets cited in Thursday's deal are public debt of less  
than 46.5 percent of GDP -- the goal established in Brazil's 
previous agreement with the IMF -- and a budget surplus of 3 percent 
to 3.5 percent of GDP by the end of 1999. The government is to 
reach its surplus target two years sooner than under the earlier 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main question for them now is how the government will  
achieve these targets. We need specifics,'' said Thomas Taterka, a 
head trader at Sao Paulo's Banco Cidade. 
</P>
<P>
	``International investors are still completely absent from  
Brazil,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil had hoped to secure an early release of a second $9  
billion installment of the aid package, but the IMF won't make the 
money available until its board of directors approves the terms of 
the new agreement. Brazil received a first disbursement of $9.4 
billion in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``The missing piece of the puzzle is still credit from private  
international banks,'' said Silvio Camargo, head of institutional 
equity sales at Banco Fator in Sao Paulo.

<HEADLINE> Panthers' Bure Suffers Knee Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pavel Bure, who had eight goals in his first  
six games with the Florida Panthers, left Friday night's game in 
Pittsburgh with a slightly strained right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure was injured with 2:26 left in the first period while trying  
to redirect the puck with his skate and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure will be evaluated again Saturday and his status for that  
night's game at Carolina is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not too bad right now. It's stiff a little bit. I hope  
it's just a sprain,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since ending a season-long holdout and joining Florida in a  
seven-player trade with Vancouver on Jan. 17, Bure had scored at 
least one goal in all but one of six games. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a goal and two assists Wednesday against Toronto, giving  
him eight goals and three assists since joining the Panthers. He 
did not score in nearly nine minutes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is 4-2-1 since adding Bure, who had sat out the season  
in a contract dispute before joining the Panthers.

<HEADLINE> Bumbling Doctor Cleared To Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A surgeon who amputated the wrong leg  
of a diabetic and put a catheter in the wrong patient will be 
allowed to resume his medical practice in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Board of Medicine agreed Friday to allow Dr. Rolando  
Sanchez to resume his Tampa practice as soon as he finishes a 
nine-month suspension he began in July for the catheter incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez's license was suspended because an 89-year-old woman  
didn't give consent for the catheter to be inserted into a vein in 
her chest on Nov. 2, 1997. The catheter was intended for an 
80-year-old woman in the same room at Vencor Hospital Central in 
Tampa. The elder patient survived without significant harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez already was on probation for amputating the left leg of  
a patient instead of the gangrenous right leg in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The board, which regulates physicians and other health-care  
workers, ordered Sanchez to be monitored when he resumes his 
practice. He also must pay a $2,500 fine and will be on probation 
for two years.

<HEADLINE> Border Agents Arrest 162 Aliens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The Border Patrol on Friday arrested 162  
illegal immigrants who were smuggled across the Mexico border and 
lived together in a house with no furniture or working bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conditions were deplorable and dirty,'' said Bill  
Strassberger, spokesman for the western division of the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was trash everywhere, only mattresses on the floor, no  
furniture. The sinks and tubs were overrunning and unusable,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Border Patrol received an anonymous tip Friday that there  
was a large group of illegal immigrants living in the 
1,500-square-foot, four-bedroom home, Strassberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strassberger said smugglers often use ``drop houses'' to store  
people while they wait for money or a move to their final 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS is investigating who owns the house and how long it has  
been used by smugglers. Most of the immigrants were returned to 
Mexico.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Said Vulnerable to Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress has received a sobering message from  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Attorney General Janet 
Reno: The United States continues to be vulnerable to bombing 
attacks, both at home and abroad, despite progress in combating 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 10 percent of the planned work has been performed on  
upgrading U.S. embassies since last August's twin bombings in 
Africa, Albright told a Senate hearing on anti-terrorism Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think from our perspective we don't need any more  
legislative authority, but we do need ... money,'' she testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said there has been much progress in foiling would-be  
terrorist plots and in improving coordination among agencies. 
Still, she said, ``we're not going to be able to prevent them all. 
There is no way we can do that. And we have got to be prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general said that of particular concern was ``the  
threat of a cyberattack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just now in this past year, we have been able to see instances  
in which 17- and 18-year-old hackers can intrude into sensitive 
computers across this country. If they can do that, our 
cybersystem, our cyberinfrastructure, is at risk,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said that government agencies are working together ``with  
personnel and technology that can match the wits of the smartest 
criminals and the smartest terrorist.'' But she said states and the 
private sector need to do more to fight this new brand of 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said security at U.S. embassies around the world has  
been strengthened considerably since simultaneous bombings last 
Aug. 7 at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania killed 224 
people, including 12 Americans. She also said the administration's 
five-year plan for combating terrorism is progressing. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, there is much to be done. ``Our strategy must be  
long-term. The five-year plan is only the beginning. Certainly no 
single arrest or shutdown of a terrorist operation will be 
sufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The advance of technology has given us new means to counter  
terrorists, but it has also enabled terrorists to develop more 
powerful weapons and to travel, communicate, recruit and raise 
funds on a global basis,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh testified before a  
Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the budgets of 
their agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., the subcommittee chairman, said  
President Clinton's budget request for $300 million to upgrade 
embassy security next year falls about $700 million short of what 
he said an interagency study panel said was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg said the president's entire anti-terrorism program, which  
also includes a request for $2.8 billion in new spending, appeared 
to be ``put together on the back of an envelope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Albright defended the program. ``I think we are at the  
beginning stages. ... We're working very hard and I think we all 
need to work together on this,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh told the panel that during fiscal 1998, which ended last  
Sept. 30, the FBI had ``prevented 10 planned terrorist acts'' 
through its investigations, nine of which he said were planned by 
an Illinois-based white supremacist group that plotted to bomb 
buildings across the country.

<HEADLINE> Bookies Won Another Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Bookies won another Super Bowl, but bettors  
didn't get taken for too much. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures released Thursday by the Nevada Gaming Control Board  
showed the state's legal sports books finished with a profit of 
nearly $3 million on the game on total betting of $75,986,520. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount wagered was just under last year's record of $77.3  
million, but bookies made a 3.8 percent profit on this year's game, 
up from 0.6 percent a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still a wonderful handle,'' said Pete Korner, operations  
manager for Las Vegas Sports Consultants, which sets the odds for 
most major sports books. ``The end result is comparable to some 
good days we've had in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korner said the decision by the Falcons to go for a 2-point  
conversion with just over two minutes left in the game might have 
been the difference between some sports books making a profit or 
taking a loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The conversion failed, and with it so did the chances of some  
books to make money on betting on the total points scored in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anywhere in the world, anyone with a bet on the over-under had  
to wonder what he was doing,'' Korner said. ``It really wasn't 
going to make any difference in the game, just in the number of 
total points scored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The failed 2-point conversion left the final score at 34-19, for  
a total of 53 points. In some books that was the total on parlay 
cards, but many other books had it at 54. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettors who wager parlay cards lose on ties, meaning sports  
books who had it at 53 won a pile of money on parlay bets while 
those who had it at 54 had to pay off those who bet the under. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really cost a lot,'' Korner said. ``It would have been a  
really good day otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the amount of money bet in the state's 137 legal betting  
parlors was below last year's record amount, it was still the 
second-best bet Super Bowl ever. Tens, and even hundreds, of 
millions more were wagered illegally across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl is the most heavily bet sporting event of the  
year, but sports books don't generally get rich off of it. Rather, 
it attracts gamblers to casinos, where hotel operators hope they 
will make even more off games such as blackjack and craps that give 
casinos a larger win percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost every Las Vegas hotel-casino was packed Super Bowl  
weekend, which ranks only behind New Year's as the biggest tourism 
weekend of the year in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's become quite a party overall, but the casino win is far  
more important than the sports book win,'' Korner said. ``Betting 
on the game is basically to keep people in the house, and that's 
exactly what it does. Even if the sports book loses money, it's 
still huge for the casino.''

<HEADLINE> Greene Wins Men's 60-Meter Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Like father, like daughter.  
</P>
<P>
	Inger Miller joined her father as a Millrose Games winner in a  
unique match race and Maurice Greene solidified his position as the 
world's No. 1 sprinter Friday night at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Meet officials found little room to separate Miller and  
Sevatheda Fynes of the Bahamas in the women's 60-meter dash. The 
two had reached the final by winning their four-woman heats. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, ranked third in the world in the women's 100 meters, was  
caught in 7.194 seconds, Fynes in 7.198. Both were officially timed 
in 7.20. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so close I didn't know who won,'' Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
	In edging Fynes, Miller joined Lennox Miller as a Millrose  
champion, making them the first father-daughter winners in the 
meet's 92-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennox Miller, winner of the 60-yard dash in 1968 and 1969, was  
in the stands to watch his daughter make Millrose history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a thrill to be here and see her compete,'' he said. ``It  
brings back a lot of memories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Millers, at times, go on 2 1/2-mile runs together. But they  
wouldn't think of sprinting seriously against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might hurt something trying to run with me,'' Inger said.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's out of my league,'' Lennox said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Miller-Fynes match race brought back memories of the Michael  
Johnson-Donovan Bailey 150-meter race at Toronto in 1997. 
Artistically, the women's race was more successful. In the men's 
race, Johnson failed to finish because of a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the 1997 world champion and ranked No. 1 in the world  
last year, recovered from a slow start and won the men's 60 meters 
for the second consecutive year in 6.51 
</P>
<P>
	His time failed to match last year, when he ran the fastest ever  
in the United States, 6.46, and was far short of his world indoor 
record of 6.39, set at Madrid, Spain, last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene did not get out of the blocks as quickly as usual and  
trailed Jon Drummond early. But he rallied in the closing strides 
to overtake his teammate, who finished second at 6.54. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have control at the start,'' Greene said. ``I didn't  
rush it. I just stayed calm. I have to be happy because I won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Regina Jacobs outdueled Suzy Hamilton in the women's  
mile, then the two seemed to patch up their animosity toward each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs didn't take the lead in the 11-laps-to-the-mile race  
until two laps remained and she bumped Hamilton going around the 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jacobs pulled away in the final half-lap to win by about  
12 meters in 4:31.65, she asked Hamilton to take a victory lap with 
her. Hamilton agreed, saying, ``Can I shake your hand?'' Jacobs 
raised their hands together before touring the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say it's a love fest, but we're being more  
civil,'' Hamilton said, after finishing second in 4:33.63. Last 
year, their positions were reversed, with Hamilton winning and 
Jacobs second. 
</P>
<P>
	William Tanui became the second straight Kenyan to win the  
prestigious Wanamaker Mile, sweeping past Richie Boulet with less 
than a half-lap remaining and finishing in 3:59.24. Boulet wound up 
second in 4:00.03. Last year, Laban Rotich became the first Kenyan 
mile winner since Kip Keino in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	Reggie Torian, the 1998 national outdoor hurdles champion,  
easily won the men's 60-meter hurdles in 7.59, as Larry Wade, the 
1998 NCAA indoor and outdoor champion from Texas A&AMP;M, finished 
second at 7.72. Mark Crear, the world's top-ranked hurdler, 
false-started twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Morrison repeated as champion in the women's 60 hurdles  
in 7.99, with Gillian Russell of Jamaica second at 8.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Two American records were broken by women -- pole vaulter Melissa  
Mueller and weight thrower Dawn Ellerbe. 
</P>
<P>
	Mueller soared 14 feet, 8 3/4 inches, the highest ever indoors in  
the United States by a woman, breaking the mark of 14-8 1/4 held by 
Stacy Dragila, the 1997 world indoor champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the fourth time I jumped at it, so I knew it was  
coming,'' Mueller, 26, of Phoenix, said. ``It was awesome. I knew I 
was going to do it sooner or later. I'm glad it was sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of the best crowds to be with. Usually, they're not  
even paying attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellerbe shattered her American record in the 20-pound weight  
throw, with a heave of 75-3 1/4. Her previous mark was 75-2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Everett won his ninth Millrose title and fourth at 500  
meters, rallying down the stretch to beat Milton Campbell in 
1:01.70. Everett also has three Millrose victories at 600 yards and 
two 800 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Connie Price-Smith earned her eighth Millrose title, tying the  
meet record for women held by Diane Dixon, winning the women's shot 
put at 61-0. Dixon, a quarter-miler, was inducted into the 
inaugural Millrose Hall of Fame Friday night, along with pole 
vaulter Bob Richards, hurdler Harrison Dillard, miler Eamonn 
Coghlan and high jumper John Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Deal won his seventh Millrose title in the men's 35-pound  
weight throw with a toss of 77-6.

<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- President Clinton proposal to tighten the sale  
of weapons at gun shows is a public relations stunt, a National 
Rifle Association official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is expected to focus on the issue in his weekly radio  
address Saturday, calling for tightening of the Brady bill to 
further restrict weapons sales at an estimated 5,000 gun shows 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In a radio speech Nov. 7, Clinton called the shows ``illegal  
arms bazaars'' and asked for a study of illegal sales at the 
gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne R. LaPierre Jr., chief executive officer of the Fairfax,  
Va.-based NRA, said the government is not prosecuting felons 
identified under the existing Brady provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is public relations masquerading as substance,'' he said  
of the president's latest push. ``It's hollow and it means nothing 
to felons on the streets. This is an attempt to put the federal 
government on the backs of more people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brady bill requires a five-day waiting period and background  
checks for gun show purchases from licensed dealers, but hobbyists 
selling from their private collections are exempt. Clinton proposed 
extending the background check to all weapons buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Nov. 7 address, Clinton said some gun shows have become  
``illegal arms bazaars for criminals and gun traffickers to buy and 
sell guns on a cash-and-carry, no-questions-asked basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NRA lobbyist James Baker said in the last two years there have  
been only four prosecutions of illegal dealings at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they know about them, why aren't they arresting them,''  
Baker said. ``There is no reason to pass one more law that the 
Clinton administration has no intention of enforcing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department figures show that out of 800,000 gun sale  
transactions, 13,000 buyers were denied because of criminal 
records, the NRA lobbyist said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of those 13,000, nobody was arrested,'' Baker said.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Less Control of Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are generally happy with their  
health insurance coverage, but four in 10 adults say insurers have 
a bigger say than doctors in the care they receive, according to a 
new poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Women are more critical than men, with 40 percent saying the  
health care system is in worse shape than it was five years ago, 
says the poll conducted for The Associated Press. The biggest 
complaint was the inability of people to choose their own doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	As these concerns grow, Congress is again considering how to  
give people more control over their own health care without 
substantially increasing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine out of 10 Americans said they were very satisfied or  
somewhat satisfied with their health insurance coverage, the survey 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	But among those with concerns about health care, much of that  
dissatisfaction is centered around the growing loss of control 
people feel over their medical care, an intensely personal issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,008 people taken Friday through Tuesday was done  
by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Making some changes in the system sounds like a good idea to  
Thomas Feagley, a 42-year-old father of three, whose health plan 
required him to change family doctors last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There needs to be an investigation or some kind of fine  
tuning,'' said the custodian of athletic fields at schools near 
Huntington, in central Pennsylvania, who used the team doctor as 
his family physician for years. ``I would have been a happy camper 
if I could have gotten my insurance and kept my doctor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The growing loss of personal control over health care has left  
Feagley uneasy about the future. He changed doctors a year ago and 
now that doctor is leaving his practice. 
</P>
<P>
	When people were asked their biggest concern about health care,  
the most-mentioned complaint was limits on their ability to pick 
the doctor of their choice, cited by 28 percent, followed by 
concerns about cost and quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they have to have guidelines,'' Feagley said, but he  
noted his former doctor treats many others in his family. ``We had 
kind of a family thing going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The findings reflect some continued frustration with managed  
care, such as health maintenance organizations, which have 
controlled health care costs by preventing unnecessary treatment. 
But Americans also worry they may not get treatments that they 
someday need. 
</P>
<P>
	A big movement to HMOs, has taken place over the past two  
decades. Most Americans who get insurance from an employer are now 
enrolled in an HMO, said Larry Levitt, director of the changing 
health care marketplace project at the Kaiser Family Foundation in 
Menlo Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many people, there has been a sea change in how they deal  
with their insurance companies,'' Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the people in the AP poll who said they were very satisfied,  
the majority said they felt their doctor had the bigger say in 
their care. And three-fourths of those who said they were 
dissatisfied cited insurers as more likely to have the leading 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	Older people were among the most satisfied with their health  
care, while well-educated, middle-aged people between the ages of 
35 and 64 were more likely to have concerns with health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt suggested that those with more education probably have  
higher expectations and middle-aged adults grew up with 
conventional insurance but now must balance family responsibilities 
and the new health care system. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost two-thirds of the people covered by a government plan  
said they were very satisfied with their health insurance coverage, 
said the poll, which had an error margin of plus or minus 3 
percentage points. Levitt said government plans like Medicare often 
offer the freedoms of more conventional insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those who thinks the health care system is getting worse  
is Connie Branch, a 44-year-old mother and factory worker from 
Humboldt, Tenn., east of Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs require people to get a referral to prevent them from  
seeing expensive specialists when they are not needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what a problem is and if I need to go to a certain  
doctor, I've got to have a referral from a family practitioner,'' 
she groused. ``If I have trouble with my feet, why should I have to 
go a family doctor?'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on health care is based on telephone  
interviews with 1,008 randomly selected adults from all states 
except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviewing was conducted Jan. 
29-Feb. 2 by ICR, of Media, Pa. The results were weighted to 
represent the population by key demographic factors such as age, 
sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the  
sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 percentage points 
from the answers that would be obtained if all Americans were 
polled. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll questions (because of rounding, sums may not total  
100 percent): 
</P>
<P>
	1. Which one statement best applies to your household?  
</P>
<P>
	An employer pays most or all of our health insurance, 46  
percent; you pay most or all of the costs of health insurance, 19 
percent; you are enrolled in a government health care plan such as 
Medicare or Medicaid, 19 percent; you do not have health insurance, 
14 percent; don't know/refused, 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	2. How satisfied are you with the quality of your health  
insurance coverage? 
</P>
<P>
	Very satisfied, 51 percent; somewhat satisfied, 37 percent; not  
very satisfied, 7 percent; not at all satisfied, 4 percent; don't 
know, 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	3. In your view, who has the bigger say in your health care:  
your doctor or your insurance company? 
</P>
<P>
	Doctor, 48 percent; insurance company, 41 percent; neither, 6  
percent; don't know, 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Which one of the following items is your biggest concern  
about health care? 
</P>
<P>
	The ability to pick the doctor of your choice, 28 percent; the  
quality of medical care, 23 percent; the cost of health care, 22 
percent; you have no major concerns about health care, 18 percent; 
your ability to get health insurance coverage, 8 percent; don't 
know, 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Compared to five years ago, do you believe the health care  
system in this country is: 
</P>
<P>
	Better than it was, 24 percent; worse than it was, 34 percent;  
about the same as it was, 36 percent; don't know, 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Navy, Merchant Ships Collide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- A Navy destroyer and a much larger  
merchant ship collided early Friday in the Atlantic Ocean, leaving 
one sailor with a broken arm and damaging the bows of both ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The 563-foot Radford and the 657-foot container ship Saudi  
Riyadh bumped in the dark about 25 miles off Virginia Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Radford returned to the Norfolk Naval Base, where divers  
were to inspect the hull. 
</P>
<P>
	``At no time was the ship in any danger of losing her  
seaworthiness,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Bill Spann, a Navy spokesman. ``A 
Navy warship is designed to take a phenomenal amount of damage and 
still be able to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saudi container ship headed for Virginia Beach so the Coast  
Guard could examine it. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the accident was not known. The Navy and the  
National Transportation Safety Board were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy ship has two 5-inch gun mounts, can carry 61 Tomahawk  
missiles and can use Harpoon missiles.

<HEADLINE> Marlin on Top in Daytona Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Just the sight of Daytona  
International Speedway's 2 1/2-mile oval brings a smile to Sterling 
Marlin's face. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlin has had some hard times in a Winston Cup career that  
began in his father's car in 1976. But some of his best moments 
have come at Daytona, where he won the Daytona 500 pole in 1992 and 
then won NASCAR's most prestigious race in 1994 and 1995 while 
driving for Morgan-McClure Racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a special place in my heart,'' Marlin said Friday  
after his fast lap of 193.995 mph led all 56 drivers who took part 
in the opening day of practice for the Feb. 14 race. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad ran good here. He won a qualifying race,'' he said,  
referring to Coo Coo Marlin's win here in 1973. ``The first time I 
ran a race here, I ran second. There's just something about this 
place. I sure do like it. Some guys don't like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, his first with Team Sabco, Marlin got off to a good  
start by winning one of the twin 125-mile qualifying races. But a 
broken shock absorber early in the Daytona 500 relegated him to 
22nd place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we were going to be good last year,'' Marlin said.  
``But, from then on we kind of went into a slump and didn't run 
real good and had a lot of problems. We kind of got picked up it up 
after May and had some good runs, and we made up our mind over the 
winter that we were going to work real hard and see if we can beat 
these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he did just that, boosting himself into the  
favorite's position in today's pole qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the front row positions for the big race were to be  
determined today, with Thursday's qualifying races filling most of 
the 43-car field. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the competition for the front row was expected to be  
fierce, with 40 drivers within less than one second of Marlin's 
fast lap on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Closest to Marlin were teammates Rusty Wallace and Jeremy  
Mayfield and Rusty Wallace at 193.878 and 193.632, followed by Dale 
Jarrett at 193.528, two-time defending NASCAR Winston Cup champion 
Jeff Gordon at 193.245 and former Daytona pole-winner Kyle Petty at 
193.108. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, who was fastest in winter testing at Daytona, said,  
``Both cars are running real strong. If we get both cars on the 
front row, it's a lot easier to stay hooked up all day in the race. 
That's what we plan, but plans never really seem to work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace drew the No. 2 spot in the 58-car qualifying order, wile  
Mayfield will qualify fifth, Marlin 10th, Petty 20th and Jarrett 
24th. 
</P>
<P>
	Pole qualifying was scheduled to begin at 12:30 p.m. EST.  
Wallace said the earlier in the draw, the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it got hotter today as the day went on,'' Wallace  
noted. ``Going out second and fifth definitely isn't going to hurt 
anything at all. I believe the track will be cooler at 12:30 than 
it will be at 3 o'clock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the drivers down at the bottom of the list are Winston Cup  
runner-up Mark Martin in 43rd and Gordon 56th. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if that will be a problem or not,'' said Gordon,  
who won the Daytona 500 in 1997. ``But we don't have any choice but 
to go out and run the best lap we can and see where we stand. 
Hopefully, if we can't be on the front row, we can at least have a 
good starting spot for our qualifying race.''

<HEADLINE> Wine Label May List Health Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientific studies have suggested it, and now  
winemakers finally may get a chance to tout it through their 
labeling: A glass or two of the grape each day could be good for 
you. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department today was expected to announce proposed  
changes in wine labels to include references to some of the 
positive health effects of drinking wine, according to a senior 
administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a very major accomplishment,'' said John DeLuca,  
president of the San Francisco-based Wine Institute, which has 
pushed for to add wording about the health effects of wine. ``We 
have every expectation it will be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeLuca said the approved statement would read: ``To learn the  
health effects of wine consumption, send for the federal 
government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans.'' He said it would 
give a mailing address and a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Wine labels already warn that pregnant women should not drink  
alcohol and that alcohol can impair driving and cause health 
problems. But they say nothing about studies suggesting that 
moderate alcohol intake can reduce the risk of heart disease in 
some people. 
</P>
<P>
	The change would not become final until after a public comment  
period that could last 90 days and a review by the Treasury 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal health officials and some senators already have voiced  
their concern that such a label would purport to make a health 
claim about wine or would encourage excessive drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon General David Satcher has communicated his concern that  
mentioning health benefits on a bottle would send ``mixed 
messages,'' according to a senior administration official. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who helped write the alcohol  
warning labels that have been in place for a decade, urged federal 
regulators last spring not to approve any watered-down label. He 
also introduced a bill that would strengthen the required warning 
labels. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1997, the Health and Human Services Department wrote the  
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which is part of the 
Treasury Department, urging the bureau to delay approval of the 
labels. 
</P>
<P>
	But some winemakers said a change in the label can touch on the  
positive effects of wine while also stressing responsible behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's coming to pass is recognition that responsible,  
moderate, temperate consumption of wine in particular can have a 
place in our daily life,'' said Eric Wente of Wente Vineyards in 
Livermore, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA's dietary guidelines note that ``current evidence  
suggests that moderate drinking is associated with a lower risk for 
coronary heart disease in some individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines also point out that higher levels of alcohol  
intake can raise the risk for high blood pressure, stroke, heart 
disease, certain cancers and accidents, as well as possibly causing 
cirrhosis of the liver and damage to the brain and heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who drink should do so in moderation, the guidelines  
recommend. This is defined as no more than one drink per day for 
women and no more than two drinks per day for men. Five ounces of 
wine is considered a drink, according to the guidelines.

<HEADLINE> Men Jailed for Threatening E-mails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Two men accused in an alleged plot to  
use biological weapons against President Clinton and other 
officials were sentenced Friday to more than 24 years in prison for 
sending threatening e-mail to government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnie Wise and Jack Abbott Grebe, both members of the  
separatist group Republic of Texas, gave rambling anti-government 
speeches at their sentencing and challenged U.S. District Judge 
Hilda Tagle's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	They were convicted in October of sending e-mail to the Internal  
Revenue Service and the Drug Enforcement Agency, threatening to use 
biological weapons against government employees and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise, Grebe and a third man were acquitted of conspiring to  
develop a device in which a modified Bic lighter would shoot a 
cactus needle coated with a toxin such as anthrax, the AIDS virus, 
rabies or botulism.

	Jordan's King Hussein Faces Death  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Cancer-stricken King Hussein lay dying in a  
hospital bed today as hundereds of Jordanians wept outside his 
window, some offering up their own organs to their leader of 46 
years. Royal palace sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said the king's brain had stopped functioning and that his liver 
and kidneys had failed. A respirator kept Hussein breathing, but 
the end could come within hours or days, sources said. The king's 
family did not want to take the 63-year-old Hussein off life 
support.

	Clinton Witnesses Offer Little New

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In need of support to help him through the  
impeachment crisis, President Clinton could have done a lot worse 
than Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal. All 
three gave almost no new information to House managers in 
depositions for his trial. Ms. Lewinsky testified that she 
respected and admired the president. Blumenthal recalled Clinton's 
demeanor a year ago when the Lewinsky scandal erupted: ``I thought 
he was a man in anguish,'' Blumenthal said of the president. Jordan 
made few concessions.

	Tyson Is Going Back to Jail

<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- In a move that places his boxing career in  
jeopardy, former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was sentenced 
today to a year in jail for assaulting two motorists after a 
traffic accident. Judge Stephen Johnson handed Tyson a two-year 
sentence, but suspended one year. Indiana authorities also must now 
decide whether the 32-year-old fighter violated his probation for a 
1991 rape conviction. Tyson was released in 1995 after serving 
three years of a six-year sentence, and his probation was set to 
expire in March. In October, Tyson's boxing license was reinstated 
after a one-year suspension for biting Evander Holyfield's ear 
during a fight in June 1997.

government touted figures showing that consumers spent $9 billion 
last year on the Internet, it warned that growth of electronic 
commerce will wane unless shoppers trust that personal information 
will be kept private. Complete figures for last year and this year 
won't be available until the summer of 2000.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With Russia still pressing for his  
dismissal, chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler today said 
he will resist any move to oust him before his term ends June 30. 
The Russians and Chinese have demanded Butler's ouster since U.N. 
Special Commission reported on Dec. 15 that Iraq had failed to live 
up to its weapons inspection pledge. Butler said he told 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Wednesday that he would not seek an 
extension of his contract as UNSCOM head, which is charged with

center of Malanje, about 190 miles east of the capital Luanda, a 
private radio station reported. No immediate casualty figures were 
available. Malanje's population of 500,000 has nearly doubled since 
a two-decade civil war between the government and UNITA resumed in 
December.

eight per year desired by NASA.

<HEADLINE> Volvo Said Set To Buy Scania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Volvo AB is on the verge of succeeding  
in its attempt to buy Swedish rival Scania, a deal that would 
create Europe's biggest truck-maker, the respected daily Dagens 
Nyheter reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper cited unidentified sources close to negotiations  
as saying the deal was imminent. The companies declined to comment 
on the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Nils Ingvar Lundin, a spokesman for the investment company  
Investor AB, which holds about 45 percent of Scania's shares, said 
Friday, ``We have said that we have talked with other parties and 
are prepared to continue talking with other parties (than Volvo) 
and are trying to determine what is best for Scania.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo surprised the markets last month when it announced that it  
had bought nearly 13 percent of the shares in Scania, a move that 
Investor described as ``close to hostile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But many observers speculated that Investor would be interested  
in selling its shares in Scania for a high price. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo last week announced that it planned to sell its  
passenger-car division to Ford Motor Company for 50 billion kronor 
($6.45 billion) in cash. That money would give Volvo considerable 
muscle in seeking to buy up Scania shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Dagens Nyheter said the purchase of Scania would cost 55 billion  
to 60 billion kronor ($7.1 billion to $7.7 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Scania shares closed up 2.8 percent, at about $32.35, Friday on  
the Stockholm Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo's truck and bus divisions, which employ nearly 27,000  
people, reported sales of 54.7 billion kronor ($6.8 billion) for 
the first nine months of 1998. Scania, with about 24,000 employees, 
had sales of 32.4 billion kronor ($4.05 billion) for the same 
period. Volvo's total sales for the first nine months of 1998, 
including its automobile and aviation divisions, was 150 billion 
kronor ($18.75 billion).

<HEADLINE> Starr Lawyers Discuss Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two former and one current member of Kenneth  
Starr's prosecutorial team insisted they did not leak the story of 
the independent counsel's belief that he has the authority to 
indict President Clinton while the president remains in office. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was silent when asked if there is a sealed indictment  
against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``To read that people in the office were leaking was  
demoralizing,'' said Michael Emmick, associate independent counsel. 
``It made me want to start strangling people. It was mortifying. I 
hope it turns out it was all a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick, a former member of the U.S. attorney's office in Los  
Angeles, was a panelist Thursday at a program titled ``Starr 
Gazing.'' It was sponsored by the Los Angeles County Bar in 
conjunction with the American Bar Association's midwinter meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick and former Starr staff members Karin Immergut and Thomas  
Bienert fielded a barrage of questions from fellow lawyers and 
reporters. Earlier, Emmick used a large chart to present the case 
for preserving the independent counsel law, which is due to expire 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does the (independent counsel) act create monsters --  
overzealous, obsessive, independent counsels on a mission to 'get' 
their targets,'' one chart read. 
</P>
<P>
	His answer was no. But he was challenged by panelists Neil  
Eggleston, a counsel to the Office of the President, and Ted Wells, 
the defense attorney who won an acquittal on corruption charges for 
former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monsters?'' Wells said. ``These three people seem very nice at  
dinner. But something happens to you when you go to the independent 
counsel office. ... They become crazed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said unlimited finances and time allotted to the independent  
counsel is ``an invitation to a witchhunt'' and he called some of 
their legal positions ``wacky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immergut, who served with Starr for four months in 1998, said  
when she arrived there was ``a siege mentality which emanated from 
the White House attitude toward Ken Starr. ... We were so concerned 
with leaks. We only had each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immergut, now a state prosecutor in Portland, Ore., said she  
almost declined the request to work for Starr because ``I thought I 
would never get a job again. ... People thought that I was crazy 
because I would be branded part of the right wing conspiracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moderator Laurie Levenson, associate dean of Loyola University  
Law School, challenged both Emmick and Immergut on their treatment 
of Monica Lewinsky and asked whether the key witness was ``broken'' 
during questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Immergut said she asked all the personal questions and  
complained that ``as I asked those questions I did not anticipate 
that was for dissemination over the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick, who was the first to quiz Lewinsky in a Washington hotel  
room, acknowledged it was ``a stressful and traumatic day for 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He confirmed that Lewinsky was advised not to call a lawyer who  
had been representing her in civil depositions. He defended the 
action, citing a later court decision that Lewinsky's right to 
counsel was not violated because no charges had been brought 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick said he and other members of the team believed that her  
civil lawyer, Frank Carter, did not handle criminal litigation, a 
statement greeted with some skepticism by his questioners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Didn't she ask to speak with him?'' asked a lawyer in the  
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes and gosh I'm glad you asked that question,'' said Emmick  
who then cited the ruling by U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway 
Johnson on the issue. ``We actually gave her the names of a public 
defender and a legal aid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of Lewinsky's treatment, he said, ``When you're asked to  
cooperate in an investigation of this kind it's going to be hellish 
no matter how nice you are to her. It's a nightmare. That's one of 
the ugly truths about law enforcement. It's very ugly at times. We 
tried to make it as undifficult as we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the explicit sexual detail contained in Starr's report,  
Bienert said, ``For my taste, I would like to have seen less 
detail.'' But he blamed President Clinton for putting at issue the 
definition of what is sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``It forced the office to get into details,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Levenson's final question -- ``Is there a sealed indictment?'' --  
elicited only silence from all members of the panel.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky: He Never Told Me To Lie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sentimental without swaying from her story,  
Monica Lewinsky declared to House prosecutors in a videotaped 
deposition that President Clinton never suggested she file a false 
affidavit to deny their affair. She said she was ``a pest'' to 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan in seeking a job. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky said she now has ``mixed feelings'' for Clinton and  
objected when her congressional inquisitor, Rep. Ed Bryant, 
referred to her relations with Clinton as ``salacious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress today released transcripts of the depositions taken  
this week from Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan and White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal. Excerpts from all three are to be played at the 
impeachment trial on Saturday, giving Americans their first view of 
Ms. Lewinsky answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
	In her deposition taped earlier this week, Ms. Lewinsky  
recounted a middle-of-the-night telephone call from Clinton on Dec. 
17, 1997. During the call, the president informed her she might 
become a witness in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and 
suggested she could file an affidavit to avoid being deposed. 
</P>
<P>
	But in testimony that undermines one aspect of the perjury and  
obstruction of justice charges against Clinton, the former White 
House intern insisted Clinton never told her to file a false 
affidavit. ``There was no discussion of what would be in an 
affidavit,'' she said. ``I don't think I necessarily thought at 
that point it would have to be false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Bryant pressed further, Ms. Lewinsky conceded that during  
that same conversation she began thinking to herself that she would 
deny the relationship because she and the president had always 
planned to use ``cover stories'' to conceal their affair. ``From 
what I learned ... through those cover stories ... from what I 
learned in that conversation, I thought to myself I knew I would 
deny the relationship,'' Ms. Lewinsky explained. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the president never told her to lie or to tell the  
truth. She refused to say whether she felt Clinton lied when he 
denied touching her in a sexual manner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't feel comfortable characterizing whether what he  
said was truthful or not truthful,'' she told the House 
prosecutors. ``I know I've testified to what I believe is true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her sworn testimony to prosecutor Kenneth Starr, Ms. Lewinsky  
said Clinton touched her. Clinton denied that he touched her in a 
sexual manner although he acknowledged an inappropriate 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Several times in her deposition, Ms. Lewinsky reflected  
sentimentally on her secret affair with the president and the 
tumultuous times when it was exposed and exploded into an 
impeachment crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	She recalled with a laugh that during her first meeting with  
Frank Carter, the lawyer Jordan found for her to help in the Jones 
case, ``I asked if I could sue Paula Jones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The questioning turned personal when Bryant asked Ms. Lewinsky  
whether she still had ``feelings for the president'' a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have mixed feelings,'' she replied. She answered ``yes''  
twice when Bryant asked if she still admired the president and 
appreciated ``what he is doing for this country as the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate on Thursday voted not to call Ms. Lewinsky to testify  
in person, opting instead for the airing of portions of her 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was in recess today, so both sides could prepare for  
Saturday's presentations. Closing arguments will be held Monday, 
and then deliberations, with a vote expected next Friday or sooner 
on conviction or acquittal of the president on the articles of 
impeachment. Republicans and Democrats agree that the 67 votes 
needed to convict and remove Clinton are lacking. 
</P>
<P>
	There was growing bipartisan sentiment to open to the public the  
Senate's deliberations on the impeachment verdict. Senators 
expressed support today for changing rules that require the 
deliberations be kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
	``These outdated rules are outweighed by the compelling national  
interest and values involved,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. 
Added Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.: ``It is very important for the 
American people to understand as fully as possible why we are doing 
what we are doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his testimony, Jordan described the dramatic weeks in  
December 1997 when Ms. Lewinsky was emerging as a potential witness 
in the Jones case at the same time Jordan was seeking a job in New 
York for her at the behest of the president. He recalled how Ms. 
Lewinsky called him in ``an emotional state'' when she got a 
subpoena in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was disturbed about not having, in her words, heard from  
the president or talked to the president. It was also in that 
meeting that it became clear to me that ... for lack of a better 
way to put it, that she had a 'thing' for the president,'' Jordan 
explained. He said, however, Ms. Lewinsky denied the relationship 
was sexual during the Dec. 18 conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan snapped at Rep. Asa Hutchinson when the House prosecutor  
asked if he had ever suggested that Ms. Lewinsky destroy subpoenaed 
love letters she had written the president. The former intern has 
testified he did. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Hutchinson, I'm a lawyer and I'm a loyal friend, but I'm  
not a fool, and the notion that I would suggest to anybody that 
they destroy anything just defies anything that I know about 
myself. So the notion that I said to her go home and destroy notes 
is ridiculous,'' Jordan answered. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Jordan's efforts to help her find work, Ms. Lewinsky said,  
``I was a pest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal, in his testimony, recounted a conversation he had  
with the president in January of last year after the Lewinsky 
controversy erupted in public. He said Clinton suggested he had 
tried to minister to a troubled Ms. Lewinsky, that she had pursued 
him and he had rebuffed the requests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he was very upset,'' Blumenthal said. ``That  
troubled me. And I also was troubled by his association with 
troubled people and thought this was not a good story and thought 
he shouldn't be doing this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal later passed on Clinton's story to a federal grand  
jury. House prosecutors argue the president had planted the false 
account to mislead the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky expressed gratitude for some of the gifts Clinton  
gave her, particularly a hat pin. ``It was the first gift he gave 
me. It was a thoughtful gift. It was beautiful,'' she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	And when Bryant asked her about ``the first so-called salacious  
occasion,'' she interrupted him, saying, ``Can you call it 
something else? ... I mean, this is my relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant said, ``What would you like to call it?''  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky replied, ``It was my first encounter with the  
president, so I don't really see it as my first salacious -- that's 
not what this was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She stuck closely to her earlier grand jury testimony, but cast  
doubt on Clinton's sworn testimony that he told her she might have 
to turn over his gifts if they were subpoenaed in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did the president ever tell you to turn over the gifts?''  
Bryant, R-Tenn., asked in the Monday questioning. ``Not that I 
remember,'' she answered. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors are trying to show that the president's and  
Jordan's efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job were linked to her 
filing a false affidavit denying her affair with the president and 
that the hiding of gifts he had given her was part of a scheme by 
Clinton to obstruct justice.

<HEADLINE> Vernon Jordan Annoyed by Questioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From the outset, it was clear that  
presidential friend Vernon Jordan was more than a little annoyed 
about answering questions again regarding his job search for Monica 
Lewinsky -- especially from a Republican House prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Transcripts released Friday from Jordan's deposition earlier  
this week reveal glimpses of a famous, powerful lawyer who is 
treated with great respect by the House prosecutor, Rep. Asa 
Hutchinson of Arkansas. Jordan, meanwhile, seems by turns jovial 
and dismissive. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the questioning, Hutchinson told Jordan, ``I've looked  
forward to this opportunity to meet you,'' to which Jordan jokingly 
replied: ``I can't say that the feeling is mutual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly understand,'' Hutchinson commented as those in the  
room laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, Jordan reacted with apparent disdain when  
Hutchinson asked him to define what ``making rain'' means at the 
800-lawyer firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think even in Arkansas you understand what rainmaking is,''  
Jordan said before defining his job as one that brings in new 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've read (John) Grisham books,'' said Hutchinson, referring  
to the lawyer-turned-novelist who wrote ``The Rainmaker,'' which 
was made into a movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Jordan said he once charged upwards of $500 an hour but  
now has moved beyond billing clients. ``Not bad for a Georgia 
boy,'' he said. ``I'm from Georgia. You've heard of that state, I'm 
sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Jordan's testimony covers familiar ground: that he  
helped Ms. Lewinsky look for a New York job using high-level 
contacts at Revlon and elsewhere and that he often helps people 
find jobs; that President Clinton was concerned and was kept 
apprised of the search; that Ms. Lewinsky denied to him that she 
was having a sexual relationship with Clinton, and that the job 
search was not linked to Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit denying the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, Jordan said he called Clinton the day Ms. Lewinsky  
signed the affidavit because the president ``was obviously 
interested in her job search ... I would say, 'Mr. President, she 
signed the affidavit. She signed the affidavit.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``And what was his response?'' Hutchinson asked.  
</P>
<P>
	```Thank you very much,''' Jordan replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan was forced to correct earlier testimony denying that he'd  
met Ms. Lewinsky for breakfast at the Park Hyatt hotel on Dec. 31, 
1997, after Hutchinson confronted him with credit card receipts. 
And although Jordan acknowledged they talked about love notes Ms. 
Lewinsky had written the president, Jordan flatly denied telling 
her to get rid of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Hutchinson, I'm a lawyer and I'm a loyal friend, but I'm  
not a fool, and the notion that I would suggest to anybody that 
they destroy anything just defies anything that I know about 
myself,'' Jordan said. ``So the notion that I said to her, `Go home 
and destroy notes,' is ridiculous.''

<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- A man was fined $500 for impersonating  
hip-hop artist Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott in phone calls to 
radio stations and others.

threatening her if she didn't rehire him.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Committee To Reorganize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Gov. Mike Leavitt and Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee Chairman Robert Garff unveiled a sweeping reorganization 
plan for running the 2002 Winter Games that is more open and has 
better oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization announced Thursday would include 17 or 18 new  
spots on the SLOC board of trustees. The board's executive 
committee would be replaced with a management group ordered to keep 
a tight rein on planning. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal by Garff and Leavitt will be voted on next week by  
the full board. That vote will come two days after it gets a report 
from an independent ethics panel investigating Salt Lake City's 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have found the bid committee gave more than $1  
million in cash, free medical care, travel and scholarships to IOC 
members or their relatives before the 1995 IOC vote giving Salt 
Lake City the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff said he and Leavitt have not offered the job of SLOC chief  
executive to anyone, and refused to discuss Mitt Romney, the man 
believed to be the front-runner. Romney is a Boston venture 
capitalist and former Republican Senate candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chief executive would replace Frank Joklik, who resigned  
Jan. 8 but remains on the job until he is replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The new board members, to be chosen by Leavitt and Mayor Deedee  
Corradini, likely would be ready to join the board on Feb. 11, 
Garff said. ``We have a reasonable expectation it will be 
approved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff and Leavitt declined to say whether board members who also  
were on the bid committee will remain on SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to see if any of those people are implicated,''  
Garff said. ``We will review those facts and then take decisive 
action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roles of First Security Corp. Chairman Spence Eccles and  
PacifiCorp Vice President Verl Topham, both on the executive 
committee, have come under question. They were enlisted during Salt 
Lake's bidding for the games to watch over staffers now blamed for 
excesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt declined to say whether restructuring of the board might  
mean ridding it of businessmen who are doing business with SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics committee investigating the scandal also has  
looked at contracts awarded by the SLOC board to some of its 
members. A $23.2 million contract went to a construction company 
headed by board trustee Alan Layton to build a roof for a speed 
skating oval. SLOC board member Earl Holding is owner of Snowbasin 
ski resort, where the downhill races will be staged. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization is designed to broaden community  
representation and give more responsibility to the management 
committee. However, the enlarged board of trustees would lose its 
decision-making authority, playing only an advisory role for the 
management committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the seven at-large members elected by the full board,  
the management committee would include Leavitt, Garff, Corradini, a 
new SLOC president and chief executive, four athletes, three U.S. 
Olympic Committee officials and two IOC representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt also elaborated on a statement that he knew little about  
the excessive spending on International Olympic Committee members 
by a few bid executives. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he met about 50 IOC members and their families, posed  
for photographs and gave obligatory gifts of diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not ever personally see a gift of great value,'' Leavitt  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not know that the international students he met  
were sons and daughters of IOC members, some supported by bid 
money, and he repeated an earlier assertion that the lavish 
spending was hidden from him and the bid committee by bid 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was there a pattern of deception? Yes,'' Leavitt said. ``They  
had to hide it. I didn't see it and I don't know of anyone else who 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt dismissed allegations to the contrary by Tom Welch, the  
former bid committee president who has been blamed for the 
excesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not unexpected from someone who is feeling a lot of  
pressure because of past actions,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sydney Olympics organizing president Michael Knight announced a  
full independent investigation of the city's winning bid for the 
2000 Games, to be completed by March 11. Knight said the inquiry 
was intended to ``clear the air on Sydney's bid once and for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Welch denied he told CNN that the bid committee took $50,000 in  
cash to Budapest, where the IOC chose Salt Lake for the games. 
Welch said he told CNN that he didn't know about any cash, but if 
it was carried to Budapest, it was to pay routine expenses of the 
Salt Lake delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. Merrill Cook, R-Utah, said the $150 million Congress has  
approved so Utah can prepare its highways, airport and mass transit 
systems before the Olympics is safe. Rep. John Dingle, D-Michigan, 
has asked the General Accounting Office to determine whether Salt 
Lake is being rewarded with federal dollars after using shady means 
to get the games. 
</P>
<P>
	That money cannot now be withdrawn, and neither can the  
legislation that authorizes the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to 
give funding priority in coming years to Salt Lake and other host 
cities, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, securing money might be harder in the future, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	--The Washington Post said FBI agents and Olympic ethics  
investigators are examining evidence that Salt Lake Olympic 
organizers used airline tickets to disguise illicit payments to 
several IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the tickets, bought at premium prices by the Salt Lake  
committee, in some instances were cashed in or traded for 
less-expensive fares. Investigators were examining whether there 
was an understanding between some IOC members and Salt Lake 
organizers that the tickets would serve as a form of payoff in 
return for supporting the city's bid, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	--USA Today, citing unidentified sources, said the Salt Lake bid  
committee made thousands of dollars in questionable payments to a 
company linked to former U.S. Olympic Committee official Alfredo La 
Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said La Mont, who resigned Jan. 14 as senior  
director of international relations, used a company named Citius to 
receive payments that amounted to at least $2,500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	La Mont was the middleman in efforts by Welch to buy  
intelligence about IOC members in Latin America, sources told The 
Associated Press at the time of his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	--The New York Times said it had obtained copies of letters  
written by Joklik and another member of the Salt Lake bid 
committee's board of trustees, James Beardall, seeking to get a 
forestry job for the husband of a Finnish member of the IOC. The 
letters to Weyerhauser Company on behalf of Bjarne Haeggman were 
sent in 1993 when Salt Lake was seeking the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik and other board members have insisted they were unaware  
such tactics were part of an aggressive campaign to win over IOC 
members who would vote on the site selection. 
</P>
<P>
	--An IOC member from South Korea denied today that Salt Lake  
Olympic officials helped find a job for his son in the United 
States and reimbursed part of his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Un-yong, the only member of the IOC's executive board  
implicated in the Salt Lake scandal, said the allegations against 
him were part of a plot to discredit him and his close ally, 
Olympic chief Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim spoke in reaction to USA Today's report that Kim's only son,  
Kim Jung-hoon, was employed by a Utah company, Keystone 
Communications, at the request of Salt Lake officials.

<HEADLINE> Symington Loses Bankruptcy Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Former Gov. Fife Symington lost his bid to get  
rid of or reduce the last multimillion-dollar debt in his 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Judge John Mangum ruled against Symington's request  
for revaluing the debt he owes a group of union pension funds that 
financed a downtown Phoenix office and retail development called 
the Mercado. 
</P>
<P>
	After Symington failed to repay a loan he had guaranteed  
personally, the funds ultimately took over the project under 
foreclosure and hired a management organization to run it. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds won an $8.8 million judgment against him in 1995. With  
interest, the judgment has grown to $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Symington's bankruptcy petition, filed shortly after the pension  
funds judgment was reached, remains pending in U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court. Settlements have been reached in his other major debts that 
once totaled about $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Symington resigned as governor after he was convicted of wire  
and bank fraud in a separate criminal proceeding. He was sentenced 
to 2 1/2 years in prison. He remains free while his appeal is pending.

<HEADLINE> Compliments for New Pebble Beach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The No. 5 hole at Pebble Beach  
finally is what it was meant to be 80 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The new par-3 hole at Pebble Beach Golf Links, designed by Jack  
Nicklaus, hugs Stillwater Cove and the crashing waves of the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really impressed,'' said Phil Mickelson, who got his  
first look at the new hole this week while tuning up for the AT&AMP;T 
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.''I thought it looked like it had been 
here since the first, you know, when the course was created back in 
the early 1900s. Just amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new hole was placed where developer Samuel F. B. Morse -- a  
descendant of telegraph inventor -- originally envisioned it. But 
alas, he had sold the oceanfront site before his dream of creating 
a golf course was realized. 
</P>
<P>
	Morse tried to buy the property back, but balked at the $20,000  
asking price. Pebble Beach was opened on Feb. 22, 1919, with a No. 
5 hole that played uphill and inland from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast forward to a few years back, when the Pebble Beach Golf Co.  
was able to acquire the property for more than $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus, who won a U.S. Amateur, a U.S. Open and three Pro-Ams  
at the course, designed the hole with the surroundings in mind. The 
green has a back pin position, guarded from southerly breezes by a 
buffer of trees. 
</P>
<P>
	The hole plays 187 yards for the pros, and 138 yards for the  
amateurs. The two tees are separated by a quaint bridge over a deep 
ravine that spills into the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The scenic hole was not without controversy. Environmentalists  
protested plans to remove an old oak tree where the green was to 
be. The oak turned out to be diseased, and cut down anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionalists complained about altering the course, which has  
hosted the National Pro-Am since 1947 when the tournament was known 
as the Crosby Clambake. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the pros were skeptical. But upon playing the hole this  
week, many were pleasantly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``It now flows with the rest of the golf course. It's a fair  
hole, you can now see the pin,'' said Brett Quigley, the co-leader 
with a 6-under 66 after Thursday's first round. ``At the old hole 
you were hitting over the bunker there and you were never really 
sure where you were going.''

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Just a day before peace talks to  
stop the bloodshed in Kosovo, the province's leading ethnic 
Albanian party today demanded that any deal include a vote on 
independence and the stationing of NATO troops -- conditions the 
Serbs reject. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, international monitors were trying to prevent an  
armed clash between ethnic Albanian guerrillas and Serb police 
wanting to enter a rebel area to investigate a robbery at a Serbian 
monastery. 
</P>
<P>
	Protection of Serb religious sites in this largely Muslim  
province is considered one of the most sensitive issues in the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators for the majority ethnic Albanian community were  
expected to leave later today for France, where the internationally 
sponsored conference is to open Saturday in Rambouillet, near 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the departure, the spokesman for the main ethnic Albanian  
party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, insisted that any agreement 
include provisions for a referendum on independence and the 
stationing of NATO troops here. 
</P>
<P>
	Xhemail Mustafa, spokesman for the party headed by Ibrahim  
Rugova, said the presence of NATO troops was the only way to 
guarantee any peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	He also insisted ethnic Albanians be allowed to build political  
institutions outside Serbia's control to pave the way for possible 
independence after a three-year period of autonomy, as proposed by 
the conference sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	A referendum on independence is also a key demand of the Kosovo  
Liberation Army, which will also attend the Rambouillet talks but 
has opposed Rugova's nonviolent campaign for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbian government was to name its team of negotiators today  
after a grudging acceptance Thursday of the internationally 
brokered negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Serbian lawmakers strongly rejected the peace plan that the  
United States and its European allies seek to impose by Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kosovo is not just any part of Serbia. Kosovo is Serbia's  
heart and it will remain forever so,'' said Gorica Gajevic, a top 
aide to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, in an emotional 
speech in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	An ultranationalist Serb deputy, Tomislav Nikolic, warned that  
government representatives to the talks must resist heavy pressure 
at Rambouillet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be difficult for you there, but it will be even worse  
for you when you return if you yield to pressure there,'' Nikolic 
said in a threatening tone. 
</P>
<P>
	Jakup Krasniqi, a senior KLA leader and one of five guerrilla  
representatives at the conference, said the rebels are going to 
peace talks to make their case for full independence, but are ``not 
very optimistic'' of either getting it or of ending fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncompromising positions of both sides signaled that success  
in Rambouillet is far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
	As a sign of the continuing tensions, international monitors  
were trying today to refuse a dangerous standoff in Srbica, a town 
18 miles west of here, where Serb police were trying to enter rebel 
territory to investigate a robbery at a Serbian Orthodox monastery. 
</P>
<P>
	About eight armored vehicles were prepared to move to the  
monastery of Devic, where thieves three days ago made off with farm 
equipment. KLA rebels refused to let them enter. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas Kern of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in  
Europe said a confrontation erupted Thursday when police tried to 
approach the monastery, home to nine Serbian nuns. There were no 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Kern said OSCE monitors were negotiating with both sides to try  
to resolve the standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Western leaders, meanwhile, were moving ahead with plans to put  
as many as 30,000 peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, despite Serb 
warnings against foreign intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said in Washington that ``unless we can  
contain and ultimately defuse the ethnic hatreds in that region, 
they can embroil us ... in a much larger conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton was ``seriously considering'' sending as many as  
4,000 U.S. troops to enforce a possible peace deal, the Serbian 
assembly railed against the notion in a declaration: ``We do not 
accept the presence of foreign troops on our territory under any 
excuse.''

<HEADLINE> Ancient Egypt Helps Modern Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists trying to unravel the mysteries of  
El Nino are studying floods on the Nile, using information 
collected by instruments introduced in the days of the pharaohs. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual Nile floods were vital to Egyptian agriculture, so  
the ancient pharaohs introduced the nilometer, a device to measure 
the height of the river flood. 
</P>
<P>
	Now researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are  
finding those records useful in estimating the frequency of the El 
Nino climate phenomenon in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	They have discovered a period, just over 1,000 years ago, that  
had relatively frequent El Ninos, similar to the pattern of the 
past 20 years, according to a paper in the Feb. 15 edition of 
Geophysical Research Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers Elfatih A.B. Eltahir and Guiling Wang looked at Nile  
flood records dating back to A.D. 650 -- long after the pharaohs but 
still recorded using the nilometer system -- to develop an estimate 
of past El Ninos. 
</P>
<P>
	El Nino, an unusual warming of the water in the eastern tropical  
Pacific Ocean, can have worldwide impacts on weather. Sea surface 
temperature records go back only to the late 1800s, so climate 
researchers have looked for other ways to determine when past El 
Ninos might have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	When an El Nino is under way, rain is reduced over the sources  
of the Nile. Studies have found that about 30 percent of the change 
in water flow on the Nile at Aswan can be attributed to El Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper shows frequent El Ninos between about 750 and 1000  
with a reduction after that, and then an increase again in the 
latter years of this century. It did not speculate on the reason 
for the correlation between the two periods.

<HEADLINE> Jurors Chosen in Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Eight Marine officers, none of them  
combat pilots, were chosen as jurors Friday for the court-martial 
of an aviator whose jet sliced through a ski gondola cable in the 
Italian Alps, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby's lawyers questioned whether he could  
receive a fair trial without combat pilots on the panel. Two combat 
pilots had been dismissed from the jury pool. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, noted that there are  
three aviators on the jury who fly helicopters or cargo planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening arguments are scheduled for Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged with 20 counts  
of involuntary manslaughter in the Feb. 3, 1998, accident. 
Navigator Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., faces the 
same charges and will be tried separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunley set aside Tuesday morning for jurors to see Prowlers  
firsthand. They will be flown by helicopter 60 miles to Cherry 
Point Marine Air Base, where each juror will sit in a Prowler. They 
will then go to a range to watch a Prowler and an F-18 fly over at 
1,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Ashby was flying recklessly low and fast  
during the training flight. The Prowler EA-6B warplane was supposed 
to be flying no lower than 1,000 feet when it hit the cable, which 
was suspended 370 feet above the valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys say that the pilot was using a map that didn't  
have the ski lift marked on it and that an optical illusion caused 
him to think he was flying higher than he was.

<HEADLINE> Senators Consider Clinton Censure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON -- With President Clinton's acquittal on impeachment  
charges virtually assured, Senate Republicans and Democrats are 
quietly jockeying over how strongly -- if at all -- he should be 
censured for his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and his efforts 
to conceal it. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, ready to vote overwhelmingly and possibly unanimously  
against conviction, favor a formal condemnation. Sens. Dianne 
Feinstein of California and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York are 
leading a drafting effort in hopes the Senate will vote on it at 
when the trial ends late next week. A recent draft cited Clinton 
for ``shameless, reckless and indefensible behavior'' and said his 
conduct demeaned his office and ``creates disrespect for the laws 
of the land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans favor censure, including Sen. John Chafee of  
Rhode Island, who says of Clinton's behavior, ``We believe this is 
just plain wrong ...that it's harmful for the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are obvious difficulties in reaching agreement on terms  
satisfactory to both Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid that once the (Democratic proposal) is out there  
will be many critics of the president who will argue it's not 
strong enough, and if this turns into an escalation of humiliation, 
it will fall apart,'' Democratic Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans are opposed to censure, and one, Texas Sen.  
Phil Gramm, has all but threatened a filibuster to block it, in 
part on constitutional grounds. ``You either remove the president 
(by convicting him on an article of impeachment) or you have no 
ability to transcend the line that represents the separation of 
power,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott has yet to disclose his position. His  
spokesman, John Czwartacki, said Friday the Mississippi Republican 
``has real concerns'' about censure, including a fear it may set a 
dangerous constitutional precedent. ``Are we going to be in the 
business of censuring any president that comes along for policy 
differences?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	There are political factors at play, as well.  
</P>
<P>
	Some Republican strategists, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
say they fear that Democrats favoring acquittal on charges of 
perjury and obstruction of justice would point to their censure 
vote to immunize themselves against accusations that they let 
Clinton escape punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	These Republicans concede, however, that some GOP senators will  
also oppose conviction on at least one article of impeachment and 
may want to go on record in favor of censure. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Gramm spoke dismissively of the political  
maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Censure is driven by a desire of politicians to have it both  
ways,'' he said. ``They want to vote yes and no, guilty and not 
guilty at the same time. Censure lets them do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are operating on the assumption that Republicans will  
try to end the trial without a formal vote. That would be 
turnabout, after Democrats united to oppose a Republican plan to 
declare Clinton guilty of wrongdoing as part of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if the Senate begins a winter vacation at the end of  
next week without a vote on censure, Democrats say they could 
resurrect the issue when lawmakers return to Washington. One option 
is to attempt to add a provision censuring the president to 
unrelated legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	However it turns out, the current censure debate is the residue  
of earlier suggestions for more tangible penalties against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The suggestion of a fine -- once envisioned by House Democrats as  
part of what they dubbed ``censure plus'' -- has faded. ``Bad, bad, 
bad,'' Moynihan said of that idea at one point. ``I'm sure the 
people who are proposing it are doing so in perfectly good faith. 
Impeachment is not about punishment. The Constitution is very 
clear,'' added the New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
	Also discarded are suggestions that Clinton would agree  
voluntarily to reimburse the government for the costs that 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr incurred investigating the 
Lewinsky matter. Nor has there been any talk lately of stripping 
the president of his government pension. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as December, House Democrats battling against  
impeachment drafted harshly worded legislation that Clinton would 
be required to sign in acknowledgment of ``this censure and 
condemnation.'' Even the idea of a presidential signature on the 
instrument of his censure seems to have been abandoned, at least 
for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton virtually invited Congress to censure him several months  
ago. But in public, at least, the White House is staying out of the 
current debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be up to the Senate to decide how they want to move  
forward,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Brazil IMF Vow May Worsen Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Stock and currency values eroded  
further Friday due to investor skepticism over the lack of details 
in Brazil's new belt-tightening commitments to the International 
Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said they feared the deal to salvage an IMF-led loan  
package of $41.5 billion would hobble Latin America's dominant 
economy with higher interest rates, worsening unemployment and 
deeper recession. The United States fears that continued economic 
turmoil in Brazil could stifle growth elsewhere in a region that 
accounts for a major share of U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the lack of specifics in the government's pledge  
Thursday to reduce its public debt and achieve a budget surplus 
triggered a decline on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, where share 
prices closed down 2.5 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the currency market, the real slipped to 1.84 to the dollar  
before rallying to close at 1.82. It opened trading at 1.81 to the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The real has depreciated by 34 percent since Jan. 13, when the  
government first moved to let the currency float freely on world 
exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Thursday by Finance Minister Pedro Malan  
and the IMF's Deputy Director Stanley Fischer revised earlier 
financial targets to account for the precipitous devaluation of 
Brazil's currency, the real. The central bank abandoned efforts to 
prop up the currency in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The slide in the real has rekindled fears of inflation, which  
plunged from about 2,700 percent in 1993, when the government 
pegged the real to the dollar, to just 2 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint statement by IMF and Brazilian officials made clear that  
the government will resort to high interest rates in an effort to 
control inflation, but it avoided a commitment to firm year-end 
figures. Malan sidestepped the issue, saying only that the 
annualized rate of inflation would amount to less than 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While both Malan and Fischer avoided details on the specific  
steps Brazil would need to take in order to meet the goals, but 
analysts foresee cuts in government spending as well as higher 
taxes. The result, they say, is that gross domestic product will 
shrink by even more than the 1 percent originally forecast by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Marcio Pochmann of the University of Campinas said GDP  
will probably contract by as much as 3.5 percent and that inflation 
could reach 10 percent. ``Instead of last year's 6.6 million 
unemployed, we'll have more than 10 million,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The key targets cited in Thursday's deal are public debt of less  
than 46.5 percent of GDP -- the goal established in Brazil's 
previous agreement with the IMF -- and a budget surplus of 3 percent 
to 3.5 percent of GDP by the end of 1999. The government is to 
reach its surplus target two years sooner than under the earlier 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main question for them now is how the government will  
achieve these targets. We need specifics,'' said Thomas Taterka, a 
head trader at Sao Paulo's Banco Cidade. 
</P>
<P>
	``International investors are still completely absent from  
Brazil,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil had hoped to secure an early release of a second $9  
billion installment of the aid package, but the IMF won't make the 
money available until its board of directors approves the terms of 
the new agreement. Brazil received a first disbursement of $9.4 
billion in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``The missing piece of the puzzle is still credit from private  
international banks,'' said Silvio Camargo, head of institutional 
equity sales at Banco Fator in Sao Paulo.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Lifts Ban on Louisville </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- In an unprecedented move, the NCAA on  
Friday overturned a postseason ban, giving Louisville's basketball 
team a chance to play in a March tournament this season. 
</P>
<P>
	An NCAA appeals committee cited ``procedural error'' in the case  
of NCAA violations by former Louisville assistant coach Scooter 
McCray. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said Louisville and McCray had not been adequately  
warned about the seriousness of the violations, and that may have 
altered their defense before the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been something that's been held over our head, and  
we've been penalized in a lot of ways,'' Louisville coach Denny 
Crum said. ``But we're happy now that it's over, that it's all 
behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling makes the Cardinals eligible for postseason play just  
four weeks before the start of the Conference USA tournament, which 
Louisville would have missed under the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``It ought to be a real positive, motivating factor in the rest  
of our games this season, to get to the point, hopefully, where we 
will quality for (NCAA) tournament play,'' Crum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville did not appeal its other penalties, including a  
three-year probation and the loss of three scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	In its investigation, the NCAA found that McCray secured a  
discounted hotel room in September 1996 for Fred Johnson, the 
father of forward Nate Johnson, and later provided his personal 
credit card to keep him from being evicted because of a delinquent 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really got caught up in it ... it's just fortunate  
that it came out on our side,'' Nate Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville President John Shumaker said his school was  
handicapped by not knowing the infractions committee considered the 
violations ``major.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Stein, acting chairman of the appeals committee, compared  
the situation to a trial in which a person charged with a 
misdemeanor was found guilty of a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an error that occurred here,'' Stein said. He said  
it was the first time the NCAA had lifted a postseason ban. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, NCAA investigator Rich Hilliard said the enforcement  
staff didn't consider Louisville a ``repeat violator'' because he 
didn't consider the violations major. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville was already on probation because of former player  
Samaki Walker's use of two cars in 1995. The school didn't argue 
the point, but it became the crux of the committee's assessment of 
severe penalties. Louisville was deemed a ``repeat violator,'' 
receiving a postseason ban and other penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	McCray, who has since been reassigned in the athletic  
department, shared in the victory. In a separate appeal involving 
McCray, the NCAA said the former assistant also was not adequately 
warned and lifted a requirement that any school wanting to hire 
McCray needed NCAA permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Crum ranks third in NCAA tournament history with 21 appearances  
and 42 victories. His teams have a history of strong runs in 
February, and Crum said this team (11-7, 6-3 Conference USA) has a 
``legitimate shot'' at reaching the NCAA tournament despite a 
recent slump. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals beat Memphis 89-76 Thursday night to snap a  
four-game losing skid.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Study Plankton Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Plankton may not look like much -- masses of  
tiny plants drifting about in the ocean -- but scientists are paying 
increasing attention to its role in the global climate. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the big questions in oceanography is how the ocean  
responds to changes in climate. One thing that's very important is 
the role of phytoplankton in cycling carbon and other elements'' 
taken up from the atmosphere, said Michael J. Behrenfeld of Rutgers 
University in New Brunswick, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Many scientists are worried that the Earth's climate may be  
warmed by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
One of the natural systems removing carbon dioxide is plankton. 
They use it in their respiration and store some of it when they die 
and sink to the bottom of the seas. 
</P>
<P>
	But in some areas the growth of plankton is limited by the lack  
of certain nutrients, such as iron, nitrogen or phosphorus. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrenfeld and co-researcher Zbigniew S. Kolber report in  
today's edition of the journal Science that they have developed a 
way to tell when that limiting factor is a lack of iron. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of experiments in 1993 and 1995, scientists added  
liquefied iron compounds to areas with limited plankton and 
observed a massive bloom of the plants. But that type of experiment 
can only be done on a small area, Behrenfeld explained in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	In NASA-funded research, Behrenfeld discovered that during a  
24-hour cycle, plankton show a pattern of fluorescence which, 
though not visible to the naked eye, can be measured by shipboard 
instruments. This pattern varies if the plants have insufficient 
iron, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrenfeld said his system can be used to test for lack of iron  
over large areas, helping scientists better understand plankton 
growth and the problems it faces. 
</P>
<P>
	Theoretically, it also could identify prime areas that could be  
enriched with iron to cause increased growth of plankton with the 
aim of removing more carbon from the air -- what some call the 
``Geritol solution'' to global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrenfeld, however, was reluctant to call for action  
immediately, warning that ``there are a lot of uncertainties in 
that step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term addition of iron could result in a complete change in  
species distribution in a region, he said, and ``there is a lot of 
understanding that needs to be gained about ecological responses'' 
before iron enrichment can be recommended.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Chemical Co. Settles Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABERDEEN, Miss. (AP) -- Kerr-McGee Corp. has agreed to pay $10.25  
million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging one of its 
chemical plants released fumes that harmed hundreds of people 
living nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, filed in federal court Jan. 26, people  
living within seven miles of the Hamilton plant for three months or 
more since the place opened in 1958 could file claims for some of 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The amounts paid out would be based on how long the recipients  
lived nearby and how close to the plant they were. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr-McGee denied any wrongdoing and said it settled the 1996  
lawsuit to avoid a long and costly trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed on behalf more than 800 people, accused  
Kerr-McGee of releasing harmful fumes -- such as sulfur dioxide, 
titanium tetrachloride, chlorine and ammonia -- in violation of 
state and federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs blamed the pollutants for respiratory ailments  
and central nervous system disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr-McGee is an Oklahoma City-based energy and chemical  
company. Its Hamilton plant produces pigments used in coatings and 
plastics, and last summer it began a $57 million expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	A court hearing on the settlement is set for July 19.

<HEADLINE> Writers To Get Pct. of Box Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Columbia Pictures and a group of top  
Hollywood screenwriters have brokered a rare deal that gives the 
writers a percentage of box office receipts in addition to the fee 
paid for their scripts. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Thursday was hammered out with 33  
writers but could apply to hundreds more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's groundbreaking. A big moment in the movie business,''  
said Gary Ross, whose writing credits include ``Dave'' and ``Big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, only a few studios have offered screenwriters a  
percentage of box office receipts, or points, when negotiating 
contracts. Such deals are far more common for actors and directors. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is considered a boost for screenwriters, who long have  
been shut out of the financial success of blockbuster movies while 
actors and directors earn millions through the point deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, the 33 writers agreed to deliver one  
script each -- an original screenplay, an adaptation, or a rewrite -- 
to Columbia within the next three years. Each writer can either 
commit to one of five projects the studio proposes or give Columbia 
their own idea. 
</P>
<P>
	A writer receiving sole screen credit is guaranteed 2 percent of  
gross box office receipts -- a figure calculated after the studio 
recoups its production, marketing and distribution costs. If there 
is a co-writing screen credit, the writer gets 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal extends to potentially hundreds of other writers who  
have either received at least $750,000 for a writing assignment, 
sold a screenplay for at least $1 million, or been nominated for an 
Academy Award or Writers Guild of America award. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Pascal, Columbia's president, predicted that both her studio  
and writers will benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, it's like getting first-look deals from all these  
great writers,'' she said. ``I think this was going to happen at 
some point. If not us, they would have gone somewhere else.''

<HEADLINE> Etrade Suffers Another Outage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Online brokerage ETrade suffered another trading  
outage Friday, its third in as many days, sending its own stock 
plunging. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the latest outage, which lasted about 30 minutes,  
was unclear. ETrade spokeswoman Susan Walker said the company has 
corrected a software glitch that had interrupted trading on 
Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade's shares fell 4.56 1/4 to close at $48.93 3/4 on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market. On Monday, before the onset of the latest trading 
problems, ETrade hit a 52-week high of $66.44. 
</P>
<P>
	Other online brokerages on the Nasdaq dropped as well including  
Ameritrade, down $15.25 to $95.50 and JB Oxford Holdings, down 
$4.12 1/2 to $11.75. Charles Schwab slipped 44 cents to close at 
$66.06 1/4 in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said this week marked the first service interruptions  
that company has had in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade's woes have added fuel to a new inquiry about customer  
complaints of the booming Internet brokerage industry by New York 
state's attorney general.

<HEADLINE> Dierdorf Out at ABC Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC decided last year to stick with Dan Dierdorf  
instead of hiring John Madden for its high-profile ``Monday Night 
Football'' announcing team. 
</P>
<P>
	Next season the network will have neither analyst.  
</P>
<P>
	Dierdosf said Thursday that he is leaving his job at ABC after  
12 years. Al Michaels is now the only announcer who has been in the 
ABC booth for more than one season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday, ABC Sports informed my representatives at The  
Marquee Group that no substantial offer to extend my contract would 
be forthcoming,'' Dierdorf's statement said. ``Therefore, Sunday's 
broadcast of the Pro Bowl will be my last for ABC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf's departure had been speculated for months as ABC  
seemed unwilling to renew his $1.75 million a year contract. 
Dierdorf came under heavy criticism this season as he struggled to 
mesh with newcomer Boomer Esiason in ABC's three-man booth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a very talented broadcaster, who earned the respect,  
admiration and friendship of everyone with whom he worked at ABC 
Sports,'' said Brian McAndrews, executive vice president and 
general manager of ABC Sports. ``We wish him luck in his future 
endeavors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Sports spokesman Mark Mandel said ``it would be premature to  
discuss our plans for next season.'' But with most top analysts 
locked up at other networks, it is expected ABC will shift someone 
from cable partner ESPN to the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Sterling Sharpe's name has been mentioned the most. But ABC may  
be hesitant to team two inexperienced game analysts, especially in 
a year in which it has the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney could also decide to move one of ESPN's Sunday night  
analysts -- Paul Maguire or Joe Theismann -- to ABC and plug Sharpe 
into the cable slot. 
</P>
<P>
	Or it could team Esiason and Michaels in a two-man booth, which  
has been done only once before when Michaels and Frank Gifford 
teamed in 1986 -- one year before Dierdorf came on board. 
</P>
<P>
	The Michaels-Dierdrof-Gifford team was together for 11 years  
before ABC replaced Gifford with Esiason last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf might have trouble ending up at another network for the  
upcoming season. Fox has no apparent openings and ESPN is run by 
the same people who ousted Dierdorf at ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS could shift No. 2 analyst Randy Cross to the studio and team  
Dierdorf with Verne Lundquist. But CBS seems unwilling to shuffle 
its top announcing teams to make room for Dierdorf, who began his 
network career at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``To this point, CBS has not expressed an interest in Dan  
Dierdorf,'' CBS Sports spokeswoman LeslieAnne Wade said.

<HEADLINE>  Jazz, Bulls Game Won't Be the Same  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- When the wretched remains of the Chicago  
Bulls take the court tonight against the Utah Jazz, it's only an 
NBA Finals rematch in the most technical sense. 
</P>
<P>
	But that won't matter to the Utah fans. After two agonizing  
finals losses to Michael Jordan and Co., they have a healthy 
dislike for anyone in red and black. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to boo us as soon as we get off the airplane,''  
said Ron Harper, the only remaining starter from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to know this is a different team, and I'll pass this  
word,'' rookie Bulls coach Tim Floyd said with a laugh. ``I think 
regardless of who is coming in, the Bulls or any other team, Utah 
is going to be sending a statement early and quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's left of the six-time champions will be back at the scene  
of their club's last triumph, a Game 6 NBA Finals win over the Jazz 
that capped Jordan's career and signaled the end of Chicago's 
basketball renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a delicious bit of payback, the Jazz, who saw their  
championship dreams twice crushed by Jordan and his teammates, have 
the opportunity to throw the ceremonial first punch in what will 
probably be a season of beatings for the depleted Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	While their fans may think otherwise, the Jazz players aren't  
attaching any special meaning to the meeting. For them, running 
with the Bulls is just the first lap in a race they hope will end 
in the champions' circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of 50 games we've got to play well in to make a  
run at the playoffs,'' Karl Malone said. ``Michael, Scottie Pippen 
and Dennis Rodman were the Bulls. It's not like that any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Chicago bears only faint resemblance to the Bulls of eight  
months ago, the biggest change the Jazz made was allowing utility 
big man Antoine Carr to sign with the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been replaced by Thurl Bailey, who has been out of the  
league since 1994, and center Todd Fuller, who was acquired from 
Golden State on Thursday for a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some teams in basketball and in other sports like to build it  
up and tear it down, but that's not what we're trying to do,'' 
coach Jerry Sloan said. ``We've got a bunch of quality players 
together, and they've played together for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, who manned the bench at Iowa State last year and has  
never played or coached professionally, is up against Sloan, a 
former Bulls playing great who begins his 11th season in Utah, by 
far the longest tenure in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``That guy's in a tough situation,'' Sloan said of Floyd. ``I'm  
sure he'll make the best of it, but it would be a really tough 
thing to do what he's doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls franchise is making a definite effort toward a fresh  
start. The seven remaining players and three assistant coaches from 
last year's team quietly received their championship rings 
Wednesday at the Bulls' practice facility, rather than during a 
public ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, Brent Barry and Toni Kukoc are definite starters for the  
Bulls tonight. Beyond that, it gets murky: Floyd will likely start 
journeymen Andrew Lang or veteran Bill Wennington at center and 
Mario Bennett or Dickey Simpkins at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz will counter with four of their five starters from last  
year's finals. Only center Greg Foster, who may not play with a 
fractured ankle, will be missing, and a slimmed-down Greg Ostertag 
likely will take his place. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago lost both of its preseason games to the Indiana Pacers,  
but also showed more life than some expected. In particular, Kukoc 
scored 32 points in the Bulls' 89-83 loss in their final 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not the same team, but they're still the Bulls,'' Jeff  
Hornacek said. ``We respect that.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Jordan Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts of Vernon Jordan's deposition testimony from Feb. 2:  
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutor Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.: You have  
testified, I believe, five times previously before the federal 
grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And so I know that probably about every question  
that could be asked has been asked, but there are a number of 
reasons I want to go over additional questions with you, and some 
of them will be repetitious of what's been asked before. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to coming in today, though, have you had the opportunity  
to review your prior testimony in those five appearances before the 
grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I have done some preparation, congressman.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And let me start with the fact that the oath that  
you took today is the same as the oath that you took before the 
federal grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe that's correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And, Mr. Jordan, what is your profession?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I am a lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And how is it that you are able to obtain enough  
business for 800 lawyers? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I don't think that's my entire responsibility. I'm just  
one of 800 lawyers, and that is what I do in part, but I'm not 
alone in that process of making rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: When you say 'making rain,' that's the terminology  
of being a rainmaker? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I think even in Arkansas, you understand what rainmaking  
is. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: We've read Grisham books.  
</P>
<P>
	And so, when you say making rain or being a rainmaker, that is  
to bring in business so that you can keep the lawyers busy 
practicing law? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, that is -- that is part and parcel of the practice  
of law. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: When you did bill by the hour, what was your  
billable rate the last time you had to do that? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe my billable rate at the last time was  
somewhere between $450 and $500 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, would you describe --  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Not bad for a Georgia boy. I'm from Georgia. You've  
heard of that state, I'm sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: It's probably not bad from Washington standards.  
Would you describe the nature of your relationship with President 
Clinton? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: President Clinton has been a friend of mine since  
approximately 1973, when I came to your state, Arkansas, to make a 
speech as president of the National Urban League about race and 
equal opportunity in our nation, and we met then and there, and our 
friendship has grown and developed and matured and he is my friend 
and will continue to be my friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And just to further elaborate on that friendship,  
it's my understanding that he and his -- and the first lady has had 
Christmas Eve dinner with you and your family for a number of 
years? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Every year since his presidency, the Jordan family has  
been privileged to entertain the Clinton family on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And has there been any exceptions in recent years to  
that? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Every year that he has been president, he has had, he  
and his family, Christmas Eve with my family. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And have you vacationed together with the Clinton  
family? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes. I think you have seen reels of us playing golf and  
having fun at Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And so you vacation together, you play golf together  
on a semi-regular basis? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Whenever we can. We've not been doing it recently, for  
reasons that I think are probably very obvious to you, counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Well, explain that to me.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Just what I said, for a time, I was going before the  
grand jury, and under the advice of counsel and I'm sure under 
advice of the president's counsel, it was thought best that we not 
play golf together. So, from the time that I first went to the 
grand jury, I don't think -- we have not played golf this year, 
unfortunately, together. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Have you had any private conversations with the  
president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes, I have, as a matter of fact.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And has this been on the telephone or in person?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I've talked to him on the telephone, and I talked to him  
at the Vineyard. He was at my house on Christmas Eve. There were a 
lot of people around, but, yes, I've talked to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you discuss your testimony before the grand  
jury or his testimony before the grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I did not.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: If I understand your question about whether or not the  
president of the United States and I talked about my testimony 
before the grand jury or his testimony before the grand jury, I can 
say to you unequivocally that the president of the United States 
and I have not discussed our testimony. I was advised by my 
counsel, Mr. Hundley, not to discuss that testimony, and I have 
learned in this process, Mr. Hutchinson, to -- to take the advice of 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Did you, subsequent to your last testimony before  
the grand jury, talk to the president in which you discussed 
conversation that you have had with Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I have not discussed a conversation that I have had with  
Monica Lewinsky with the president of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And have you had any discussions about Monica  
Lewinsky with the president of the United States since your last 
testimony before the grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I have not.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I had not at any time discussed the Lewinsky matter with  
-- with Howard Gittis. And so I had breakfast with him to tell him 
that reporters were calling, that this would obviously involve 
Revlon, which had responded to my -- my efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky 
employment, and so Howard Gittis is a friend of mine. Howard Gittis 
is a fellow board member with me at Revlon. He is the Vice Chairman 
of McAndrews &AMP; Forbes, and I thought it -- I thought I had -- it was 
incumbent upon me to stop and say, `Listen, there's trouble 
a-brewing.' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Was there some news stories that had mentioned your  
name in reference to Ms. Lewinsky and the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe that my name has been an integral part of this  
process from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you in fact have the breakfast meeting with  
Mr. Gittis? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes, I did.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And what information did you convey to Mr. Gittis  
concerning Ms. Lewinsky at that breakfast meeting? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I just simply said that the press was calling about Ms.  
Lewinsky; that while I had not dealt with him, I had dealt with 
Richard Halperin, I had dealt with Ronald Perelman. I had not dealt 
with him, but that he ought to know and that I was sorry about 
this. And I also said that it would probably be even more 
complicated because early on I had referred Webb Hubbell to them to 
be hired as counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And I want to get to that in just a moment, but you  
indicated that you said you were sorry. Were you referring to the 
problems that this might create for the company? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, I was obviously concerned. I am a director. I am  
their counsel. They're my friends. And publicity was breaking. I 
thought I had some responsibility to them to give them a heads-up 
as to what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, is it true that your efforts to find a job for  
Ms. Lewinsky that you referenced in that meeting with Mr. Gittis -- 
were your efforts carried out at the request of the president of 
the United States? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: There is no question but that through Betty Currie, I  
was acting on behalf of the president to get Ms. Lewinsky a job. I 
think that's clear from my grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Okay. And I just want to make sure that that's  
firmly established. And in reference to your previous grand jury 
testimony, you indicated, I believe, on May 28th, 1998, at page 61, 
that 'She' -- referring to Betty Currie -- 'was the one that called 
me at the behest of the president.' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct, and I think, congressman, if in fact  
the president of the United States' secretary calls and asks for a 
request that you try to do the best you can to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And you received that request as a request coming  
from the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I -- I interpreted it as a request from the president.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And then, later on in June of '98 in the grand jury  
testimony at page 45, did you not reference or testify that `The 
president asked me to get Monica Lewinsky a job'? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: There was no -- there was no question but that he asked  
me to help and that he asked others to help. I think that is clear 
from everybody's grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Do you believe that you were acting in the company's  
interest or the president's interest when you were trying to secure 
a job for Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, what I knew was that the company would take care  
of its own interest. This is not the first time that I referred 
somebody, and what I know is, is that if a person being referred 
does not meet the standards required for that company, I have no 
question but that that person will not be hired. And so the 
referral is an easy thing to do; the judgment about employment is 
not a judgment as a person referring that I make. But I do have 
confidence in all of the companies on whose boards that I sit that, 
regardless of my reference, that as to their needs and as to their 
expectations for their employees that they will make the right 
decisions, as happened in the American Express situation. American 
Express called and said: We will not hire Ms. Lewinsky. I did not 
question it, I did not challenge it, because they understood their 
needs and their needs in comparison to her qualifications. They 
made a judgment. Revlon, on the other hand, made another judgment. 
I am not the employer, I am the referrer, and there is a major 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And when you had your conversation with Mr. Perelman  
... you do not believe you told him you were calling for the 
president -- 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe that I did not tell him.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: -- but you assumed that he knew?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: No. I did not make any assumptions, let me say. I said:  
Ronald, here is a young lady who has been interviewed. She thinks 
the interview has not gone well. See what you can do to make sure 
that she is properly interviewed and evaluated -- in essence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you reference her as a former White House  
intern? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Probably. I do not have a recollection of whether I  
described her as a White House intern, whether I described her as a 
person who had worked for the Pentagon. I said this is a person 
that I have referred. I think, Mr. Hutchinson, that I have 
sufficient, uh, influence, shall we say, sufficient character, 
shall we say, that people have been throughout my career able to 
take my word at face value. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And so you didn't need to reference the president.  
The fact that you were calling Mr. Perelman -- 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That was sufficient.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: You knew and the president knew that Ms. Lewinsky  
was under subpoena in the Jones case, and that information was not 
provided to either Mr. Halperin or to Mr. Perelman; is that 
correct? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That's correct.  
</P>
<P>
	... I think, on the other hand, that had she been a defendant in  
a murder case and I knew that, then I probably wouldn't have 
referenced her. But her being a witness in a civil case I did not 
think important. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Despite the fact that you were acting at the request  
of the president, and this witness was potentially adverse to the 
president's interest in that case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I didn't know that. I mean, I don't -- I don't know what  
her position was or whether it was adverse or not. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Ms. Lewinsky has made reference to a meeting that  
occurred in your office on November 5, and that's the meeting that 
you have no recollection of? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct. We have no record of it in my office,  
and I just have no recollection of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And in your first grand jury appearance, you were  
firm, shall I say, that the first time you met with Ms. Lewinsky, 
that it was on December 11th? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes. It was firm based on what my calendar told me, and  
subsequently to that, there has been a refreshing of my 
recollection, and I do not deny that it happened. By the same 
token, I will tell you, as I said in my grand jury testimony, that 
I did not remember that I had met with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And in fact today, the fact that you do not dispute  
that that meeting occurred is not based upon your recollection but 
is simply based upon you've seen the records, and it appears that 
that meeting occurred? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	How did the meeting on December 11 of 1997 with Ms. Lewinsky  
come about? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Ms. Lewinsky called my office and asked if she could  
come to see me. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And was that preceded by a call from Betty Currie?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: At some point in time, Betty Currie had called me, and  
Ms. Lewinsky followed up on that call, and she came to my office, 
and we had a visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Ms. Lewinsky called, set up a meeting, and at some  
point sent you a resume, I believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe so.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you receive that prior to the meeting on  
December 11th? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I -- I have to assume that I did, but I -- I do not know  
whether she brought it with her or whether -- it was at some point 
that she brought with her or sent to me -- somehow it came into my 
possession -- a list of various companies in New York with which she 
had -- which were her preferences, by the way -- most of which I did 
not know well enough to make any calls for. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Many times I will be listed as a reference, and they  
can take that to any company. You might be listed as a reference 
and the name 'Vernon Jordan' would be a good reference anywhere, 
would it not? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I would hope so.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And so, even though it was a company that you might  
not have the best contact with, you could have been helpful in that 
regard? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, the fact is I was running the job search, not Ms.  
Lewinsky, and therefore, the companies that she brought or listed 
were not of interest to me. I knew where I would need to call. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And that is exactly the point, that you looked at  
getting Ms. Lewinsky a job as an assignment rather than just 
something that you were going to be a reference for. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I don't know whether I looked upon it as an assignment.  
Getting jobs for people is not unusual for me, so I don't view it 
as an assignment. I just view it as something that is part of what 
I do. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: You're acting in behalf of the president when you  
are trying to get Ms. Lewinsky a job, and you were in control of 
the job search? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: During the course of the meeting with Ms. Lewinsky,  
what did you learn about her? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Uh, enthusiastic, quite taken with herself and her  
experience, uh, bubbly, effervescent, bouncy, confident, uh -- 
actually, I sort of had the same impression that you House managers 
had of her when you met with her. You came out and said she was 
impressive, and so we come out about the same place. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did she relate to you the fact that she liked  
being an intern because it put her close to the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I have never seen a White House intern who did not like  
being a White House intern, and so her enthusiasm for being a White 
House intern was about like the enthusiasm of White House interns -- 
they liked it. She was not happy about not being there anymore -- 
she did not like being at the Defense Department -- and I think she 
actually had some desire to go back. But when she actually talked 
to me, she wanted to go to New York for a job in the private 
sector, and she thought that I could be helpful in that process. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Did she make reference to someone in the White House  
being uncomfortable when she was an intern, and she thought that 
people did not want her there? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: She felt unwanted -- there is no question about that. As  
to who did not want her there and why they did not want her there, 
that was not my business. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: If there was a discussion subsequent to Monica  
Lewinsky's visit to me on December the 11th with the president of 
the United States, it was about the job search. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right. And during that, did he indicate that he  
knew about the fact that she had lost her job in the White House, 
and she wanted to get a job in New York? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: He was aware that -- he was obviously aware that she had  
lost her job in the White House, because she was working at the 
Pentagon. He was also aware that she wanted to work in New York, in 
the private sector, and understood that that is why she was having 
conversations with me. There is no doubt about that. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And he thanked you for helping her?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: There's no question about that, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And on either of these conversations that I've  
referenced that you had with the president after the witness list 
came out, your conversation on December 7th, and your conversation 
sometime after the 11th, did the president tell you that Ms. Monica 
Lewinsky was on the witness list in the Jones case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: He did not.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you consider this information to be  
important in your efforts to be helpful to Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I never thought about it.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Was there a time that you became aware that Ms.  
Lewinsky had been subpoenaed to give a deposition in the Jones 
versus Clinton case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: On December 19th when she came to my office with the  
subpoena -- I think it's the 19th. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: How did it come about that you met with Ms. Lewinsky  
on December 19th? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Ms. Lewinsky called me in a rather high emotional state  
and said that she needed to see me, and she came to see me. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And she called you on the telephone on December  
19th, in which she indicated she had received a subpoena? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That's right, and was emotional about it and asked, and  
so I said come over. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And what was your reaction to her having received a  
subpoena in the Jones case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Surprise, number one; number two, quite taken with her  
emotional state. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you see that she had a problem?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: She obviously had a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	... She was -- she was disturbed about the subpoena. She was  
disturbed about not having, in her words, heard from the president 
or talked to the president. It was also in that meeting that it 
became clear to me that the -- that her eyes were wide and that she, 
uh, that -- let me -- for lack of a better way to put it, that she 
had a 'thing' for the president.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended the week lower  
Friday on the back of a drop on Wall Street overnight and continued 
concerns over rising Japanese interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks fell for the fifth straight day. The benchmark  
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 188.77 points, or 1.34 percent, 
ending the day at 13,898.08. On Thursday, the average closed down 
74.46 points, or 0.53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from worries about rising interest rates, prices were also  
pushed down by the overnight fall on Wall Street, which prompted 
Japanese institutional investors to sell in the stock futures 
market, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,304.50  
points, down 62.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 112.06 yen in late  
afternoon trading in Tokyo, down 1.72 yen from late Thursday in 
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 112.21 yen 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market will continue to monitor movements of interest  
rates and the dollar-yen rate,'' said Shoji Hirakawa, a strategist 
at Kokusai Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed sharply lower.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of

9,190.20. On Thursday, the index had edged up 18.80 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Worries about a correction in the U.S. market are putting  
pressure on Hong Kong stocks,'' said Johnson Hui, research head at 
BOCI Securities Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian share prices also tumbled, with the key index falling  
3.2 percent as foreign investors began selling their stocks ahead 
of Feb. 15 -- the date they can begin repatriating frozen funds 
according to newly introduced tax regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Malaysian Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin announced  
the details of an ``exit tax'' on investment withdrawals to replace 
a one-year moratorium on foreign capital outflow which was imposed 
at the beginning of September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's benchmark Composite Index fell  
18.52 points to 555.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan share prices closed lower, with the key index  
falling to a new 33-month low as investors continued to stay away 
from the market amid fears of more corporate failures. The Weighted 
Stock Price Index fell 40.10 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,474.79, 
the lowest level since April 5, 1996, when it finished at 5377.19. 
</P>
<P>

NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 5.95 points, or 0.2 percent, to 
2,211.81.

worse-than-expected inflation figures for January. The Philippine 
Stock Exchange index of 30 selected companies lost 8.46 points, or 
0.4 percent, to 1,977.84. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian stock prices gave back some of their recent  
record gains, closing lower on profit-taking despite stronger 
commodity prices overnight. The All Ordinaries Index fell 28.6 
points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,911.9. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share price closed slightly higher on bargain-hunting.  
The main Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 1.24 points, or 0.2 
percent, to 551.39.

<HEADLINE> Gates Donates $3.35B to Charity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill Gates and his wife,  
Melinda, have made new donations to charity totaling $3.35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The donations include $2.23 billion to the William H. Gates  
Foundation, named after and administered by Gates' father, and 
$1.115 billion to the Gates Learning Foundation, spokeswoman Rose 
Berg-Fosnaugh said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The William H. Gates Foundation provides grants in the areas of  
world health and population, education, and services in the Seattle 
area. With the new gift, its assets are now $4.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gates Learning Foundation, formerly known as the Gates  
Library Foundation, is dedicated to closing the gap between poorer 
children and their better-off counterparts in Internet access and 
computer training. That foundation's endowment is now $1.13 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortune magazine reports the gift is believed to be the largest  
charitable donation ever, although Berg-Fosnaugh would not confirm 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	In early December, Gates and his wife announced a $100 million  
donation to support immunization programs for children in 
developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates is the world's richest man, with an estimated worth of at  
least $60 billion.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Rejects Big Ten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Notre Dame figured it could have lost several  
million dollars a year by joining the Big Ten. Still, that wasn't 
the main reason the Irish decided to stay out. 
</P>
<P>
	They turned down the Big Ten Friday for the second time in five  
years because signing up could have cost them their identity and 
hurt recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our projection indicated a small economic disadvantage of  
joining, but it was not a material difference when you look at 
it,'' athletic director Mike Wadsworth said. He said the difference 
would have been between $1 million and $4 million in 2007, the 
first year Notre Dame could have played a full Big Ten schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``This amount of difference was inconsequential,'' he added.  
Wadsworth termed reports that the shortfall could have been as much 
as $8.5 million ``way out of bounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were concerned about the implications (joining) would have  
to the independence of our football program. And because the 
football program has been the engine that has driven the athletic 
department for so many years, that concern outweighed the other 
advantages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to go it alone -- as the football team has for 111  
years -- was announced Friday in a unanimous vote by the board of 
trustees, who were in London this weekend for the dedication of 
Notre Dame's new academic center. Thirty-nine of the 55 board 
members traveled to London to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Rev. Edward Malloy, the university president, said the decision  
to say out was based on Notre Dame's independent identity and its 
national following. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notre Dame has a distinct identity that is the product of more  
than a century and a half of institutional independence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Catholic university with a national constituency, we  
believe independence continues to be our best way forward, not just 
in athletics, but first and foremost in the fulfillment of our 
academic aspirations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move seems sure to please most students, football players  
and alumni. The latter were vocal, with 99.5 percent of alumni 
association members reported opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my 12 years as president, I have never received so many  
thoughtful, well-articulated letters from alumni as on this 
particular issue,'' Malloy said. ``And it really wasn't focused on 
athletics. It was focused on the fundamental question of 
identity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wadsworth said the move would have hurt football recruiting,  
which is a nationwide business for the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk so much internally about recruiting and the nature of  
our admissions requirements and being a smaller school,'' Wadsworth 
added. ``One of the things we always had as an advantage is the 
selling of the national program, that and television exposure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if being an independent would eventually lock the Irish  
out of bowls, Wadsworth answered: ``We feel that we have to have 
basically the same kind of record to play our way in as an 
independent that we would have to have to win the Big Ten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Football coach Bob Davie, speaking in South Bend, said the  
decision was bigger than just football. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious the university's announcement involved far more  
than football and far more than just athletics,'' he said. ``It 
involved a reinforcement of the heritage and culture of the 
institution -- not only looking back into the past, but also 
projecting where Notre Dame expects to be in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an independent, Notre Dame pockets its gate receipts, all  
proceeds from bowl appearances, and an estimated $7 million 
annually in an exclusive TV contract with NBC -- expected to jump to 
$8 million for the 2000-2005 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	As a Big Ten member, the Irish would have been part of a  
revenue-sharing program that splits up a portion of each school's 
gate receipts from football and basketball, bowl revenues, TV 
contracts and proceeds from the NCAA basketball tournament.

<P>
	BURNS CITY, Ind. (AP) -- Two railroad cars carrying tons of  
military explosives derailed outside a Navy base in southern 
Indiana early Friday, a railroad official said. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported, and military personnel said there was  
no danger of an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	The cars derailed as containers of bombs, detonators and  
propellant charges were being unloaded for delivery to the nearby 
Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center. 
</P>
<P>
	A stretch of highway was closed and 21 nearby homes were  
evacuated as a precaution. Cleanup was expected to continue at 
least through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosives were en route to the Navy base from a Marine  
Corps munitions ship anchored near Jacksonville, Fla., said Capt. 
William Shotts, the base commander. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the derailment is still under investigation, said  
Anthony Fletcher, a manager for Canadian-Pacific Railway in Terre 
Haute. He said human error is suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	The base is about 75 miles southwest of Indianapolis.

<HEADLINE> Espy Won't Run for Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Mike Espy, acquitted in December of  
charges that he received inappropriate gifts while he was 
agriculture secretary, said Friday he won't run for office this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to step back and rehabilitate,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Espy, 45, said he will soon join a Mississippi law firm and  
hinted that the White House may appoint him to a part-time job. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement ended weeks of speculation since Espy was found  
innocent of charges of receiving gifts and entertainment from 
companies or organizations regulated by the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, Espy became Mississippi's first black congressman since  
Reconstruction. President Clinton named him agriculture secretary 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Espy would not name the law firm he plans to join or speculate  
what type of presidential appointment he could receive. He said he 
has spoken twice to Clinton since his December trial.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Robinson To Return Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Eugene Robinson of the Atlanta Falcons, honored  
at the Super Bowl for high moral character just hours before being 
arrested and charged with solicitation, plans to return the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson made the announcement Thursday in Honolulu, where he  
will play in the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons free safety received the Bart Starr Award Saturday  
morning, the day before Atlanta's 34-19 Super Bowl loss to the 
Denver Broncos. The award was presented for leadership in home, on 
the field and in the community. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was arrested that night for allegedly soliciting oral  
sex from an undercover police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Bratton of Athletes in Action, the Ohio-based group that  
gives the award, said the organization supported Robinson's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are encouraged by the remorse he has shown,'' Bratton said  
in a statement. ``We continue to express our concern and 
unconditional love for Eugene and are standing with him during 
these difficult days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson is scheduled to be arraigned on the misdemeanor charge  
March 2.

<HEADLINE> NY To Host Woodstock Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- It used to be home to bomb-toting Cold War  
B-52s. This summer, the former Griffiss Air Force Base will be the 
scene for three days of peace, love and music. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials reached a preliminary agreement Thursday to host  
the 30th anniversary of Woodstock. As many as 300,000 people are 
expected to attend the music festival at the decommissioned air 
base July 23-25. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Joe Griffo heralded the economic benefits of the show, and  
said the concert could double Oneida County's population while 
injecting as much as $30 million into the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	No acts have been lined up yet. Promoter Michael Lang said he  
hopes to have most in place by April 1. He said ticket prices would 
be comparable to the 1994 Woodstock anniversary, around $135. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents doubted a financial windfall courtesy of young  
music-lovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're lucky if they can afford the price of the ticket, a  
hot dog and a sleeping bag,'' said Nancy Graves.

<HEADLINE> Teen-Agers Eulogize Dead Classmates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDIA, Pa. (AP) -- Amanda Congar described an emotional emptiness  
that overpowered her high school after five classmates died 
together in a car crash last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been really quiet around the halls. It's really  
depressing. You don't feel like you're actually here,'' she said. 
``Your body's floating and your mind's somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congar was one of hundreds of people who attended a tribute  
Thursday inside the Penncrest High School auditorium for the five 
girls who died when their car overturned returning from a shopping 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaena Grigaitis, 16, had already picked out her dress a week  
ago for the spring prom. So had her friend, Rachael Lehr, 17, who 
also died in the crash along with Tracy Graham, also 17, and 
Rebecca Weirich and Loren Wells, both 16. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, speakers shared their own special memories with the  
people who packed the auditorium in this old mill town on the 
outskirts of Philadelphia. Dozens of people sat on folding chairs 
in the gymnasium to watch the service on closed-circuit television. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaena's boyfriend, half-sobbing, said he knows ``she's up in  
heaven looking out for me.'' A teacher, quoting Jack London, spoke 
of the victims' ``brilliant blazes, magnificent flow, living, not 
existing.'' A student sang a pretty, lilting version of ``Amazing 
Grace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others recounted the girls' attributes: Tracy -- whose cousin  
said dreamed of being a TV weather forecaster in some sunny climate 
-- loved dolphins and the color blue. Rachael, who aspired to be a 
model, was a ``brilliant star now shining down on us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becky had a beautiful smile and a sassy demeanor. Loren had  
decided to take nursing classes and was fascinated by medicine. 
Both were the kind of people who knew how to cheer up others. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were still trying to determine what caused Miss Wells'  
dark blue Corsica to swerve across a median on a twisting section 
of U.S. Route 1 before smashing into a tree. Four of the girls died 
on impact; Miss Graham died at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Students have flocked to the crash site all week, depositing  
flowers, T-shirts, stuffed animals and balloons. Many of them have 
left messages, filled with joy and sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the notes was from Miss Graham's 15-year-old sister.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tracy, I love you very much and will never forget your smile.  
Always look down on me. All you guys stick together. Love ya, Vicky 
Graham.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Lehr was laid to rest in the all-white dress she had picked  
out for the junior prom. Miss Grigaitis -- who paged Tracy Graham 
every night before bed with the words ``I love you'' -- was buried 
in a pink prom dress of beaded satin.

<HEADLINE> ETrade Experiences Online Glitches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Online investors angered by a second straight  
day of trading problems at ETrade chose a familiar medium to lodge 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	In more than 1,500 e-mail messages and streams of nasty notes in  
Internet chat rooms, investors blasted the snags at ETrade, which 
says a software glitch caused outages Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On busy trading days, most online brokerages can experience  
delays in fulfilling trade orders, though ETrade's troubles had 
nothing to do with system capacity or heavy volume, a spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	New software installed Tuesday night malfunctioned Wednesday  
morning, knocking out the trading function for 75 minutes. About 5 
percent of ETrade's customers were unable to trade electronically 
throughout the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The system functioned normally for the first half-hour of  
trading Thursday before crashing again at about 10 a.m. EST. Some 
service was restored within an hour, and the system was entirely 
fixed within two hours, said Lisa Nash, vice president for customer 
management at the Palo Alto, Calif., brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade brokers were able to fill telephone orders, but many  
callers experienced lengthy delays, even as ETrade put more staff 
members onto telephone detail. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade set up a special e-mail address to handle customer  
complaints, and many investors turned to Internet chat rooms, 
disparaging the brokerage with nicknames like EtrytoTrade, EDelayed 
and ETrash. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Crisci, an ETrade customer who trades over the Internet  
several times a week, said he is frustrated enough to look into 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is both a legal and implied trust or contract to  
provide uninterrupted services during market hours,'' he said. 
Crisci said he lost money Wednesday when the system outage 
prevented him from canceling an order to buy stock. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade's woes have added fuel to a new inquiry into the booming  
Internet brokerage industry by New York state's attorney general. 
Citing a wave of complaints about system crashes, delayed trades 
and constant busy signals, Eliot Spitzer's office has asked a 
number of online trading firms to provide reports on their 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer, who took office in January, released a statement  
saying: ``The public knows that there are always risks involved in 
investing in the stock market. But part of that risk should not 
include questions about whether trades will be executed promptly or 
whether online brokerage firms can deliver on the services that 
they've promised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer's office has asked several online brokerages to provide  
information on their operations, but a spokesman wouldn't name the 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry follows a stream of warnings in recent weeks from  
state and federal securities regulators, who have urged online 
investors to use caution and be prepared for possible delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Arthur Levitt, chairman of the U.S. Securities and  
Exchange Commission, issued a warning to ordinary investors. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade said it will handle complaints on a case-by-case basis,  
but wouldn't say whether it plans to mollify customers with offers 
of free transactions or any other reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are vocal, but they are fair,'' Nash said. ``We know they  
are very frustrated when they can't place a trade.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> White House Offers Oil Firms Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Domestic oil and natural gas industry  
officials are welcoming the Clinton administration's decision to 
offer some relief to producers battered by depressed oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But they say the help is not enough to revive the fortunes of an  
industry that has lost tens of thousands of jobs and is mothballing 
its drilling rigs in droves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Independent Petroleum Association of America ``is getting  
flooded with calls from American men and women of this industry who 
keep asking what the heck is Washington doing about this problem,'' 
said Gil Thurm, the trade association's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Releasing the results of an industrywide survey taken last  
month, IPAA said more than 136,000 oil wells and 57,000 natural gas 
wells have shut down since oil prices crashed in November 1997. The 
association says the closings represent an economic loss of $25 
billion and have cost some 41,000 jobs over the past 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings ``should send shock waves through the halls of the  
Congress and the Clinton administration,'' Thurm said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced some  
relief for independent producers who drill on public lands. They 
can suspend operations for up to two years without losing their 
leases. 
</P>
<P>
	The action is directed at ``stripper'' wells, which individually  
produce 15 barrels or less daily, but collectively account for 32 
percent of all oil drilled on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will help to alleviate the economic impact low oil prices  
may have on small federal stripper-oil operations,'' Babbitt said. 
``We understand what the small operators are going through, and 
this is the right decision at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thurm welcomed the assistance but prodded the administration to  
do more. 
</P>
<P>
	``While these initiatives address an important concern for  
stripper wells, we hope the administration understands that the 
risk is far broader,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of a worldwide glut, crude oil prices have plunged 55  
percent in the past two years. Beyond the economic and job losses, 
the depressed prices have had a ripple effect on the budgets of 
state and local governments that depend on oil royalties and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials warn that a nation that relies on foreign oil  
for more than half of its energy needs can ill afford to see its 
domestic production reduced further. IPAA estimates that 60 percent 
of domestic onshore production is at risk if crude oil prices 
remain at their current lows. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has rallied behind legislation introduced by Sen.  
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and other Oil Patch legislators that 
would provide an array of tax incentives to help independent 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to take action to enable producers to stay in  
operation even at these low oil prices,'' said a co-sponsor, Sen. 
Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, who is ranking Democrat on the Senate 
Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Many also favor replenishing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a  
move that would siphon millions of barrels of oil from the glutted 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The reserve, stored in underground salt caverns in Louisiana and  
Texas, can hold up to 752 million barrels. It stands at 560 million 
barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	But with motorists enjoying the cheapest prices at the gasoline  
pump since World War II, when prices are adjusted for inflation, 
some lawmakers recognize they may have a hard time convincing the 
public of the need to boost oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Wine Labels To Tout Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A long effort by winemakers to spread the word  
that drinking wine can be good for your heart bore fruit Friday: 
Labels now can point to scientific findings about the health 
effects of a glass or two. 
</P>
<P>
	The government announced it has approved two statements for use  
on wine labels: 
</P>
<P>
	``The proud people who made this wine encourage you to consult  
your family doctor about the health effects of wine consumption,'' 
one reads. 
</P>
<P>
	The other says: ``To learn the health effects of wine  
consumption, send for the federal government's Dietary Guidelines 
for Americans,'' and provides a mailing address and Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The statements were approved by the Treasury Department, which  
oversees the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The approval 
is not an endorsement by the government but a reflection of the 
finding that the statements are neither false nor misleading. 
</P>
<P>
	The original statements proposed by the wine industry included  
references to the ``health benefits'' of wine in ``moderate 
consumption,'' said Edward S. Knight, a Treasury Department 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``We insisted they be dropped because we felt they could be  
false or misleading,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the new statements are considered a victory by a wine  
industry that has pushed the added wording for more than three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time,'' said Tom Shelton, president of the Napa  
Valley Vinters Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a great compromise -- good for the consumer and  
certainly good for the wine industry,'' he said. ``It's certainly 
balanced because it does not mitigate against the warning label 
that remains on the bottle. It's simply referring consumers to the 
dietary guidelines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wine labels already warn -- and will continue to warn -- that  
pregnant women should not drink alcohol and that alcohol can impair 
driving and cause health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But the labels currently say nothing about studies suggesting  
that moderate alcohol intake can reduce the risk of heart disease 
in some people. 
</P>
<P>
	The government dietary guidelines note that ``current evidence  
suggests that moderate drinking is associated with a lower risk for 
coronary heart disease in some individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines also point out that higher levels of alcohol  
intake can raise the risk for high blood pressure, stroke, heart 
disease, certain cancers and accidents, as well as possibly causing 
cirrhosis of the liver and damage to the brain and heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who drink should do so in moderation, the guidelines  
recommend. That is defined as no more than one drink a day for 
women, and no more than two drinks a day for men. Five ounces of 
wine is considered a drink. 
</P>
<P>
	John DeLuca, president of the San Francisco-based Wine  
Institute, argued the new statements are not a marketing scheme to 
boost sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to give our people a choice,'' he said. ``This is  
a complex subject, but if science is saying this, the public has a 
right to know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only two wineries have been approved to use the new  
statements. Others must submit to the government an application 
that includes a sample label. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just the statement but other components of the label  
that we need to look at,'' such as the label's placement and 
typeface, said Art Libertucci, assistant director of the ATF. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal health officials and some senators already have voiced  
concern that such a label would purport to make a health claim 
about wine or could encourage excessive drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon General David Satcher has expressed his concern that  
mentioning health benefits on a bottle would send ``mixed 
messages,'' according to a senior administration official. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who helped write the alcohol  
warning labels that have been in place for a decade, urged federal 
regulators last spring not to approve any watered-down label. He 
also introduced a bill that would strengthen the required warning 
labels. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1997, the Health and Human Services Department wrote to  
the ATF, urging the bureau to delay approval of the labels.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Eugene Robinson, the Atlanta Falcons defensive  
back arrested on the eve of the Super Bowl, says he will return the 
award he won for high moral character the same day he got into 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who is in Honolulu for the Pro Bowl, told Atlanta  
station WSB-TV on Thursday that he would return the Bart Starr 
Award, given for leadership in home, on the field and in the

</P>
<P>

sex from an undercover police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Bratton of Athletes in Action, the Ohio-based group that

<HEADLINE> Researcher Falsified Cancer Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A research data manager fabricated information  
about three patients in a series of large cancer treatment trials, 
the government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Cancer Institute said the amount of data falsified  
was so small it did not affect the outcome of the trials, which 
studied chemotherapy effectiveness on breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute said the federal Office of Research Integrity  
discovered that information had been falsified on one patient in 
each of three studies. The studies involved 2,697, 1,106 and 2,305 
patients respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer institute spokesman Mike Miller said the data manager  
involved was Thomas Philpot, who worked for Rush-Presbyterian-St. 
Luke's Medical Center in Chicago and MacNeal Cancer Center, then 
affiliated with Northwestern University. Miller said attempts by 
the National Cancer Institute to contact Philpot have been 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of these trials had a large number of patients and was  
conducted at many institutions,'' said Dr. Richard Ungerleider, 
chief of NCI's Clinical Investigations Branch. ``The fabricated 
data, involving as it did just one patient on each trial, will not 
affect these trials' results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three studies were large, controlled trials of chemotherapy  
treatments for breast cancer conducted between 1977 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the cancer institute, the data manager falsified or  
fabricated telephone contacts and information, including the 
patients' survival status.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Sentenced to Jail for Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson was sent back to jail Friday,  
this time for as long as a year, for assaulting two motorists in 
what the judge called ``potentially lethal road rage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision not only puts the former heavyweight champion's  
career in jeopardy, it could lead to more jail time for violating 
parole in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson ``repeatedly speaks and acts compulsively and violently,''  
Judge Stephen Johnson said after a three-hour hearing. ``The court 
views this as a tragic example of potentially lethal road rage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson gave Tyson two concurrent two-year sentences, and  
suspended all but one year. He fined Tyson $5,000 and sentenced him 
to two years' probation after his release from jail -- which could 
be in six months if he's released early for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson appeared stoic throughout the hearing. During a 30-minute  
recess, he stroked the face of his wife, Monica, and quietly 
chatted with her. Then came the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon hearing the judge's words, Tyson's broad shoulders slumped,  
and he was led away in handcuffs while his wife cried. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who pleaded no contest, can appeal the sentence within 30  
days, and if he won, he would stand trial on the charges. He cannot 
be released on bail before Monday, when he can request a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came three weeks after Tyson's successful comeback  
against Francois Botha. Tyson was scheduled to fight April 24 in 
Las Vegas against an opponent to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino Capurro, spokesman for Showtime, the cable network that  
has a multiple-fight contract with Tyson: 
</P>
<P>
	``We are surprised at the severity of the sentence that the  
Montgomery County District Court has issued to Mike Tyson. We 
cannot comment further at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana authorities must now decide whether the 32-year-old  
fighter violated his probation for a 1991 rape conviction. Tyson 
was released in 1995 after serving three years of a six-year 
sentence, and his probation was set to expire in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence could also lead to a review of Tyson's boxing  
license by the Nevada State Athletic Commission, which reinstated 
the fighter in October after a one-year suspension for biting 
Evander Holyfield's ears during a fight in June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Nave, the only Nevada commissioner who voted against  
Tyson, said it was possible the five-member panel would take no 
further action, especially since the license expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sense is that if it is true, if he's going to be in jail  
for a year, there's not much need at this point for us to take 
action,'' Nave said. ``What what would be the reason for us to do 
anything?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Jimmerson, Tyson's lead attorney at the Nevada hearing, said  
the panel's options include a fine and-or a suspension or 
revocation of his license. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the sentence is totally and completely unexpected and  
unduly harsh,'' Jimmerson said. ``There's going to be a careful 
review of his options, including perhaps requesting a new trial in 
Maryland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Patricia Gifford, the Indiana judge who sentenced Tyson at  
his rape trial, could not be reached for comment. David Deputy, a 
bailiff in her court, said he couldn't comment on the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judge is waiting for her paperwork to come from  
Maryland,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson kicked one motorist and punched another after a minor  
three-car accident in Gaithersburg, Md., on Aug. 31. In December, 
Tyson pleaded no contest -- meaning he neither protested the charges 
nor admitted guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have received up to 20 years in jail.  
</P>
<P>
	The two victims, Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick, settled  
out of court, and were against sending Tyson to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor, Montgomery County State's Attorney Douglas  
Gansler, wanted Tyson behind bars, but was hampered by a plea 
agreement negotiated by his predecessor, Robert Dean. Dean had said 
he would recommend no jail time in return for the no contest plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler's memo to the judge called Tyson ``nothing less than a  
time bomb.'' Gansler detailed Tyson's 1991 rape conviction in 
Indiana, seven brushes with the law as a juvenile, and the 
Holyfield fight.

<HEADLINE> Outlook Bright for HMO Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The debate in Congress over HMOs has shifted  
from whether to pass ``patient protection'' legislation to what it 
should include. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues have not changed much since last year, but the  
politics have. A half dozen bills have been introduced, and House 
and Senate committees already are looking for compromises. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to tackle the managed-care issue in a bipartisan  
manner,'' Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., 
and the panel's top Democrat, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., 
said in a joint statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	They said their staffs were meeting with interest groups in a  
``serious effort'' to find common ground. While Congress has failed 
to produce legislation thus far, they said, ``it is our hope that 
with a fresh start and open minds,'' they can reach consensus in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Even fierce opponents say this year is likely to produce action.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is a train going down the track,'' said Chip Khan, who  
heads the Health Insurance Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Any law is likely to give patients the right to complain to an  
outside mediator if an insurance company turns down care and to 
provide guarantees that a health-insurance plan will pay for 
reasonable visits to an emergency room and other basic care. 
</P>
<P>
	But crucial questions still are debated hotly, including whether  
patients should be allowed to sue HMOs when care is denied and 
whether plans must pay for what doctors consider medically 
necessary care. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the House narrowly passed a GOP bill along party  
lines. In the Senate, no legislation was considered because 
Republicans and Democrats couldn't even agree on the rules for 
debate. But this year looks different: 
</P>
<P>
	--Both House and Senate leaders have said legislation will be  
produced through the committee process, which forces the parties to 
work together. Last year, Democrats backed President Clinton's 
plan, and Republicans met in secret to craft their approach. 
</P>
<P>
	--In the House, Democrats picked up five seats in the November  
elections. Last year, the Democratic HMO bill failed by five votes. 
</P>
<P>
	--In the Senate, GOP leaders have introduced their own modest  
legislation. A year ago, they were saying they might not back 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	--The new House speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has  
signaled interest in seeing HMO legislation become law. He was 
chairman of last year's GOP task force, knows the issues and has 
promised a vote before year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Politically, many Republicans would like this issue off the  
table before the 2000 elections. Last year's exit polls found HMOs 
were not a top issue for most voters, although candidates of both 
parties campaigned on it across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The essential arguments for and against legislation have not  
changed. Supporters say patients need protection from health 
maintenance organizations and other managed care plans that deny 
needed care in order to hold down costs. Opponents say new 
regulations will increase the cost of insurance, cause employers to 
drop coverage and leave more people uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	But even opponents, including the HMO trade group, are open to  
modest regulations, including the right to take disputes over 
coverage to an independent panel. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how hard opponents will lobby against legislation  
this year. Opponents spent $60 million to lobby on HMO regulation 
and other subjects in the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Association of Health Plans is looking ahead to  
2000, trying to keep HMOs out of the presidential race by releasing 
polls of GOP voters in New Hampshire and Iowa that show minimal 
interest in the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some insurance companies are acting on their own to  
address complaints. Just Thursday, Sierra Health Services of Nevada 
became the latest company voluntarily to offer its members external 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize that anti-managed care comments and anecdotes  
create a concern that HMOs may not provide lifesaving treatment for 
severely ill patients,'' the company's chief executive officer, Dr. 
Anthony M. Marlon, said in a statement. ``Outside independent 
review should give our members peace of mind.''

<HEADLINE> Illinois Man Freed From Death Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Anthony Porter walked out of jail Friday after 17  
years on death row and threw his arms around the journalism 
professor and students who gathered evidence suggesting he was 
wrongly convicted of two murders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, it feels marvelous to be outside. I'm free,'' declared  
Porter, who came within two days of being executed in September 
before the Illinois Supreme Court stopped the execution two days 
earlier amid questions about his mental fitness. Porter has an IQ 
of 51. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, key witnesses have recanted their testimony and  
another man made a videotape confession Wednesday to the shooting 
deaths of Jerry Hillard, 18, and Marilyn Green, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Alstory Simon of Milwaukee made the admission under questioning  
by a private investigator who worked on the case with Northwestern 
University journalism students. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Thomas Fitzgerald freed Porter on a $10,000  
recognizance bond. He cited ``news reports of significant 
evidentiary developments that would put into question whether Mr. 
Porter actually committed the crime that he was convicted of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, 43, emerged from jail and embraced journalism professor  
David Protess, whose investigative reporting class gathered the 
evidence in his favor. Porter then clamped a bearhug around several 
students, lifting two of them joyously into the air as they stood 
in the jail's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	Stopping to talk with reporters, he said he wasn't bitter.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I'm free. I'm just glad I got out,'' Porter said. But  
he added: ``They waited too damn long. They had me locked up for 17 
years for something I didn't do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter remains charged with the two murders, pending further  
investigation. If Porter's conviction is overturned, he would be 
the 10th death row inmate exonerated in Illinois since capital 
punishment was reinstated in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors declined to say if they plan to charge Simon, whose  
attorney, Jack Rimland, would not disclose his client's 
whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court put Porter's execution on hold Sept. 21 after  
his attorneys questioned his fitness. After the execution was 
postponed, the case began to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
	Eyewitness William Taylor recanted his testimony and told  
Northwestern students that police pressured him into implicating 
Porter. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the students went to Milwaukee, armed with a list  
of names and addresses provided by an Illinois convict, and tracked 
down Simon's former wife, who implicated Simon in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago private investigator Paul Ciolino then went to Simon's  
home and videotaped his statement. Simon said he shot the man in 
self-defense and didn't mean to hit the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not the first time Protess and his students have  
investigated old murder cases. In June 1996, four men who had spent 
18 years in prison for murder were released after students helped 
uncover new evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving the jail with attorney Daniel Sanders, Porter  
stopped at McDonald's before arriving at his mother's home in a 
gritty and battered tenement next to an elevated train track. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daddy! Daddy!'' squealed his 21-year-old daughter, Thelma,  
racing into his arms. ``Glory be to God, Daddy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter hugged his mother, who cried softly, and turned to  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my mama, and I love her. This is Ms. Clara Porter,''  
he said, holding her tighter. ``C'mere, girl. She had faith in me 
the whole time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting on a sofa with his mother near a hole in the ceiling  
patched with newspaper, Porter spoke matter-of-factly about his 
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came this close to being executed, and that's hard,'' he  
said. ``But I know that everything's going to be all right now that 
I'm home.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky declares in her videotaped  
deposition that President Clinton never suggested she file a false 
affidavit to deny their affair and says she was ``a pest'' to 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan in seeking a job. Lewinsky says

deeply worried about what its monarch's death could mean for the 
future. The 63-year-old ruler left an American hospital last night 
after his body rejected a bone marrow transplant meant to fight off 
his lymphatic cancer. Aides carried Hussein, who was attached to an

<HEADLINE> Keillor Book Lampoons Ventura </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Perhaps they could settle it in one of  
those claymation celebrity wrestling matches on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesotan Garrison Keillor, host of public radio's ``A Prairie  
Home Companion,'' has written a political satire based loosely on 
Gov. Jesse Ventura's election. 
</P>
<P>
	Keillor says the book, ``Me'' -- ``by Jimmy `Big Boy' Valente as  
told to Garrison Keillor'' -- is a ``rather genial novel, not mean 
at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ventura, the colorful former pro wrestler who won election  
as a third-party candidate in November, is not amused. He feels 
that ``writing a book based upon me, without my permission, without 
any of my involvement'' amounts to ``cheating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tension already exists between Keillor and Ventura.  
</P>
<P>
	In an essay for Time magazine after the election, Keillor called  
the governor ``this great big honking bullet-headed shovel-faced 
mutha who talks in a steroid growl and doesn't stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Ventura proposed gradually eliminating state money  
for public radio and television. And in an appearance at a budget 
forum on Monday, he singled out Keillor's income for criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see his W-2,'' Ventura said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ventura is writing his own life story, which isn't expected out  
until this summer. He said he's not pleased with ``all of the 
people who are making money off of me.'' At least one other book 
and a made-for-TV movie are planned about him. 
</P>
<P>
	Keillor, an author of numerous books, said he was sorry to hear  
that the governor was steamed. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Minnesota humorist would be crazy to ignore Mr. Ventura,''  
Keillor said. ``He is the best show in town. Every 10-year-old in 
Minnesota does a Jesse imitation.''

<HEADLINE> Wiberg Wins Women's Ski Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg captured the women's  
combined title with a blistering second run of the slalom in the 
World Alpine Ski Championships on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg, collecting the fourth gold medal of her career in the  
world championships, stood fifth entering the last of three races. 
Combined times for the one downhill and two slalom runs determined 
the combined champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg, .69 seconds off the pace after the first slalom run, was  
clocked in 42.68 seconds on an aggressive second run. Four 
subsequent racers couldn't overtake her. Her aggregate time was 3 
minutes, 8.52 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Renate Goetschl, who won the downhill and maintained  
her lead despite only the seventh-fastest run in the first heat of 
slalom, could manage only a 43.52 time in the second run during 
which she nearly fell. She settled for the silver medal in 3:08.67. 
</P>
<P>
	The bronze went to France's Florence Masnada in 3:08.97.  
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Hilde Gerg, considered a favorite for the combined  
title because of her strength in slalom, was fourth in 3:09.38. 
Norway's Trude Gimle took fifth in 3:10.51, and Austria's Michaela 
Dorfmeister was sixth in 3:11.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg, 28, placed sixth in the downhill, 1.44 seconds behind  
Goetschl. She cut the deficit with the fifth-best time on the first 
slalom run. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl, 23, won the combined downhill by a comfortable .79  
seconds over teammate Stefanie Schuster, but Goetschl's lead was 
trimmed to .05 seconds when Masnada clocked the fastest run on the 
first heat of the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Three skiers who ranked in the top eight entering the last  
slalom run fell during their runs -- Austria's Brigitte Obermoser 
and Schuster, who stood fourth and sixth, respectively, and 
Germany's Martina Ertl, who stood eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonna Mendes of South Lake Tahoe, Calif., was the top American,  
placing 10th in 3:15.50. Kate Monahan of Aspen, Colo., was 11th in 
3:15.64. 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Lalive of Steamboat Springs, Colo., who placed seventh  
in the Olympic combined last year, stood 22nd after the downhill 
but lost an edge and did not finish the initial slalom run. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg had the best combined time for both slaloms at 1:33.42.  
Masnada was second in 1:33.85. Croatia's Janica Kostelic was third 
in 1:34.06 and finished seventh in the combined.

	BERLIN (AP) -- Talks between the powerful metalworkers union and  
employers ended after only 15 minutes Friday with no progress 
reported in reaching a wage contract. 
</P>
<P>
	A union leader in Berlin, Hasso Duevel, said employers only

week. The IG Metall union is demanding 6.5 percent more pay for the 
3.4 million workers in Germany's metal, electrical and automotive 
industries.

Bavaria, and the union again threatened to call for a full-strike 
vote if no deal is reached by Feb. 11.

	Gesamtmetall president Werner Stumpfe expressed optimism that a  
full-scale strike could be avoided.

<HEADLINE>  Mir's Mirror Experiment Called Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian officials scrapped the Mir space station's  
much-hyped space mirror experiment today after the shiny metal 
object got stuck and failed to properly unfurl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mir crew sent the mirror, attached to a cargo ship filled  
with trash, into the earth's atmosphere this afternoon. After 
mostly burning up during re-entry, the husk dropped harmlessly into 
the Pacific Ocean, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure was a big disappointment for Russia's struggling  
space agency, which had billed the project as a display of its 
ability to conduct pioneering, ambitious projects despite a lack of 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror was supposed to work like an artificial moon,  
reflecting a beam of sunlight across the earth. But its petal-like 
segments failed to unfold Thursday after a deployment mechanism 
jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror, which was to reach 83 feet in diameter when fully  
extended, was attached to a Progress cargo ship and jettisoned 
Thursday from the Mir. Cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei 
Avdeyev then sent a remote command to unfold the mirror, made of a 
thin membrane covered with a silver metal layer. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror started rotating, and a system of weights and strings  
began to pull out the thin membranes on the flower-like structure. 
But the deployment mechanism jammed and the mirror stopped 
spinning. 
</P>
<P>
	Exasperated crew and ground controllers struggled for hours to  
fix the hitch, and even got the mirror rotating again by shaking it 
with repeated blasts of the cargo ship's jets -- only to see it stop 
a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, when it became clear that the mirror would not unfurl,  
Mission Control gave up on the experiment. By this afternoon, they 
still didn't know exactly why the mirror failed to unfurl. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mood here is very depressed,'' said Valery Lyndin, a  
spokesman for the Mission Control. ``The failure was especially 
painful because of huge worldwide interest that the experiment 
aroused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have forgotten the old principle of Russian space programs  
-- to do something first and boast about it only after,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Mission Control chief Vladimir Solovyov said another space  
mirror is sitting ready on earth, but the Znamya (Banner) 
experiment will not be repeated because there is no place for the 
object in upcoming cargo launches. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials did not rule out that the project would be  
retried on the future 16-nation international space station. That 
station is expected to be finished in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the experiment gone smoothly, the mirror would have shone  
light on a spot about 5 miles in diameter in a number of regions in 
the former Soviet Union, Germany and the Czech Republic. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Mir's Mirror Experiment Called Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian officials scrapped the Mir space station's  
much-hyped space mirror experiment today after the shiny metal 
object got stuck and failed to properly unfurl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mir crew sent the mirror, attached to a cargo ship filled  
with trash, into the earth's atmosphere this afternoon. After 
mostly burning up during re-entry, the husk dropped harmlessly into 
the Pacific Ocean, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure was a big disappointment for Russia's struggling  
space agency, which had billed the project as a display of its 
ability to conduct pioneering, ambitious projects despite a lack of 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror was supposed to work like an artificial moon,  
reflecting a beam of sunlight across the earth. But its petal-like 
segments failed to unfold Thursday after a deployment mechanism 
jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror, which was to reach 83 feet in diameter when fully  
extended, was attached to a Progress cargo ship and jettisoned 
Thursday from the Mir. Cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei 
Avdeyev then sent a remote command to unfold the mirror, made of a 
thin membrane covered with a silver metal layer. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror started rotating, and a system of weights and strings  
began to pull out the thin membranes on the flower-like structure. 
But the deployment mechanism jammed and the mirror stopped 
spinning. 
</P>
<P>
	Exasperated crew and ground controllers struggled for hours to  
fix the hitch, and even got the mirror rotating again by shaking it 
with repeated blasts of the cargo ship's jets -- only to see it stop 
a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, when it became clear that the mirror would not unfurl,  
Mission Control gave up on the experiment. By this afternoon, they 
still didn't know exactly why the mirror failed to unfurl. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mood here is very depressed,'' said Valery Lyndin, a  
spokesman for the Mission Control. ``The failure was especially 
painful because of huge worldwide interest that the experiment 
aroused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have forgotten the old principle of Russian space programs  
-- to do something first and boast about it only after,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Mission Control chief Vladimir Solovyov said another space  
mirror is sitting ready on earth, but the Znamya (Banner) 
experiment will not be repeated because there is no place for the 
object in upcoming cargo launches. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials did not rule out that the project would be  
retried on the future 16-nation international space station. That 
station is expected to be finished in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the experiment gone smoothly, the mirror would have shone  
light on a spot about 5 miles in diameter in a number of regions in 
the former Soviet Union, Germany and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	People looking at the correct sector of the night sky would have  
seen the mirror as an immobile pinpoint of light, only slightly 
brighter or larger than an ordinary star, for about 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian space experts hoped the mirror would serve as a  
prototype for much larger models that could illuminate sun-starved 
northern cities through the long Arctic night and spotlight 
disaster areas. They also dreamed of futuristic spaceships that 
would glide through space using similar structures as `sails' to 
catch solar wind.

mirrors, which would be extremely difficult to unfold and maneuver.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Daytona 500 Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- John Elway's second consecutive  
victory in the Super Bowl gave Dale Earnhardt a little jolt of 
confidence as he began preparations to defend his victory in the 
Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was glad to see him win the Super Bowl for that reason  
alone,'' Earnhardt said of the Denver Broncos' quarterback, whose 
team beat the Atlanta Falcons 34-19 in the big game last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt, who failed to win in his first 19 attempts, would be  
one the fourth driver to win NASCAR's most prestigious event twice 
in a row, joining Cale Yarborough, Richard Petty and Sterling 
Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to do that would be great,'' Earnhardt said Friday  
after finishing practice at Daytona International Speedway. ``To 
start the season off on a winning note and get this team back into 
the feel of racing in the top five and racing for the championship 
is what I want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now that he has won the Daytona 500, Earnhardt's next big goal  
is a record eighth Winston Cup championship. In fact, his last 
title came in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he failed to win again after starting the season in  
victory lane, and he was out of the running for another title 
early, finishing a distant eighth in the points. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to longtime car-owner Richard Childress, Earnhardt  
added, ``Over the years I've raced with Richard, we've raced for 
the championship a lot of years. There weren't many years we were 
out of the running for it. We've got to get this turned around and 
get back in the running for it. Winning the race again would be a 
great start.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	FUN PLACE: Marlin, who was fast in Friday's practice with a lap  
of 193.995 mph, loves the high banks of Daytona International 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a special place in my heart,'' Marlin said. ``I won my  
first career pole here. My dad won a qualifying race here and I got 
my first career win here. It's always been good to me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really enjoy coming to Daytona and racing. Hopefully, we can  
get back to the magic we had in 1994, 95 and 96.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marlin won the pole here in 1992 and got the first two of his  
six career victories in the 1994 and 1995 Daytona 500s. His father, 
Coo Coo Marlin, won a 125-mile qualifying race here in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, his first season with Team Sabco, Marlin won one of  
the qualifying races, but broke a shock absorber in the 500 and 
wound up 22nd. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we were going to be good,'' Marlin said. ``From  
then on, we kind of went into a slump and didn't run real good and 
had a lot of problems. We kind of picked it up after May and had 
some good runs, but we made up our mind over the winter that we 
were going to work real hard and see if we can beat these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ROOKIE LOOK: Tony Stewart, driving for Joe Gibbs Racing, was  
easily the fastest Friday among the six drivers who will vie for 
rookie of the year honors in the 1999 Winston Cup Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was seventh overall at 192.827 mph. The next quickest  
rookie was Dan Pardus who was 35th at 190.670. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott Sadler was caught at 189.394, while Buckshot Jones  
turned a lap of 188.387, Stanton Barrett hit 188.147 and Mike 
Harmon managed 186.420. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, a former short track star in the U.S. Auto Club, said  
he has kept his butterflies in check so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of been business as usual,'' he said. ``You work so  
hard to get to this level. It's such a relief that you're finally 
here and you're in the first weekend of your Cup career. Instead of 
the anxiety kicking in, it's finally been a relief to me more than 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	FEELING OK: Frank Kimmel, the defending champion in the ARCA  
stock car series, was released from Halifax Medical Center Friday 
following an overnight observation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimmel was taken to the hospital, just blocks from the track,  
after his car spun and slammed into the turn two wall first-round 
qualifying for the FirstPlus Financial 200 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled to undergo another medical evaluation Saturday.  
If Kimmel is not cleared to drive, Bob Hill will qualify his car.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Holds at 28-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate held at a  
28-year low of 4.3 percent in January with retailers, financial and 
real estate firms and construction companies all reporting job 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted rate matched the level achieved in  
December and last April, and before that in 1970, the Labor 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers added 245,000 jobs to their payrolls -- nearly 100,000  
more than projected by economists -- on top of 298,000 in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The report shows the U.S. economy entering the new year with  
considerable momentum after growing during the final three months 
of 1998 at the fastest rate in 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	It could raise questions in financial markets about how much  
longer the Federal Reserve can resist raising short-term interest 
rates. At Fed policy-makers' most recent meeting, this week, they 
decided to hold rates unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	But Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan expressed concern in  
congressional testimony last month that labor shortages would 
propel faster wage increases, which in turn would drive up 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The traditional danger signals for the Fed, strong job growth  
and rising wages, are flashing, but I think the Fed is struggling 
because there still are no clear signs of inflation,'' said 
economist Bill Cheney of John Hancock in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates rose in U.S. credit markets after the figures  
were released. Yields on 30-year bonds, a barometer of long-term 
borrowing costs for consumers and business, climbed to 5.33 percent 
from 5.29 percent just before the data were released. The Dow Jones 
average of industrial stocks rose 41 points in the first hour of 
trading to 9,346. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's report showed the average hourly wages of nonsupervisory  
workers rising 6 cents in January to $13.04. It was the largest 
monthly increase since August. Over the year, hourly earnings have 
increased 50 cents, or 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate for whites was unchanged at 3.8 percent in  
January. But the rates for blacks, 7.8 percent, and Hispanics, 6.6 
percent, fell to the lowest levels since the government began 
tracking them in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner,  
Katharine G. Abraham, January job gains were led by services. 
Engineering and management services continued their strong growth, 
with payrolls rising by 27,000 and 17,000 jobs, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance and real estate each added 11,000 jobs. Retail  
employment rose by 30,000. Payrolls increased by 13,000 at trucking 
firms, 11,000 at communications companies and 36,000 in local 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The booming construction industry added a seasonally adjusted  
15,000 jobs even though severe weather in the Midwest and Northeast 
halted some work. Since September, construction has added 184,000 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, job losses continued in manufacturing. Payrolls fell by  
13,000 jobs, bringing job losses since last March to 285,000, 
reflecting the loss of export sales to troubled economies, 
principally in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	One bright spot was lumber and wood-products manufacturing,  
which gained 8,000 jobs, reflecting the brisk pace of construction, 
and auto manufacturing, up 6,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mining reported a drop of 9,000 jobs, reflecting the impact of  
low prices on oil production. 
</P>
<P>
	Employment gains in health services -- 6,000 -- were weak. Gains  
at medical offices were offset by a drop in home health care. 
Hospital employment was unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Miami, Florida OK Two-Year Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida and Miami finalized an  
agreement Friday to play a home-and-home football series beginning 
in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The first game will be played in Gainesville on Sept. 7, 2002.  
Florida will return the visit to Miami on Sept. 6, 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited about the opportunity to compete against a very  
fine Miami football program,'' Florida athletic director Jeremy 
Foley said. ``I know this will be a series that will have 
tremendous interest around the state and I am very pleased that 
these negotiations have been successfully completed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams were afforded the chance to add the meeting when the  
NCAA approved a 12th regular-season game in its meetings last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	They had considered playing at a neutral site, most likely in  
Jacksonville, but Foley said he preferred staying on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't always have the strongest non-conference home  
games,'' Foley said. ``So, I didn't feel like it would be fair to 
schedule a game a lot of people have been wanting to see, and then 
take it away to another city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators and Hurricanes have met 49 times with Florida holding  
a 25-24 lead. The last game was a 31-4 Miami rout in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miami fans have always enjoyed the rivalry and its rich  
history,'' said Miami athletic director Paul Dee. ``I am sure all 
Hurricane fans look forward to once again playing against the 
Florida Gators.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Nike Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A judge has thrown out a lawsuit that  
claimed Nike Inc. violated California's false-advertising laws by 
whitewashing conditions in its Asian factories to allay U.S. 
customers' concerns over sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge David Garcia dismissed the lawsuit Friday  
without giving a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accused Nike -- the world's largest athletics shoe  
maker -- of falsely stating that it guarantees a ``living wage'' to 
all workers and of painting a false picture of conditions for 
450,000 workers in Asian factories run by contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., denied making false statements  
and said its descriptions of factory conditions were protected by 
freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling will be appealed, said Alan Caplan, one of the  
lawyers who filed the lawsuit in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Caplan said he was at a loss to understand the ruling, because  
the right of free speech does not bar lawsuits over fraudulent 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Vada Manager, spokesman for Nike, said the company's statements  
were not the type of advertising regulated by the California law, 
as the lawsuit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike Chairman Philip Knight said the ruling will allow the  
company to redirect resources that were diverted by the lawsuit 
toward ``its initiatives for continuously updating factory working 
conditions around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nike said it had acted during the past year to set a minimum age  
of 18 for workers in Asian footwear factories, increase wages 40 
percent for entry-level factory workers in Indonesia, and improved 
factory air quality by substituting water-based adhesives in the 
assembly process. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said Nike's self-descriptions were refuted in  
studies by labor and human rights groups, news media investigations 
and a January 1997 audit by the firm of Ernst &AMP; Young, commissioned 
by Nike. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit, leaked to reporters in November 1997, found that  
employees in a large Vietnam shoe factory were exposed to 
cancer-causing toluene and suffered a high incidence of respiratory 
problems.

<HEADLINE> CBS Has $1 Million Quarterly Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. posted a $1 million fourth-quarter  
loss on severance payments to its former chief and losses from 
selling stakes in two cable networks, reversing an $861 million 
profit from a year earlier on gains from selling industrial 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the one-time gains or costs in both periods, CBS  
posted stronger profits from continuing operations in the latest 
quarter. Growth in its radio and outdoor advertising business 
offset lower television results, despite the NFL's successful 
return to the CBS network. 
</P>
<P>
	The profits from continuing operations exceeded Wall Street  
expectations. CBS shares were up 12 1/2 cents at $35.93 3/4 in midday 
trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS said its per-share results were breakeven for the quarter  
ended Dec. 31. In the same period a year earlier, CBS earned $1.25 
per share, but the profits came from an $871 million gain on the 
sale of the former Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s remaining 
industrial businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue jumped 22 percent to $1.79 billion from $1.47 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest quarter included $7 million in severance payments to  
former CBS chairman and chief executive Michael Jordan, who stepped 
down in October -- earlier than expected -- after transforming the 
former Westinghouse into a pure media company. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS also lost $7 million on sales of stakes in two cable  
networks. CBS sold its half of CBS Eye on People to Discovery 
Communications Inc. and sold a controlling stake in the 
Spanish-language news channel CBS TeleNoticias to Mexico's Grupo 
Medcom SA. 
</P>
<P>
	But excluding all special items, profits from continuing  
operations were $17 million, or 2 cents per share, in the 1998 
quarter, compared to a loss of $10 million, or 1 cent per share, in 
the 1997 period. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected CBS to post breakeven per-share results  
from continuing operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter operating profits rose 25 percent at Infinity  
Broadcasting Corp., its radio and outdoor advertising business, on 
strong advertising revenue and the acquisition of 98 stations from 
American Radio Systems Corp. CBS sold an 18 percent stake in 
Infinity to the public in December, raising nearly $3 billion in 
richest initial public offering ever made by a media company. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits at the televisions division -- the CBS network,  
television stations and cable channels -- dropped 81 percent. CBS 
blamed lower syndication revenue and smaller profits from 
programming other than the NFL, which the network regained this 
season after four years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, CBS lost $21 million, or 3 cents per share,  
compared to profits of $549 million, or 84 cents per share, in 
1997. Revenue rose to $6.81 billion from $5.37 billion.

<HEADLINE> America West Makes Stock Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- America West's biggest shareholder has served  
notice to other airlines that it won't sell its stock in the 
nation's ninth-largest airline unless the deal is part of a 
purchase of all of America West's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was seen as a move to drive up the price of any  
takeover by pressuring Continental Airlines to join the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, announced last  
month it was talking to America West about a buyout. Delta Air 
Lines is also said to be discussing a deal with America West. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental already owns 8 percent of America West and has a  
marketing alliance with the Tempe, Ariz.-based airline. In 
addition, it has first rights to purchase the stock of TPG Partners 
LP, an investor group led by David Bonderman, which has a 49 
percent stake in America West. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental contends it could take control of America West by  
acquiring only TPG's Class A shares, at an estimated cost of $50 
million. Buying the entire company is expected to cost more than $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	America West Holdings Corp. Chairman William Franke told airline  
analysts in Miami on Thursday that TPG would support a takeover 
only if the acquirer bought all of the company's Class A and Class 
B shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Miller, director of Avitas Inc., a Reston, Va.-based  
airline consulting firm, said Friday that Franke sent two key 
signals: America West and TPG are very serious about making a deal, 
and Continental -- which has indicated it won't allow America West 
to fall to a rival carrier -- should expect to pay full price. 
</P>
<P>
	Franke and Bonderman ``clearly want to maximize the value of the  
company for themselves and shareholders one way or another,'' 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonderman has already cashed out some of his stake in America  
West, selling 1.95 million shares in May for $56 million. A buyout 
at $30 a share -- the high end of analysts' estimates -- would give 
Franke more than $30 million.

<HEADLINE> NY Police Shoot, Kill Unarmed Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An unarmed immigrant street peddler with no  
criminal record was shot and killed by four officers who were 
searching for a serial rapist, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amadou ``Ahmed'' Diallo, a 22-year-old immigrant from West  
Africa, was killed early Thursday in the vestibule of the building 
where he shared a small apartment with two roommates. The four 
officers fired a total of 41 shots and an autopsy found Diallo was 
wounded 19 times in the legs, torso, back, arm and chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo, who had no criminal record, was unarmed, said a police  
source, speaking on condition of anonymity. His wallet and a beeper 
were found nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no civilian witnesses and the officers involved have  
yet to be interviewed by investigators as requested by the Bronx 
district attorney's office. The office would not comment on the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo's uncle, Mamadou Diallo, described the Guinea native as  
``a very honest guy, a religious guy'' who sold hats, clothing and 
other items on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shoot somebody 30, 40 times,'' said the uncle, who talked  
to police after the shooting. ``They tell me this is probably (a) 
police mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani asked residents to be patient. ``We all  
have to wait and react to facts. ... We've had terrible mistakes in 
this city when people have reacted to rumors and intuition and 
feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo died of multiple gunshot wounds to the torso, said Ellen  
Borakove, spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office. The 
medical examiner was still determining how many bullets hit Diallo 
and the direction they were fired from. 
</P>
<P>
	The four plainclothes officers -- assigned to a street crime  
patrol -- were investigating a serial rapist in the area, but it was 
not known if they thought Diallo was a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	The police source said a roommate told investigators Diallo had  
come home at about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, then left again. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after 12:30 a.m., the source said, the police officers  
had contact with a man on Diallo's street, but it wasn't clear if 
it was Diallo. Diallo was shot in his vestibule about 10 minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what happened, because we haven't spoken to  
them, but it looks like one guy panicked and the rest followed 
suit,'' The New York Times quoted an unidentified a police official 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the four officers, all assigned to the 43rd Precinct in  
the Bronx, have been involved in prior shooting incidents. No 
criminal charges were brought in two cases, and the third is still 
under investigation.

<HEADLINE> SEC Said To Be Probing Mutual Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- MONY Group Inc. says it is unaware of any  
investigation of its Mutual Life Insurance Co. unit by federal 
securities regulators, despite claims to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Mutual Life company manager said Thursday that his  
company's accounting practices are being examined. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a million Americans who got burned,'' said R. Dale  
Abshire, who brought the allegations to the attention of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and state regulators. He was 
referring to the million or so Mutual Life policyholders in the 
late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC is looking into whether Mutual Life, one of the nation's  
biggest life insurers, manipulated the surplus on its books to 
bolster its financial position, Abshire said in a telephone 
interview. The investigation was first reported in Thursday's 
editions of The Wall Street Journal, which quoted unidentified 
people familiar with the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, MONY Group said it was unaware of any  
investigation by the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our accounting practices are appropriate and in accordance  
with regulatory requirements,'' the statement said. It called the 
accounting allegations ``without merit,'' noting that the 
class-action suit was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain confident that additional scrutiny of any of these  
issues would be resolved in our favor,'' said Michael I. Roth, 
chairman and chief executive officer of MONY Group. 
</P>
<P>
	In another reported probe, SEC investigators also have signaled  
they may bring civil charges of securities fraud against major Wall 
Street firm Bear Stearns Cos., the Journal reported. Bear Stearns' 
clearing division, which processes trades for brokerage firms, has 
come under scrutiny from both securities regulators and criminal 
prosecutors, who are examining whether the company ignored signs of 
fraudulent activity at the small firms for which it clears 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Bear Stearns had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	SEC spokesman Duncan King declined comment on both reported  
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	The market watchdog agency recently started a major enforcement  
crackdown against accounting fraud by publicly traded companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of Mutual Life, a high surplus would show the  
insurer was financially strong, attracting more policyholders and 
positive reviews from investors and analysts, thereby increasing 
the pay of company executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutual Life did ``all kinds of manipulations of the books,''  
said Abshire, who left the company in 1991 and settled a defamation 
suit against it in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations were made in a 1995 class-action suit by  
policyholders against the company that was dismissed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also alleged that Mutual Life deceptively marketed life  
insurance policies with so-called ``vanishing premiums,'' which 
sales agents claimed could be eliminated because of the interest 
accumulated on the policies' cash value. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which had been mutually owned by its policyholders,  
began to be publicly traded last November.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Owner `Doubtful' of Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Money may be the reason Dennis Rodman  
doesn't play for the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The most the Lakers could offer Rodman is the prorated portion  
of the veteran minimum of $1 million, well under the $18 million he 
earned the last two seasons with Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't imagine Dennis playing for that kind of money,''  
Lakers owner Jerry Buss said Friday night. ``But it's not over 
until the fat lady sings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buss said he last saw Rodman 10 days ago and the two talked.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's looking doubtful,'' Buss said. ``How interested was I? I  
was very interested. Dennis is someone that could give us 
rebounding like we have never had, particularly at that position. 
He's a true talent. In a way, I was just hoping somehow if he chose 
a team, it would be us. I know he wants to play here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buss suggested Rodman and his well-known antics would be  
tolerated by Los Angeles fans hungry for a championship, something 
the Lakers haven't won since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't please everybody. Some people don't even like the  
Laker Girls. Dennis is a talent,'' Buss said. ``...I think a lot of 
people would forgive him as long as he tried to act somewhat 
normally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the rest of the Lakers don't think Rodman would be a  
distraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it would remain to be seen,'' Buss said. ``Dennis is  
Dennis. You're not about to tell Dennis how to be someone else. You 
take him the way he is.''

<HEADLINE> Lions Sign Ex-Notre Dame QB Powlus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Lions signed former Notre Dame  
quarterback Ron Powlus on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	After ending his high-profile career at Notre Dame, where he set  
16 school records, Powlus wasn't selected in the NFL draft in April 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent the preseason with the Tennessee Oilers before being  
released in August, and was working in the Harrisburg, Pa., 
statehouse before getting the call in December to join the St. 
Louis Rams' practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Powlus passed for 7,602 yards and 52 touchdowns during his four  
years as starting quarterback with the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions finished last season with rookie Charlie Batch as  
their starting quarterback. Batch was backed up by Frank Reich and 
Scott Mitchell.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Chairman Warns of Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co.'s low stock price could make it  
vulnerable to a takeover bid, the aerospace company's chairman has 
warned senior managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Phil Condit shared his worries with the company's top  
280 executives at their annual winter retreat in Palm Springs, 
Calif., last month, The Seattle Times reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said that according to Boeing officials who  
attended the gathering, Condit noted that Boeing's assets -- its 
plants, equipment and backlog of orders for airplanes and rockets -- 
now exceed its market value, making the company potentially 
vulnerable to a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Condit did not cite a specific threat by another company or  
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has faced the prospect of a hostile takeover before. In  
1987, corporate raider T. Boone Pickens announced he intended to 
buy as much as 15 percent of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The news at that time stunned Boeing executives, and the state  
Legislature was called into special session to pass a law making 
hostile takeovers more difficult. Pickens eventually withdrew 
quietly, and his stock holdings never exceeded more than 5 percent 
of Boeing's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-1990s, there was speculation that General Electric or  
another company might try to acquire Boeing. Instead, Boeing went 
on its own buying spree, acquiring Rockwell Aerospace and McDonnell 
Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's stock price has fallen by one-third since it merged  
with McDonnell Douglas in August 1997. Boeing shares closed Friday 
at $37.25 a share, up 75 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's market value -- its share price multiplied by its  
outstanding shares -- was $37.22 billion Friday. The value of its 
assets was $36.67 billion as of Dec. 31, the most recent figure 
Boeing has given. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Hopkins, Boeing's chief financial officer, said in a  
recent interview that a takeover is unlikely. But she said Boeing 
can't expose itself to the risk. Boeing's new business plan, which 
Hopkins plans to release within 60 days, is partly aimed at 
discouraging potential raiders, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of what's really driving me comes from looking at it from  
that perspective myself,'' Hopkins said. ``No company can sit 
around and say that would never happen to them. I think at 58 bucks 
a share, it probably wouldn't happen, but certainly we can't afford 
to take that attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because Boeing is a big defense contractor, any new owner would  
need approval from government. A potential foreign owner would have 
an even more difficult time getting regulatory approval, since many 
Boeing defense projects involve classified information and 
state-of-the-art military technology.

<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The envelope, please. And the winner is  
.... Ree Johnson, for ``Jaws''! 
</P>
<P>
	Ree Johnson? ``Jaws?'' It's no mistake, as Johnson bounds to the  
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the king of the universe!'' Johnson exclaims, clutching a  
golden trophy as admirers applaud his victory and his stirring 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, an office worker by day, wanted to be a star. And on  
this night he was. He got the paparazzi frenzy, the autograph 
demands, the TV interviews, the award. And a choice of salmon, 
chicken, steak or pasta, all for $44.50 at Tinseltown Studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Tinseltown Studios, a tourist attraction near Disneyland that  
opened in November, offers ordinary people the chance to taste 
fame, or at least a homogenized, amusement-park version of it, at a 
fantasy Oscar-style awards dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	A red carpet leads to the front door, and photographers, TV  
cameras and autograph seekers -- all extras hired by the operator of 
Tinseltown, Ogden Corp. -- pester the guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two awards -- the ``Oggies'' for best actress and actor --  
are given here. The eight nominees tape lines from popular movies, 
then see their performances digitally inserted into the films. 
Dinner, comedy and dance numbers fill the rest of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Even fantasy fame can give some people butterflies.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm nervous as heck to be here, let me tell you,'' said  
Michelle Reynolds of Anaheim, whose husband, Jeff, gave her the 
evening as a birthday gift. ``I so wanted to cancel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others seem born to it.  
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Selznick of San Diego (no relation to David O. Selznick,  
the Hollywood mogul who made ``Gone With the Wind'') was marking 
her 16th birthday with her mom, Kim, and several pals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the whole Hollywood thing,'' Jamie said. Why exactly?  
Her friend Ashley Nagle jumped in: ``Fame. Money. Matt Damon. Ben 
Affleck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this artificial version of an artificial world, reality  
doesn't stand a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Actress and writer Carrie Fisher -- Princess Leia Organa in  
``Star Wars'' -- decided to give her 6-year-old daughter a taste of 
the Hollywood hype. More than one Tinseltown guest thought Ms. 
Fisher was an impostor. (She looked so short.) 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my fill before I was 3,'' said Ms. Fisher, the daughter  
of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who years ago gave up his dream of acting to raise a  
family in the Los Angeles suburbs, couldn't have liked it more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm going to have to go now and search out my lost  
career,'' Johnson said. His wife, Dr. D'Liese Melendrez Johnson, 
smiled indulgently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we have a limo outside?'' Johnson said, grinning. ``Because  
I cannot ride in an Explorer now.''

<HEADLINE> Man Free After 16 Years on Death Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man who spent 16 years on death row was freed  
today after college journalists uncovered new evidence and another 
man confessed to the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook County Criminal Courts Judge Thomas Fitzgerald said there  
were ``news reports of significant evidentiary developments'' that 
would put into question whether Anthony Porter actually committed 
the crime he was convicted of. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed Porter to leave prison on a $10,000 recognizance  
bond, meaning he does not have to post any bond. He will stay free 
while prosecutors study the new confession. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, 43, was released based on a motion filed by the Cook  
County state's attorney's office. However, he remains charged with 
the 1982 murders of Jerry Hillard, 18, and Marilyn Green, 19, who 
were gunned down in a Chicago park. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they need more time to complete their  
investigation into the latest evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter had his arms around his two attorneys as he heard the  
judge's decision. While he appeared elated by the news, he did not 
speak to reporters as he was taken back to the Cook County Jail to 
be processed before leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the day after another man was videotaped confessing  
to the slayings, he had said, ``I'm not angry now. I thank God 
everything came out all right.''

	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Gravely ill with cancer, King Hussein is  
being treated as his deeply apprehensive nation hopes for the best. 
The king returned home today only 11 days after he abruptly left 
for the United States to treat the relapse of illness. Jordan TV 
said Hussein is still undergoing medical treatment. But one source 
has called the king's condition a ``hopeless case.'' Another source 
said it was ``a matter of hours.'' He said the king's liver and 
kidney had failed, his brain had stopped functioning and he was 
surviving on life support.

affair. She says she now has ``mixed feelings'' for Clinton and

	Jobless Rate Holds at 28-Year Low

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American economy entered the new year on a  
tear, creating 245,000 jobs in sales, construction, computers and 
other fields and holding the unemployment rate at a 28-year low of 
4.3 percent. The government's first major economic report of the 
year was issued today by the Labor Department. The unemployment 
rate for whites was unchanged at 3.8 percent in January. But the 
rates for blacks, 7.8 percent, and Hispanics, 6.6 percent, fell to 
the lowest levels since the government began tracking them in the 
early 1970s.

a bigger say than doctors in the care they receive, according to a 
new poll. Women are more critical than men, with 40 percent saying 
the health care system is in worse shape than it was five years 
ago, says the poll conducted for The Associated Press. The biggest 
complaint was the inability of people to choose their own doctor. 
Nine out of 10 Americans said they were very satisfied or somewhat

West Africa, was killed early yesterday in the vestibule of the

	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Nick Anderson scored 19 points and Orlando  
held off a late rally led by Latrell Sprewell to ruin the 
controversial guard's debut with the New York Knicks 93-85 Friday 
tonight. Orlando outscored New York 25-4 during a nine-minute 
stretch of the second quarter to break open a close game, despite 
not getting a big offensive night from All-Star guard Penny 
Hardaway.

	Lewinsky: He Never Told Me To Lie  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky declares in her videotaped  
deposition that President Clinton never suggested she file a false 
affidavit to deny their affair and says she was ``a pest'' to 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan in seeking a job. Lewinsky says 
she now has ``mixed feelings'' for Clinton and objected when her 
congressional inquisitor, Rep. Ed Bryant, referred to her relations 
with Clinton as ``salacious.''

	King Hussein Returns to Jordan  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- King Hussein arrived home today to a nation  
deeply worried about what its monarch's death could mean for the 
future. The 63-year-old ruler left an American hospital last night 
after his body rejected a bone marrow transplant meant to fight off 
his lymphatic cancer. Aides carried Hussein, who was attached to an 
IV, off the plane on a stretcher, said royal palace officials, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. One official said the king's liver 
and kidney had failed, his brain was not functioning and that he 
was on life support.

	BURNS CITY, Ind. (AP) -- At least four boxcars loaded with bombs  
derailed today just outside a naval weapons center, but none of 
them exploded and no one was hurt. A few houses in Burns City, a 
community of about 15 homes, were evacuated as a precaution, said 
Sgt. Michael Bennett of the Indiana State Police. The boxcars were 
``loaded with some type of explosive device. It's bombs, 
phosphorus-type bombs,'' Bennett said. The cars were part of a 
Canadian Pacific Railway train.

<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Canada's prime minister and 11 regional leaders  
have reached a new agreement on how to fund Canada's extensive 
social programs, but in doing so damaged relations with Quebec. The 
new deal was supposed to unite Canada's 10 provinces and two 
territories by offering the same services to all Canadians, no 
matter what province they live in. But talks that ended last night 
reinforced old divisions as French-speaking Quebec found itself 
again the only dissenting voice.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian officials scrapped the Mir space station's  
space mirror experiment today after the shiny metal object got 
stuck and failed to properly unfurl. It was a big disappointment 
for Russia's struggling space agency, which had billed the project 
as a display of its ability to conduct pioneering, ambitious 
projects despite a lack of funds. The mirror was supposed to work 
like an artificial moon, reflecting a beam of sunlight across the 
earth.

injection at the national penitentiary in the Manila suburb of

	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson faces sentencing today on two  
counts of second-degree assault stemming from an altercation 
following a minor traffic accident on Aug. 31. The judge's decision 
will help determine whether Tyson will have to return to jail in 
Indiana for violating probation for a 1991 rape conviction. It also 
could lead boxing authorities to strip Tyson of his license for the 
second time in less than two years.

<HEADLINE>  Tyson Sentenced to Jail for Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson was sent back to jail Friday,  
this time for as long as a year, for assaulting two motorists in 
what the judge called ``potentially lethal road rage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision not only puts the former heavyweight champion's  
career in jeopardy, it could lead to more jail time for violating 
parole in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson ``repeatedly speaks and acts compulsively and violently,''  
Judge Stephen Johnson said after a three-hour hearing. ``The court 
views this as a tragic example of potentially lethal road rage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson gave Tyson two concurrent two-year sentences, and  
suspended all but one year. He fined Tyson $5,000 and sentenced him 
to two years' probation after his release from jail -- which could 
be in six months if he's released early for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson appeared stoic throughout the hearing. During a 30-minute  
recess, he stroked the face of his wife, Monica, and quietly 
chatted with her. Then came the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon hearing the judge's words, Tyson's broad shoulders slumped,  
and he was led away in handcuffs while his wife cried. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who pleaded no contest, can appeal the sentence within 30  
days, and if he won, he would stand trial on the charges. He cannot 
be released on bail before Monday, when he can request a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came three weeks after Tyson's successful comeback  
against Francois Botha. Tyson was scheduled to fight April 24 in 
Las Vegas against an opponent to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino Capurro, spokesman for Showtime, the cable network that  
has a multiple-fight contract with Tyson: 
</P>
<P>
	``We are surprised at the severity of the sentence that the  
Montgomery County District Court has issued to Mike Tyson. We 
cannot comment further at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana authorities must now decide whether the 32-year-old  
fighter violated his probation for a 1991 rape conviction. Tyson 
was released in 1995 after serving three years of a six-year 
sentence, and his probation was set to expire in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence could also lead to a review of Tyson's boxing  
license by the Nevada State Athletic Commission, which reinstated 
the fighter in October after a one-year suspension for biting 
Evander Holyfield's ears during a fight in June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Nave, the only Nevada commissioner who voted against  
Tyson, said it was possible the five-member panel would take no 
further action, especially since the license expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sense is that if it is true, if he's going to be in jail  
for a year, there's not much need at this point for us to take 
action,'' Nave said. ``What what would be the reason for us to do 
anything?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Jimmerson, Tyson's lead attorney at the Nevada hearing, said  
the panel's options include a fine and-or a suspension or 
revocation of his license. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the sentence is totally and completely unexpected and  
unduly harsh,'' Jimmerson said. ``There's going to be a careful 
review of his options, including perhaps requesting a new trial in 
Maryland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Patricia Gifford, the Indiana judge who sentenced Tyson at  
his rape trial, could not be reached for comment. David Deputy, a 
bailiff in her court, said he couldn't comment on the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judge is waiting for her paperwork to come from  
Maryland,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson kicked one motorist and punched another after a minor  
three-car accident in Gaithersburg, Md., on Aug. 31. In December, 
Tyson pleaded no contest -- meaning he neither protested the charges 
nor admitted guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have received up to 20 years in jail.  
</P>
<P>
	The two victims, Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick, settled  
out of court, and were against sending Tyson to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor, Montgomery County State's Attorney Douglas  
Gansler, wanted Tyson behind bars, but was hampered by a plea 
agreement negotiated by his predecessor, Robert Dean. Dean had said 
he would recommend no jail time in return for the no contest plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler's memo to the judge called Tyson ``nothing less than a  
time bomb.'' Gansler detailed Tyson's 1991 rape conviction in 
Indiana, seven brushes with the law as a juvenile, and the 
Holyfield fight.

<HEADLINE> VW Voluntarily Recalls Two Models </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Volkswagen is voluntarily recalling  
its 1999 Jetta and Golf four-door models due to sound-absorbing 
material in the doors that might have been improperly installed and 
could catch fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall involves about 11,585 Jettas and Golfs in the United  
States and 1,385 Jettas sold in Canada, VW said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seat belt tension system, designed to provide extra  
protection in severe collisions, creates heat and could potentially 
ignite the material if it has been damaged by improper 
installation, VW said. 
</P>
<P>
	No accidents or injuries have resulted from the problem, and  
only one reported incident in a controlled test environment, the 
automaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of affected vehicles will be notified by mail. Dealers  
will remove the material, which is designed to reduce sound at 
higher speeds, from the door pillars. All work will be completed at 
no cost to the customer.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Nike Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A judge on Friday dismissed a lawsuit  
accusing Nike of misrepresenting conditions at Asian factories in 
order to mislead customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in April by a consumer advocate, claimed Nike  
violated California false-advertising laws in its campaign in 
defense of wages, treatment of workers, and health and safety 
conditions at overseas plants run by contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike, the world's largest athletic shoe maker, denied making  
false statements and said its descriptions of factory conditions 
were protected by freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge David Garcia dismissed the lawsuit without  
giving a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling will be appealed, said Alan Caplan, lawyer for a San  
Francisco consumer advocate who sued on behalf of the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Caplan said he was at a loss to understand the ruling, because  
the right of free speech does not bar lawsuits over fraudulent 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Vada Manager, spokesman for the Beaverton, Ore.-based company,  
said Nike's statements were not the type of advertising regulated 
by the California law, and also were constitutionally protected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the company can redirect those critical resources that  
were diverted by the lawsuit towards its initiatives for 
continuously updating factory working conditions around the 
world,'' the company's chairman and CEO, Philip H. Knight, said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it had acted during the past year to set a  
minimum age of 18 for workers in Asian footwear factories, increase 
wages 40 percent for entry-level factory workers in Indonesia, and 
improved factory air quality by substituting water-based adhesives 
in the assembly process. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Nike's products are made by 450,000 workers in Asian  
factories run by contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said Nike has falsely stated that it guarantees a  
``living wage'' to all workers; that its workers in Southeast Asia 
make twice the local minimum wage, get free meals and health care 
and are protected from corporal punishment; and that it complies 
with government rules on wages, hours and health and safety 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said Nike's self-descriptions were refuted in  
studies by labor and human rights groups, news media investigations 
and a January 1997 audit by the firm of Ernst &AMP; Young, commissioned 
by Nike. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit, leaked to reporters in November 1997, found that  
employees in a large Vietnam shoe factory were exposed to 
cancer-causing toluene and suffered a high incidence of respiratory 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike's publicized Code of Conduct was intended ``to entice  
consumers who do not want to purchase products made in 
sweatshops,'' the lawsuit said. It said Nike's statements should be 
considered the equivalent of advertising claims. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the lawsuit, Nike said each of the claims had  
been previously addressed ``through penalties, new investments in 
training and equipment designed to improve the workplace.''

<HEADLINE> CBS Posts $1 Million Quarterly Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. posted a $1 million fourth-quarter  
loss on severance payments to its former chief and losses from 
selling stakes in two cable networks, reversing an $861 million 
profit from a year earlier on gains from selling industrial 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the one-time gains or costs in both periods, CBS also  
reported Friday that it had stronger profits from continuing 
operations in the latest quarter. Growth in its radio and outdoor 
advertising business offset lower television results, despite the 
NFL's successful return to the CBS network. 
</P>
<P>
	The profits from continuing operations exceeded Wall Street  
expectations. CBS shares rose 31 1/4 cents to close at $36.12 1/2 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS said its per-share results were break-even for the quarter  
ended Dec. 31. In the same period a year earlier, CBS earned $1.25 
per share, but the profits came from an $871 million gain on the 
sale of the former Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s remaining 
industrial businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue jumped 22 percent to $1.79 billion from $1.47 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest quarter included $7 million in severance payments to  
former CBS chairman and chief executive Michael Jordan, who stepped 
down in October -- earlier than expected -- after transforming the 
former Westinghouse into a pure media company. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS also lost $7 million on sales of stakes in two cable  
networks. CBS sold its half of CBS Eye on People to Discovery 
Communications Inc. and sold a controlling stake in the 
Spanish-language news channel CBS TeleNoticias to Mexico's Grupo 
Medcom SA. 
</P>
<P>
	But excluding all special items, profits from continuing  
operations were $17 million, or 2 cents per share, in the 1998 
quarter, compared to a loss of $10 million, or 1 cent per share, in 
the 1997 period.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Policeman Shot To Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A man being arrested in a prostitution sting  
opened fire on police Friday, killing one officer and critically 
wounding another. The gunman was fatally shot by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Benny Napoleon, holding back tears, said he was  
shocked that so much violence would grow out of an arrest that 
probably would have led to no more than a fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those things that none of us can understand,''  
he said. ``We're trying to find how who this guy is and why he 
would react this way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sting involved a female officer posing as a prostitute on  
the street. When a car pulled over, five backup officers moved in 
to make an arrest. A passenger in the car got out and shot two of 
the officers in the face, the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Richard Scalf, 26, a three-year veteran of the force,  
died after being shot in the back, Napoleon said. Officer Diaz 
Graves, 30, a four-year veteran, was shot in the chest, abdomen and 
side of the head. He was in critical condition and expected to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman, Darryl Gates, 21, of Detroit died of multiple  
gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Harrington, a 37-year resident of the neighborhood, said  
the area is known for prostitution but he didn't consider it a 
serious problem.

<HEADLINE> Amoco To Cut 1,500 Chicago Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- BP Amoco said it expects to cut 1,500 management  
and non-management jobs in the Chicago area in the next 18 months, 
eliminating almost one in four positions here. 
</P>
<P>
	The move stems from the merger of British Petroleum Co. and  
Amoco Corp. last year and from the continuing slump in world oil 
prices, the company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the cuts will be at the company's downtown Chicago  
skyscraper, the former Amoco headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based conglomerate said the majority of those losing  
jobs will be gone by the end of April. But a few decisions won't be 
made until early 2000, said BP Amoco spokeswoman Vicky Kastory. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the company promised that 200 jobs will move  
to Chicago over the next 18 months, and it pledged to make Chicago 
the world headquarters for its chemical operations, which would 
bring more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes six months after the company suggested  
that the merger would result in Chicago gaining jobs. But 
continuing low energy prices have helped turned an expected gain 
into a loss, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been struck by a continuation of low worldwide oil  
prices. There will be some job reductions as a result of reduced 
spending (and) as a result of low energy prices,'' Kastory said. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco employs close to 6,300 people in the Chicago area

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Office on Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has turned down advisers'  
suggestion that he create a permanent commission on race relations, 
preferring to set up a new office in the White House to focus on 
racial issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House Office on the President's Initiative for One  
America will try to keeping alive the work begun under the yearlong 
race campaign that ended last September. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president and his staff have taken a long, hard look at  
the best way to build on the advisory board and the initiative to 
date, and made the decision that ... the best way to move forward 
was to develop this new office so that this kind of work can 
continue both for the next two years and the years beyond,'' White 
House press secretary Joe Lockhart said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was naming deputy public liaison director Ben Johnson to  
head the office, the officials said. In his current capacity, 
Johnson serves as a liaison to minority communities. He could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of South Bend, Ind., Johnson joined the Clinton White  
House in 1993 in the Office of Public Liaison. In the 1970s, he 
served as director of consumer programs for President Carter. He 
also was administrator for the District of Columbia's Business 
Regulation Administration from 1983-87. 
</P>
<P>
	The office he will head would be set up similarly to the White  
House Office for Women's Initiatives and Outreach, which Clinton 
established in 1995 to ensure better outreach to women and smooth 
handling of their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	In delivering its findings, Clinton's advisory board proposed  
creating a White House office on race to work in conjunction with a 
permanent commission. One official said the fact that the president 
chose to set up an office on a smaller scale did not mean the 
effort is being given a lower priority. 
</P>
<P>
	The race board suggested last June that Clinton should establish  
a race panel patterned after the Council of Economic Advisers. The 
council consists of three full-time, paid government employees in a 
position to get to the president quickly on pressing economic 
matters. The members must be confirmed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The race office will have a staff of about four people. Its  
director would ensure that policies that tie directly to racial 
issues on the president's agenda are ``up and running,'' one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, the official said one of the office's first  
duties will be to promote items in Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget 
plan that will have major impact in minority communities, such as 
his education proposals and his request for increased spending on 
enforcement of anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The office also will have a role in advancing the race report  
that Clinton expects to release this spring.

<HEADLINE> Unmapped Fault Uncovered in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALY CITY, Calif. (AP) -- A geologist has discovered a new  
earthquake fault in the seaside cliffs just south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The fault, though unknown until recently, has been around for a  
long time. It's not clear if it is active or not, geologist Scott 
Kieffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kieffer was mapping the Mussel Rock area of Daly City last fall  
when he roped down the side of a cliff to examine layers of 
sedimentary rock and found clear evidence of a quake across a 
previously unmapped fault. 
</P>
<P>
	He dated the sedimentary layer around the rupture to 120,000  
years ago, which means the state Division of Mines and Geology 
would classify it as inactive. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fault would be considered active if it has generated a  
quake as recently as 11,000 years ago, and would require urgent 
work to survey its seismic danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major fault trace, no question about it,'' said  
Nicholas Sitar, a University of California, Berkeley, engineer who 
has examined Kieffer's evidence.

<HEADLINE> IRS Says `Dead' Taxpayers Are OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of taxpayers who have received W-2  
forms indicating that they're dead need not check their pulses. 
They're very much alive, and so are the forms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service announced Friday that taxpayers can  
go ahead and send those forms in with their returns without 
correcting them. If they've been corrected, that's OK too. 
</P>
<P>
	The errors, which cropped up in places from Saratoga Springs,  
N.Y., to El Paso, Texas, appeared in Box 15 of the W-2 -- the form 
that describes annual earnings, how much taxes were paid, and so 
on. Box 15 is used to indicate such items as deferred compensation, 
pension plan coverage, or a deceased person. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, according to the IRS, when the number of items in  
Box 15 was reduced from seven to five, some employment tax software 
developers overlooked this change or used printing specifications 
that gave incorrect spacing between the items. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is not related to the Year 2000 computer glitch, IRS  
spokesman Don Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, reports began to surface that thousands of  
employees around the country had an ``X'' printed in the box 
showing them as deceased. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the local funeral directors even called me up to offer  
a special group rate,'' said J. Michael O'Connell, mayor of 
Saratoga Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Other places were the mistake was reported were Dickson, Okla.;  
Muscogee County, Ga.; New Mexico State University; and Fargo, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS isn't sure how many taxpayers have been affected, but  
officials say the errors won't affect the processing of the tax 
return or the amount of any refund. The IRS says it will not impose 
any penalties and employers don't have to notify the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the IRS later matches employers' W-2 data with employees'  
tax returns, it will take steps to avoid contacting taxpayers about 
this matter,'' an IRS statement says. 
</P>
<P>
	But just to make sure people don't panic, the IRS adds that  
companies should ``alert their employees to the error and reassure 
them'' that everything is all right.

<HEADLINE> 'Doonesbury' Follows Day Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Will Chase lose his shirt -- and suspenders?  
</P>
<P>
	The risky world of day trading in stocks has become so popular  
among ordinary investors that the ``Doonesbury'' comic strip is 
chronicling the day-by-day progress of the buttoned-down Chase. 
</P>
<P>
	He opened an online day-trading account this week with $10,000 --  
actually a smaller deposit than many day-trading companies require 
of an amateur getting into the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday's episode, Chase was ready to buy shares of  
imaginary company E-Bid, a new business ``with only one product -- 
its own stock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His adrenaline rush was palpable. A day earlier, he masked his  
fear when the Nasdaq Stock Market dropped 63 points and he was 
suddenly down 40 percent on his trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Day trading has attracted a small but growing breed of  
investors, many of whom have abandoned their regular jobs for the 
prospect of quick riches. Day traders seek out stocks solely for 
their sharp price swings, buying and selling them quickly to 
capitalize on the short-term movement in price and rarely holding a 
position overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	But securities regulators have expressed concern that some  
day-trading companies, which sell training courses and specialized 
software and provide computer work space to investors, could be 
misleading them about potential profits and causing them to get in 
over their heads. State regulators have stepped up their scrutiny 
of day-trading firms and a handful, particularly in Massachusetts, 
have filed fraud charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're concerned when day trading becomes such a part of the  
culture'' that it features in a popular comic strip, said Marc 
Beauchamp, a spokesman for the North American Securities 
Administrators Association, which represents the state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who are misled about the potential of day trading and  
lose all their money: that's not funny,'' Beauchamp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Levitt, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange  
Commission, warned last week that day trading can be ``highly 
risky'' for Main Street investors, who should engage in it only 
``with funds they can afford to lose.'' He expressed dismay at 
stories he had heard of people putting up their student loan money, 
mortgages or retirement savings to finance their day trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of the day-trading companies acknowledge it's not for  
everyone, but they say it can give financial freedom to ordinary 
people who study and learn trading techniques. They maintain the 
regulators are unfairly tarnishing their industry because of a few 
rogue firms that may have misled investors about what kind of money 
they could make. 
</P>
<P>
	The Electronic Traders Association, which represents day-trading  
companies, said in a statement Thursday it was concerned that many 
people may be undertaking the practice without ``a clear 
understanding of the effort required to become successful and the 
potential risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group issued guidelines for people considering day trading  
and a suggested disclosure statement for companies to provide to 
potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the guidelines: Only money not needed for living or  
retirement should be used to finance day trading, and only ``highly 
disciplined'' people should get into it. 
</P>
<P>
	Does Chase have the aptitude for it? Stay tuned.

<HEADLINE> Doc Says Lewis Told Him of Coke Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A doctor defending himself against a malpractice  
suit in the death of Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis said Lewis 
told him he used cocaine, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gilbert Mudge said that 16 days before Lewis collapsed from  
a heart attack during a 1993 practice, he acknowledged having used 
cocaine, but had stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge, who is being sued by Lewis' widow, Donna Harris-Lewis,  
said he confronted Lewis after reviewing test results that showed 
his heart condition had deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked again, `Have you ever taken cocaine,' and Mr. Lewis  
indicated he had,'' Mudge said in a written response to questions 
by lawyers for Harris-Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I responded, `You have got to stop. Cocaine causes all this,'  
and at that point there was silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis was 27 when he died in the Celtics' practice gym at  
Brandeis University in Waltham on July 27, 1993. The death stunned 
basketball fans who admired him for his basketball skill and 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis contends in her lawsuit that Mudge made a  
``determined effort'' to discount the opinions of a team of 
cardiologists who believed Lewis's heart was seriously damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis previously collapsed during a game, and a team of New  
England Baptist Hospital doctors said he had a life-threatening 
heart ailment and warned that his career was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis transferred to Brigham and Women's Hospital, where a team  
led by Mudge, diagnosed him with a less-harmful neurological 
condition. Mudge said he was optimistic Lewis could play again. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge now says he was prevented from making a proper diagnosis  
because Lewis concealed his cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
	A motion filed Thursday by Mudge's lawyer, William Dailey Jr.,  
seeks to force Northeastern University to turn over documents 
related to drug tests given to Lewis while he was a a student in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing on that motion was scheduled for today.  
</P>
<P>
	The motion includes a sworn deposition from a Northeastern  
student, Wayne Brown, who claimed he snorted and smoked cocaine 
with Lewis at his apartment ``15 or 20 times'' while Lewis was a 
student. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Harley, an attorney representing Harris Lewis, dismissed  
the drug allegations as a diversion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to avoid facing the terrible medical mistake  
that was made by throwing in all this rumor and innuendo,'' Harley 
told the Boston Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	``What caused it, in the final analysis, was irrelevant to  
treating it. The point is if they want to they can distract the 
jury with these kinds of accusations. They hope the jury won't pay 
attention to the medical negligence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge said in court papers that Harris-Lewis, who has denied her  
husband used cocaine, grew agitated when he asked Lewis about 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked whether Mr. Lewis had ever taken drugs and Mrs. Lewis  
became very excited and stated, `Drugs, drugs, drugs. That is all I 
hear. Just because he is not Bird. Don't insult my husband. They 
would never ask Larry Bird about drugs. They just can't get over 
that he is not Larry,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harley confirmed that Harris-Lewis made the comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``You point to a black athlete and say cocaine. Now the onus is  
on him to say no,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless there is a settlement, the malpractice case is expected  
to go to trial in May or June, according to The Boston Globe.

<HEADLINE> Raiders' Bruce Arrested in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Oakland Raiders defensive end Aundray Bruce was  
arrested by Atlanta police and charged with offering an undercover 
police officer $20 for oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest Thursday night came five days after Atlanta Falcons  
safety Eugene Robinson was arrested on a similar solicitation 
charge in Miami the night before the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta police spokesman John Quigley said Bruce, a former  
Falcons first-round NFL draft pick, stopped his rental car on 
Metropolitan Parkway at 9 p.m. Thursday. After he allegedly made 
the offer to the female officer, other officers stopped Bruce and 
arrested him. They also towed away his rental car, Quigley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce was selected No. 1 overall by the Falcons in the 1988  
draft. He left the Falcons in 1991 to play for the Raiders. He now 
lives in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce spent Thursday night at the Atlanta city jail. Quigley  
said officials have often held sex crime suspects in jail for 24 
hours before they are allowed to post bonds.

<HEADLINE> Police Fire On, Kill Unarmed Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An unarmed street peddler with no criminal  
record was shot to death by four officers who fired at him 41 
times, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed Diallo, 22, was killed early Thursday at the door of the  
small apartment he shared with two roommates in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo, who had no criminal record, was unarmed, said a police  
source, speaking on condition of anonymity. His wallet and a beeper 
were found nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no civilian witnesses and the officers involved have  
yet to be interviewed by investigators as requested by the Bronx 
District Attorney's office, which would not comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo's uncle, Mamadou Diallo, described the Guinea native as  
``a very honest guy, a religious guy'' who sold hats, clothing and 
other items on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shoot somebody 30, 40 times,'' said Mamadou Diallo, who  
talked to police after the shooting. ``They tell me this is 
probably (a) police mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo died of multiple gunshot wounds to the torso, said Ellen  
Borakove, spokeswoman for the Medical Examiner's office. The 
medical examiner was still determining how many bullets hit Diallo 
and the direction they were fired from. 
</P>
<P>
	The four plainclothes officers -- assigned to a street crime  
patrol -- were investigating a serial rapist in the area, but it was 
not known if they thought Diallo was a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	The police source said a roommate told investigators Diallo had  
come home at about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, then left again. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after 12:30 a.m., the source said, the police officers  
had contact with a man on Diallo's street, but it wasn't clear if 
it was Diallo. Diallo was shot in his vestibule about 10 minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what happened, because we haven't spoken to  
them, but it looks like one guy panicked and the rest followed 
suit,'' a police official told The New York Times on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the four officers, all assigned to the 43rd Precinct in  
the Bronx, have been involved in prior shooting incidents. Two were 
resolved without criminal charges and the third is still under 
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Help Against Elderly Blindness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists are harnessing light beams to fight  
one of the most insidious problems of aging, providing a ray of 
hope against a creeping blindness that steals vision from the 
center out. 
</P>
<P>
	Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause  
of blindness in people over 50. 
</P>
<P>
	First, fine detail fades. Your crossword puzzle seems OK at a  
glance, until you try focusing on just one word. People's faces 
start to blur. You can't read or drive. Eventually, the worst form 
of AMD causes blindness. 
</P>
<P>
	Now scientists are trying an experimental light-activated drug  
to help preserve patients' eyesight. Visudyne is not a cure, 
cautioned Dr. Neil Bressler of Johns Hopkins University. Nothing 
can restore already-lost vision. 
</P>
<P>
	But for early-stage patients, ``we may be able to slow down  
vision loss, or reduce the chance of (AMD) costing them any more 
vision,'' said Bressler, who heads a nationwide Visudyne study. 
</P>
<P>
	And the National Eye Institute, worried that the graying of  
America means millions more people are at risk, is pouring $25 
million into research to curb the disease. Among the work: 
</P>
<P>
	--An ongoing trial of 4,800 people is comparing whether vitamins  
C, E or beta carotene or the mineral zinc can stop the progression 
of AMD-caused vision loss. 
</P>
<P>
	--A government-funded study is about to enroll 350 people to see  
if a new type of surgery to remove a tuft of disease-caused blood 
vessels could stop the blindness. 
</P>
<P>
	--In March, the government starts a third study to see if  
removing drusen -- yellow deposits on the retina that are a 
precursor of AMD -- from people's eyes can actually prevent the 
disease from ever striking. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD is a budding epidemic, warns institute director Carl Kupfer:  
Some 1.7 million sufferers are legally blind already, and the aging 
population means some 6 million more could go blind in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The macula is the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the center  
of the retina. Two types of AMD destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dry'' AMD, which accounts for 90 percent of cases, slowly  
breaks down the macula's light-sensitive cells. There is no 
treatment. But the damage occurs very slowly so victims only 
gradually notice a blind spot in their central vision and don't 
completely lose sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wet'' AMD is rarer but much worse. New blood vessels form  
behind the retina, leaking onto the macula and rapidly destroying 
it. First, straight lines appear wavy. Then sufferers suddenly 
develop a central blind spot that often progresses to blindness 
within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The research focuses on wet AMD.  
</P>
<P>
	There is one treatment, a laser that cauterizes the blood  
vessels. But only 15 percent of patients qualify because, if the 
blood vessels are in the wrong spot, the laser can hurt more than 
it helps. 
</P>
<P>
	Visudyne works differently. The light-activated drug is injected  
into the arm and then migrates into the eye's abnormal blood 
vessels. Shine in a non-burning beam of light and the drug 
``switches on,'' eliminating those blood vessels without hurting 
surrounding tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study of 600 patients, 61 percent given Visudyne had stable  
or slightly improved vision after a year, vs. 45 percent of 
patients given a placebo. The study is continuing another year, 
important because more-rapid vision loss usually occurs in wet 
AMD's second year. 
</P>
<P>
	But manufacturer QLT Phototherapeutics is about to ask  
government permission to sell Visudyne based on the early data, 
approval that Bressler expects by 2000. Until then, the Visudyne 
trials are full -- anxious patients will have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, people over 40 need regular eye exams, with their eyes  
dilated, to hunt early disease signs. AMD sufferers and those at 
risk should ask an ophthalmologist about new treatments, including 
studies like the eye institute's, Bressler advised. 
</P>
<P>
	A small radiology study presented last month suggests two weeks  
of low-dose radiation might help wet AMD, too, although Kupfer 
cautioned that better studies are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	And Kupfer warned AMD patients to beware dubious treatment  
offers like ``blood filtering'' that cost thousands of dollars but 
have little, if any, scientific backing. ``It's a terrible 
indication of how people are grasping'' at hope, he sighed.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Names Award After Aaron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Twenty-five years after he broke Babe Ruth's home  
run record, baseball is naming an award after Hank Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, honored at a gala dinner attended by President Clinton on  
Friday night, will have his name on an award presented annually to 
the best hitter in each league. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1999, the award will go to the hitter with the most hits,  
home runs and RBIs, commissioner Bud Selig said. In future years, 
it will be selected by a panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clearly for the best all-around hitter, not just for the  
power hitter,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, who turned 65 Friday, finished with 755 homers. He hit  
No. 715 in April 1974 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, and felt 
snubbed because commissioner Bowie Kuhn skipped the game. Aaron 
also received hate mail as he approached Ruth's record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say if race had anything to do with it and why I  
didn't get the recognition,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as recently as five years ago, Aaron said much more could  
have been done to publicize the sport by promoting the 715th home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the sad thing about the whole thing,'' he said in 1994.  
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has been criticized for its record on minority hiring  
and Selig says the sport must do more. In its last report, issued 
in 1996, baseball said 9 percent of front-office employees on the 
28 teams are black and 8 percent of on-field employees are black. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, a senior vice president with the Atlanta Braves, said was  
excited about the award. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hank Aaron Award is finally an honor that's worthy of your  
achievements,'' said Time Warner vice chairman Ted Turner, the 
longtime head of the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	The $500-a-plate gala, attended by Hall of Famers Ernie Banks  
and Frank Robinson, Sammy Sosa and heavyweight champion Evander 
Holyfield, was expected to raise more than $1 million for the 
Chasing The Dream Foundation that Aaron and his wife started in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation provide grants to children ages 9-12 to help them  
develop talents for which they have shown an ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``By April we'll have 44 kids in the program and eventually have  
755,'' Aaron said gathering, which included about a dozen of the 
children currently benefiting from the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron hit his 715th home run on April 8, 1974, off Al Downing.  
Downing, who lives in California, was invited to attend the gala 
but was unable to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has an ear infection,'' Aaron said. ``He was coming. But he  
did send me a nice letter.''

<HEADLINE> Tarasov Gets 19-8 at Budapest Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Maxim Tarasov, the 1992 Olympic pole  
vault champion, cleared 19 feet, 8 inches Friday night in the 
Hungarian Indoor Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Russian dominated a field that included another  
Olympic champion, Jean Galfione of France, as well as the defending 
world and European indoor champions, Igor Potapovich of Kazakstan 
and Tim Lobinger of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarasov, one of only eight men to have reached the 19-8 mark,  
has now achieved it indoors and out. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Daniel Komen had announced he would try to break the  
men's 2,000-meter world record, set by Ethiopia's Haile 
Gebrselassie last year, he did not even win the race. 
</P>
<P>
	He was overtaken in the last five yards by Morocco's Adil El  
Kaouch. Komen ran the distance almost 6 seconds outside the world 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Jackson of Britain won the 60-meter hurdles in 7.49  
seconds and was second in the 50-meter hurdles. The 31-year-old 
Jackson, who holds the world 110-meter record, is racing indoors to 
prepare for the world championships outdoors in Seville next 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 800 meters, Natalya Tsiganova, 27, of Russia  
clocked 1 minute, 58.95 seconds, the best time of the year so far. 
She defeated defending European indoor champion Ludmila Formanova 
of the Czech Republic and Africa championship runner-up Hasna 
Benhassi of Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's sprint hurdles, Russian Olympic and world  
runner-up Irina Shishigina won both the 50- and 60-meters, pushing 
another Olympic runner-up, Brigitta Bukovec of Slovenia, to second 
place in both events.

<HEADLINE> Feds Want in on Student Loan Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government got into the business  
of offering student loans directly to collegians five years ago. 
But private loans still predominate and the Clinton administration 
wants to boost the government program. 
</P>
<P>
	Both types of loans are actually administered by colleges.  
However, two-thirds of those institutions choose to offer mainly 
the private loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration budget proposal for next year wants  
to give its own program a 25 percent raise, up $115 million to $735 
million, and cut at least $1.4 billion from the private lenders' 
federal subsidy. The government has subsidized private loans for 
more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican lawmakers -- who consider the government program  
unnecessary -- say there's little chance they'll help give the 
government an edge in the $32 billion market for student borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to happen,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa.,  
who chairs the House Education and Workforce Committee. ``They just 
hope they can be the largest bank in the world ... even though they 
couldn't handle it. It's all about control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lenders say the administration is worried about the government  
program because it's not as successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``This proposal favors bureaucrats over students,'' said Mark  
Cannon, who directs the Coalition for Student Loan Reform, a group 
of state and nonprofit loan administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the government program -- created to simplify the loan  
process -- is partly responsible for new popularity of the private 
loans, said Larry Zaglaniczny, a lobbyist for the National 
Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. The 
competition prompted private lenders to begin sending out checks 
sooner and allowing officials to process loans online. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had an upstart competitor that shook up an industry that  
was fairly somnolent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colleges have become happier with the private lenders, Education  
Department surveys show: Five years ago, 89 percent of 
government-loan schools were satisfied, but that fell to 64 percent 
in 1997. Satisfaction among private-lender schools rose from 68 
percent in 1994 to 82 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Private loans are backed by a government subsidy and guarantee.  
Advocates say they have the staff and management to handle larger 
numbers of loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Congress crafted a law -- which Clinton signed -- that  
made all loans less expensive for student borrowers, in part by 
capping the interest rate both private lenders and the government 
could charge at 8.25 percent. As part of that law, private lenders 
got increases in government payments, their incentive to enter the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration opposed the increased payments but agreed to  
them to reach a compromise with the Republican-led Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got a package and you are trying to work out an  
agreement and it includes all of the pieces,'' said David A. 
Longanecker, the Education Department assistant secretary for 
higher education. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the Clinton proposal to cut private lenders'  
subsidies, along with its reductions in traditional campus-based 
aid such as Pell Grants, would unfairly rob higher education in 
favor of the president's elementary and secondary school 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal education officials are defending the proposals.  
</P>
<P>
	Longanecker said private, nonprofit lenders are being targeted  
for cuts because their loans already are financed by tax-exempt 
bonds. The department also wants to cut government payments to 
private lenders for collecting debts or soliciting business, and 
says the cuts should hurt only the most inefficient of private 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The program is simply costing the federal government more than  
it should cost,'' Longanecker said.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Holds at 28-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American economy entered the new year on a  
tear, keeping the unemployment rate at a 28-year low of 4.3 percent 
and pushing the jobless rates for blacks and Hispanics to their 
lowest on record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great time to be an American worker,'' said economist  
Bill Cheney of John Hancock in Boston. ``The job market, except for 
manufacturing, remains remarkably vibrant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government's first major economic report for this year,  
issued Friday by the Labor Department, showed that 245,000 new jobs 
were created in sales, construction, computers and other fields. 
That put January's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate at the 
level achieved in December, last April and, before that, in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate for whites was unchanged at 3.8 percent in  
January. But the rates for blacks, 7.8 percent, and Hispanics, 6.6 
percent, fell to their lowest levels since the government began 
tracking them in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in employers' payrolls was nearly 100,000 more than  
expected by economists and came on top of a 298,000 increase in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sluggish (corporate) earnings and weak growth in the rest of  
the world should eventually temper the U.S. economy,'' said 
economist Gerald D. Cohen of Merrill Lynch. ``However, that is not 
yet evident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, along with private reports on auto and retail chain  
sales and manufacturing activity, shows the U.S. economy last month 
had considerable momentum after growing during the final three 
months of 1998 at the fastest rate in 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	It raises questions about how much longer the Federal Reserve  
can resist raising short-term interest rates. At Fed policy-makers' 
most recent meeting, this week, they decided to hold rates 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	But Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan expressed concern in  
congressional testimony last month that labor shortages would 
propel faster wage increases, which in turn would drive up 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said she wasn't worried about  
a rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no signs of inflation. ... Productivity is in line  
with real wage gains. That's exactly the kind of balance you want 
to see,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's report showed the average hourly wages of  
nonsupervisory workers rising 6 cents in January to $13.04. It was 
the largest monthly increase since August. Over the past year, 
hourly earnings have increased 50 cents, or 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said consumer  
borrowing advanced at a strong 6.9 percent annual rate in December, 
to $1.34 trillion. The gain was led by auto loans, up at 15.9 
percent rate, the fastest in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	January job gains were led by services. Engineering and  
management continued their strong growth, with payrolls rising by 
27,000 and 17,000 jobs, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance and real estate each added 11,000 jobs. Retail  
employment rose by 30,000. Payrolls increased by 13,000 at trucking 
firms, 11,000 at communications companies and 36,000 in local 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The booming construction industry added a seasonally adjusted  
15,000 jobs even though severe weather in the Midwest and Northeast 
halted some work. Since September, construction has added 184,000 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, job losses continued in manufacturing. Payrolls fell by  
13,000 jobs, bringing the drop since March to 285,000, reflecting 
the loss of export sales to troubled economies, principally in 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	One bright spot was lumber and wood-product factories, which  
added 8,000 jobs, reflecting the brisk pace of construction, and 
auto manufacturing, up 6,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mining reported a drop of 9,000 jobs, reflecting the impact of  
low prices on oil production. 
</P>
<P>
	Employment gains in health services -- 6,000 -- were weak. Gains  
at medical offices were offset by a drop in home health care. 
Hospital employment was unchanged.

<HEADLINE> VW Voluntarily Recalls Two Models </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Volkswagen is recalling its 1999  
Jetta and Golf four-door models because a type of sound-absorbing 
material used in the doors might have been improperly installed and 
could ignite. 
</P>
<P>
	The voluntary recall involves about 11,585 Jettas and Golfs in  
the United States and 1,385 Jettas sold in Canada, VW said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seat belt tension system, designed to provide extra  
protection in severe collisions, creates heat and could potentially 
ignite the material if it has been damaged by improper 
installation, VW said. 
</P>
<P>
	No accidents or injuries have resulted from the problem, and  
only one reported incident in a controlled test environment, the 
automaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of affected vehicles will be notified by mail. Dealers  
will remove the material, which is designed to reduce sound at 
higher speeds, from the door pillars. All work will be completed at 
no cost to the customer.

<HEADLINE> BMW May Oust Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Shares of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  
rose 3 percent in early trading in Frankfurt amid anticipation that 
BMW's supervisory board would replace chief Bernd Pischetsrieder. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent media reports have fed rumors that the board will decide  
to oust Pischetsrieder because of years losses at the company's 
Rover unit in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW, which has declined to comment on the reports, said an  
announcement on the outcome of a supervisory board meeting was 
expected this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially, the supervisory board met to discuss plans for  
closer cooperation between the BMW and Rover brands to boost 
Rover's profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has invested more than 6 billion marks ($3.5 billion) in  
Rover since it acquired the British automaker in 1994. 
Pischetsrieder, an engineer who took BMW's top job in 1993, 
orchestrated the Rover takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect Rover to post a pretax loss of around 1 billion  
marks ($590 million) for 1998, including provisions for the work 
flexibility pact Rover sealed with the unions in December. 
</P>
<P>
	But BMW shares have risen this week, a trend analysts attributed  
to market hopes that Pischetsrieder's departure could open the way 
for BMW to join the current wave of carmarker alliances. 
Pischetsrieder has consistently ruled out BMW as a partner in any 
merger or joint-venture. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW is seen as an attractive takeover target, particularly for a  
U.S. car company, due to its strong position in the European luxury 
car market. 
</P>
<P>
	A Belgian newspaper, La Libre Belgique, on Thursday quoted the  
head of General Motors Corp.'s European operations, Michael Burns, 
as expressing a possible interest in BMW. However, John Mueller, a 
GM spokesman in Detroit dismissed the report, saying: ``There has 
been no discussion with BMW management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BMW was one of the likely targets mentioned when it became known  
that Ford Motor Co. was seeking a European partner. Ford announced 
this month that it was buying Volvo's car division instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Also last year, Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech floated the  
idea of joint ownership of BMW and Volkswagen, but BMW dismissed 
such a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	But a changing of the top brass at BMW wouldn't necessarily mean  
a change in merger strategy, since the Quandt family, which owns 42 
percent of the company, would still have to approve. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those rumored as in line to replace Pischetsrieder are BMW  
board member Wolfgang Reitzle, who is in charge of research and 
development and enjoys the reputation of a corporate visionary, but 
reportedly faces resistance from workers' representatives on the 
supervisory board. 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates mentioned in the media include BMW chief  
financial officer Volker Doppelfeld and Porsche chairman Wendelin 
Wiedeking. 
</P>
<P>
	Rover union leaders also fear Reitzle might want to close the  
British plant in Birmingham -- despite a deal last year on new 
working practices and 2,500 redundancies, which seemed to have 
secured the factory's future.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 6 in Early Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened slightly higher. The  
Dow Jones industrial average is ahead six points in today's early 
going. Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold an 
eight-to-seven lead over decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up ten points and the S&AMP;P 500  
Index is up two points. 
</P>

	Perhaps the big item for the market today is the first day of  
trading for one of the biggest initial public offerings ever. 
Delphi Automotive begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange,

</P>
<P>
	It appears there will be little reaction to this morning's  
employment report from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said the unemployment rate held steady last  
month at 4.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ritts Resigns As LPGA Commissioner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Along with bringing women's golf almost double the television  
coverage, Jim Ritts guided the LPGA Tour through some potentially 
turbulent times in his three years as commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	His departure will bring the LPGA its fifth commissioner in just  
over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In a surprising announcement Friday, Ritts said he was stepping  
down in 45 days to become chief operating officer of Digital 
Entertainment Network Inc., a company that delivers 
television-quality programming to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritts will be succeeded by Ty Votaw, a corporate lawyer who  
joined the LPGA in 1991 and had been the vice president of business 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was really a difficult decision because of my passion for  
the LPGA,'' Ritts said from LPGA headquarters in Daytona Beach, 
Fla. ``But everybody knows what's occurring with the Internet. This 
is really a chance to maybe shape that part of the world in 
entertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ritts said he decided to take the new job on Sunday. He mailed  
overnight letters to every player Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it surprised everybody,'' Dottie Pepper said. ``I  
guess you could say the LPGA can keep a lid on leaks a lot better 
than the government. It sounds to me like Jim is going back into 
the field where he came from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came on the final day of voting for sweeping  
changes in the criteria for the LPGA Hall of Fame, which has been 
in the works for 14 years. Also, the LPGA recently signed up a 
development tour -- similar to the Nike Tour in men's golf -- that 
was one of Ritts' projects when he became commissioner in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But his legacy will be television. The LPGA had only 19 events  
televised in 1995, compared to 33 this year. As a result, purses 
increased nearly 50 percent during his tenure, from $24.4 million 
in 1995 to $36.2 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``His vision and marketing savvy have propelled the LPGA to the  
forefront of women's sports,'' said Andrew Shepard, chairman of the 
LPGA Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritts wasn't popular with all the players, and several longtime  
LPGA employees left during his tenure. But even Pepper, who said 
she didn't always see eye-to-eye with Ritts, said he was a 
steadying influence during some choppy times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all went through transition,'' she said. ``From a stability  
standpoint, Jim was there for an important part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ritts came to the LPGA in 1996 after serving as president for  
network affairs at Channel One Communications, where he worked with 
Neuman and Edward Winter, now the chief marketing officer for DEN. 
</P>
<P>
	He also spent six years with the New York advertising agency of  
Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, Inc., where at age 27 he became its 
youngest vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we are in the beginning stages of a communication,  
information and cultural revolution, perhaps only seen previously 
during the Industrial Revolution,'' Ritts said. ``I am not willing 
to sit on the sidelines while these momentous changes unfold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, the LPGA went through some big changes during his  
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the increase in television exposure -- a record 238 hours  
last year -- came in an agreement with Mercury to show as many as 10 
events on ESPN. He also managed to replace title sponsors whenever 
the LPGA lost them. 
</P>
<P>
	His arrival coincided with the emergence of foreign stars on the  
LPGA Tour such as Annika Sorenstam, Karrie Webb and Se Ri Pak. 
Along with more television, Ritts launched the tour's first 
national advertising campaign to promote its players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the places I've been, the LPGA experience has been the  
one I treasure and value the most,'' Ritts said. ``I feel very much 
in my heart that we left it better than we found it. And we've left 
it in very good hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Votaw, 37, is the fifth LPGA commissioner since 1988 when John  
Laupheimer resigned. He was replaced by William Blue, who lasted 
one year and turned the tour over to Charlie Meacham. 
</P>
<P>
	Meacham, who retired after 1995, is the one who brought Votaw to  
the LPGA in 1991 as a general counsel and special assistant to the 
commissioner. Through the years, Votaw has worked on tournament 
sponsorship and television negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows the LPGA from the inside out,'' said Cindy McCurdy,  
president of the LPGA executive committee. ``We could have spent 
months and months looking, but I know we would not find a better 
candidate than Ty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The LPGA also said it would restructure its front office by  
creating a new position -- chief operating officer -- to assist 
Votaw.

<HEADLINE> Columbia Gives Writers Some Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Top Hollywood writers brokered a deal with  
Columbia Pictures that gives them a percentage of movie profits, an 
agreement that could rile rival studios and pressure them to adopt 
similar plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Studios historically have resisted giving writers percentages of  
a movie's gross receipts. Top writers can get $1 million to $2 
million for a script and the Columbia deal would give them another 
2 percent of the picture's gross. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when studios already sweating out a shrinking bottom  
line as they pay big bucks to actors directors and producers, 
Columbia's rivals likely will have to come up with a comparable 
plan to attract top writers. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal caught other studios by surprise and executives  
declined requests Friday for interviews, saying it was too early to 
determine the impact of the Columbia deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I imagine it will irk them at first, but on reflection I would  
hope not that they would feel that way,'' Daniel Petrie Jr., 
president of the Writers Guild of America west, said Friday. ``It's 
more than a deal about money, it's about dignity. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who are sophisticated about the business know the  
importance of the screenwriter. But I feel for the public at large, 
and maybe more shortsighted people in the business, writers are 
looked down on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 40 percent of a film's gross can go to actors, so 2  
percent isn't insignificant, a rival studio executive, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, told Daily Variety. 
</P>
<P>
	``This comes at a time when profitability is under siege in the  
movie business. So I ask you, `Where are they getting the money?' 
With stars and directors taking points, there aren't any additional 
ones to give away,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of more than 30 top writers approached other studios  
with the plan. Columbia, a unit of Japan's Sony Corp., was the only 
one that agreed to talk, and the discussions were kept confidential 
until Thursday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The writers came to explore collaboratively ways of justifying  
writers getting what they've always been denied,'' Columbia TriStar 
Motion Picture Group Vice Chairman Gareth Wigan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The writers represent the cream of the 8,500-member Writers  
Guild of America, including Eric Roth (``Forrest Gump''), Tom 
Schulman (``Dead Poets Society''), Ron Bass (``Rain Man,'' ``My 
Best Friend's Wedding''), Nicholas Kazan (``Reversal of Fortune'') 
and Frank Pierson (``Dog Day Afternoon''). 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is very specific about who's entitled to a percentage  
of the gross. Among them, writers must be getting $750,000-plus per 
script, must have an Oscar or WGA award nomination, or sold a 
speculative script for more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 writers fall into this category, Petrie said.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, the writers under the Columbia pact will deliver  
one script, an original screenplay, an adaptation, or a rewrite, to 
Columbia within the next three years. A writer receiving sole 
screen credit is guaranteed 2 percent of gross box office receipts, 
or if there is co-writing screen credit, 1 percent of gross box 
office receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	The writers can either commit to one of five projects the studio  
proposes or give Columbia their own idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The gross receipts are calculated after the studio recoups its  
production, marketing and distribution costs. With the average 
movie costing about $60 million, if it were to earn $200 million in 
box office receipts, a writer who receives sole screen credit would 
get $2.8 million on top of the initial writer's fee.

<HEADLINE>  Serbs Refuse To Let KLA Board Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbian authorities refused to let  
Kosovo Albanian rebels fly to France today, jeopardizing the start 
of peace talks supposed to begin outside Paris on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	French envoy Jacques Huntzinger said Serbs wouldn't allow the  
four rebel representatives to enter the Pristina airport to catch 
their plane because two of them didn't have passports. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Kosovo Albanian delegates refused to go without the  
Kosovo Liberation Army representatives. The non-KLA delegates 
returned to the provincial capital Pristina after the standoff 
became clear. 
</P>
<P>
	International monitors were trying to persuade the Serbs to let  
the rebels go, but chances of arranging a flight appeared dim as 
darkness fell late today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks as if it is off for tonight,'' said one of the  
delegates, Rexhep Qosja. 
</P>
<P>
	The airport stalemate came only a day after the Serbs grudgingly  
accepted participation in the talks in Rambouillet, France, which 
are intended to work out a political settlement to end 11 months of 
war in the separatist province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Balkan Contact Group -- representing the United  
States and European powers who are sponsoring peace talks -- 
appealed in strong terms to government officials to drop their 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been putting strong pressure on the FRY (Federal  
Republic of Yugoslavia) authorities to resolve this and allow the 
Kosovo Albanian delegation to travel,'' said a spokesman for the 
British Foreign Ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Together with his French colleague, our ambassador in Belgrade  
has called on the deputy prime minister and the foreign ministry. 
Contact Group ambassadors will be making further representations 
until this is resolved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An official for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in  
Europe, which runs the Kosovo monitoring mission, was even more 
blunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbs will be held accountable if the Ramouillet talks do  
not go forward,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief mediator in the talks, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill,  
said negotiators would insist the delegation be allowed to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's critical that the entire delegation get to  
Paris. We expect they will leave this evening,'' Hill told 
reporters in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	A C130 aircraft sent by the French government for the delegation  
remained on the tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting between Kosovo Albanian separatists and Serbian and  
Yugoslav forces has killed at least 2,000 people, many of them 
civilians, and made refugees out of hundreds of thousands in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Xhemail Mustafa, a spokesman for the main ethnic  
Albanian party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, insisted that any 
agreement reached in France include provisions for a referendum on 
independence and the stationing of NATO troops -- terms the Serbs 
oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	Making public the composition of the Serbian negotiating team,  
the state-run Tanjug news agency reported that top aides to 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic would attend the talks, along 
with representatives from mostly tiny ethnic communities in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The composition of the Serb government team indicated Serbia  
would insist on its stand that ethnic Albanians, although they form 
90 percent of Kosovo's population, should have the same rights in 
the province as other, much more minor groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian Information Minister Milan Kamnenic told German  
television that Serbia would accept autonomy -- ``even a substantial 
one'' -- for Kosovo and warned that if the talks failed, ``war would 
then be unavoidable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Serbian officials were less conciliatory as they debated  
the peace plan that the United States and its European allies seek 
to impose by Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, international monitors were trying to defuse a  
standoff in the town of Srbica, 18 miles west of Pristina, where 
Serb police were trying to enter rebel territory to investigate a 
robbery at a Serbian Orthodox monastery. 
</P>
<P>
	About eight armored vehicles were prepared to move to the  
monastery of Devic, where thieves made off with farm equipment 
three days ago. KLA rebels refused to let them enter. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas Kern of the OSCE said a firefight broke out Thursday  
when police tried to approach the monastery, home to nine Serbian 
nuns. There were no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Protection of Serb religious sites in this largely Muslim  
province is considered one of the most sensitive issues in the 
conflict.

<HEADLINE> Hamilton's Murphy Wins 500th Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLINTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Tom Murphy has never backed away from a  
challenge. So when he was offered the job as men's basketball coach 
at tiny Hamilton College nearly three decades ago, he took it 
despite a stern warning from the dean. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `You're not going to win a game,''' Murphy recalled  
of that day in 1970. ``I didn't really believe him. You think 
you're a good enough coach that you're going to win half your 
games. I figured we would struggle a little, but I'd always won 
everywhere I'd been and I just figured we were gonna win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He figured wrong. The Continentals lost their first 14 games  
under Murphy, and convincingly. Hamilton allowed more than 100 
points four times and scored a high of only 78 -- in a 30-point loss 
to Hobart. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy quickly learned a valuable lesson as he watched each  
debacle unfold. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden you find out it's players that win and lose  
games, not the coaches,'' said Murphy, who quit a comfortable job 
as basketball coach at Belleville High School in northern New York 
state -- he left with an 83-game winning streak intact -- to take 
over at Hamilton. ``We worked at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That work finally paid off in a game against Utica College,  
which annihilated the Continentals 120-76 in the second game of the 
1970-71 season. Hamilton won the rematch 80-71. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy when you're winning, but when you've got to come in  
here every day and get pounded, it's not much fun,'' Murphy said. 
``I still admire those kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it's a good bet they admire him. After losing 62 of his  
first 78 games at Hamilton and suffering through four miserable 
years, the stubborn Murphy turned the program upside down. Since 
the 1975-76 season, the Continentals have averaged 20 wins a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, at age 60, Murphy won his 500th game at the  
1,650-student liberal arts school in central New York. Murphy, now 
502-216, is just the 12th NCAA Division III coach to achieve that 
milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	The tide began to turn once Murphy got his recruiting in gear.  
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to get your own players in, the people that think  
like you think,'' said Murphy, who was born in Milford, Conn., and 
graduated from Springfield College in 1960 with a degree in 
physical education. ``It took a few years to do that. We got some 
great kids early, and when you have good kids it attracts other 
good kids. We've been able to attract kids who want an education 
and play hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of those is Mike Schantz, an All-American forward who leads  
the Continentals with 24.3 points and 12.7 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the main reasons I came here,'' Schantz said.  
``The thing that's so special about coach Murphy is how hard he 
works with each and every one of us -- from the first guy to the 
14th guy. Everyone's the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The kids and his deep sense of loyalty are what have kept Murphy  
right where he is, even though he's had offers to go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every once in a while, when it gets to the Final Four, you  
start thinking, `Geez, I'd like to do that,''' said Murphy, who 
twice was named Division III coach of the year (in 1979 and 1991) 
by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. ``But then you 
realize the other part of it. Here, you're always dealing with 
quality student-athletes. Every kid graduates. We've graduated 
doctors, lawyers, people that are in business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People that have learned more than basketball from Murphy.  
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I want our kids to realize is just because they  
happen to be able to make a jump shot, they're no different than 
anybody else in this school, be it the kid that plays in the 
orchestra, or one who writes for the student newspaper, or one 
that's interested in poetry or something like that,'' Murphy said. 
``When you graduate, you're all the same, and I think our kids 
understand that. 
</P>
<P>
	``At bigger institutions, athletes get a false sense of their  
importance sometimes, and that's too bad, really. They start 
thinking they're different than other people, and then when they 
get out in the real world they find out all of a sudden they're 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy is something of a rare breed, though. In the 1990-91  
season, the Continentals won their first 26 games, were ranked No. 
1 in the country, then lost their finale, 85-80, to Potsdam State 
for the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, there were no tantrums because it really wasn't that  
big of a deal for Murphy to watch a perfect season disintegrate. It 
was time to do what he was hired to do -- teach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to win every time we go out,'' Murphy said. ``But if  
you lose and you don't learn anything from it, it's bad. If you 
lose and you take something away from it, it's going to make you a 
better person. Things don't always go the way you want them to go 
in life.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton presented the Malcolm  
Baldrige National Quality Award on Thursday to three companies 
whose efforts to improve efficiency have enhanced U.S. 
competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're showing the world that you can be good at what you do  
and happy while you do it,'' Clinton said in a ceremony hosted by 
the Commerce Department at a downtown hotel. ``The employees are 
true stake holders in the progress not only of their companies, but 
of our country, with new ideas and sharing in results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Baldrige awards are named for the commerce secretary who  
died in a riding accident during the Reagan administration. The 
companies that received the award were Boeing Airlift and Tanker 
Programs of Long Beach, Calif.; Solar Turbines Inc., San Diego; 
Texas Nameplate Co., Dallas, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Police Fire On, Kill Unarmed Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An unarmed street peddler with no criminal  
record was shot to death by four officers who fired at him 41 
times, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed Diallo, 22, was killed early Thursday at the door of the  
small apartment he shared with two roommates in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo, who had no criminal record, was unarmed, said a police  
source, speaking on condition of anonymity. His wallet and a beeper 
were found nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no civilian witnesses and the officers involved have  
yet to be interviewed by investigators as requested by the Bronx 
District Attorney's office, which would not comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo's uncle, Mamadou Diallo, described the Guinea native as  
``a very honest guy, a religious guy'' who sold hats, clothing and 
other items on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shoot somebody 30, 40 times,'' said Mamadou Diallo, who  
talked to police after the shooting. ``They tell me this is 
probably (a) police mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo died of multiple gunshot wounds to the torso, said Ellen  
Borakove, spokeswoman for the Medical Examiner's office. The 
medical examiner was still determining how many bullets hit Diallo 
and the direction they were fired from. 
</P>
<P>
	The four plainclothes officers -- assigned to a street crime  
patrol -- were investigating a serial rapist in the area, but it was 
not known if they thought Diallo was a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	The police source said a roommate told investigators Diallo had  
come home at about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, then left again. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after 12:30 a.m., the source said, the police officers  
had contact with a man on Diallo's street, but it wasn't clear if 
it was Diallo. Diallo was shot in his vestibule about 10 minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what happened, because we haven't spoken to  
them, but it looks like one guy panicked and the rest followed 
suit,'' a police official told The New York Times on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the four officers, all assigned to the 43rd Precinct in  
the Bronx, have been involved in prior shooting incidents. Two were 
resolved without criminal charges and the third is still under 
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Weighs Big Ten Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Notre Dame never wanted to just be part of a  
crowd. For years, the Fighting Irish protected their football 
independence so fiercely that they didn't even go to bowl games, 
much less join a conference. 
</P>
<P>
	After today, even that might change.  
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the school's trustees on whether to go ahead  
with negotiations to join the Big Ten affects millions of dollars 
in bowl and TV revenues, recruiting and academics, among other 
things. More importantly, Notre Dame's status as the national, 
Catholic American university could be forever altered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notre Dame's identity nationally is so linked to football that  
people worry if the football program were restricted from a 
national schedule to a regional schedule, that would have an impact 
on the identity,'' said Notre Dame professor Gregory Sterling, who 
favors the move. ``This is touching the nerve center of the 
university.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Tribune said today that the university's officers  
were expected to recommend to the trustees that they decline to 
pursue membership in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, citing ``persons familiar with the thinking of  
board members,'' the trustees are unlikely to vote against the 
wishes of the 10 officers, who include the university president, 
Rev. Edward Malloy, who is also a trustee. 
</P>
<P>
	Even thorugh the decision affects far more than the football  
team, how joining the Big Ten would affect the Irish legacy, which 
includes 11 national championships and great coaches like Knute 
Rockne and Frank Leahy, is of utmost concern to most with ties to 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing we're really addressing here is the extent to  
which the athletic department is advanced or not by virtue of our 
football program changing its status,'' said athletic director Mike 
Wadsworth, who played football for the Irish in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	As an independent, Notre Dame takes home every cent of its gate  
receipts, all of proceeds from bowl payouts and an estimated $7 
million a year in its exclusive TV contract with NBC, which is 
expected to jump to $8 million a year for the 2000-2005 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But as a member of the Big Ten, it would enter a revenue sharing  
program that splits up a portion of each school's gate receipts 
from football and basketball, bowl revenues, TV contracts and 
proceeds from the NCAA basketball tournaments, Big Ten commissioner 
Jim Delany said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of whether you're up or you're down, those bowl  
revenues are there,'' Delany said. ``Whether you in the Rose Bowl 
or not, you get the money. Whether you're on ESPN or not, you get 
money. So, basically it's a shared risk, shared upside, shared 
downside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should the trustees, meeting in London to dedicate a new Notre  
Dame facility there, decide to proceed with talks to join the 
conference, school and Big Ten officials will still have to decide 
several issues. But Delany anticipates no problems to resolve those 
``competitive and financial issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be disappointing if they're not interested in taking the  
next step,'' Delany said. ``It's somewhat implicit that when we 
decided to contact Notre Dame as the first institution to talk to, 
that we felt they would be the best fit for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Problem is, an overwhelming majority of Notre Dame alumni don't  
think the Irish are a good fit for the Big Ten, in part because the 
decision has academic implications as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame, known for its undergraduate programs, trails far  
behind the Big Ten schools in research and graduate programs. Some 
see joining the Big Ten as a way to improve those programs because 
conference affiliation also includes membership in the Committee on 
Institutional Cooperation, the academic arm of the Big Ten that 
includes all 11 conference schools and the University of Chicago. 
It allows the schools to share resources freely. 
</P>
<P>
	But some also see that as a threat to Notre Dame's Catholic  
identity, especially in a conference of secular schools, and some 
Big Ten presidents have grumbled privately that Notre Dame's weak 
graduate programs are not a good fit for the Big Ten, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our brand name is something special. We'd rather be one of one  
than one of 12,'' said Chuck Lennon, executive director of the 
Alumni Association. ``Not that we're better than anybody. We're 
different, and I think that's important because there is a very 
positive feeling about the quality of the Big Ten academically and 
athletically, but it just is not the right mix for us.''

<HEADLINE> Hamilton's Murphy Wins 500th Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLINTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Tom Murphy has never backed away from a  
challenge. So when he was offered the job as men's basketball coach 
at tiny Hamilton College nearly three decades ago, he took it 
despite a stern warning from the dean. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `You're not going to win a game,''' Murphy recalled  
of that day in 1970. ``I didn't really believe him. You think 
you're a good enough coach that you're going to win half your 
games. I figured we would struggle a little, but I'd always won 
everywhere I'd been and I just figured we were gonna win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He figured wrong. The Continentals lost their first 14 games  
under Murphy, and convincingly. Hamilton allowed more than 100 
points four times and scored a high of only 78 -- in a 30-point loss 
to Hobart. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy quickly learned a valuable lesson as he watched each  
debacle unfold. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden you find out it's players that win and lose  
games, not the coaches,'' said Murphy, who quit a comfortable job 
as basketball coach at Belleville High School in northern New York 
state -- he left with an 83-game winning streak intact -- to take 
over at Hamilton. ``We worked at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That work finally paid off in a game against Utica College,  
which annihilated the Continentals 120-76 in the second game of the 
1970-71 season. Hamilton won the rematch 80-71. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy when you're winning, but when you've got to come in  
here every day and get pounded, it's not much fun,'' Murphy said. 
``I still admire those kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it's a good bet they admire him. After losing 62 of his  
first 78 games at Hamilton and suffering through four miserable 
years, the stubborn Murphy turned the program upside down. Since 
the 1975-76 season, the Continentals have averaged 20 wins a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, at age 60, Murphy won his 500th game at the  
1,650-student liberal arts school in central New York. Murphy, now 
502-216, is just the 12th NCAA Division III coach to achieve that 
milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	The tide began to turn once Murphy got his recruiting in gear.  
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to get your own players in, the people that think  
like you think,'' said Murphy, who was born in Milford, Conn., and 
graduated from Springfield College in 1960 with a degree in 
physical education. ``It took a few years to do that. We got some 
great kids early, and when you have good kids it attracts other 
good kids. We've been able to attract kids who want an education 
and play hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of those is Mike Schantz, an All-American forward who leads  
the Continentals with 24.3 points and 12.7 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the main reasons I came here,'' Schantz said.  
``The thing that's so special about coach Murphy is how hard he 
works with each and every one of us -- from the first guy to the 
14th guy. Everyone's the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The kids and his deep sense of loyalty are what have kept Murphy  
right where he is, even though he's had offers to go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every once in a while, when it gets to the Final Four, you  
start thinking, `Geez, I'd like to do that,''' said Murphy, who 
twice was named Division III coach of the year (in 1979 and 1991) 
by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. ``But then you 
realize the other part of it. Here, you're always dealing with 
quality student-athletes. Every kid graduates. We've graduated 
doctors, lawyers, people that are in business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People that have learned more than basketball from Murphy.  
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I want our kids to realize is just because they  
happen to be able to make a jump shot, they're no different than 
anybody else in this school, be it the kid that plays in the 
orchestra, or one who writes for the student newspaper, or one 
that's interested in poetry or something like that,'' Murphy said. 
``When you graduate, you're all the same, and I think our kids 
understand that. 
</P>
<P>
	``At bigger institutions, athletes get a false sense of their  
importance sometimes, and that's too bad, really. They start 
thinking they're different than other people, and then when they 
get out in the real world they find out all of a sudden they're 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy is something of a rare breed, though. In the 1990-91  
season, the Continentals won their first 26 games, were ranked No. 
1 in the country, then lost their finale, 85-80, to Potsdam State 
for the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, there were no tantrums because it really wasn't that  
big of a deal for Murphy to watch a perfect season disintegrate. It 
was time to do what he was hired to do -- teach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to win every time we go out,'' Murphy said. ``But if  
you lose and you don't learn anything from it, it's bad. If you 
lose and you take something away from it, it's going to make you a 
better person. Things don't always go the way you want them to go 
in life.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Less Control of Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost as many Americans say their insurance  
companies play the biggest role in their medical care as those who 
say their doctors call the shots, a new poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Women are more critical than men, with 40 percent saying the  
health care system is in worse shape than it was five years ago, 
says the poll conducted for The Associated Press. The biggest 
complaint was the inability of people to choose their own doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	As these concerns grow, Congress is again considering how to  
give people more control over their own health care without 
substantially increasing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine out of 10 Americans said they were very satisfied or  
somewhat satisfied with their health insurance coverage, the survey 
found. Just over four out of 10 people in the poll said they 
thought their insurance companies had more say over their medical 
coverage than their doctors. Almost half said their doctors had the 
biggest say. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,008 people taken Jan. 29 through Tuesday was done  
by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Making some changes in the system sounds like a good idea to  
Thomas Feagley, a 42-year-old father of three, whose health plan 
required him to change family doctors last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There needs to be an investigation or some kind of fine  
tuning,'' said Feagley, the custodian of athletic fields at schools 
near Huntington, in central Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, he used the team doctor as his family physician for  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have been a happy camper if I could have gotten my  
insurance and kept my doctor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing loss of personal control over health care has left  
Feagley uneasy about the future. He changed doctors a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	When people were asked their biggest concern about health care,  
the most-mentioned complaint was limits on their ability to pick 
the doctor of their choice, cited by 28 percent, followed by 
concerns about cost and quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they have to have guidelines,'' Feagley said, but he  
noted his former doctor treats many others in his family. ``We had 
kind of a family thing going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The findings reflect some continued frustration with managed  
care, such as health maintenance organizations, which have 
controlled health care costs by preventing unnecessary treatment. 
But Americans also worry they may not get treatments that they some 
day need. 
</P>
<P>
	A big movement to HMOs has taken place over the past two  
decades. Most Americans who get insurance from an employer are now 
enrolled in an HMO, said Larry Levitt, director of the changing 
health care marketplace project at the Kaiser Family Foundation in 
Menlo Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many people, there has been a sea change in how they deal  
with their insurance companies,'' Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the people in the AP poll who said they were very satisfied,  
the majority said they felt their doctor had the bigger say in 
their care. Three-fourths of those who said they were dissatisfied 
cited insurers as more likely to have the leading role. 
</P>
<P>
	Older people were among the most satisfied with their health  
care, while well-educated, middle-aged people between the ages of 
35 and 64 were more likely to have concerns with health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt suggested that those with more education probably have  
higher expectations, and middle-aged adults grew up with 
conventional insurance but now must balance family responsibilities 
and the new health care system. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost two-thirds of the people covered by a government plan  
said they were very satisfied with their health insurance coverage, 
said the poll, which had an error margin of plus or minus 3 
percentage points. Levitt said government plans like Medicare often 
offer the freedoms of more conventional insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those who thinks the health care system is getting worse  
is Connie Branch, a 44-year-old mother and factory worker from 
Humboldt, Tenn., east of Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs require people to get a referral to prevent them from  
seeing expensive specialists when they are not needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what a problem is and if I need to go to a certain  
doctor, I've got to have a referral from a family practitioner,'' 
she groused. ``If I have trouble with my feet, why should I have to 
go a family doctor?''

<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- It was billed as the ``death jump,'' but  
motorcycle daredevil Robbie Knievel made the 130-foot leap from one 
hotel tower to another look easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This happens so fast,'' Knievel said Thursday after he landed

<HEADLINE>  Mir's Mirror Experiment Called Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian officials scrapped the Mir space station's  
much-hyped space mirror experiment today after the shiny metal 
object got stuck and failed to properly unfurl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mir crew sent the mirror, attached to a cargo ship filled  
with trash, into the earth's atmosphere this afternoon. After 
mostly burning up during re-entry, the husk dropped harmlessly into 
the Pacific Ocean, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure was a big disappointment for Russia's struggling  
space agency, which had billed the project as a display of its 
ability to conduct pioneering, ambitious projects despite a lack of 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror was supposed to work like an artificial moon,  
reflecting a beam of sunlight across the earth. But its petal-like 
segments failed to unfold Thursday after a deployment mechanism 
jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror, which was to reach 83 feet in diameter when fully  
extended, was attached to a Progress cargo ship and jettisoned 
Thursday from the Mir. Cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei 
Avdeyev then sent a remote command to unfold the mirror, made of a 
thin membrane covered with a silver metal layer. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror started rotating, and a system of weights and strings  
began to pull out the thin membranes on the flower-like structure. 
But the deployment mechanism jammed and the mirror stopped 
spinning. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Mir's Mirror Experiment Called Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian officials scrapped the Mir space station's  
much-hyped space mirror experiment today after the shiny metal 
object got stuck and failed to properly unfurl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mir crew sent the mirror, attached to a cargo ship filled  
with trash, into the earth's atmosphere this afternoon. After 
mostly burning up during re-entry, the husk dropped harmlessly into 
the Pacific Ocean, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure was a big disappointment for Russia's struggling  
space agency, which had billed the project as a display of its 
ability to conduct pioneering, ambitious projects despite a lack of 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror was supposed to work like an artificial moon,  
reflecting a beam of sunlight across the earth. But its petal-like 
segments failed to unfold Thursday after a deployment mechanism 
jammed. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror, which was to reach 83 feet in diameter when fully  
extended, was attached to a Progress cargo ship and jettisoned 
Thursday from the Mir. Cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei 
Avdeyev then sent a remote command to unfold the mirror, made of a 
thin membrane covered with a silver metal layer. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror started rotating, and a system of weights and strings  
began to pull out the thin membranes on the flower-like structure. 
But the deployment mechanism jammed and the mirror stopped 
spinning. 
</P>
<P>
	Exasperated crew and ground controllers struggled for hours to  
fix the hitch, and even got the mirror rotating again by shaking it 
with repeated blasts of the cargo ship's jets -- only to see it stop 
a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, when it became clear that the mirror would not unfurl,

<HEADLINE> Senate Rebukes House Prosecutors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The other body is not happy. And it's mutual.  
</P>
<P>
	The other body is what House members call the Senate when they  
are being polite. They weren't being polite Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors have been complaining since the opening gavel  
that they've been handicapped in making their impeachment case 
against President Clinton at trial in the Senate, which would 
rather be doing something else. 
</P>
<P>
	No witnesses, no chance to question Monica Lewinsky in person,  
restrictions no prosecutor in a real trial would face -- the 
prosecutors' complaint list went on and on. 
</P>
<P>
	Their frustration was showing even before the Senate voted 70-30  
against summoning the central figure in the sex scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't stomach to listen to inappropriate sexual conduct,  
then why do we put that burden on anyone else?'' said Rep. Lindsay 
Graham of South Carolina. ``Give us this witness... 
</P>
<P>
	``We will try to do it in a way not to demean the Senate,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate told the Republican prosecutors no, agreeing only  
to their use of videotaped depositions by Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton's 
friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal when 
the final phase of the impeachment trial begins Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate simply wants to be done with impeachment.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Rogan of California huffed that any senator who has  
not watched the Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal depositions, about 
eight hours of taped questions and answers, shouldn't be voting on 
Clinton's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	House members sometimes chafe at the standing senators accord  
themselves as the so-called upper chamber, and sniping across the 
Capitol is not uncommon. But indirectly. Rogan, however, was 
direct. 
</P>
<P>
	``And if one senator has failed to personally sit through this  
deposition and every deposition, that senator is not equipped to 
render a verdict on the impeachment trial of the president of the 
United States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said he knows how difficult it is, ``given where  
everybody is at in the country,'' which is against ousting Clinton 
despite his affair and lies about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want this to end as much as you do,'' he told the Senate.  
``However, there's a signal we're going to send if we don't watch 
it. We're going to make the independent counsel report the 
impeachment trial...'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what Democrats, and restive Republicans, don't  
like about the case. The House voted impeachment on Republican 
party lines on the basis of Kenneth W. Starr's investigation and 
accusations against the president. Their case is his case. When the 
House managers took it to the Senate, they said there had to be 
witnesses, a real trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor, had complained earlier  
that the House prosecutors were not getting appropriate respect in 
the Senate proceedings. He said they were riding a tiger and 
couldn't get off until they were done. 
</P>
<P>
	But senators don't want to get into that position with them.  
</P>
<P>
	And beyond that, perhaps, with voters. Republicans are worried  
that the impeachment case could echo into the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	That was showing in the final, futile appeal for testimony by  
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Permit us all to return to our districts, and you to your  
states, and tell our constituents that we considered the full and 
complete case,'' Rep. Ed Bryant of Tennessee said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Professor Gives $1.5M to UMass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMHERST, Mass. (AP) -- Frederick ``Jack'' Francis looks on the  
mysteries of investing as science -- not business. It's a strategy 
that made him piles of money and landed the University of 
Massachusetts a $1.5 million gift. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, a 77-year-old retired professor with a keen knowledge  
of biochemistry, made his millions on technology stocks. He gave 
the gift to the school this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't get rich on a faculty salary,'' Francis said Friday.  
He earned $75,000 in his last year as a professor in the Department 
of Food Science, where he worked from 1954 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis wrote or co-wrote nine books and more than 350 technical  
articles, many of which focused on how to maintain the quality of 
fresh and processed foods. He served as president of the Institute 
of Food Technologists and chairman of the American Council of 
Science and Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Science was his avocation, but investing became his hobby.  
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't judge the finance and I couldn't judge the  
management, but I sure could judge the technology,'' he said. ``So 
I thought I'd take a fly at the stock market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 40 or so stocks in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and  
chemical industries inflated his otherwise modest wealth to a total 
of about $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis bought only what he knew. ``I made a boodle in the  
pharmaceutical industry,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	He reads The Wall Street Journal and a couple business magazines  
but eschews brokers' advice. 
</P>
<P>
	His gift, the largest ever to the College of Food and Natural  
Resources, will endow a food science professorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's making an investment where he knows it's going to count  
most,'' said Robert Helgesen, dean of that college.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Lewinsky Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``Ms. Lewinsky, welcome back to Washington, and we wanted to  
just gather a few of our friends here to have this deposition now. 
We do have quite a number of people present, but we -- in spite of 
the numbers, we do want you to feel as comfortable as possible 
because I think we -- everyone present today has an interest in 
getting to the truth of this matter, and so as best as you can, we 
would appreciate your answers in a -- in a truthful and a fashion 
that you can recall.'' -- Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``I think, to be fair, we're -- we're obviously going to  
have to talk about some things for eight hours here, or else we can 
go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Sounds good to me.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``The first -- was the first time you actually spoke to  
the president or he spoke to you, other than perhaps a hello in the 
hallway, was that on Nov. the 15th, 1995?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And that was -- that was the day of the first so-called  
salacious encounter, the same day?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``What -- do you recall what he said or what he did in  
regard to the intern pass?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``He tugged on my pass and said: `This is going to be  
a problem.''' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``At some point, you were transferred to the Pentagon,  
to the Department of Defense. When did that occur?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I found out I was being transferred on April 5,  
1996.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you want to go?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``No.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``... to the Department of Defense? Did you have a  
discussion with the president about this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``What was your reaction to being transferred?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I started to cry.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you attach any significance to being transferred  
away before the election and then him assuring you he would bring 
you back after the election? Did you attach any significance to the 
election and your having to leave?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Emotional significance, yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Your emotion? I'm -- I'm not sure I follow you. You  
were ... 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Well, yes, I attached significance to it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And that was emotional ... ''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``But that was emotional.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``But the reason you both felt -- again, I'm not trying  
to put words in your mouth, but you both felt you were leaving 
until after the election was because of your relationship and 
perhaps people finding out? 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``No ... I can only speak for myself. I mean, I, my  
understanding initially was that it was for work-related issues, 
but not my work, and I came to understand later that it was having 
to do with my relationship with the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Ms. Lewinsky, did you tell a number of people in  
varying details about your relationship with the president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``You tell us who did you tell?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Catherine Allday Davis, Neysa Deman Erbland, Natalie  
Ungvari, Ashley Raines, Linda Tripp, Dr. Kathy Estep, Dr. Irene 
Kassorla, Andy Bleiler, my mom, my aunt. Who else has been 
subpoenaed? 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Okay. Let me suggest Dale -- did you mention Dale  
Young?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Dale Young. I'm sorry.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you lie before the grand jury and to your friends  
about the nature of that relationship with the president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``No.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``In regard to your testimony at the grand jury about  
your -- your relationship and the physical contact that you have 
said occurred in some of these, visits with the president, it has 
been characterized in a way that would give you an excuse not to 
tell the truth. Did you tell the truth in the grand jury about what 
actually happened and how the president touched -- the president 
touched you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And did you likewise tell the truth to your friends in  
connection with the same matters?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did your relationship with the president involve  
giving gifts, exchanging gifts?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And you mentioned earlier that in reference to this  
chart that it was, uh, subject to certain corrections you've made 
in later testimony. It was an accurate representation or an 
accurate compilation of the gifts that you gave the president and 
the president gave you. Is that correct?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Approximately how many gifts did you give the  
president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I believe I've testified to that number. I don't  
recall right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``About 30? Would that be ... ?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``If that's what I testified to, then I accept that.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``That's the number I have, and do you recall how many  
gifts approximately the president gave you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``It would be the same situation.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``You wrote the president a letter expressing some  
frustrations about the job situation in terms of -- is that -- can 
you tell us about that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes. I had had a -- well, I guess I was -- I know I've  
testified about this, I mean, in the grand jury, but I was feeling 
at that point that I was getting the run-around on being brought 
back to the White House. So I sent a letter to the president that 
was probably the harshest I had sent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you get a response?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Sort of.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Would you explain?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Um, Betty called me and told me to come to the White  
House the next morning, on July 4th, at 9 a.m.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And what happened when you -- I assume you went to the  
White House on July the 4th. What happened?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Do you have a specific question? I know I testified,  
I mean, extensively about this whole day, that whole ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Well, in regards to -- let's start with the job.''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Well, I started crying. We were in the back office  
and -- and when the subject matter came up, the president was upset 
with me and then I began to cry. So ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did he encourage you about you coming back? Did he  
make a promise or commitment to you that he would make sure you 
came back to work at the White House?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I don't know that he reaffirmed his promise or  
commitment. I remember leaving that day thinking that, as usual, he 
was going to work on it and had a renewed sense of hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did he comment on your letter, the tone of your  
letter?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``What did he say?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``He was upset with me and told me it was illegal to  
threaten the president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you intend the letter to be interpreted that  
way?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``No.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you explain why you wrote the letter to him about  
reminding him that you were a good girl and you left the White 
House? Did you have that type of conversation?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes. That's what made me start to cry.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you -- did you ever explain to him that you didn't  
intend to threaten him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I believe so.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``What was the intent of the letter?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``First, I felt the letter was going to him as a man  
and not as president of the United States. Second, I think I could 
see how he could interpret it as a threat, but my intention was to 
sort of remind him that I had been waiting patiently and what I 
considered was being a good girl, about having been transferred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``You didn't feel it was necessary to go back to the  
president and perhaps confront the president and say, `Why am I not 
coming back, I want to come back?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I mean, I had a discussion with the president, but I  
had made a decision from that based on that information, and I 
guess -- my experience of it coming up on a year from the election, 
having not been brought back, that it probably wasn't going to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you carry any documents or any papers with you to  
the meeting with Mr. Jordan?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``What were those?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``My resume and a list of public relations firms in  
New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did Mr. Jordan ask you why you were there?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And what did you say?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I was hoping to move to New York and that he could  
assist me in securing a job there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did he ask you why you wanted to leave Washington?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And what was your answer?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I gave him the vanilla story of, that I -- I think I  
-- I don't remember exactly what I said. I -- I believe I've 
testified to this. I think it was something about wanting to get 
out of Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``The vanilla story. You mean sort of an innocuous set  
of reasons, not really the true reasons you wanted to leave?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And what were the true reasons you wanted to leave?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Because I couldn't go back to the White House.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``During this meeting, did he make any comments about  
your status as a friend of the president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``What ... did he say?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``In one of his remarks, he said something about me  
being a friend of the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And did you respond?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``How?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I said that I didn't -- I think I -- my grand jury  
testimony, I know I talked about this, so it's probably more 
accurate. My memory right now is I said something about, seeing him 
more as a man than as a president, and I treated him accordingly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``I know in your grand jury you mentioned some of your  
feelings that you felt after he spoke publicly about the 
relationship, but let me ask you more about the positive -- you said 
there were mixed feelings. What about -- do you still respect the 
president, still admire the president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Do you still appreciate what he is doing for this  
country as the president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Was there any discussion of how you would accomplish  
preparing or filing an affidavit at that point?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``No.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Why didn't you want to testify? Why would not you --  
why would you have wanted to avoid testifying?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``First of all, I thought it was nobody's business.  
Second of all, I didn't want to have anything to do with Paula 
Jones or her case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Would you agree that these cover stories that you've  
just testified to, if they were told to the attorneys for Paula 
Jones, that they would be misleading to them and not be the whole 
story, the whole truth?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``They would -- yes, I guess misleading. They were  
literally true, but they would be misleading, so incomplete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``As I understand your testimony, too, the cover stories  
were reiterated to you by the president that night on the telephone 
...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Correct.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And after he told you would be a witness -- or your  
name was on the witness list, I should say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Correct.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And did you understand that since your name was on the  
witness list that there would be a possibility that you could be 
subpoenaed to testify in the Paula Jones case?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: I think I understood that I could be subpoenaed, and  
there was a possibility of testifying. I don't know if I 
necessarily thought it was a subpoena to testify, but ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Were you in fact subpoenaed to testify?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And that was what?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Dec. 19, 1997.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Dec. 19. Now, you have testified in the grand jury. I  
think your closing comments was that no one ever asked you to lie, 
but yet in that very conversation of December the 17th, 1997, when 
the president told you that you were on the witness list, he also 
suggested that you could sign an affidavit and use misleading cover 
stories. Isn't that correct? 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Uh -- well, I -- I guess in my mind, I separate  
necessarily signing affidavit and using misleading cover stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``In fact you did deny the relationship to the Jones  
lawyers in the affidavit that you signed under penalty of perjury; 
is that right?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I denied a sexual relationship.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``The president did not in that conversation on December  
the 17th of 1997 or any other conversation, for that matter, 
instruct you to tell the truth; is that correct?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``That's correct.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you express your frustration to Mr. Jordan with,  
with the President? 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I expressed that sometimes I had frustrations with  
him, yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And what was his response to you about -- after you  
talked about the president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``He sort of jokingly said to me, `You know what your  
problem is, and don't deny it -- you're in love with him.' But it 
was a sort of lighthearted nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you -- did you have a response to that?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I probably blushed or giggled or something.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Do you still have feelings for the president?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I have mixed feelings.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``What -- maybe you could tell us a little bit more about  
what those mixed feelings are. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I think what you need to know is that my grand jury  
testimony is truthful irrespective of whatever those mixed feelings 
are in my testimony today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Was this your first notice of your name being on the  
Paula Jones witness list?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``I realize he, he commented about some other things,  
but I do want to focus on the witness list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``OK.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did he say anything to you about how he felt  
concerning this witness list?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``He said it broke his heart that, well, that my name  
was on the witness list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did the president ever tell you to turn over the  
gifts?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Not that I remember.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``In his answer to this proceeding in the Senate, he has  
indicated that he thought he had -- might have had a way that he 
could have you -- get you to file a -- basically a true affidavit, 
but yet still skirt these issues enough that you wouldn't be called 
as a witness. Did he offer you any of these suggestions at this 
time?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``He didn't discuss the content of my affidavit with  
me at all, ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``But, I mean, he didn't make an offer that, you know,  
'Here's what you can do,' or 'Let me send you over something that 
can maybe keep you from committing perjury?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``No. We never discussed perjury.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``On January the 6th ... did you pick up a draft of the  
affidavit from Mr. Carter?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes, I did.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``What did you do with that draft?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I read it and went through it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``How did it look?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I don't really remember my reaction to it. I know I  
had some changes. I know there's a copy of this draft affidavit 
that's part of the record, but ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Were portions of it false?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Incomplete and misleading.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``The fact that you assume that Mr. Jordan was in  
contact with the president -- and I believe the evidence would 
support that through his own testimony that he had talked to the 
president about the signed affidavit and that he had kept the 
president updated on the subpoena issue and the job search ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Sir, I'm not sure that I knew he was having contact  
with the president about this. I -- I think what I said was that I 
felt that it was getting his approval. It didn't necessarily mean 
that I felt he was going to get a direct approval from the 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Even just mentioning that I might have been alone  
with the president, I was concerned that that would give the Jones 
people enough ammunition to want to talk to me, to think, 'Oh, 
well, maybe if she was alone with him that' -- that he propositioned 
me or something like that, because I hadn't -- of course. I mean, 
you remember that at this point, I had no idea the amount of 
knowledge they had about the relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Let me ask you, though -- I realize none of us were  
there -- but that statement, `I was never really alone with Monica; 
right?' -- that was not -- he was alone with you on many occasions, 
was he not? 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I'm not trying to be difficult, but I feel very  
uncomfortable making judgments on what someone else's statement 
when they're defining things however they want to define it. So if 
you -- if you ask me, Monica, were you alone with the president, I 
will say yes, but I'm not comfortable characterizing what someone 
else says.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``You and the president had an emotional relationship as  
well as a physical one; is that right? 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``That's how I'd characterize it.''

<HEADLINE> Wiberg Wins Combined Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Swedish veteran Pernilla Wiberg had a prerace  
plan, then executed it perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg turned in a blistering second run of the slalom on Friday  
to capture the women's combined title in the World Alpine Ski 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined times for one downhill and two slalom runs determined  
the combined champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``My plan was to not be too far behind in the downhill and then  
to go a little bit slow in the first run of the slalom to see where 
I am,'' she said. ``I know I always have a better second run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one was better on the second run.  
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg, collecting the fourth gold medal of her career in the  
world championships, stood in fifth place, .69 seconds off the 
pace, entering the second slalom run. She eliminated that deficit 
with an aggressive second run that was clocked in 42.68 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Four subsequent racers couldn't overtake her. Her aggregate time  
was 3 minutes, 8.52 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Renate Goetschl, who won the downhill and maintained  
her lead despite only the seventh-fastest run in the first heat of 
slalom, could manage only a time of 43.52 in the second run, during 
which she nearly fell. She settled for the silver medal in 3:08.67. 
</P>
<P>
	The bronze went to France's Florence Masnada in 3:08.97.  
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Hilde Gerg, considered a favorite for the combined  
title because of her strength in slalom, was fourth in 3:09.38 and 
left the course in tears after failing to medal. Norway's Trude 
Gimle took fifth in 3:10.51, and Austria's Michaela Dorfmeister was 
sixth in 3:11.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonna Mendes of South Lake Tahoe, Calif., was the top American,  
placing 10th in 3:15.50. Kate Monahan of Aspen, Colo., was 11th in 
3:15.64. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg captured the World Cup overall title in 1996-97, then  
endured an injury-plagued season last year that nearly caused her 
to quit racing. 
</P>
<P>
	But with her knee repaired and her confidence restored, Wiberg  
she found herself back on top Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``After last year when I had so many injuries, I was really down  
and I thought I might have to quit skiing,'' Wiberg, 28, said. 
``But Dr. Richard Steadman fixed my knee, as he did so many other 
times, and he said there were no problems and I could go on skiing 
for many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg, who said she has undergone 10 or 11 operations during  
her career, felt her victory on Friday would help her relax for the 
remainder of the world championships. ``For me, that's good because 
when I am too tense, I don't ski good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg placed sixth in the downhill, 1.44 seconds behind  
Goetschl. She cut the deficit with the fifth-best time on the first 
slalom run. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl, 23, won the combined downhill by a comfortable .79  
seconds over teammate Stefanie Schuster, but Goetschl's lead was 
trimmed to .05 seconds when Masnada clocked the fastest run on the 
first heat of the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Three skiers who ranked in the top eight entering the last  
slalom run fell during their runs -- Austria's Brigitte Obermoser 
and Schuster, who stood fourth and sixth, respectively, and 
Germany's Martina Ertl, who stood eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the combined, you have to have three good runs and be a  
little bit lucky,'' Wiberg said. ``I didn't expect Renate to ski so 
good in the slalom. She put pressure on me, and I really had to 
give my best in the second run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her second run was ``not without faults. I made some  
mistakes on the bottom part, but when you try to go fast, you 
always make some mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl, gold medalist in combined at the 1997 world  
championships, captured her second medal of these championships. 
She won silver in the super-G on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had three good races today,'' she said. ``Having a good  
downhill today should help me in the (downhill) race on Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg had the best combined time for both slaloms at 1:33.42.  
Masnada was second in 1:33.85. Croatia's Janica Kostelic was third 
in 1:34.06 and finished seventh in the combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Lalive of Steamboat Springs, Colo., who placed seventh  
in the Olympic combined last year, stood 22nd after the downhill, 
but lost an edge and did not finish the initial slalom run.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Gov. Spares Inmate's Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Gov. Mike Huckabee on Friday spared the  
life of a death row inmate after a juror who voted for execution 
pleaded for mercy because his conscience was bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
	Huckabee commuted the death sentence to life without parole for  
Bobby Ray Fretwell, 34, who was convicted of robbing and shooting 
to death 81-year-old Sherman Sullins in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this is a hard decision for any one person to decide  
and Mr. Huckabee is a wonderful person,'' Fretwell said in a 
statement. ``I still feel the pain and suffering of Sullins' family 
and friends and I pray they can find forgiveness and heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Stinnett, one of the jurors at Fretwell's trial, had  
written a letter to the governor and the state parole board asking 
that the Feb. 16 execution be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Stinnett, 70, said he was the lone holdout against the death  
penalty but relented for fear he would be an outcast in the small 
community where the killing occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just kind of broke down. I didn't have the courage of my  
conviction,'' Stinnett said in an interview last week. ``It's 
driving me nuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sullins' son, LeRoy, criticized the governor but said his family  
hadn't decided whether to protest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how he can think it ain't diminished. I mean,  
it's no punishment,'' he said. ``When you do the crime, you got to 
pay. You can't let people off in a few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said Stinnett had given him sufficient doubt that  
an execution was warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This man has done a courageous deed, coming forward to admit  
what he views as a mistake and to correct what he perceives as an 
injustice,'' Huckabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The death penalty is irreversible,'' he said. ``We cannot  
afford to make a mistake. To carry out the death penalty in this 
case would me a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huckabee, who became governor in 1996, has sent six men to their  
deaths and has never commuted any other death sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Under state law, there is a 30-day public comment period before  
the commutation becomes final. 
</P>
<P>
	Fretwell, who was 20 at the time of the slaying, admitted  
shooting Sullins after stealing the man's truck and robbing him. 
Fretwell's wife and another accomplice were convicted of theft, 
served several years in prison and have been released. 
</P>
<P>
	Fretwell begged for mercy last week, but a state appeals board  
voted 4-2 against clemency. He was scheduled to die by injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Another execution is still set for Feb. 16 -- that of Johnie  
Michael Cox, 42. He was convicted of killing three people, 
including his step-grandmother, in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Campus Lauds Notre Dame Big Ten Nix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Tony Driver came to Notre Dame for the  
``uniqueness'' of the football program. Troy Murphy committed to 
Notre Dame so he could play basketball at home on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Muffet McGraw was just happy women's basketball finally  
had a permanent home. Her team was affiliated with three 
conferences the past 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of the motivation, they were all relieved Friday  
after Notre Dame's trustees rejected an invitation from the Big 
Ten. The decision allows the football team to remain independent 
and most of Notre Dame's other sports to stay in the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here because I wanted to be able to play at home but I  
also wanted to get away from home,'' said Murphy, a New Jersey 
native. ``Not joining the Big Ten has taken a load of my 
shoulders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To Driver, a sophomore free safety from Louisville, Ky., joining  
the Big Ten would have taken some of the shine off the Golden Dome. 
One reason he came to Notre Dame was its national football 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the flexibility of playing all over the country,''  
Driver said. ``I really didn't want to see Notre Dame playing a 
strict schedule every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Driver's coach, Bob Davie, the decision keeps alive Notre  
Dame's reputation as an independent, national Roman Catholic 
university, something no one else can claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Davie also likes the university's multimillion-dollar contract  
with NBC to broadcast all home Notre Dame football games, one of 
the tools Davie used to land 16 recruits this week who earned USA 
Today All-American honors. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an independent in football, we have some unique  
opportunities afforded to us that make us tremendously attractive 
to a prospective student-athlete,'' he said. ``Based on the success 
that we've had recently in recruiting and the improvement we've 
made as a football team, I like where we are and where we're 
headed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only the faculty seemed disappointed. It had hoped that joining  
the Big Ten -- and its academic arm, the Committee on Institutional 
Cooperation -- would help build the university's graduate and 
research programs, which lag far behind the conference schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm understandably disappointed, but I do understand the  
decision,'' said theology professor Gregory Sterling. ``A good case 
can be made either way and the board weighed things a little 
differently than some of us who are on the faculty did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there was some resentment among Notre Dame athletes now  
playing in the Big East of the perception the decision was looked 
at solely in terms of what's best for the football program, Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just going to throw the other sports along to  
benefit the football program,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Men's basketball coach John MacLeod said most in the athletic  
department realized football was the major factor in the decision 
but still felt the interests of all -- including academics -- were 
taken into consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us this is as a good decision, as well as a decision best  
for the university,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Nation's Top Scorer in Brooklyn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Say ``Brooklyn,'' and certain thoughts come  
easily to mind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers, or rather ``Da Bums.'' A beautiful bridge that can  
be had for the right price. Coney Island and the famous hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	There soon might be another -- the college basketball's leading  
scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Jones of Long Island University, located on Flatbush  
Ave., was No. 1 in Division I the past two seasons, averaging 30.1 
as a junior and 29.0 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The name on top of the current scoring list is Ray Minlend of  
St. Francis, N.Y., the ultimate urban college in Brooklyn Heights. 
</P>
<P>
	Minlend, a 6-foot-2 senior, is averaging 25.6 points after  
getting 33 in Thursday night's 89-75 victory over Quinnipiac. 
That's one full point ahead of Brian Merriweather of Texas Pan 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also almost triple what Minlend averaged as a junior for  
the Terriers and as a freshman at Davidson. He scored 12.1 points 
as a sophomore when the Wildcats went to the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	Minlend wanted to transfer after his sophomore season, but  
Davidson would not give him a release, so he had to pay his way for 
a year at St. Francis, living part of the time with his brother 
Charles, who was in his senior year at St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	``When any kid sits out, he can lose that edge, and Ray wasn't  
on scholarship so I couldn't demand he practice. It would have been 
so hard for him living with his brother in Queens and all,'' 
Terriers coach Ron Ganulin said. ``Then last season we had to make 
a choice between Ray and Richy Dominguez, and we thought since 
Richy was a freshman Ray would be more mature and didn't have an 
ego. It didn't work out that way. Kids get down on themselves. It 
was a bad coaching decision. I might have taken the starch out of 
the kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minlend came back for his senior season fully starched. He has  
scored 30 or more points eight times, with 39 against Robert Morris 
his career high. He is shooting 78 percent from the free-throw 
line, an even more impressive number since he has been to the line 
228 times, 45 percent of the team's total, and he has made 176, 
more than half the Terriers' total. 
</P>
<P>
	It was obvious most of the crowd of 382 at the Pope Center on  
Thursday night were counting Minlend's point total, and there was a 
murmur of recognition when he reached his average. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganulin, an assistant to Jerry Tarkanian at UNLV when the  
Runnin' Rebels won the NCAA title in 1990, admitted it can be a 
distraction having the nation's leading scorer on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other players might think he takes too many shots or is  
selfish, but this group has been great,'' he said. ``I think they 
realize what Ray is doing is special and he is so valuable to us. 
He shoots a very high percentage and he gets fouled a lot. He 
doesn't take bad shots. How do you stop a kid from shooting when he 
gets those good shots and makes them?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minlend, a native of Cameroon who went to St. Thomas More Prep  
in Connecticut, is majoring in accounting and has the second 
highest grade-point average on the team. He is very quiet and is 
uncomfortable talking about himself. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked to give a scouting report on his game for those who  
haven't seen him play he answered: ``Get to the basket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Terriers are 15-5, the most wins in a season since they won  
16 in 1977-78. They are in second place in the Northeast 
Conference, and there are people talking about a possible 
conference title and the school's first NCAA tournament appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to win so badly, especially after sitting out  
that year,'' said Minlend, whose 3.1 steals per game also gets him 
in the Top 20 nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Jones was a local kid. Ray Minlend is from a foreign  
country. They both have made Brooklyn proud. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in New York so long I feel like part of me is from  
Brooklyn,'' Minlend said, ``but I think I'll always be the little 
kid from Cameroon who came to the U.S. and got an education and was 
fortunate enough to play basketball.''

	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A woman filed a lawsuit against police who  
stopped her and doused her with pepper spray as she rushed to a 
hospital to give birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Angie Cottrell accuses Monona and Madison police of violating  
her constitutional rights in 1995 when they stopped a van driven by 
her husband, Steve. 
</P>
<P>
	Monona Officer Frank Fenton stopped the couple for speeding at  
80 mph to 85 mph, the lawsuit said. Fenton told Cottrell he should 
have called an ambulance allegedly said: ``You're not going 
anywhere, pal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cottrell continued on to the hospital but was stopped at a  
roadblock, where Fenton and two Madison officers tried to drag the 
couple from the van, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	They resisted and Fenton told another officer to spray the  
couple, according to the lawsuit. Police then rushed Mrs. Cottrell 
to the hospital and released her husband in time for the birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenton has said the pepper spray was triggered accidentally  
during the struggle. The Cottrells claim Fenton and other officers 
used excessive force.

<HEADLINE> President To Establish Race Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has turned down advisers'  
suggestion that he create a permanent commission on race relations, 
preferring to set up a new office in the White House to focus on 
racial issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House Office on the President's Initiative for One  
America will try to keeping alive the work begun under the yearlong 
race campaign that ended last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Two senior White House officials, speaking Thursday on condition  
of anonymity, said the move would be announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned to name deputy public liaison director Ben  
Johnson to head the office, the officials said. In his current 
capacity, Johnson serves as a liaison to minority communities. He 
could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of South Bend, Ind., Johnson joined the Clinton White  
House in 1993 in the Office of Public Liaison. In the 1970s, he 
served as director of consumer programs for President Carter. He 
also was administrator for the District of Columbia's Business 
Regulation Administration from 1983-87. 
</P>
<P>
	The office he will head would be set up similarly to the White  
House Office for Women's Initiatives and Outreach, which Clinton 
established in 1995 to ensure better outreach to women and smooth 
handling of their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	In delivering its findings, Clinton's advisory board proposed  
creating a White House office on race to work in conjunction with a 
permanent commission. One official said the fact that the president 
chose to set up an office on a smaller scale did not mean the 
effort is being given a lower priority. 
</P>
<P>
	The race board suggested last June that Clinton should establish  
a race panel patterned after the Council of Economic Advisers. The 
council consists of three full-time, paid government employees in a 
position to get to the president quickly on pressing economic 
matters. The members must be confirmed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The race office will have a staff of about four people. Its  
director would ensure that policies that tie directly to racial 
issues on the president's agenda are ``up and running,'' one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, the official said one of the office's first  
duties will be to promote items in Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget 
plan that will have major impact in minority communities, such as 
his education proposals and his request for increased spending on 
enforcement of anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The office also will have a role in advancing the race report  
that Clinton expects to release this spring.

<HEADLINE> Brokerages Fined Over Y2K Notice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five brokerage firms have agreed to pay civil  
fines and be censured to settle federal regulators' charges that 
they failed to fully disclose their computer readiness for the Year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the settlements  
Friday with Laguna Financial Corp. of San Jose; McGlone &AMP; Co. of 
Westport, Conn.; Phoenix Financial Services Corp. of New York City; 
Multi Spectrum Investing Corp. of Somerville, N.J.; and E.C. 
Capital Ltd., now known as Morgan, Taylor and Associates Inc., of 
Mineola, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The five were among 37 relatively small brokerages charged by  
the SEC in October, in the federal government's first major 
enforcement action related to the Year 2000 computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the firms have agreed to settle the charges by promising  
to refrain from such violations in the future, being censured and 
paying civil fines ranging from $5,000 to $25,000, depending on 
their size. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest settlements, the five firms agreed to pay the  
fines, to be censured and to refrain from future such violations. 
The firms neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Laguna Financial, McGlone and Phoenix Financial each agreed to  
pay a $5,000 fine; while Multi Spectrum Investing agreed to pay 
$15,000 and E.C. Capital to pay $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the SEC accused nine stock-transfer agents of  
allegedly failing to adequately disclose their computer readiness 
for the millennial year. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the agent companies settled the charges and four  
contested them. 
</P>
<P>
	Transfer agents, which sometimes are banks or trust companies,  
are responsible for keeping records of shareholders of corporations 
and for issuing or canceling stock certificates when shares are 
bought and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said failure of transfer agents to anticipate and fix  
Year 2000 computer problems could ``seriously disrupt'' 
corporations' dividend payments and other transactions with their 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The market watchdog agency also requires mutual fund companies  
and publicly traded corporations to disclose their readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about the Jan. 1, 2000, date stem from the fact that  
some computer systems may read only the last two digits of a 
four-digit year and interpret the year 2000 as 1900, potentially 
wreaking havoc on financial transactions.

<HEADLINE> Robbie Knievel Makes 'Death Jump' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- It was billed as the ``death jump,'' but  
motorcycle daredevil Robbie Knievel made the 130-foot leap from one 
hotel tower to another look easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This happens so fast,'' Knievel said Thursday after he landed  
in a pile of hay bales to slow his speed. ``I don't know what else 
to do but to go up there and jump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robbie Knievel gained fame in April 1989 when he jumped the  
fountains at nearby Caesars Palace, a feat that nearly killed his 
father 21 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Evel Knievel, 60, who has hepatitis C, underwent a long-awaited  
liver transplant last week in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bet he thought it was sensational,'' the younger Knievel  
said of his father's opinion of his jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel, wearing a white leather jumpsuit with blue stars, ran  
his motorcycle up the ramps several times before taking off for the 
jump from the 13th floor hotel tower without a safety net or a 
parachute.

	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Michael Jordan's going itty-bitty.  
</P>
<P>
	Mattel Inc. has created three action figures -- from 3 1/2 inches to  
13 inches tall -- of the now-retired basketball star.

	The 6-foot-6 Jordan was a five-time NBA most valuable player,  
two-time Olympic gold medalist and six-time NBA champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The action figures will cost $3.49 to $29.99. The 3 1/2-inch and

<HEADLINE>  Tyson Sentenced to Jail for Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson was sent back to jail Friday,  
this time for as long as a year, for assaulting two motorists in 
what the judge called ``potentially lethal road rage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision not only puts the former heavyweight champion's  
career in jeopardy, it could lead to more jail time for violating 
parole in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson ``repeatedly speaks and acts compulsively and violently,''  
Judge Stephen Johnson said after a three-hour hearing. ``The court 
views this as a tragic example of potentially lethal road rage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson gave Tyson two concurrent two-year sentences, and  
suspended all but one year. He fined Tyson $5,000 and sentenced him 
to two years' probation after his release from jail -- which could 
be in six months if he's released early for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson appeared stoic throughout the hearing. During a 30-minute  
recess, he stroked the face of his wife, Monica, and quietly 
chatted with her. Then came the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon hearing the judge's words, Tyson's broad shoulders slumped,  
and he was led away in handcuffs while his wife cried. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who pleaded no contest, can appeal the sentence within 30  
days, and if he won, he would stand trial on the charges. He cannot 
be released on bail before Monday, when he can request a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came three weeks after Tyson's successful comeback  
against Francois Botha. Tyson was scheduled to fight April 24 in 
Las Vegas against an opponent to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino Capurro, spokesman for Showtime, the cable network that  
has a multiple-fight contract with Tyson: 
</P>
<P>
	``We are surprised at the severity of the sentence that the  
Montgomery County District Court has issued to Mike Tyson. We 
cannot comment further at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana authorities must now decide whether the 32-year-old  
fighter violated his probation for a 1991 rape conviction. Tyson 
was released in 1995 after serving three years of a six-year 
sentence, and his probation was set to expire in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence could also lead to a review of Tyson's boxing  
license by the Nevada State Athletic Commission, which reinstated 
the fighter in October after a one-year suspension for biting 
Evander Holyfield's ears during a fight in June 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Nave, the only Nevada commissioner who voted against  
Tyson, said it was possible the five-member panel would take no 
further action, especially since the license expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sense is that if it is true, if he's going to be in jail  
for a year, there's not much need at this point for us to take 
action,'' Nave said. ``What what would be the reason for us to do 
anything?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Jimmerson, Tyson's lead attorney at the Nevada hearing, said  
the panel's options include a fine and-or a suspension or 
revocation of his license. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the sentence is totally and completely unexpected and  
unduly harsh,'' Jimmerson said. ``There's going to be a careful 
review of his options, including perhaps requesting a new trial in 
Maryland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Patricia Gifford, the Indiana judge who sentenced Tyson at  
his rape trial, could not be reached for comment. David Deputy, a 
bailiff in her court, said he couldn't comment on the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judge is waiting for her paperwork to come from  
Maryland,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson kicked one motorist and punched another after a minor  
three-car accident in Gaithersburg, Md., on Aug. 31. In December, 
Tyson pleaded no contest -- meaning he neither protested the charges 
nor admitted guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have received up to 20 years in jail.  
</P>
<P>
	The two victims, Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick, settled  
out of court, and were against sending Tyson to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor, Montgomery County State's Attorney Douglas  
Gansler, wanted Tyson behind bars, but was hampered by a plea 
agreement negotiated by his predecessor, Robert Dean. Dean had said 
he would recommend no jail time in return for the no contest plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler's memo to the judge called Tyson ``nothing less than a  
time bomb.'' Gansler detailed Tyson's 1991 rape conviction in 
Indiana, seven brushes with the law as a juvenile, and the 
Holyfield fight.

<HEADLINE> Flutie Appreciates Pro Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Doug Flutie kneeled so he could talk to the  
young girls at eye level. 
</P>
<P>
	He patiently listened to their questions, and as they each  
scribbled furiously, he gave them the quotes they needed for a 
school project. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie hasn't shunned a single autograph seeker, or fan wanting  
to have a photo snapped with him, or ducked a reporter all week. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most accommodating all-stars, the 36-year-old Pro  
Bowl rookie has more reason than most to appreciate being here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very special, an acceptance from the other players,''  
said Flutie, whose selection to the game provided a final stamp of 
validity to his amazing return to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most guys who are in the Pro Bowl for the first time are 24 or  
25. It's just an interesting twist to my career, and I'm very 
thankful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Buffalo Bills quarterback obviously has enjoyed the week  
leading up to the Pro Bowl, particularly the company of his 
all-star teammates. He teased John Elway about getting the AFC No. 
7 jersey. That's also Flutie's number with Buffalo, but he'll wear 
No. 6 in the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Have you done anything to deserve it (the No. 7)?'' Elway  
asked with a grin. Flutie replied, ``Just hanging in there, riding 
along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie was in Hawaii about a year ago for a quite different  
reason, joining several other former Heisman Trophy winners, 
including Texas A&AMP;M's John David Crow and Michigan's Desmond 
Howard, who were honored at the Hula Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie, who spent most of the '90s playing in the Canadian  
Football League, found out while he was in Hawaii that the Bills 
were interested in him. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie, whose 5-foot-10 stature has long been seen as a drawback  
by most NFL teams, told some of his fellow Heisman winners he 
wanted to give the NFL another try, and, he said, ```They thought I 
was crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crazy or not, he was determined.  
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I learned Buffalo wanted to sign me, my competitive  
juices stared flowing because I knew this year was going to be 
something different,'' Flutie recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	His long journey to the Bills wound through a year with the New  
Jersey Generals of the now-defunct United States Football League, 
and one season with the Chicago Bears before being traded to New 
England, where he spent most of three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He went to Canada in 1990 and had a very successful eight years  
there, including being selected the CFL's Most Outstanding Player 
six times. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed with the Bills on Jan. 20, 1998, and went to camp as  
backup to Rob Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel real comfortable going in. It was like being a  
rookie all over again,'' Flutie said. ``I just was in a position 
where I was fighting for a job, trying to get a chance to get on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	When Johnson went down with an injury, Flutie got his chance and  
was outstanding, completing 202 of 354 passes for 2,711 yards and 
20 touchdowns and leading the Bills to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believed all along that I could do it in the NFL, that I  
just needed an opportunity,'' Flutie said. ``The way things turned 
out was fantastic.''

<HEADLINE> Cops Say Boy Shoved in Front of Bus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALE, Pa. (AP) -- A woman who once pleaded no contest to trying  
to run down some children has been charged with shoving a 
15-year-old boy in front of a bus, which nearly hit him. 
</P>
<P>
	Alma Sibert, 59, was jailed on $15,000 bail on charges including  
aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Terry Holcomb said Ms. Sibert and the boy, whose  
name was not released, were arguing Tuesday over her grandson. Ms. 
Sibert shoved the boy, who lives in her neighborhood, in front of a 
bus, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver swerved to miss the boy and called police.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, police charged Ms. Sibert with driving onto a sidewalk  
outside an elementary school in an attempt to run down eight 
children, including an 8-year-old boy she believed had fought with 
her grandson. Witnesses said the youngsters had to run to get out 
of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sibert was placed on probation for a year, fined $200 and  
ordered to perform 48 hours of community service.

<HEADLINE> Starr Lawyers Discuss Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two former and one current member of Kenneth  
Starr's prosecutorial team insisted they did not leak the story of 
the independent counsel's plan to indict President Clinton after 
impeachment hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was silent when asked if there is a sealed indictment  
against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``To read that people in the office were leaking was  
demoralizing,'' said Michael Emmick, associate independent counsel. 
``It made me want to start strangling people. It was mortifying. I 
hope it turns out it was all a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick, a former member of the U.S. attorney's office in Los  
Angeles, was a panelist at a program titled ``Starr Gazing.'' It 
was sponsored by the Los Angeles County Bar in conjunction with the 
American Bar Association's midwinter meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick and former Starr staff members Karin Immergut and Thomas  
Bienert fielded a barrage of questions from fellow lawyers and 
reporters. Earlier, Emmick used a large chart to present the case 
for preserving the independent counsel law, which is due to expire 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does the (independent counsel) act create monsters --  
overzealous, obsessive, independent counsels on a mission to 'get' 
their targets,'' one chart read. 
</P>
<P>
	His answer was no. But he was challenged by panelists Neil  
Eggleston, a counsel to the Office of the President, and Ted Wells, 
the defense attorney who won an acquittal on corruption charges for 
former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monsters?'' Wells said. ``These three people seem very nice at  
dinner. But something happens to you when you go to the independent 
counsel office. ... They become crazed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said unlimited finances and time allotted to the independent  
counsel is ``an invitation to a witchhunt'' and he called some of 
their legal positions ``wacky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immergut, who served with Starr for four months in 1998, said  
when she arrived there was ``a siege mentality which emanated from 
the White House attitude toward Ken Starr. ... We were so concerned 
with leaks. We only had each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immergut, now a state prosecutor in Portland, Ore., said she  
almost declined the request to work for Starr because ``I thought I 
would never get a job again. ... People thought that I was crazy 
because I would be branded part of the right wing conspiracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moderator Laurie Levenson, associate dean of Loyola University  
Law School, challenged both Emmick and Immergut on their treatment 
of Monica Lewinsky and asked whether the key witness was ``broken'' 
during questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Immergut said she asked all the personal questions and  
complained that ``as I asked those questions I did not anticipate 
that was for dissemination over the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick, who was the first to quiz Lewinsky in a Washington hotel  
room, acknowledged it was ``a stressful and traumatic day for 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He confirmed that Lewinsky was advised not to call a lawyer who  
had been representing her in civil depositions. He defended the 
action, citing a later court decision that Lewinsky's right to 
counsel was not violated because no charges had been brought 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick said he and other members of the team believed that her  
civil lawyer, Frank Carter, did not handle criminal litigation, a 
statement greeted with some skepticism by his questioners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Didn't she ask to speak with him?'' asked a lawyer in the  
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes and gosh I'm glad you asked that question,'' said Emmick  
who then cited the ruling by U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway 
Johnson on the issue. ``We actually gave her the names of a public 
defender and a legal aid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of Lewinsky's treatment, he said, ``When you're asked to  
cooperate in an investigation of this kind it's going to be hellish 
no matter how nice you are to her. It's a nightmare. That's one of 
the ugly truths about law enforcement. It's very ugly at times. We 
tried to make it as undifficult as we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the explicit sexual detail contained in Starr's report,  
Bienert said, ``For my taste, I would like to have seen less 
detail.'' But he blamed President Clinton for putting at issue the 
definition of what is sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``It forced the office to get into details,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Levenson's final question -- ``Is there a sealed indictment?'' --  
elicited only silence from all members of the panel.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Said Vulnerable to Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress has received a sobering message from  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Attorney General Janet 
Reno: The United States continues to be vulnerable to bombing 
attacks, both at home and abroad, despite progress in combating 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 10 percent of the planned work has been performed on  
upgrading U.S. embassies since last August's twin bombings in 
Africa, Albright told a Senate hearing on anti-terrorism Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think from our perspective we don't need any more  
legislative authority, but we do need ... money,'' she testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said there has been much progress in foiling would-be  
terrorist plots and in improving coordination among agencies. 
Still, she said, ``we're not going to be able to prevent them all. 
There is no way we can do that. And we have got to be prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general said that of particular concern was ``the  
threat of a cyberattack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just now in this past year, we have been able to see instances  
in which 17- and 18-year-old hackers can intrude into sensitive 
computers across this country. If they can do that, our 
cybersystem, our cyberinfrastructure, is at risk,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said that government agencies are working together ``with  
personnel and technology that can match the wits of the smartest 
criminals and the smartest terrorist.'' But she said states and the 
private sector need to do more to fight this new brand of 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said security at U.S. embassies around the world has  
been strengthened considerably since simultaneous bombings last 
Aug. 7 at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania killed 224 
people, including 12 Americans. She also said the administration's 
five-year plan for combating terrorism is progressing. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, there is much to be done. ``Our strategy must be  
long-term. The five-year plan is only the beginning. Certainly no 
single arrest or shutdown of a terrorist operation will be 
sufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The advance of technology has given us new means to counter  
terrorists, but it has also enabled terrorists to develop more 
powerful weapons and to travel, communicate, recruit and raise 
funds on a global basis,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh testified before a  
Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the budgets of 
their agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., the subcommittee chairman, said  
President Clinton's budget request for $300 million to upgrade 
embassy security next year falls about $700 million short of what 
he said an interagency study panel said was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg said the president's entire anti-terrorism program, which  
also includes a request for $2.8 billion in new spending, appeared 
to be ``put together on the back of an envelope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Albright defended the program. ``I think we are at the  
beginning stages. ... We're working very hard and I think we all 
need to work together on this,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh told the panel that during fiscal 1998, which ended last  
Sept. 30, the FBI had ``prevented 10 planned terrorist acts'' 
through its investigations, nine of which he said were planned by 
an Illinois-based white supremacist group that plotted to bomb 
buildings across the country.

<HEADLINE> Ritts Resigns as LPGA Commissioner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The LPGA Tour wanted Jim Ritts as its commissioner because of  
his background in television. It's losing him for the very same 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritts, the marketing whiz who helped women's golf nearly double  
its television exposure in just three years, resigned Friday to 
become chief operating officer of Digital Entertainment Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital Entertainment delivers television-quality programming to  
the Internet. Ritts joins a management team led by former Walt 
Disney Television Network president David Neuman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was really a difficult decision because of my passion for  
the LPGA,'' Ritts said from LPGA headquarters in Daytona Beach, 
Fla. ``But everybody knows what's occurring with the Internet. This 
is really a chance to maybe shape that part of the world in 
entertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ritts will stay with the LPGA for 45 days and then be replaced  
by Ty Votaw, the tour's vice president of business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritts said he decided to take the new job on Sunday. He mailed  
overnight letters to every player Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it surprised everybody,'' said Dottie Pepper. ``I  
guess you could say the LPGA can keep a lid on leaks a lot better 
than the government. It sounds to me like Jim is going back into 
the field where he came from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes on the final day of voting for sweeping  
changes in the criteria for the LPGA Hall of Fame, which has been 
in the works for 14 years. Also, the LPGA recently signed up a 
development tour -- similar to the Nike Tour in men's golf -- that 
was one of Ritts' projects when he became commissioner in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But his legacy in just three years will be television. The LPGA  
had only 19 events televised in 1995, compared to 33 this year. As 
a result, purses increased nearly 50 percent during his tenure, 
from $24.4 million in 1995 to $36.2 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``His vision and marketing savvy have propelled the LPGA to the  
forefront of women's sports,'' said Andrew Shepard, chairman of the 
LPGA Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritts wasn't popular with all the players and several longtime  
LPGA employees left during his tenure. But even Pepper, who said 
she didn't always see eye-to-eye with Ritts, said he was steadying 
influence during some choppy times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all went through transition,'' she said. ``From a stability  
standpoint, Jim was there for an important part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ritts came to the LPGA in 1996 after serving as president for  
network affairs at Channel One Communications, where he worked with 
Neuman and Edward Winter, now the chief marketing officer for DEN. 
</P>
<P>
	He also spent six years with the New York advertising agency of  
Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, Inc., where at age 27 he became its 
youngest vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we are in the beginning stages of a communication,  
information and cultural revolution, perhaps only seen previously 
during the Industrial Revolution,'' Ritts said. ``I am not willing 
to sit on the sidelines while these momentous changes unfold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, the LPGA went through some big changes during his  
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the increase in television exposure -- a record 238 hours  
last year -- came in an agreement with Mercury to show as many as 10 
events on ESPN. He also managed to replace title sponsors whenever 
the LPGA lost them. 
</P>
<P>
	His arrival coincided with the emergence of foreign stars on the  
LPGA such as Annika Sorenstam, Karrie Webb and Se Ri Pak. Along 
with more television, Ritts launched the tour's first national 
advertising campaign to promote its players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the places I've been, the LPGA experience has been the  
one I treasure and value the most,'' Ritts said. ``I feel very much 
in my heart that we left it better than we found it. And we've left 
it in very good hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Votaw, a 37-year-old lawyer, came to the LPGA in 1991. He was  
general counsel and special assistant to former commissioner 
Charlie Meacham, and later worked on tournament sponsorship and 
television negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows the LPGA from the inside out,'' said Cindy McCurdy,  
president of the LPGA executive committee. ``We could have spent 
months and months looking, but I know we would not find a better 
candidate than Ty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The LPGA also said it would restructure its front office by  
creating a new position -- chief operating officer -- to assist 
Votaw.

<HEADLINE> Anthrax Scare in D.C., Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Packages said to contain the potentially  
deadly bacterium anthrax forced police in the nation's capital to 
halt traffic on streets near The Washington Post's offices and 
Atlanta officials to evacuate several floors of an office building. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities on Thursday retrieved packages in two District of  
Columbia and two Georgia locations, but later said the claims 
seemed to be hoaxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and FBI agents retrieved parcels delivered to the  
newspaper and the Old Executive Office Building. In Atlanta, police 
cordoned off a four-block area after a package was delivered to the 
NBC News bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a postal worker in Columbus, Ga., opened a parcel with  
a note reading, ``You have been exposed to anthrax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the past is any indication, this is all a hoax,'' said FBI  
spokesman Frank Scafidi. ``In Los Angeles a few weeks ago, these 
things were popping all over the place. These sound similar to 
those widely reported incidents. It sounds like another spike, just 
more of the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, an analysis showed that the substance contained  
inside the package received by the newspaper was harmless. FBI 
Agent Elisa Foster said package ``contained rambling threats and 
claimed that whoever opened the letter was exposed to a poisonous 
substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after noon, FBI agents entered the Old Executive Office  
Building next to the White House to retrieve the second package. No 
details on that parcel were immediately available, but the building 
was not evacuated. The building houses offices of members of the 
president's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, several floors of the building where the NBC bureau  
is located were evacuated and about a dozen people went through 
decontamination showers set up by emergency officials. Some were 
then taken to hospitals as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency officials in Georgia said they were not sure if either  
of the packages actually contained dangerous material. It was not 
clear when lab tests would be completed.

	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Cancer-stricken King Hussein lay dying in a  
hospital bed Friday as hundreds of Jordanians wept outside his 
window, some offering up their own organs to their leader of 46 
years. Royal palace sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said the king's brain had stopped functioning and that his liver 
and kidneys had failed. A respirator kept Hussein breathing, but 
the end could come within hours or days, sources said. The king's 
family did not want to take the 63-year-old Hussein off life

trial, Ms. Lewinsky says she now has ``mixed feelings'' for

Indiana authorities also must now decide whether the 32-year-old 
former heavyweight champion violated his probation for a 1991 rape 
conviction. Tyson was released in 1995 after serving three years of

	Chernobyl Reactor To Stay Idle

Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which has been shut for repairs for 
almost two months, will stay idle at least until March 2, officials 
said Friday. Chernobyl's reactor No. 3 was temporarily closed on 
Dec. 15, and original plans called for the reactor to come back on 
line Feb. 16. But the state nuclear energy company Energoatom said 
it needed more time to fix the reactor. Chernobyl is the site of 
the world's worst nuclear accident, when an explosion and fire at 
reactor No. 4 in 1986 spewed radiation over large parts of Europe.

<HEADLINE> FedEx Pilots Approve 1st Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Federal Express Corp. and its pilots union  
finally have a work contract after years of squabbling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fedex Pilots Association announced Thursday that 86 percent  
of its voting members approved the five-year deal, which takes 
effect May 31. The tally was 2,516-395. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes 2 1/2 months after the pilots backed down from a  
threat to strike and makes the pilots the only FedEx employees in 
the U.S. represented by a union. The haggling over a contract has 
gone on since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract ratification gives the company and the union a  
starting point for putting their differences behind them, said Paul 
Schlesinger, a market analyst for Donald Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great opportunity for the company and the pilots and  
everybody else to get on with their lives. ... If they can do that 
and forget about the tensions that were created, they'll all be 
better off,'' Schlesinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's 3,600 flight crew members will get a 17 percent  
pay raise over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the pilots originally sought a 24 percent raise over four  
years, the union said its members were pleased with company 
concessions on flight scheduling and retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives FedEx pilots the best retirement package in the  
airline industry,'' said union president Frank Fato. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract boosts pension payments from 41 percent of a  
pilot's final-year pay to 72.5 percent. For a 30-year veteran who 
flies the company's largest cargo jets and earns $225,000, the 
increase amounts to $70,875 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots, for the first time, also will have some control over  
flight schedules, and a committee of pilots and company managers 
will handle complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	A new scheduling system put in place last year by the company  
often had pilots hustling to catch connecting flights or making too 
many takeoffs and landings, the union said. 
</P>
<P>
	``(That is) a complete change in philosophy that allows us to  
get in and work with the company to provide the rules that are 
going to make our lives tolerable for the remainder of our 
careers,'' Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx president Ted Weise said the contract makes the pilots'  
salaries competitive with those at other major airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	'' ... And it recognizes the vital contributions they provide in  
maintaining FedEx's leadership position in our industry,'' Weise 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Line Pilots Association represented FedEx pilots when  
they first started working toward a contract. Over the years, the 
pilots twice rejected proposed contracts recommended by their union 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fedex Pilots Association took over in 1996. Its leadership  
endorsed the contract in December and mailed ballots to members 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots threatened a holiday-season strike in October after  
contract talks broke off. FedEx began leasing planes and crews from 
other companies in preparation for a walkout. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx declines discussing particulars of those contracts.  
</P>
<P>
	The contract talks resumed Nov. 20 after FedEx founder and FDX  
chairman Frederick Smith warned the pilots they could lose their 
jobs if they went on strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Davies said he's hopeful subsequent contract negotiations will  
be smoother. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we were trying to swallow the apple whole ...  
everything was at issue,'' he said. ``This will make transition 
into the next round of negotiations I believe a lot easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Memphis-based FedEx was founded in 1973 and is owned by FDX  
Corp. It has 145,000 employees worldwide and ships more than 3 
million items to 211 countries each day.

<HEADLINE> Daughter Tells of Wynette's End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tammy Wynette was taking narcotics and  
wanted a divorce from her fifth husband when she died last year, 
according to one of her daughters who wants her mother's body 
exhumed and an autopsy done. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackie Daly said she has no evidence of wrongdoing. She just  
wants to erase any doubt about what killed her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd just like to know what happened for some kind of peace of  
mind for myself. I'd hate to think I'd have to go forever and not 
know what happened,'' she told The Associated Press on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynette's manager-husband, George Richey, found her body in  
their Nashville home April 6. Wynette's personal doctor, Wallis 
Marsh, flew in from Pittsburgh that evening and listed the cause of 
death as a blood clot to the lungs. No autopsy was performed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If in fact it was a blood clot, then that's terrific,'' Daly  
said. ``So be it and there's closure and that's all we're wanting 
to know. If it was drug-related or ... liver failure or whatever -- 
then I would also like to know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly and two of her sisters, Tina Jones and Georgette Smith,  
wrote letters to Dr. Bruce Levy, Nashville's medical examiner, and 
the district attorney's office in November asking for an autopsy, 
Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
	They got no response until the request became public last week  
after an employee in the medical examiner's office tried to sell 
one of letters to a supermarket tabloid, Daly said. The sisters 
plan to meet with Levy on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynette, who was 55 when she died, had 20 No. 1 hits, including  
her anthem, ``Stand By Your Man.'' But she endured health problems 
for much of her life, including intestinal scarring from several 
surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	``At one point in time she was taking (the painkiller) Stadol,  
she took Valium, she took Demerol,'' Daly said. ``They were all 
prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last years, I don't what she was taking, but if they do  
an autopsy they will most definitely find several different kind of 
narcotics in her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wynette was married to Richey for 20 years, longer than any of  
her other husbands. Daly said her mother wanted to leave Richey, 
but was scared. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told me on several occasions that she wanted to divorce  
him,'' Daly said. She didn't because she was afraid of him and 
worried about what her fans would think, Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richey did not return a phone message left Friday afternoon at  
Tammy Wynette Enterprises, which he runs.

<HEADLINE> Careless Smoking Cited in Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Careless smoking started an early morning fire  
that spread rapidly through a downtown apartment high-rise Friday, 
killing an elderly tenant as she made her way down 30 flights, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven other people were injured.  
</P>
<P>
	An occupant of the 15th floor apartment where the blaze began  
noticed his couch on fire and tried to put it out with a blanket, 
fire spokesman Hector Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
	The blanket caught fire and the occupant opened a window,  
providing additional oxygen that helped spread flames to the 18th 
floor of Charles Towers, Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping the window closed ``probably would have contained the  
fire a great deal more than when we arrived on the scene,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents fled to the roof and were met by firefighters  
lowered from helicopters. Other tenants frantically dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
	Johncie Montgomery, 72, died of a heart attack as a firefighter  
led her down from her 30th floor apartment. Ten other residents 
were treated for smoke inhalation, and a firefighter suffered a 
second-degree burn to his left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire caused $3 million in damage.

<HEADLINE> Ford Plant Blast Triggered by Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Gas buildup inside the boiler of an electrical  
power station at the Ford Motor Co. Rouge complex caused the 
explosion that killed one worker and injured at least 20 others, a 
state inspector said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's blast destroyed the power station, killed a 58-year-old  
pipe fitter and left 15 people in critical condition. It cut off 
power and shut down production at the 1,100-acre complex where 
10,000 people work. 
</P>
<P>
	A boiler inspector from the state Department of Consumer and  
Industry Services examined the remains of the coal-fired power 
plant Thursday and traced the origin of the blast to a furnace 
explosion. Dave Johnson said gas built up inside the firebox of the 
boiler and then ignited. 
</P>
<P>
	The firebox generated heat that turned water into steam to power  
the plant's electrical generators. The steam also powered other 
factory operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The boiler was made in 1965 and was one of the newer ones at the  
Rouge complex, which has some boilers dating from the 1930s, agency 
spokeswoman Maura Campbell said. It last was inspected Feb. 20, 
1998, and was due soon for an annual check. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably the last thing we'll be able to do for a  
while,'' Ms. Campbell said. ``A lot of the other questions are 
going to take some time to answer, like why was there a buildup of 
gas in the boiler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another key question is what ignited the gas, the agency said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ford is pushing to resume full production on Monday at the  
complex, which makes Ford Mustangs as well as engines and a variety 
of other vehicle components used at 16 of Ford's 20 North American 
assembly plants.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Takes Blame for Affidavit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After listening to audio tapes of her  
discussing a presidential affair, Americans now can watch Monica 
Lewinsky answering questions on videotape at President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors and the White House defense team got to pick  
and choose portions of Ms. Lewinsky's deposition taken last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of that recording was expected to be shown today at the  
televised trial. Snippets of presidential friend Vernon Jordan's 
deposition and parts of White House aide Sidney Blumenthal's 
testimony also were likely to be aired. 
</P>
<P>
	The session is the last before closing arguments, scheduled for  
Monday, but could be affected at the last minute if King Hussein of 
Jordan dies. A number of senators would be expected to attend 
services for the respected monarch. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Lewinsky tapes were readied for their first public  
airing, support also seemed to be growing Friday to conduct final 
deliberations in open session. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of Senate Republicans embraced the idea, which most  
Democrats already supported. But a two-thirds majority will be 
needed to change rules that call for closed debate before the final 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	With Clinton's acquittal on impeachment charges virtually  
assured, Senate Republicans and Democrats are quietly jockeying 
over how strongly -- if at all -- he should be censured for his 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and his efforts to conceal it. 
Conviction and removal from office requires 67 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, ready to vote overwhelmingly and possibly unanimously  
against conviction, favor a formal condemnation. Sens. Dianne 
Feinstein, D-Calif., and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., are 
leading a drafting effort in hopes the Senate will vote on it at 
when the trial ends late next week. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent draft cited Clinton for ``shameless, reckless and  
indefensible behavior'' and said his conduct demeaned his office 
and ``creates disrespect for the laws of the land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans favor censure. They include Sen. John Chafee of  
Rhode Island, who says of Clinton's behavior, ``We believe this is 
just plain wrong ... that it's harmful for the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are obvious difficulties in reaching agreement on terms  
satisfactory to both Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid that once the (Democratic proposal) is out there  
will be many critics of the president who will argue it's not 
strong enough, and if this turns into an escalation of humiliation, 
it will fall apart,'' Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans are opposed to censure, and one, Texas Sen.  
Phil Gramm, has all but threatened a filibuster to block it, in 
part on constitutional grounds. ``You either remove the president 
(by convicting him on an article of impeachment) or you have no 
ability to transcend the line that represents the separation of 
power,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	In a transcript of her deposition released by the Senate on  
Friday, Ms. Lewinsky seemed to retain sentimental feelings about 
her relationship with the president. At different times, she 
supported and undercut his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	In one matter, she backed the president's contention that he  
never told her to file a false affidavit in the Paula Jones civil 
lawsuit denying their extramarital affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing a middle-of-the-night telephone conversation with  
Clinton, Ms. Lewinsky said she thought to herself that she would 
deny the relationship because she and Clinton had always planned to 
use ``cover stories'' to conceal their affair. 
</P>
<P>
	But she remained at odds with Clinton on other matters --  
including his denial that he touched her in intimate areas. While 
testifying she didn't ``feel comfortable characterizing'' his 
comments as truthful or not, Ms. Lewinsky asserted: ``I know I've 
testified to what I believe is true.''

<HEADLINE> House Members Want Trial Over Quick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man who rose in the public gallery of the  
Senate and shouted, ``God almighty, take the vote and get it over 
with!'' wins no support from those concerned with the chamber's 
rules and decorum. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sentiment is widespread, shared even by some of the  
House Republicans who set the impeachment trial in motion. 
</P>
<P>
	In the face of ominous polls and the near certainty President  
Clinton will survive the trial, Republican House lawmakers see 
little point in dragging it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost everyone, even people who are convinced that Clinton's  
actions were reprehensible -- even those voters are wanting this 
entire matter over,'' said Rep. Richard Baker, a Louisiana 
Republican who won a seventh term in a squeaker in November. ``So I 
think the nation has had enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from the trial managers, House members are now free from  
Monica Lewinsky. Republicans among them expressed no wish to 
second-guess those they elected to carry the fight forward. ``I am 
extremely proud of their integrity,'' declared Rep. Tom Coburn, 
R-Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the hunger to close this convulsive chapter in Washington  
-- and ease the threat that voters will punish the GOP in 2000 -- was 
palpable. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's light at the end of the tunnel,'' says Republican Rep.  
Mark Foley of Florida. ``I just hope that a boulder doesn't fall on 
the tracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House managers, however, pressed on Thursday, pleading  
unsuccessfully with the Senate to allow at least Ms. Lewinsky to 
testify in person in what's left of the trial. The Senate rejected 
that idea, 70-30, with 25 Republicans joining all 45 Democrats in 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	A spectator, Richard Douglas Llamas, 48, of the District of  
Columbia, was arrested after he rose in the gallery and shouted for 
the senators to get it over with. He was escorted from the gallery 
and charged with disruption of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the talk in the nation about ``moving on,'' most House  
members already have. Regular business has returned since their 
impeachment vote Dec. 19 -- a trade bill here, an hour-long speech 
to an empty chamber there, not to mention committee meetings on the 
budget of the president they impeached. 
</P>
<P>
	With one seat vacant and the 13 serving as trial managers, that  
leaves 421 able to throw themselves back into the blend of foreign, 
national and local matters that constitute normalcy. 
</P>
<P>
	But they cannot entirely escape the issue still gripping the  
other half of the Capitol. Not even in historic Williamsburg, Va., 
at a leafy Republican retreat surely rustling with chatter about 
the impeachment endgame. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be omnipresent in the background,'' Rep. Greg Ganske  
of Iowa predicted Thursday before heading down to the annual 
get-together. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite polls indicating Americans are unhappy with the conduct  
of the trial and blame the GOP, many Republicans are reluctant to 
leave their band of 13 twisting in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're trying to fulfill their constitutional  
obligations, and that may or may not be politically smart,'' said 
Rep. Ernest Fletcher of Kentucky, a freshman Republican who won a 
narrow victory in the fall. ``But I think in the long run it will 
be well-respected by the American people and by history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we do is a dilemma,'' Foley said. ``They are doing  
the best they can in a very difficult situation. They are being 
pilloried in a number of circles ... but I don't fault them for 
what they are doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker senses that the majority of his constituents want the  
impeachment articles to come to a vote, not for the trial to simply 
peter out. ``Whatever the vote outcome is, they can certainly live 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are as reflexively critical of the managers as the  
Republicans are supportive. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't represent my House,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler,  
D-Fla. ``It's abundantly clear they ... don't represent the 
American people.''

<HEADLINE> Profit-Taking Hurts Palladium  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After four days of trading higher on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange, silver futures prices gave up a large portion of their 
gains Friday as profit-taking hit the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver gave up about half of the gains made in Thursday's  
trading, however prices remain more than 60 cents higher than they 
were at the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, palladium prices fell despite continued  
concern over the lack of supply from Russia, cattle and hog futures 
gained, and energy futures prices suffered from unusually warm 
weather for this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures prices were hit by profit-taking after rising to  
levels not seen since July. The strength of silver has been due to 
strong demand from developing nations, particularly India, where 
there is a burgeoning market for jewelry and other products that 
use silver, said analyst James Steel of Refco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also a strong demand for silver coin and bars, with  
increased purchases of film, in which silver is a key ingredient, 
also giving futures a boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears that silver production will not meet demand also gave  
silver futures a boost this week, Steel said. Although the 
shortfall will be made up from stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger dollar, which nearly always adversely affects  
precious metals, contributed to Friday's selloff, according to 
Steel. There was also a reluctance to carry the week's profits over 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver for March delivery settled 11.8 cents lower at $5.642 a  
troy ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness in silver carried over into the gold market.  
</P>
<P>
	March gold was .70 cents lower at $289.80 a troy ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Profit-taking also sent palladium futures prices tumbling on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange, despite continued concerns about 
deliveries of the metal by Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	As in years past, Russia is beset by production problems caused  
electrical shortages, antiquated machinery and unpaid workers. It 
has not been unusual in recent years for Russia, the world's 
leading producer, to hold back deliveries of the metal used in auto 
catalytic converters and electronic equipment until mid-year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past they have cannibalized stocks to meet demand. There  
is now a fear Russia no longer has available stocks to cover the 
production shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium for March delivery was $16.70 lower at $346 a troy  
ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy futures prices continue to be dogged by the unseasonably  
warm temperatures blanketing the Northeast and the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	March light sweet crude was 22 cents lower at $11.80 a barrel;  
March heating oil was .55 cent lower at 30.80 cents a gallon; March 
unleaded gasoline was .76 cent lower at 34.99 a gallon; March 
natural gas was 1.9 cents lower at $1.810 per 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and pork futures prices were higher in trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Live hog futures prices were higher on expectations the U.S.  
Agriculture Department will buy hogs as part of a food-aid package 
for Russia. Prices also received a boost from a slowdown in hog 
slaughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical factors and the expectation of higher cash prices in  
coming weeks gave a boost to cattle futures prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle for February delivery were .58 cent higher at 65.25 cents  
a pound; March feeder cattle were .47 cent higher at 74.77 cents a 
pound; February lean hogs were .97 cent higher at 43.42 cents a 
pound; February pork bellies were 2.45 cents higher at 62.10 cents 
a pound.

<HEADLINE> NBA Opening Night Is Here </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Three months late, the NBA season finally arrived.  
</P>
<P>
	The post-Jordan era began Friday night with a dozen games on  
opening night, featuring Scottie Pippen with Houston, Latrell 
Sprewell with New York, Dominique and Gerald Wilkins with Orlando 
and the Chicago Bulls with too many problems to count. 
</P>
<P>
	``That guy's in a tough situation,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said  
of new Bulls coach Tim Floyd. ``I'm sure he'll make the best of it, 
but it would be a really tough thing to do what he's doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls and Jazz played in a rematch of the NBA finals, and 11  
other games were on the schedule: Washington at Indiana, 
Philadelphia at Charlotte, Cleveland at Atlanta, Detroit at Miami, 
Toronto at Boston, New York at Orlando, Sacramento at San Antonio, 
Minnesota at Denver, Dallas at Seattle, Houston at the Los Angeles 
Lakers and Phoenix at the Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Oddsmakers made the champion Bulls the biggest underdogs of the  
night, installing Utah as a 15-point favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Another seven games are on tap for Saturday night, with New  
Jersey, Vancouver, Golden State, Milwaukee, Portland and Seattle 
playing their season openers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine games will be played Sunday including NBC's first  
doubleheader -- Miami at New York or Indiana at Detroit in the early 
game and Utah at the Lakers in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's important to start with a little more urgency and  
get some wins early on,'' Phoenix Suns coach Danny Ainge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams will play 50 games apiece during 90 days, with the regular  
season ending May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	What remains to be seen is how the fans will respond.  
</P>
<P>
	When the baseball strike ended in 1995, the backlash from the  
public was fierce. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime fans stopped going to games, casual fans stopped  
watching on TV and a trio of New Yorkers ran onto the field at Shea 
Stadium and threw $1 bills at the players, a la Abbie Hoffman's 
famous protest on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	No one is quite certain how any fan backlash might manifest  
itself in the NBA, but the league has been taking steps to mend 
fences with its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to do some damage control, I guess,'' Grant Hill told  
the Detroit Free Press. ``Personally, I don't think free tickets 
and autograph sessions are going to do it. I think that's kind of 
phony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the best way to do it is to go out and play hard and  
win. I think you'll see -- and the cities that win, the cities that 
are in the playoffs -- the fans will come back. And the cities that 
have losing teams, they'll be a little lukewarm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers-Rockets game found Pippen starting the season in the  
uniform of a team other than the Bulls for the first time in his 
NBA career. After playing alongside one superstar, Michael Jordan, 
he'll play alongside two -- Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley -- in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, who was suspended for 68 games last season for choking  
his coach, was set to play his first game in more than 14 months 
when the Knicks, who traded three players to Golden State for him, 
traveled to Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic have united the Wilkins brothers. They signed  
39-year-old free agent Dominique, a nine-time All-Star, to play 
alongside his brother, Gerald. Dominique Wilkins, last seen in the 
NBA during the 1996-97 season, spent part of last year playing in 
Italy.

<HEADLINE> Some Rusty on NBA Opening Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The NBA season finally opened with Scottie Pippen, Latrell  
Sprewell, Antonio McDyess and Chris Webber in new uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Not one of them walked off the court a winner.  
</P>
<P>
	Pippen struggled with his shooting, Sprewell's team fell behind  
by 21, McDyess's return didn't stop the Nuggets from losing again 
and Webber couldn't get Sacramento a win. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the players in new places, it was Toronto's Kevin Willis  
who had the most eventful night. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis had 28 points and 16 rebounds as the Raptors opened the  
season with a 103-92 win over Boston, and Willis also made sure a 
couple fans left the arena a few dollars richer. 
</P>
<P>
	A fan walked on the court at the Fleet Center in Boston with  
3:46 gone in the third quarter and threw several dollar bills on 
the floor before being escorted away by security personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis laughed as he picked them up and handed them to two fans  
in the front row. But he was serious after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was very tasteless, very classless,'' he said. ``We come  
out to entertain and if you don't like it, be man enough to walk 
out of the arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was one of the few signs of fan disenchantment because of  
the lockout as 12 games were played on an opening night that came 
94 days late. 
</P>
<P>
	In other games, the Los Angeles Lakers beat Houston 99-91, 	
Orlando topped New York 93-85, Minnesota beat Denver 110-92, San 
Antonio defeated Sacramento 101-83, Indiana downed Washington 
96-81, Atlanta beat Cleveland 100-83, Philadelphia topped Charlotte 
78-66, Detroit defeated Miami 95-81, Utah downed Chicago 104-96, 
Seattle edged Dallas 92-86 in overtime and Phoenix defeated the Los 
Angeles Clippers 101-92.	
</P>
<P>
                        *Lakers 99, Rockets 91 	
</P>
<P>
	At Inglewood, Calif., Shaquille O'Neal had 30 points and 14  
rebounds, and Bryant added 25 points and a career-high 10 rebounds 
to spoil Pippen's debut with the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, who brought the six NBA championship rings he earned in  
Chicago to Houston on Jan. 22, had 10 points, nine rebounds, seven 
assists and five steals in his Rockets debut. But he was only 
4-for-18 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Barkley appeared in midseason form, both in scoring and  
jawing. He led the Rockets with 31 points and 15 rebounds, and took 
time out to utter expletives at fans in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Magic 93, Knicks 85    	
</P>
<P>
	At Orlando, Nick Anderson scored 19 points and Orlando held off  
a late rally led by Sprewell to ruin the controversial guard's 
debut with the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, who lost more than $6 million in salary during his  
68-game suspension for choking his coach, finished with 24 points 
and led a fourth-quarter rally that trimmed a 21-point deficit to 
87-82 in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Timberwolves 110, Nuggets 92    	
</P>
<P>
	At Denver, Stephon Marbury had 21 points and 10 assists and  
Minnesota led from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Smith added 23 points on 10-of-11 shooting for the  
Timberwolves. McDyess led the Nuggets with 18 points, and Nick Van 
Exel had 17 points and 10 assists. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Spurs 101, Kings 83    	
</P>
<P>
	At San Antonio, Tim Duncan launched his second season with 19  
points and 17 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Elliott, returning from a knee injury that sidelined him  
the second half of last season, added 14 points for the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Pacers 96, Wizards 81    	
</P>
<P>
	At Indianapolis, Chris Mullin scored Indiana's first 10 points  
and the Pacers took a lead they never lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Jalen Rose scored 11 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter and  
Indiana capitalized on a 29-9 advantage from the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased with the way the starters played. We had more  
than five guys who played well,'' said coach Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Hawks 100, Cavaliers 83    	
</P>
<P>
	At Atlanta, Steve Smith scored 21 points and the Hawks outscored  
Cleveland 24-4 in the final eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought in spots we played pretty darn good,'' coach Lenny  
Wilkens said. ``Down the stretch, we played smart and took over the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announced crowd of 19,806 was the largest for an opener in  
team history -- almost 2,600 more than the first game at the Georgia 
Dome last season. Hoping to lure back fans after the lockout, the 
Hawks sold about half the seats in the cavernous arena for $10. 
</P>
<P>
                        *76ers 78, Hornets 66    	
</P>
<P>
	The 76ers won in Charlotte for the first time in nearly seven  
years, holding the Hornets to 34 percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte was without its two best players, Glen Rice and  
Anthony Mason, who are recovering from elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Derrick Coleman had four shots blocked and put up two airballs  
in his debut for the Hornets. He had 11 points on 4-for-13 shooting 
and added 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Pistons 95, Heat 81    	
</P>
<P>
	At Miami, Jerry Stackhouse scored 24 points off the bench Grant  
Hill had 19 points for the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
	The defeat was an unexpected blow for Miami, which lost only 11  
home games all last season in winning the Atlantic Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came in here and laid an egg -- a big one,'' Miami's Tim  
Hardaway said. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Jazz 104, Bulls 96    	
</P>
<P>
	At Salt Lake City, Karl Malone had 21 points as the Utah Jazz  
overcame a stunning shooting display by Toni Kukoc to beat Chicago 
on the floor where Michael Jordan clinched the Bulls' sixth title 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc, who may thrive under new coach Tim Floyd, scored 22 of  
his 32 points in the second half and nearly brought the Bulls back 
from an 18-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
                   *SuperSonics 92, Mavericks 86, OT    	
</P>
<P>
	At Seattle, Gary Payton scored six of his 28 points in overtime  
as Seattle opened its season under new coach Paul Westphal. 
</P>
<P>
	Vin Baker added 18 points, while Olden Polynice, Seattle's new  
center, had 11 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	For Dallas, which lost 62 games last season, Cedric Ceballos led  
the way with 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Suns 101, Clippers 92    	
</P>
<P>
	At Los Angeles, Tom Gugliotta had 24 points and 17 rebounds for  
his new team. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta, signed as a free agent from the Minnesota  
Timberwolves, shot 7-of-14 from the field and 10-of-13 on free 
throws. The Suns used a 17-0 run in the first 5 1/2 minutes of the 
second half to take the lead for good.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Debate Cisneros Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The lawyer for Henry Cisneros is trying to  
convince a federal appeals court that the former housing secretary 
should not be prosecuted for his statements to FBI investigators 
looking into his payments to a former mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros hopes to convince a three-judge panel of the U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that an 
independent counsel wrongly charged him with obstructing the 
investigation and lying to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Barry Simon argued Thursday that because presidents have  
the sole constitutional power to pick Cabinet nominees, what 
Cisneros told the FBI is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, after all, could ignore any information the FBI gave  
him, Simon told the judges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question of the FBI is only relevant to the extent that  
the president decides it is,'' Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon did not address whether Cisneros did, in fact, lie.  
</P>
<P>
	Mathew Rosengart, a prosecutor for Independent Counsel David  
Barrett, called Simon's argument a ``red herring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett charged Cisneros lied to investigators during his  
routine background check before President-elect Bill Clinton named 
him to his first Cabinet in early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	A 21-count indictment claims Cisneros vastly underreported the  
amount he had paid a former mistress. He also allegedly lied about 
the timing of payments to the woman, Linda Jones, then known by her 
married name of Medlar. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros has pleaded innocent. His trial is on hold until the  
appeals panel rules on his challenge of the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros won Senate confirmation in 1993 and served as housing  
secretary until 1996, when he resigned to become president of 
Univision Communications Inc. He retained Clinton's support 
throughout the investigation into the payments to Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	The court system has no business prying into the Cabinet  
selection process, Cisneros' lawyers argued. A lower federal court 
disagreed and refused the throw out the indictment last July. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question of nomination is a wholly political process,''  
Simon argued to the openly skeptical judges.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Jordan Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts of Vernon Jordan's deposition testimony from Feb. 2:  
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutor Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.: You have  
testified, I believe, five times previously before the federal 
grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And so I know that probably about every question  
that could be asked has been asked, but there are a number of 
reasons I want to go over additional questions with you, and some 
of them will be repetitious of what's been asked before. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to coming in today, though, have you had the opportunity  
to review your prior testimony in those five appearances before the 
grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I have done some preparation, congressman.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And let me start with the fact that the oath that  
you took today is the same as the oath that you took before the 
federal grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe that's correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And, Mr. Jordan, what is your profession?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I am a lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And how is it that you are able to obtain enough  
business for 800 lawyers? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I don't think that's my entire responsibility. I'm just  
one of 800 lawyers, and that is what I do in part, but I'm not 
alone in that process of making rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: When you say 'making rain,' that's the terminology  
of being a rainmaker? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I think even in Arkansas, you understand what rainmaking  
is. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: We've read Grisham books.  
</P>
<P>
	And so, when you say making rain or being a rainmaker, that is  
to bring in business so that you can keep the lawyers busy 
practicing law? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, that is -- that is part and parcel of the practice  
of law. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: When you did bill by the hour, what was your  
billable rate the last time you had to do that? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe my billable rate at the last time was  
somewhere between $450 and $500 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, would you describe --  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Not bad for a Georgia boy. I'm from Georgia. You've  
heard of that state, I'm sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: It's probably not bad from Washington standards.  
Would you describe the nature of your relationship with President 
Clinton? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: President Clinton has been a friend of mine since  
approximately 1973, when I came to your state, Arkansas, to make a 
speech as president of the National Urban League about race and 
equal opportunity in our nation, and we met then and there, and our 
friendship has grown and developed and matured and he is my friend 
and will continue to be my friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And just to further elaborate on that friendship,  
it's my understanding that he and his -- and the first lady has had 
Christmas Eve dinner with you and your family for a number of 
years? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Every year since his presidency, the Jordan family has  
been privileged to entertain the Clinton family on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And has there been any exceptions in recent years to  
that? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Every year that he has been president, he has had, he  
and his family, Christmas Eve with my family. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And have you vacationed together with the Clinton  
family? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes. I think you have seen reels of us playing golf and  
having fun at Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And so you vacation together, you play golf together  
on a semi-regular basis? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Whenever we can. We've not been doing it recently, for  
reasons that I think are probably very obvious to you, counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Well, explain that to me.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Just what I said, for a time, I was going before the  
grand jury, and under the advice of counsel and I'm sure under 
advice of the president's counsel, it was thought best that we not 
play golf together. So, from the time that I first went to the 
grand jury, I don't think -- we have not played golf this year, 
unfortunately, together. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Have you had any private conversations with the  
president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes, I have, as a matter of fact.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And has this been on the telephone or in person?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I've talked to him on the telephone, and I talked to him  
at the Vineyard. He was at my house on Christmas Eve. There were a 
lot of people around, but, yes, I've talked to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you discuss your testimony before the grand  
jury or his testimony before the grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I did not.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: If I understand your question about whether or not the  
president of the United States and I talked about my testimony 
before the grand jury or his testimony before the grand jury, I can 
say to you unequivocally that the president of the United States 
and I have not discussed our testimony. I was advised by my 
counsel, Mr. Hundley, not to discuss that testimony, and I have 
learned in this process, Mr. Hutchinson, to -- to take the advice of 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Did you, subsequent to your last testimony before  
the grand jury, talk to the president in which you discussed 
conversation that you have had with Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I have not discussed a conversation that I have had with  
Monica Lewinsky with the president of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And have you had any discussions about Monica  
Lewinsky with the president of the United States since your last 
testimony before the grand jury? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I have not.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I had not at any time discussed the Lewinsky matter with  
-- with Howard Gittis. And so I had breakfast with him to tell him 
that reporters were calling, that this would obviously involve 
Revlon, which had responded to my -- my efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky 
employment, and so Howard Gittis is a friend of mine. Howard Gittis 
is a fellow board member with me at Revlon. He is the Vice Chairman 
of McAndrews &AMP; Forbes, and I thought it -- I thought I had -- it was 
incumbent upon me to stop and say, `Listen, there's trouble 
a-brewing.' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Was there some news stories that had mentioned your  
name in reference to Ms. Lewinsky and the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe that my name has been an integral part of this  
process from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you in fact have the breakfast meeting with  
Mr. Gittis? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes, I did.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And what information did you convey to Mr. Gittis  
concerning Ms. Lewinsky at that breakfast meeting? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I just simply said that the press was calling about Ms.  
Lewinsky; that while I had not dealt with him, I had dealt with 
Richard Halperin, I had dealt with Ronald Perelman. I had not dealt 
with him, but that he ought to know and that I was sorry about 
this. And I also said that it would probably be even more 
complicated because early on I had referred Webb Hubbell to them to 
be hired as counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And I want to get to that in just a moment, but you  
indicated that you said you were sorry. Were you referring to the 
problems that this might create for the company? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, I was obviously concerned. I am a director. I am  
their counsel. They're my friends. And publicity was breaking. I 
thought I had some responsibility to them to give them a heads-up 
as to what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, is it true that your efforts to find a job for  
Ms. Lewinsky that you referenced in that meeting with Mr. Gittis -- 
were your efforts carried out at the request of the president of 
the United States? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: There is no question but that through Betty Currie, I  
was acting on behalf of the president to get Ms. Lewinsky a job. I 
think that's clear from my grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Okay. And I just want to make sure that that's  
firmly established. And in reference to your previous grand jury 
testimony, you indicated, I believe, on May 28th, 1998, at page 61, 
that 'She' -- referring to Betty Currie -- 'was the one that called 
me at the behest of the president.' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct, and I think, congressman, if in fact  
the president of the United States' secretary calls and asks for a 
request that you try to do the best you can to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And you received that request as a request coming  
from the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I -- I interpreted it as a request from the president.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And then, later on in June of '98 in the grand jury  
testimony at page 45, did you not reference or testify that `The 
president asked me to get Monica Lewinsky a job'? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: There was no -- there was no question but that he asked  
me to help and that he asked others to help. I think that is clear 
from everybody's grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Do you believe that you were acting in the company's  
interest or the president's interest when you were trying to secure 
a job for Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, what I knew was that the company would take care  
of its own interest. This is not the first time that I referred 
somebody, and what I know is, is that if a person being referred 
does not meet the standards required for that company, I have no 
question but that that person will not be hired. And so the 
referral is an easy thing to do; the judgment about employment is 
not a judgment as a person referring that I make. But I do have 
confidence in all of the companies on whose boards that I sit that, 
regardless of my reference, that as to their needs and as to their 
expectations for their employees that they will make the right 
decisions, as happened in the American Express situation. American 
Express called and said: We will not hire Ms. Lewinsky. I did not 
question it, I did not challenge it, because they understood their 
needs and their needs in comparison to her qualifications. They 
made a judgment. Revlon, on the other hand, made another judgment. 
I am not the employer, I am the referrer, and there is a major 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And when you had your conversation with Mr. Perelman  
... you do not believe you told him you were calling for the 
president -- 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe that I did not tell him.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: -- but you assumed that he knew?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: No. I did not make any assumptions, let me say. I said:  
Ronald, here is a young lady who has been interviewed. She thinks 
the interview has not gone well. See what you can do to make sure 
that she is properly interviewed and evaluated -- in essence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you reference her as a former White House  
intern? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Probably. I do not have a recollection of whether I  
described her as a White House intern, whether I described her as a 
person who had worked for the Pentagon. I said this is a person 
that I have referred. I think, Mr. Hutchinson, that I have 
sufficient, uh, influence, shall we say, sufficient character, 
shall we say, that people have been throughout my career able to 
take my word at face value. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And so you didn't need to reference the president.  
The fact that you were calling Mr. Perelman -- 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That was sufficient.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: You knew and the president knew that Ms. Lewinsky  
was under subpoena in the Jones case, and that information was not 
provided to either Mr. Halperin or to Mr. Perelman; is that 
correct? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That's correct.  
</P>
<P>
	... I think, on the other hand, that had she been a defendant in  
a murder case and I knew that, then I probably wouldn't have 
referenced her. But her being a witness in a civil case I did not 
think important. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Despite the fact that you were acting at the request  
of the president, and this witness was potentially adverse to the 
president's interest in that case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I didn't know that. I mean, I don't -- I don't know what  
her position was or whether it was adverse or not. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Ms. Lewinsky has made reference to a meeting that  
occurred in your office on November 5, and that's the meeting that 
you have no recollection of? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct. We have no record of it in my office,  
and I just have no recollection of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And in your first grand jury appearance, you were  
firm, shall I say, that the first time you met with Ms. Lewinsky, 
that it was on December 11th? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes. It was firm based on what my calendar told me, and  
subsequently to that, there has been a refreshing of my 
recollection, and I do not deny that it happened. By the same 
token, I will tell you, as I said in my grand jury testimony, that 
I did not remember that I had met with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And in fact today, the fact that you do not dispute  
that that meeting occurred is not based upon your recollection but 
is simply based upon you've seen the records, and it appears that 
that meeting occurred? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	How did the meeting on December 11 of 1997 with Ms. Lewinsky  
come about? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Ms. Lewinsky called my office and asked if she could  
come to see me. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And was that preceded by a call from Betty Currie?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: At some point in time, Betty Currie had called me, and  
Ms. Lewinsky followed up on that call, and she came to my office, 
and we had a visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Ms. Lewinsky called, set up a meeting, and at some  
point sent you a resume, I believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe so.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you receive that prior to the meeting on  
December 11th? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I -- I have to assume that I did, but I -- I do not know  
whether she brought it with her or whether -- it was at some point 
that she brought with her or sent to me -- somehow it came into my 
possession -- a list of various companies in New York with which she 
had -- which were her preferences, by the way -- most of which I did 
not know well enough to make any calls for. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Many times I will be listed as a reference, and they  
can take that to any company. You might be listed as a reference 
and the name 'Vernon Jordan' would be a good reference anywhere, 
would it not? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I would hope so.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And so, even though it was a company that you might  
not have the best contact with, you could have been helpful in that 
regard? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, the fact is I was running the job search, not Ms.  
Lewinsky, and therefore, the companies that she brought or listed 
were not of interest to me. I knew where I would need to call. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And that is exactly the point, that you looked at  
getting Ms. Lewinsky a job as an assignment rather than just 
something that you were going to be a reference for. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I don't know whether I looked upon it as an assignment.  
Getting jobs for people is not unusual for me, so I don't view it 
as an assignment. I just view it as something that is part of what 
I do. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: You're acting in behalf of the president when you  
are trying to get Ms. Lewinsky a job, and you were in control of 
the job search? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: During the course of the meeting with Ms. Lewinsky,  
what did you learn about her? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Uh, enthusiastic, quite taken with herself and her  
experience, uh, bubbly, effervescent, bouncy, confident, uh -- 
actually, I sort of had the same impression that you House managers 
had of her when you met with her. You came out and said she was 
impressive, and so we come out about the same place. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did she relate to you the fact that she liked  
being an intern because it put her close to the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I have never seen a White House intern who did not like  
being a White House intern, and so her enthusiasm for being a White 
House intern was about like the enthusiasm of White House interns -- 
they liked it. She was not happy about not being there anymore -- 
she did not like being at the Defense Department -- and I think she 
actually had some desire to go back. But when she actually talked 
to me, she wanted to go to New York for a job in the private 
sector, and she thought that I could be helpful in that process. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Did she make reference to someone in the White House  
being uncomfortable when she was an intern, and she thought that 
people did not want her there? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: She felt unwanted -- there is no question about that. As  
to who did not want her there and why they did not want her there, 
that was not my business. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: If there was a discussion subsequent to Monica  
Lewinsky's visit to me on December the 11th with the president of 
the United States, it was about the job search. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right. And during that, did he indicate that he  
knew about the fact that she had lost her job in the White House, 
and she wanted to get a job in New York? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: He was aware that -- he was obviously aware that she had  
lost her job in the White House, because she was working at the 
Pentagon. He was also aware that she wanted to work in New York, in 
the private sector, and understood that that is why she was having 
conversations with me. There is no doubt about that. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And he thanked you for helping her?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: There's no question about that, either.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And on either of these conversations that I've  
referenced that you had with the president after the witness list 
came out, your conversation on December 7th, and your conversation 
sometime after the 11th, did the president tell you that Ms. Monica 
Lewinsky was on the witness list in the Jones case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: He did not.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you consider this information to be  
important in your efforts to be helpful to Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I never thought about it.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Was there a time that you became aware that Ms.  
Lewinsky had been subpoenaed to give a deposition in the Jones 
versus Clinton case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: On December 19th when she came to my office with the  
subpoena -- I think it's the 19th. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: How did it come about that you met with Ms. Lewinsky  
on December 19th? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Ms. Lewinsky called me in a rather high emotional state  
and said that she needed to see me, and she came to see me. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And she called you on the telephone on December  
19th, in which she indicated she had received a subpoena? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That's right, and was emotional about it and asked, and  
so I said come over. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And what was your reaction to her having received a  
subpoena in the Jones case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Surprise, number one; number two, quite taken with her  
emotional state. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you see that she had a problem?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: She obviously had a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	... She was -- she was disturbed about the subpoena. She was  
disturbed about not having, in her words, heard from the president 
or talked to the president. It was also in that meeting that it 
became clear to me that the -- that her eyes were wide and that she, 
uh, that -- let me -- for lack of a better way to put it, that she 
had a 'thing' for the president. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: From your conversation with her, did you determine  
that in your opinion, there was a fascination on her part with the 
president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: No question about that.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And I think you previously described it that she had  
a 'thing' for the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: 'Thing,' yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you make any specific inquiry as to the  
nature of the relationship that she had with the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes. At some point during that conversation, I asked her  
directly if she had had sexual relationships with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And is this not an extraordinary question to ask a  
24-year-old intern, whether she had sexual relations with the 
president of the United States? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Not if you see -- not if you had witnessed her emotional  
state and this 'thing,' as I say. It was not. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And her emotional state and what she expressed to  
you about her feelings for the president is what prompted you to 
ask that question? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That, plus the question of whether or not the president  
at the end of his term would leave the first lady; and that was 
alarming and stunning to me. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And she related that question to you in that meeting  
on December 19th? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That's correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, going back to the question in which you asked  
her if she had had a sexual relationship with the president, what 
was her response? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: No.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And I'm sure that that was not an idle question on  
your part, and I presume that you needed to know the answer for 
some purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I wanted to know the answer based on what I had seen in  
her expression; obviously, based on the fact that this was a 
subpoena about her relationship with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And so you felt like you needed to know the answer  
to that question to determine how you were going to handle the 
situation? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: No. I thought it was a factual data that I needed to  
know, and I asked the question. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And why did you need to know the answer to that  
question? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I am referring this lady, Ms. Lewinsky, to various  
companies for jobs, and it seemed to me that it was important for 
me to know in that process whether or not there had been something 
going on with the president based on what I saw and based on what I 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, let me just go back as to what signals that you  
might have had at this particular point that there was a sexual 
relationship between Ms. Lewinsky and the president. Was one of 
those the fact that she indicated that she had a fascination with 
the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did she relate that 'He doesn't call me enough'?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And was the fact that there was an exchange of gifts  
a factor in your consideration? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, I was not aware that there had been an exchange of  
gifts. I thought it a tad unusual that there would be an exchange 
of gifts, uh, but it was just clear that there was a fixation by 
this young woman on the president of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And was it also a factor that she had been issued a  
subpoena in a case that was rooted in sexual harassment? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, it certainly helped.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And that was an ingredient that you factored in and  
decided this is a question that needed to be asked? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: There's no question about that.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, heretofore, the questions or the discussions  
with Ms. Lewinsky had simply been about a job? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Had been about a job.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And I think you indicated that you didn't have to be  
an Einstein to know that this was a question that needed to be 
asked after what you learned on this meeting? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes, based on my own judgment, that is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, at this point, you're assisting the president  
in obtaining a job for a former intern, Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Right.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: It comes to your attention from Ms. Lewinsky that  
she has a subpoena in a civil rights case against the president. 
And did this make you consider whether it was appropriate for you 
to continue seeking a job for Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Never gave it a thought.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Despite the fact that you were seeking the job for  
Ms. Lewinsky at the request of the president when she is under 
subpoena in a case adverse to the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I -- I did not give it a thought. I had committed that I  
was going to help her, and I was going to -- and I kept my 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: So it's your testimony that if Ms. Currie had known  
that Ms. Lewinsky was under subpoena, you would have expected her 
to tell you that information? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: It would have been helpful.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And likewise, would you have expected the president  
to tell you if he had any reason to believe that Ms. Lewinsky would 
be called as a witness in the Paula Jones case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That would have been helpful, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And that was your expectation, that he would have  
done that in your conversations? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: It -- it would certainly have been helpful, but it would  
not have changed my mind. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And yet, according to your testimony, the president  
did not so advise you of the fact that Ms. Lewinsky was on the 
witness list despite the fact that he had conversations with you on 
two occasions, on December 7th and December 11th? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I have no recollection of the president telling me about  
the witness list. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, Mr. Jordan, you indicated you had this  
conversation with the president at about 5:01 p.m. out of the 
presence of Ms. Lewinsky. Now, during this conversation with the 
president, what did you tell the president in that conversation? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That Lewinsky -- I'm sure I told him that Ms. Lewinsky  
was in my office, in the reception area, that she had a subpoena 
and that I was going to visit with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you advise the president as well that you  
were going to recommend Frank Carter as an attorney? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I may have.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And why was it necessary to tell the president these  
facts? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I don't know why it was not unnecessary to tell him  
these facts. I was keeping him informed about what was going on, 
and so I told him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Why did you make the judgment that you should call  
the president and advise him of these facts? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I just thought he ought to know. He was interested it --  
he was obviously interested in it -- and I felt some responsibility 
to tell him, and I did. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right. And what was the president's response?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: He said thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: During this conversation with Ms. Lewinsky, she also  
made reference to the first lady? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And that was another question of concern when she  
asked if you thought that the president would leave the first lady 
at the end of his term? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And what was your reaction to this statement?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: My reaction to the statement after I got over it was  
that -- no way. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Did it send off alarm bells in your mind as to her  
relationship with the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I think it's safe to say that she was not happy.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: You're speaking of Ms. Lewinsky?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That's the only person we're talking about, congressman.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, based upon all of this, was it your conclusion  
the subpoena meant trouble? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Beg your pardon?  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Based upon all of these facts and your conversation  
with Ms. Lewinsky, was it your conclusion that the subpoena meant 
trouble? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, I always, based on my experience with the grand  
jury, believe that subpoenas are trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: I think you've used the language, 'ipso facto' meant  
trouble? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes, yes, right.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, would you describe your conversation with the  
president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: We were upstairs, uh, in the White House. Mrs. Jordan --  
we came in by way of the Southwest Gate into the Diplomatic 
Entrance -- we left the car there. I took the elevator up to the 
residence, and Mrs. Jordan went and visited at the party. And the 
president was already upstairs -- I had ascertained that from the 
usher -- and I went up, and I raised with him the whole question of 
Monica Lewinsky and asked him directly if he had had sexual 
relations with Monica Lewinsky, and the president said, 'No, 
never.' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right. Now, during that conversation, did you  
tell the president again that Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, we had established that.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right. And did you tell him that you were  
concerned about her fascination? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I did.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you describe her as being emotional in your  
meeting that day? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I did.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you relate to the president that Ms.  
Lewinsky asked about whether he was going to leave the first lady 
at the end of the term? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I did.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And as -- and then, you concluded that with the  
question as to whether he had had sexual relations with Ms. 
Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: And he said he had not, and I was satisfied -- end of  
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Now, once again, just as I asked the question in  
reference to Ms. Lewinsky, it appears to me that this is an 
extraordinary question to ask the president of the United States. 
What led you to ask this question to the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Well, first of all, I'm asking the question of my friend  
who happens to be the president of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you expect your friend, the president of the  
United States, to give you a truthful answer? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I did.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Did you rely upon the president's answer in your  
decision to continue your efforts to seek Ms. Lewinsky a job? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believed him, and I continued to do what I had been  
asked to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Well, my question was more did you rely upon the  
president's answer in your decision to continue your efforts to 
seek Ms. Lewinsky a job. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I did not rely on his answer. I was going to pursue the  
job in any event. But I got the answer to the question that I had 
asked Ms. Lewinsky earlier from her, and I got the answer from him 
that night as to the sexual relationships, and he said no. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: If you would refer to my testimony before the grand jury  
when asked about a breakfast with Ms. Lewinsky on December 31st, I 
testified that I did not have breakfast with Ms. Lewinsky on 
December 31st because I did not remember having had breakfast with 
Ms. Lewinsky on December 31st. It was not on my calendar. It was 
New Year's Eve. I have breakfast at the Park Hyatt Hotel three or 
four times a week if I am in town, and so I really did not remember 
having breakfast with Ms. Lewinsky. And that's an honest statement, 
I did not remember, and I told that to the grand jury. It is clear, 
based on the evidence here, that I was at the Park Hyatt on 
December 31st. So I do not deny, despite my testimony before the 
grand jury, that on December 31st that I was there with Ms. 
Lewinsky, but I did testify before the grand jury that I did not 
remember having a breakfast with her on that date, and that was the 
truth. My recollection has subsequently been refreshed, and -- and 
so it is -- it is undeniable that there was a breakfast in my usual 
breakfast place, in the corner at the Park Hyatt. I'm there all the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right. And so -- and that would be with Ms.  
Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Do you recall a discussion with Ms. Lewinsky at the  
Park Hyatt on this occasion in which there were notes discussed 
that she had written to the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I am certain that Ms. Lewinsky talked to me about notes.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: On this occasion?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And would these have been notes that she would have  
sent to the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I think that there was -- these notes had to do with  
correspondence between Ms. Lewinsky and the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And would have she mentioned the retention or copies  
of some of that correspondence on her computer in her apartment? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: She may have done that.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you ask her a question, were these notes  
from the president to you? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I understood from our conversation that she and the  
president had correspondence that went back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And did you make a statement to her, 'Go home and  
make sure they're not there'? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Mr. Hutchinson, I'm a lawyer and I'm a loyal friend, but  
I'm not a fool, and the notion that I would suggest to anybody that 
they destroy anything just defies anything that I know about 
myself. So the notion that I said to her go home and destroy notes 
is ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Well, I appreciate that reminder of ethical  
responsibilities. It was -- 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: No, it had nothing to do with ethics, as much as it's  
just good common sense, mother wit. You remember that in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Was this a meeting that was set up at her request or  
your request? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I'm certain it was at her request. I am fairly certain  
that I did not call Ms. Lewinsky and say will you join me at the 
Park Hyatt for breakfast on December 31st, on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: The president was obviously interested in her job  
search. We had talked about the affidavit. He knew that she had a 
lawyer. It was in the due course of a conversation. I would say, 
`Mr. President, she signed the affidavit. She signed the 
affidavit.' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And what was his response when you informed him that  
she had signed the affidavit? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: 'Thank you very much.'  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: So she was able to secure the job based upon your  
call to Mr. Perelman? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Based upon my call, from the time that I called Halperin  
through to Mr. Perelman. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I take credit for that.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right. Now, in fact, you've used terms like `the  
Jordan magic worked'? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: It -- it has from time to time.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And it did on this occasion?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I believe so.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And then, you also informed Ms. Betty Currie that  
the mission was accomplished? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And after securing the job for Ms. Lewinsky, you did  
inform Betty Currie of that fact? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: And the president.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: All right. And was the purpose of letting Betty  
Currie know so that she could tell the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: She saw the president much more often that I did.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And -- but you wanted to inform the president  
personally that you were successful in getting Ms. Lewinsky a job? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Ms. Currie is concerned enough that she leaves the  
White House and goes to see Mr. Vernon Jordan, and she raises an 
issue with you and, according to your testimony, you told her 
simply, you need to go see Mike McCurry or Bruce Lindsey. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And it's your testimony that she never raised with  
you any issue concerning the -- Mr. Isikoff inquiring about gifts 
and records of gifts by Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I stand by what I -- what you just read to me about --  
from my testimony about tapes conversations. I have no recollection 
about gifts or gifts under the bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Okay. Are you saying it did not happen, or you have  
no recollection? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I certainly have no recollection of it.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: Well, do you have a specific recollection that it  
did not happen, that she never raised the issue of gifts with you? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: It is my judgment that it did not happen.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: You had already secured a job for Ms. Lewinsky?  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: That is correct.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And you --  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: Found a lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And a lawyer. And, as you had said at one point, job  
finished -- fini. Why is it that you felt like you needed to join in 
the search for Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: If you had been sitting where I was, and all of a sudden  
you found out, after getting her a job and after getting her a 
lawyer, that there's a report that says that she's been -- she's 
been taped by some person named Linda Tripp, I think just -- mother 
wit, common sense, judgment would have suggested that you would be 
interested in what that was about. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson: And were you trying to provide assistance to the  
president of the United States in trying to locate Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: I was not trying to help the president of the United  
States. At that point, I was trying to satisfy myself as to what 
had gone on with this person for whom I had gotten both a job and a 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	White House counsel David Kendall: Was your assistance to Ms.  
Lewinsky which you have described in any way dependent upon her 
doing anything whatsoever in the Paula Jones case? 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: No.

<HEADLINE> CIA Official Settles Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A CIA official at the Pentagon's satellite  
surveillance office is paying $48,700 to settle Justice Department 
allegations he recommended bonuses for a defense contractor that 
employed his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest civil settlement ever obtained by the Justice  
Department's criminal division in settlement of a 
conflict-of-interest case, the department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The $48,700 equaled the entire profit Allen L. Krum's wife made  
on stock options from her employer, Lockheed Martin Corp., and was 
``substantially more than the government could have obtained under 
the U.S. sentencing guidelines for criminal cases,'' the department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the civil suit and accompanying settlement filed in U.S.  
District Court in suburban Alexandria, Va., the government 
identified Krum, 46, of Centreville, Va., as a senior CIA employee 
assigned to the Defense Department's National Reconnaissance 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Until a few years ago, the NRO was so secret its existence was  
not even acknowledged. The NRO manages U.S. spying by satellites 
and high-flying aircraft around the world. It also acquires the 
satellites and planes from defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil suit alleged Krum took official action in matters in  
which his wife had a financial interest. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1994 to 1996, Krum was a contracting officer and technical  
representative for specific contracts between the NRO and Lockheed 
Martin. His primary duties included recommending approval for 
engineering changes and for bonuses totaling millions of dollars 
and renegotiating contracts with Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1996 to April 1997, Krum served as NRO chief of a  
restructuring program for a contract with Lockheed Martin. His job 
included developing overall contract requirements and plans and 
ensuring adequate budgeting. 
</P>
<P>
	From April 1997 to the present, Krum has been NRO director of  
imagery development, a position in which he has approved contract 
payments and bonuses to contractors for which he had previously 
been the recommending authority, including Lockheed Martin 
contracts, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1994 to June 30, 1997, his wife, who was not named in the  
lawsuit, was a Lockheed Martin program management engineer in the 
capital area, but she did not work on contracts her husband 
supervised, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, from April 1994 through January 1997, she received  
options to buy 3,000 shares of Lockheed Martin stock. In April and 
May 1997, she exercised options to buy 1,600 shares for a profit of 
$48,700, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	She canceled the remaining options upon later resigning  
voluntarily from the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Krum agreed to make the payment within 30 days. He keeps his  
government job, Justice spokesman John Russell said.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet's Fate in Judges Hands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- After 12 days of elaborate arguments by more than  
a dozen lawyers, the fate of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto 
Pinochet lies in the hands of seven judges in Britain's highest 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel in the House of Lords will determine whether the  
83-year-old Pinochet is immune from prosecution for crimes against 
humanity he allegedly committed during his 17-year rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll take time to consider this ... and report our judgment  
in due course,'' Lord Chief Justice Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson said 
Thursday to a packed courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was taken into custody Oct. 16 in London at the request  
of a Spanish magistrate who is seeking his extradition on charges 
of murder and other crimes that allegedly occurred during his 
regime. Spaniards are believed to be among the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Spain and human rights groups contend that torture  
is a ``violation so serious'' that it is incompatible with a head 
of state's functions and is therefore not subject to immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	They have also cited the International Convention against  
Torture, which they say would be reduced to a ``meek little mouse'' 
if it did not permit outside nations to intervene and try officials 
accused of torture. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet's lawyers argued that most of the alleged crimes would  
have taken place before 1988, when the law came into effect. They 
also say the convention does not explicitly address a head of 
state's immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	They claim Pinochet is entitled to absolute immunity for any  
acts he ordered while head of state, and the Chilean government 
argued that efforts to try Pinochet were an affront to the nation's 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the lords decide could have worldwide implications, and  
not only for other dictators. Some international legal experts say 
a judgment against Pinochet could make former heads of state think 
twice before leaving their countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on how nations interpreted the decision, Britain's  
ex-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for example, could be tried 
over the sinking of an Argentine cruiser. Or South Africa's Nobel 
Peace Prize-winning former President F.W. de Klerk could find 
himself in trouble over apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was denied immunity by the House of Lords before. But  
the 3-2 ruling by a different panel was thrown out after the 
discovery that a judge who voted against the general had close ties 
to Amnesty International, a participant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pinochet loses again, a lengthy extradition process begins.  
But if the lords uphold an Oct. 28 High Court ruling giving him 
immunity, he will be free to return to Chile, where he is protected 
by an amnesty law he passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who has not been attending the hearing, remains under  
police guard at a rented mansion west of London.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Lewinsky Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``Ms. Lewinsky, welcome back to Washington, and we wanted to  
just gather a few of our friends here to have this deposition now. 
We do have quite a number of people present, but we -- in spite of 
the numbers, we do want you to feel as comfortable as possible 
because I think we -- everyone present today has an interest in 
getting to the truth of this matter, and so as best as you can, we 
would appreciate your answers in a -- in a truthful and a fashion 
that you can recall.'' -- Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``I think, to be fair, we're -- we're obviously going to  
have to talk about some things for eight hours here, or else we can 
go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Sounds good to me.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``The first -- was the first time you actually spoke to  
the president or he spoke to you, other than perhaps a hello in the 
hallway, was that on Nov. the 15th, 1995?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And that was -- that was the day of the first so-called  
salacious encounter, the same day?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``What -- do you recall what he said or what he did in  
regard to the intern pass?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``He tugged on my pass and said: `This is going to be  
a problem.''' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``At some point, you were transferred to the Pentagon,  
to the Department of Defense. When did that occur?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I found out I was being transferred on April 5,  
1996.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you want to go?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``No.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``... to the Department of Defense? Did you have a  
discussion with the president about this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``What was your reaction to being transferred?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I started to cry.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you attach any significance to being transferred  
away before the election and then him assuring you he would bring 
you back after the election? Did you attach any significance to the 
election and your having to leave?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Emotional significance, yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Your emotion? I'm -- I'm not sure I follow you. You  
were ... 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Well, yes, I attached significance to it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And that was emotional ... ''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``But that was emotional.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``But the reason you both felt -- again, I'm not trying  
to put words in your mouth, but you both felt you were leaving 
until after the election was because of your relationship and 
perhaps people finding out? 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``No ... I can only speak for myself. I mean, I, my  
understanding initially was that it was for work-related issues, 
but not my work, and I came to understand later that it was having 
to do with my relationship with the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Ms. Lewinsky, did you tell a number of people in  
varying details about your relationship with the president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``You tell us who did you tell?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Catherine Allday Davis, Neysa Deman Erbland, Natalie  
Ungvari, Ashley Raines, Linda Tripp, Dr. Kathy Estep, Dr. Irene 
Kassorla, Andy Bleiler, my mom, my aunt. Who else has been 
subpoenaed? 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Okay. Let me suggest Dale -- did you mention Dale  
Young?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Dale Young. I'm sorry.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you lie before the grand jury and to your friends  
about the nature of that relationship with the president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``No.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``In regard to your testimony at the grand jury about  
your -- your relationship and the physical contact that you have 
said occurred in some of these, visits with the president, it has 
been characterized in a way that would give you an excuse not to 
tell the truth. Did you tell the truth in the grand jury about what 
actually happened and how the president touched -- the president 
touched you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And did you likewise tell the truth to your friends in  
connection with the same matters?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did your relationship with the president involve  
giving gifts, exchanging gifts?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And you mentioned earlier that in reference to this  
chart that it was, uh, subject to certain corrections you've made 
in later testimony. It was an accurate representation or an 
accurate compilation of the gifts that you gave the president and 
the president gave you. Is that correct?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Approximately how many gifts did you give the  
president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I believe I've testified to that number. I don't  
recall right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``About 30? Would that be ... ?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``If that's what I testified to, then I accept that.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``That's the number I have, and do you recall how many  
gifts approximately the president gave you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``It would be the same situation.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``You wrote the president a letter expressing some  
frustrations about the job situation in terms of -- is that -- can 
you tell us about that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes. I had had a -- well, I guess I was -- I know I've  
testified about this, I mean, in the grand jury, but I was feeling 
at that point that I was getting the run-around on being brought 
back to the White House. So I sent a letter to the president that 
was probably the harshest I had sent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you get a response?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Sort of.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Would you explain?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Um, Betty called me and told me to come to the White  
House the next morning, on July 4th, at 9 a.m.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And what happened when you -- I assume you went to the  
White House on July the 4th. What happened?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Do you have a specific question? I know I testified,  
I mean, extensively about this whole day, that whole ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Well, in regards to -- let's start with the job.''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Well, I started crying. We were in the back office  
and -- and when the subject matter came up, the president was upset 
with me and then I began to cry. So ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did he encourage you about you coming back? Did he  
make a promise or commitment to you that he would make sure you 
came back to work at the White House?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I don't know that he reaffirmed his promise or  
commitment. I remember leaving that day thinking that, as usual, he 
was going to work on it and had a renewed sense of hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did he comment on your letter, the tone of your  
letter?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``What did he say?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``He was upset with me and told me it was illegal to  
threaten the president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you intend the letter to be interpreted that  
way?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``No.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you explain why you wrote the letter to him about  
reminding him that you were a good girl and you left the White 
House? Did you have that type of conversation?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes. That's what made me start to cry.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you -- did you ever explain to him that you didn't  
intend to threaten him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I believe so.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``What was the intent of the letter?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``First, I felt the letter was going to him as a man  
and not as president of the United States. Second, I think I could 
see how he could interpret it as a threat, but my intention was to 
sort of remind him that I had been waiting patiently and what I 
considered was being a good girl, about having been transferred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``You didn't feel it was necessary to go back to the  
president and perhaps confront the president and say, `Why am I not 
coming back, I want to come back?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I mean, I had a discussion with the president, but I  
had made a decision from that based on that information, and I 
guess -- my experience of it coming up on a year from the election, 
having not been brought back, that it probably wasn't going to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you carry any documents or any papers with you to  
the meeting with Mr. Jordan?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``My resume and a list of public relations firms in  
New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did Mr. Jordan ask you why you were there?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And what did you say?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I was hoping to move to New York and that he could  
assist me in securing a job there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did he ask you why you wanted to leave Washington?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And what was your answer?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I gave him the vanilla story of, that I -- I think I  
-- I don't remember exactly what I said. I -- I believe I've 
testified to this. I think it was something about wanting to get 
out of Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``The vanilla story. You mean sort of an innocuous set  
of reasons, not really the true reasons you wanted to leave?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And what were the true reasons you wanted to leave?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Because I couldn't go back to the White House.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``During this meeting, did he make any comments about  
your status as a friend of the president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``What ... did he say?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``In one of his remarks, he said something about me  
being a friend of the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And did you respond?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``How?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I said that I didn't -- I think I -- my grand jury  
testimony, I know I talked about this, so it's probably more 
accurate. My memory right now is I said something about, seeing him 
more as a man than as a president, and I treated him accordingly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``I know in your grand jury you mentioned some of your  
feelings that you felt after he spoke publicly about the 
relationship, but let me ask you more about the positive -- you said 
there were mixed feelings. What about -- do you still respect the 
president, still admire the president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Do you still appreciate what he is doing for this  
country as the president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>

	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Was there any discussion of how you would accomplish  
preparing or filing an affidavit at that point?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``No.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Why didn't you want to testify? Why would not you --  
why would you have wanted to avoid testifying?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``First of all, I thought it was nobody's business.  
Second of all, I didn't want to have anything to do with Paula 
Jones or her case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Would you agree that these cover stories that you've  
just testified to, if they were told to the attorneys for Paula 
Jones, that they would be misleading to them and not be the whole 
story, the whole truth?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``They would -- yes, I guess misleading. They were  
literally true, but they would be misleading, so incomplete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``As I understand your testimony, too, the cover stories  
were reiterated to you by the president that night on the telephone 
...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Correct.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And after he told you would be a witness -- or your  
name was on the witness list, I should say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Correct.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And did you understand that since your name was on the  
witness list that there would be a possibility that you could be 
subpoenaed to testify in the Paula Jones case?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: I think I understood that I could be subpoenaed, and  
there was a possibility of testifying. I don't know if I 
necessarily thought it was a subpoena to testify, but ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Were you in fact subpoenaed to testify?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And that was what?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Dec. 19, 1997.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Dec. 19. Now, you have testified in the grand jury. I  
think your closing comments was that no one ever asked you to lie, 
but yet in that very conversation of December the 17th, 1997, when 
the president told you that you were on the witness list, he also 
suggested that you could sign an affidavit and use misleading cover 
stories. Isn't that correct? 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Uh -- well, I -- I guess in my mind, I separate  
necessarily signing affidavit and using misleading cover stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``In fact you did deny the relationship to the Jones  
lawyers in the affidavit that you signed under penalty of perjury; 
is that right?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I denied a sexual relationship.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``The president did not in that conversation on December  
the 17th of 1997 or any other conversation, for that matter, 
instruct you to tell the truth; is that correct?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``That's correct.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you express your frustration to Mr. Jordan with,  
with the President? 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I expressed that sometimes I had frustrations with  
him, yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``And what was his response to you about -- after you  
talked about the president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``He sort of jokingly said to me, `You know what your  
problem is, and don't deny it -- you're in love with him.' But it 
was a sort of lighthearted nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did you -- did you have a response to that?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I probably blushed or giggled or something.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Do you still have feelings for the president?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I have mixed feelings.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``What -- maybe you could tell us a little bit more about  
what those mixed feelings are. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I think what you need to know is that my grand jury  
testimony is truthful irrespective of whatever those mixed feelings 
are in my testimony today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Was this your first notice of your name being on the  
Paula Jones witness list?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``I realize he, he commented about some other things,  
but I do want to focus on the witness list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``OK.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did he say anything to you about how he felt  
concerning this witness list?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``He said it broke his heart that, well, that my name  
was on the witness list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Did the president ever tell you to turn over the  
gifts?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Not that I remember.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``In his answer to this proceeding in the Senate, he has  
indicated that he thought he had -- might have had a way that he 
could have you -- get you to file a -- basically a true affidavit, 
but yet still skirt these issues enough that you wouldn't be called 
as a witness. Did he offer you any of these suggestions at this 
time?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``He didn't discuss the content of my affidavit with  
me at all, ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``But, I mean, he didn't make an offer that, you know,  
'Here's what you can do,' or 'Let me send you over something that 
can maybe keep you from committing perjury?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``No. We never discussed perjury.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``On January the 6th ... did you pick up a draft of the  
affidavit from Mr. Carter?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes, I did.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``What did you do with that draft?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I read it and went through it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``How did it look?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I don't really remember my reaction to it. I know I  
had some changes. I know there's a copy of this draft affidavit 
that's part of the record, but ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Were portions of it false?''  
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Incomplete and misleading.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``The fact that you assume that Mr. Jordan was in  
contact with the president -- and I believe the evidence would 
support that through his own testimony that he had talked to the 
president about the signed affidavit and that he had kept the 
president updated on the subpoena issue and the job search ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Sir, I'm not sure that I knew he was having contact  
with the president about this. I -- I think what I said was that I 
felt that it was getting his approval. It didn't necessarily mean 
that I felt he was going to get a direct approval from the 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Even just mentioning that I might have been alone  
with the president, I was concerned that that would give the Jones 
people enough ammunition to want to talk to me, to think, 'Oh, 
well, maybe if she was alone with him that' -- that he propositioned 
me or something like that, because I hadn't -- of course. I mean, 
you remember that at this point, I had no idea the amount of 
knowledge they had about the relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``Let me ask you, though -- I realize none of us were  
there -- but that statement, `I was never really alone with Monica; 
right?' -- that was not -- he was alone with you on many occasions, 
was he not? 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I'm not trying to be difficult, but I feel very  
uncomfortable making judgments on what someone else's statement 
when they're defining things however they want to define it. So if 
you -- if you ask me, Monica, were you alone with the president, I 
will say yes, but I'm not comfortable characterizing what someone 
else says.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant: ``You and the president had an emotional relationship as  
well as a physical one; is that right? 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``That's how I'd characterize it.''

<HEADLINE> Man Free After 16 Years on Death Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man who spent 16 years on death row for a  
double murder was freed today after college journalists uncovered 
new evidence and another man confessed to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook County Criminal Courts Judge Thomas Fitzgerald said there  
were ``news reports of significant evidentiary developments'' that 
would put into question whether Anthony Porter actually committed 
the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, 43, was allowed to leave prison without having to post  
bond. He will stay free while prosecutors study the new confession. 
</P>
<P>
	The release was based on a motion filed by the county state's  
attorney's office. However, Porter remains charged with the 1982 
murders of Jerry Hillard, 18, and Marilyn Green, 19, who were 
gunned down in a Chicago park. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter had his arms around his two attorneys as he heard the  
judge's decision. While he appeared elated by the news, he did not 
speak to reporters as he was taken back to the county Jail to be 
processed before leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Terri Marroquin, one of Porter's attorneys, said ``there was a  
lot of crying and a lot of hugging'' after the ruling. She said 
Porter was going to live with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the day after another man was videotaped confessing  
to the slayings, Porter had said: ``I'm not angry now. I thank God 
everything came out all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant State's Attorney David Erickson called it ``a good  
thing'' when reporters and others get involved in the criminal 
justice system and said, ``I commend the students.'' He said it was 
too early to say whether Porter would get an apology from 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter was scheduled to die by injection last September, but the  
state Supreme Court stopped the execution two days earlier amid 
questions about his mental fitness. Defense attorneys argued 
Porter, who has an IQ of 51, could not understand what was 
happening to him or help in his appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Then questions arose about the integrity of the conviction. A  
prosecution witness allegedly recanted his testimony implicating 
Porter, saying police had pressured him. 
</P>
<P>
	And two weeks ago, students in Northwestern University's  
investigative reporting class, who were looking into Porter's 
claims of innocence, tracked down a witness in Milwaukee who 
identified her ex-husband as the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, journalism professor David Protess, private  
investigator Paul Ciolino and several students visited the witness, 
Inez Jackson, who said her former husband, Alstory Simon, pulled 
the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
	They confronted Simon five days later with Jackson's statement  
and her signed affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon at first denied the shootings, but then said he fired at  
the two in self defense when he thought the male victim was 
reaching for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must have close to busted off about six rounds,'' Simon said  
on the videotape made by Ciolino. 
</P>
<P>
	``My students certainly feel that they've contributed to saving  
a life,'' Protess said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The case would not the first in which the professor and students  
of his saved a life. In June 1996, four men who had spent 18 years 
behind bars for murder were released after Northwestern students 
working with Ciolino discovered new evidence. Two of the four had 
been on death row. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter said Thursday he wanted to hug his mother, seven children  
and six grandchildren. He said he also wants to help people in his 
community and ``teach them right from wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A steak would be fine and maybe some dinner rolls,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Told To Develop Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans risk losing control of the House  
in 2000 unless they move away from impeachment and develop a 
message that can sell to the American people, the chairman of the 
House GOP's campaign arm says. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Thomas Davis, R-Va., the new chairman of the National  
Republican Congressional Committee, delivered the warning Thursday 
at the House GOP's annual winter retreat in colonial Williamsburg, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., was among those in the  
audience as Davis described how things would be if Democrats 
succeed in winning back the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``His thoughts were, we've got a lot of work to do,'' Hastert  
spokesman John Feehery said Friday from the retreat. ``His point 
has always been, as a former coach, (that) to win as a team you've 
got to work together as a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP's House majority narrowed after the elections to 222,  
vs. 211 Democrats and one Democratic-leaning independent. A special 
election will be held Feb. 23 to fill the seat vacated by former 
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats have been emboldened by the public's continued  
disapproval with congressional Republicans' handling of President 
Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri  
announced Wednesday that he was abandoning a possible presidential 
bid in 2000 to focus on recapturing the House for Democrats and 
being elected as its speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans understand the ``high stakes'' that lie ahead,  
Feehery said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and GOP leaders in the House and Senate, meanwhile, hope  
to win public favor with the issues on their top priority list -- 
saving Social Security, improving public education, cutting taxes 
and increasing the national defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things weren't all bleak,'' Feehery said of Davis' report. He  
said Republicans have a ``very good message'' and ``a lot of talent 
in our party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do all our jobs we will be successful,'' Feehery added.

<HEADLINE> No Military Retirement While Facing Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid criticism over the retirement of an Army  
general accused of sexual misconduct, Defense Secretary William 
Cohen ordered that top military officers be barred from retiring 
while facing charges of impropriety or criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen tightened retirement rules for top officers among the  
Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps partly to address critics 
who complained that generals and admirals were treated leniently 
for misconduct while lower ranking service members were often 
punished. 
</P>
<P>
	``This standardizes the review process for every branch of the  
service,'' Col. John Smith, an Army spokesman, said Friday. ``The 
secretary wanted to make it more uniform among the services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen ordered the review of retirement procedures last October  
after Maj. Gen. David Hale retired honorably after being accused of 
having had affairs with the wives of four subordinate officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his retirement, Hale, 53, was charged in December with  
17 military offenses, including conduct unbecoming an officer for 
the alleged sexual relationships, lying to investigators and 
obstructing justice. Hale, who denies the charges, faces up to 56 
years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Dennis Reimer, the Army's chief of staff, had approved  
Hale's retirement from the Pentagon as deputy inspector general for 
the Army, a position he had held only four months. Previously, Hale 
was deputy commanding general of NATO's allied land forces in 
southeastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Cohen's new rules, the Army chief of staff no longer has  
authority to approve retirements of top officers. Instead, service 
secretaries or undersecretaries must also agree to the retirements 
of generals and admirals after ensuring there are no pending 
investigations involving them. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules state that if an officer is facing ``allegations of  
impropriety'' that are being investigated by the military criminal 
justice system, the inspector general, audit agency or other 
Pentagon agency, the retirement request must be ``flagged'' and not 
immediately approved. 
</P>
<P>
	A secretary or undersecretary can approve the flagged retirement  
request, however, after considering the seriousness of the charges, 
the ``likely outcome of the investigation,'' the ``needs of the 
service'' and the personal situation of the officer, according to 
the rules. If the service chief approves the retirement, he must 
immediately notify the defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts said scrutinizing top officer retirements will go  
a long way toward addressing concerns that high-ranking members of 
the military get special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there are serious concerns about inequality, you have to  
be especially careful about applying rules fairly,'' said Anne 
Coughlin of the University of Virginia Law School. ``You don't want 
to worry that one guys gets charged while the other gets off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen signed the retirement order on Oct. 9, applying the new  
rules to all branches of the military service, although the 
Pentagon didn't announce the change. The Washington Times first 
reported on the review requirements in its Friday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army had tightened its own retirement rules in June in light  
of the Hale case. The Air Force, Navy and Marines already required 
its service chiefs to approve top officer retirements.

<HEADLINE> Judge Favors S.C. Abortion Clinics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A federal judge Friday struck down South  
Carolina's 1996 abortion clinic regulations, calling them an 
unconstitutional infringement on a woman's right to an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge William Traxler said South Carolina's  
clinics have operated safely for nearly 25 years. But the state 
``loaded these abortion clinics down with so many unnecessary 
requirements that this court has no choice but to conclude that the 
regulation unduly burdens a woman's fundamental right to undergo an 
abortion,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations, which applied to clinics that perform at least  
five abortions a month, touched on most operations, from requiring 
registered nurses to assist in abortions, to air-flow standards, to 
the width of doorways. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials argued the guidelines would protect women's  
safety. Critics said they would limit women's access to abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	After three abortion providers sued, Traxler barred the  
Department of Health and Environmental Control from enforcing the 
new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great day for the women in South Carolina,'' said  
Lorraine Maguire, director of the Charleston Women's Medical 
Clinic. ``The court recognized that the state should not interfere 
in personal, private reproductive health care decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Charlie Condon did not know about the decision  
and would not comment until he reviewed it, a spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Hockey Player Charged With Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A star minor league defenseman accused of  
using his stick as a deadly weapon was suspended Friday for the 
rest of the regular season and fined an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Trboyevich of the Anchorage Aces also was barred by the  
West Coast Hockey League from competing in any playoff games this 
year against the Fresno Falcons, and will be on probation next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Trboyevich still could face up to four years in jail if  
prosecutors decide to pursue the assault with a deadly weapon 
charge filed by police after he cross-checked Jacques Mailhot of 
the Falcons earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Freed, chief assistant district attorney in Fresno, said  
Friday his office is awaiting further information from police, 
including additional interviews, before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in their (police) hands. We haven't even started  
considering it yet,'' Freed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trboyevich's attorney, Mike Brain, said he hopes the league's  
decision ``will be the end of this unfortunate incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trboyevich cross-checked Mailhot about five minutes into the  
first period Tuesday night. He was assessed with a major penalty 
for high-sticking and a match penalty for attempting to injure. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty triggered a bench-clearing brawl that led to the  
ejection of 11 players. The Aces lost six players, leaving them 
with 11 for the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Mailhot apparently didn't suffer any serious injury and  
continued playing, scoring the first goal in his team's 7-6 win. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Coast Hockey League also levied suspensions ranging  
from three games to 17 games against five Falcons and three Aces 
for their involvement in the brawl. Fines were imposed against both 
coaches, the amounts were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	League president Mike McCall said he hoped the penalties would

	``The actions that occurred are not acceptable at any level of  
hockey, and we hope that our players -- as role models -- accept that 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither player could be reached for comment. Aces General  
Manager Derek Donald did not immediately return a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
	Trboyevich and Mailhot also had a run-in Jan. 1 in Anchorage.  
During that game, Mailhot hit Trboyevich in the mouth with his 
stick. Trboyevich lost part of a tooth and needed 10 stitches to 
close a gash in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	It is rare, but not unprecedented, for a hockey player to face  
criminal charges for action on the ice. Usually the league 
determines the punishment for violent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mailhot who wanted Trboyevich arrested, making the  
request between the first and second periods. Authorities 
questioned Mailhot at Selland Arena and Trboyevich was arrested at 
his hotel after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	If the criminal charge is pursued, it can be treated as a  
misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail, or a felony 
punishable by two to four years in a state prison. A $10,000 fine 
could also be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar case in the league last year, charges were dropped  
after mediation.

	King Hussein Returns to Jordan  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- King Hussein arrived home today to a nation  
deeply worried about what their monarch's death could mean for the 
future. The 63-year-old ruler left an American hospital last night 
after his body rejected a bone marrow transplant meant to fight off 
his lymphatic cancer. Aides carried Hussein, who was attached to an 
IV, off the plane on a stretcher, said royal palace officials, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. One official said the king's liver 
and kidney had failed, his brain was not functioning and that he 
was on life support.

	Mir's Mirror Experiment Called Off  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian officials scrapped the Mir space station's  
space- mirror experiment today after the shiny metal object got 
stuck and failed to properly unfurl. It was a big disappointment 
for Russia's struggling space agency, which had billed the project 
as a display of its ability to conduct pioneering, ambitious 
projects despite a lack of funds. The mirror was supposed to work 
like an artificial moon, reflecting a beam of sunlight across the 
earth.

	Amoco To Cut 1,500 Chicago Jobs  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- BP Amoco said it expects to cut 1,500 management  
and non-management jobs in the Chicago area in the next 18 months, 
eliminating almost one in four positions here. The move stems from 
the merger of British Petroleum and Amoco last year and from the 
continuing slump in world oil prices, the company said yesterday. 
Most of the cuts will be at the company's downtown Chicago 
skyscraper, the former Amoco headquarters.

<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A house painter convicted of raping  
his 10-year-old stepdaughter was executed today, the first inmate 
to be put to death here in 23 years. Leo Echegaray died by lethal 
injection at the national penitentiary in the Manila suburb of 
Muntinlupa. His execution set off a furious debate in the 
Philippines over the death penalty. A prison official said, ``Baby, 
forgive me,'' were Echegaray's last words; the media has referred 
to his stepdaughter as ``Baby Echegaray.'' But other witnesses said 
he had instead asked for forgiveness from the Philippine people.

	Senate To Show Lewinsky Video  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky makes clear in her videotaped  
deposition that she now has ``mixed feelings'' for President 
Clinton and insists he never suggested she file a false affidavit 
to deny their affair. With Clinton's impeachment trial a week from 
completion, Ms. Lewinsky, in testimony obtained by The Associated

he told her she might have to turn over gifts if they were 
subpoenaed in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.

Reno: The United States continues to be vulnerable to bombing 
attacks, both at home and abroad. Only about 10 percent of the 
planned work has been performed on upgrading U.S. embassies since 
last August's twin bombings in Africa, Albright told a Senate

Johnson was to sentence Tyson after a hearing. The judge's decision 
will help determine whether Tyson will have to return to jail in 
Indiana for violating probation for a 1991 rape conviction. It also 
could lead boxing authorities to strip Tyson of his license for the 
second time in less than two years.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Decline; Dow Down 2.06 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower today as technology issues  
continued their slide. The Dow Jones industrial average teetered 
between positive and negative territory. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow was down 2.06 at 9,302.44.  
Throughout the morning, it stayed within a narrow range, from 20 
points higher to 20 points lower than Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, which was hit Thursday with the  
third-biggest point loss in its history, faltered again. The 
technology-dominated index fell 57.89 to 2,352.18. 
</P>
<P>
	An overall weakness in technology stocks was compounded by the  
chip makers. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices fell 2 1/8 to 16 3/4, as 
investors reacted to a disappointing earnings forecast released 
Thursday and fears of an impending price war. ADM dragged its 
competitors lower as well, with Micron Technology falling 6 1/2 to 
69 1/8, and Texas Instruments down 3 5/16 to 92 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The continued decline of technology stocks has worried some  
analysts about the impact on the broader market. High-flying tech 
companies have been largely responsible for the market's overall 
advances, leading some to fear that once the technology bubble 
burst, the entire market will cave in. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, technology wasn't the only weak sector today. Brokerage  
stocks were lower across the board, from blue-chip firms like 
Merrill Lynch, which fell 1 9/16 to 71 1/2, to online brokerages, 
which began tumbling Thursday after New York state's attorney 
general announced an inquiry into their business practices. ETrade 
Group Inc., which was hampered by technical difficulties Wednesday 
and Thursday, fell 7 7/8 to 45 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks failed to get much support from a government report that  
showed the U.S. unemployment rate held steady in January at a 
28-year low of 4.3 percent. Interest rates rose in U.S. credit 
markets after the figures were released. Yields on 30-year bonds, a 
barometer of long-term borrowing costs for consumers and business, 
climbed to 5.33 percent from 5.29 percent just before the data were 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly lower today, although their  
losses were slim. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 11.44 points at  
1,237.05, and the Russell 2000, which is dominated by small-company 
stocks, was down 5.10 at 412.69. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 3.11 points at 587.94, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was off 1.50 points at 
705.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to a brisk 406.5 million 
shares, ahead of Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.4 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.5 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.97 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
5.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Turns to Small Enterprise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton urged Congress Friday to  
more than double the government's support for small enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an obligation now to spread the spirit and the  
opportunity for enterprise to all the American people,'' the 
president said in an East Room awards ceremony honoring six 
outstanding microenterprise development and lending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposed budget for fiscal 2000 asks Congress for $83  
million -- up from $32 million for the current fiscal year -- for 
technical and training assistance to organizations that support 
microenterprise, which typically includes businesses that employ 
five or fewer people and need less than $25,000 in credit to get up 
and running. 
</P>
<P>
	Individuals launching such ventures -- sometimes out their  
garages -- need basic technical help to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Such help can ``transform welfare checks to paychecks, poverty  
to economic growth and income, despair to hope,'' said first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, for whom microenterprise has become a pet 
issue, especially in her overseas travels. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in Clinton's budget request is $15 million for  
technical support and research on innovations that can help new 
businesses and a doubling, to $32 million, of the Small Business 
Administration's Microloan Program, which links loans to 
microentreprenuers with training. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole country is basically built by entrepreneurs --  
whether they're in Silicon Valley or young investment bankers in 
Manhattan, or people running the street vending operations out here 
for the tourists in Washington,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The firms receiving recognition from the president Friday are  
The Micro Industry Credit Rural Organization of Tucson, Ariz.; The 
Detroit Entrepreneurship Institute Inc.; The Northeast Entrepreneur 
Fund Inc. of Virginia, Minn.; The Institute for Social and Economic 
Development of Iowa City, Iowa; The Montana Microbusiness Finance 
Program of Helena, Mont., and The Corporation for Enterprise 
Development of Washington.

</P>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- John J. Barone, a lawyer, entrepreneur and  
former chairman of the Ohio State University Board of Trustees, 
died Thursday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Barone was a lawyer for more than 62 years and served as U.S.  
commissioner for northwest Ohio -- equivalent to a U.S. magistrate -- 
from 1945 to 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an Ohio State trustee for nine years, ending in 1993 when  
he was chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Barone got involved in many businesses over the years. He was a  
principal owner and chairman of the board of Toledo Testing 
Laboratory, now known as TolTest Inc., until the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	He established Barone Enterprises and Rosie's Fine Foods, which  
began marketing food products in the 1970s. In the 1980s, he helped 
sons Philip and Michael start a chain of Rosie's Family 
Restaurants. There are five such restaurants in the Toledo area, 
named after Mrs. Barone, whose Italian recipes are featured on the 
menus.

	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Neville Bonner, the first Aborigine  
elected to Australia's federal Parliament, died Friday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonner became one of Australia's highest profile Aborigines and  
an important influence on Aboriginal issues during a time of 
conservative government. 
</P>
<P>
	Scrutinized intensely from within his own party and from  
Aborigines watching the first black face in Parliament in almost 
100 years of federated government, Bonner was cautious in his 
initial approach. 
</P>
<P>
	He became a consistent advocate of Aboriginal land rights and  
critic of assimilationist policies, positions that often put him at 
odds with his own colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonner lost his seat after being relegated to an unwinnable  
position on the Liberals' 1983 Senate ticket, prompting him to say: 
``I feel rejected by the tribe I chose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He held numerous low-key public service positions during the  
1980s and '90s.

Monday of kidney failure. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	While he was student body president at Clark College, Brown and  
actor Charles Black helped organize more than 200 students who 
occupied 11 segregated lunch counters on March 15, 1960 to protest. 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1966  
and served 11 years. He was President Carter's deputy campaign 
director in 1976 and became the first black deputy chairman of the 
Democratic National Committee.

opinion-page editor for The Oregonian and a lifelong advocate for 
minority journalists, died Thursday of cancer. He was 51. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to work for Portland's Daily Journal of Commerce and  
later The Oregonian, where he served as reporter and award-winning 
opinion-page editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Active in the Asian American Journalists Association, Chen

	ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) -- Don Dunstan, a colorful Australian  
politician and social reformer, died Saturday of cancer. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunstan was premier of South Australia State for two terms in  
the late 1960s and 1970s, and was an influential member of the 
Labor Party nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunstan's period in office was marked by social reforms  
including the decriminalization of homosexuality, making his the 
first state in the country to do so. He was also known for 
supporting the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dunstan era was one of major reform that turned conservative  
South Australia into one of the nation's most progressive states in 
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	One day in 1972, Dunstan defied convention and attended  
parliament wearing pink shorts instead of the traditional gray 
suit. Dunstan said he had sought to inject some panache into the 
conservative corridors of power.

	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Lotfi el-Khouli, a prominent Egyptian  
writer, died Friday of pneumonia. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer by training, el-Khouli joined Egypt's leading newspaper  
Al-Ahram in 1963 and became one of its top columnists. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1965 to 1977, he edited El-Talia, a magazine that  
propagated socialism and anti-Western views. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Khouli was best known for his positions on Israel.  
</P>
<P>
	He began as a staunch opponent of the Jewish state and served as  
a consultant to Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser 
Arafat from the early 1970's. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, el-Khouli was a member of the Egyptian delegation to  
the Middle East Peace Conference in Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
	After Arafat signed the Oslo peace accord with Israel in 1993,  
el-Khouli became one of Egypt's chief advocates of peace with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he helped found the Egyptian Peace Movement, a group  
that advocates normal relations with Israel as opposed to a 
so-called ``cold peace,'' where unions and other groups refuse to 
have any contact with their northern neighbor. 
</P>

<P>
	Reingold, who attended the first White House Conference on Aging  
in 1961, sought a national observance of the role grandparents play

 *Spencer A. Samuels    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Spencer A. Samuels, an international art  
dealer and expert on old masters who advised J. Paul Getty on his 
art acquisitions, died Saturday of pneumonia. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuels organized major acquisitions for such museums as the New  
York Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Chicago Art Institute, the 
National Gallery of Art, the Tate Gallery and the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
	His expertise was also sought out by his friend Getty and other  
major collectors, including Los Angeles' Norton Simon. 
</P>
<P>
	As a dealer, Samuels sold rare works by such old masters as  
Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Raphael, Goya and El 
Greco as well as works by French Impressionists such as Degas, 
Renoir and Toulouse-Lautrec, and more contemporary art by Pablo 
Picasso and Jackson Pollock. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, Samuels discovered the world's 35th known Vermeer,  
``St. Praxedis,'' when he bought an oil painting from the estate of 
a private collector. The painting was attributed to an obscure 
Italian artist named Felice Ficherelli but was signed ``Meer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A National Gallery curator authenticated it as Vermeer's copy of  
a Ficherelli work painted about 1640. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuels later worked for other art houses as Duveen Bros. and  
eventually formed his own Spencer A. Samuels &AMP; Co. Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Debate Held on Lowering Air Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- To rein in airfare costs that have soared  
to $1 million a year, Larry Peckham is pondering relocating his 
software company from upstate New York to a larger city. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were in Baltimore, it would be one-fifth as much. We  
would save $800,000, which would double our profits,'' said 
Peckham, who founded LPA Software Inc. and employs 150 people in 
suburban Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
	Peckham was among dozens of business, government and airline  
representatives who took part in a debate in Rochester on Friday on 
ways to lower plane fares in medium-sized cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that the benefits of deregulation have not flowed  
to all cities and regions,'' said U.S. Transportation Secretary 
Rodney Slater, who led the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater chose Rochester because its rates are among the nation's  
highest -- an average of 31.1 cents a mile. That's the fourth 
highest in the country, after Richmond, Va., Charlotte, N.C., and 
Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the cheapest rate can be found in Las Vegas, where  
travelers pay about 11.1 cents a mile, according to DOT statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott Seiden, a vice president of Northwest Airlines, said the  
DOT numbers give an inaccurate picture of the market because they 
lump together all kinds of fares -- from 90-day advance to the more 
expensive walk-up fare. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is considering a variety of proposals to induce  
carriers to improve service to secondary routes and to crack down 
on airlines that squash low-cost competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Louise Slaughter, a Democrat whose district includes  
Rochester, reintroduced a bill last month designed to boost 
low-cost airlines by reallocating slots to them at major airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel agent Juliann Koch said many of her Rochester customers  
trek hours to larger cities to get cheaper flights. But others, she 
said, just ``grin and bear it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The airlines have us in a stronghold,'' Koch said. ``People  
have to fly and if they're going to buy the tickets, they're not 
going to lower the fares.''

<HEADLINE> CBS Posts $1 Million Quarterly Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. posted a $1 million fourth-quarter  
loss on severance payments to its former chief and losses from 
selling stakes in two cable networks, reversing an $861 million 
profit from a year earlier on gains from selling industrial 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the one-time gains or costs in both periods, CBS  
posted stronger profits from continuing operations in the latest 
quarter. Growth in its radio and outdoor advertising business 
offset lower television results, despite the NFL's successful 
return to the CBS network. 
</P>
<P>
	The profits from continuing operations exceeded Wall Street  
expectations. CBS shares rose 31 1/4 to close at $36.12 1/2 Friday on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS said its per-share results were breakeven for the quarter  
ended Dec. 31. In the same period a year earlier, CBS earned $1.25 
per share, but the profits came from an $871 million gain on the 
sale of the former Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s remaining 
industrial businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue jumped 22 percent to $1.79 billion from $1.47 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest quarter included $7 million in severance payments to  
former CBS chairman and chief executive Michael Jordan, who stepped 
down in October -- earlier than expected -- after transforming the 
former Westinghouse into a pure media company. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS also lost $7 million on sales of stakes in two cable  
networks. CBS sold its half of CBS Eye on People to Discovery 
Communications Inc. and sold a controlling stake in the 
Spanish-language news channel CBS TeleNoticias to Mexico's Grupo 
Medcom SA. 
</P>
<P>
	But excluding all special items, profits from continuing  
operations were $17 million, or 2 cents per share, in the 1998 
quarter, compared to a loss of $10 million, or 1 cent per share, in 
the 1997 period. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected CBS to post breakeven per-share results  
from continuing operations. 
</P>

	Fourth-quarter operating profits rose 25 percent at Infinity  
Broadcasting Corp., its radio and outdoor advertising business, on 
strong advertising revenue and the acquisition of 98 stations from 
American Radio Systems Corp. CBS sold an 18 percent stake in 
Infinity to the public in December, raising nearly $3 billion in 
richest initial public offering ever made by a media company. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits at the televisions division -- the CBS network,  
television stations and cable channels -- dropped 81 percent. CBS 
blamed lower syndication revenue and smaller profits from 
programming other than the NFL, which the network regained this 
season after four years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, CBS lost $21 million, or 3 cents per share,  
compared to profits of $549 million, or 84 cents per share, in 
1997. Revenue rose to $6.81 billion from $5.37 billion.

<HEADLINE> Dupont Won't Mine Swamp Titanium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The DuPont Co. agreed to accept tens of millions  
of dollars Friday to abandon plans to mine titanium in the piney 
woods along the edge of the Okefenokee Swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	The roughly $90 million plan, worked out with environmentalists  
and other interests, also prevents anyone else from ever mining 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Dupont would get the largest single share of the $90 million.  
Much of the rest of the money would go to area municipalities to 
make up for the tax revenue they would have received from the 
mining project. 
</P>
<P>
	The price tag drew criticism from Interior Secretary Bruce  
Babbitt, who said it was inflated and unfair to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials must still figure out where the money will come from.  
Among the potential sources: a federal conservation fund, state 
conservation funds, support from companies and foundations, and 
fees from tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont, based in Wilmington, Del., bought the rights in the  
early 1990s to mine titanium ore on 38,000 acres of privately owned 
land on the eastern edge of the 438,000-acre Okefenokee National 
Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Georgia. DuPont uses the mineral to 
produce white pigment for paints and plastics. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists feared that the dredging needed to mine the  
land would destroy the swamp's ecosystem. However, the project 
enjoyed wide support among area residents eager for the jobs and 
tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement to abandon the project was tentatively reached in  
December by a mediation group, formed by DuPont, that included 
representatives of environmental groups, timber and mining 
interests, the tourism industry, local governments and Indian 
tribes. DuPont signed the agreement on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont executive Rick Straitman said the company wanted to avoid  
a long legal fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good deal. This is the right approach,'' said Jim  
Waltman, director of refuges and wildlife for the Wilderness 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont wants to recoup its $20 million investment plus some of  
the anticipated mining profits, Straitman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Nance, the administrator of Charlton County, said his  
county will seek $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also calls for $5 million to build a wetlands education  
and research center near the Okefenokee and to bring more tourism 
to the swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	To help set the exact amount of compensation, the property and  
mineral rights will have to be appraised.

<HEADLINE> Hockey Boss Upset at NHL Summit Snub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- International hockey boss Rene  
Fasel says the NHL failed to represent the interests of North 
American fans and players by snubbing the world doping summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed that despite our invitation, the NHL Players  
Association and the NHL did not send representatives here to 
participate in the discussion to find a solution for them,'' said 
Fasel, president of the International Ice Hockey Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been easier if they were here to ask their  
opinion, but I cannot speak for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day world conference, which resulted in a diluted  
antidrug resolution, was an attempt to crack down on drugs in sport 
and harmonize antidoping sanctions among international federations. 
</P>
<P>
	For Fasel, that posed a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans were criticized for lecturing and calling for  
antidoping reforms here when they still have doping problems in 
their country,'' Fasel said. ``Of course, everyone does. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that's why I was rather quiet here. I'm also sitting on a  
fence. The NHL has no antidoping rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fasel said the IIHF would organize talks with the NHL in order  
to resolve the long-standing deadlock between the two bodies on the 
issue of doping. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the mandates for the new antidoping agency is to step up  
out-of-competition testing. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL players have mostly been free of drug testing throughout the  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out-of-competition testing is a problem we'll have to discuss  
and resolve with the NHL,'' Fasel said. ``If athletes cheat, they 
must be caught. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that's my problem. Like basketball, in the world  
championships we use 80 to 120 players who play for the NHL where 
there are no antidoping tests, no antidoping lists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fasel maintained hockey doesn't have the major doping problems  
of many other sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we have some anabolic steroid and human growth hormone  
problems,'' Fasel said. ``But in North America, most NHL players 
come from our system, through the CHA and AHL, where we run the 
antidoping programs and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``And Canada, since the Ben Johnson affair, has become the most  
rigorous and tough on doping control.''

<HEADLINE> States To Divide $5B Tobacco Trust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Tobacco states have tentatively decided how  
to divide a $5.15 billion trust fund for farmers struggling to 
survive in a shrinking market. Now, they have to decide how to 
define a tobacco farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	At a closed door session Thursday, about 70 people from 14  
tobacco-growing states tentatively agreed to slice up the trust 
fund using a basic quota system already employed by the federal 
Department of Agriculture, said North Carolina Attorney General 
Mike Easley and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most equitable way and what our farm groups want  
here. All states come out pretty much even with that,'' Easley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The private trust fund was created last month by tobacco-growing  
states and cigarette-makers as part of the landmark $206 billion 
settlement between the tobacco industry and 46 states. The fund's 
purpose is to aid tobacco farmers, sure to be squeezed by the 
higher cigarette prices and curbs on tobacco promotion that are 
part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, North Carolina, the largest flue-cured tobacco  
state, and Kentucky, the biggest burley tobacco producer, would 
receive the biggest shares -- 38.34 percent, or about $1.97 billion, 
and 29.97 percent, or $1.54 billion, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	But one issue that remains unresolved is how each state will  
define a tobacco farmer. Is it the holder of the quota -- the 
government's license to market tobacco -- or the tenant farmer who 
tends to the land? 
</P>
<P>
	``When it leaves here and goes back to the state level, that's  
when the civil war starts,'' said Danny McKinney, chief executive 
officer of the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative in Lexington, Ky. 
``It's going to get pretty hateful pretty darn quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to North Carolina and Kentucky, other states and  
their percentages of funds received under the quota system would 
be: Tennessee, 7.65 percent, or $394 million; South Carolina, 7.01 
percent, or $361 million; Virginia, 6.65 percent, or $342 million; 
and Georgia, 5.91 percent, or $304 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio would get 1.37 percent; Indiana, 1.17 percent; Florida,  
1.16 percent; Missouri, 0.43 percent; West Virginia, 0.28 percent; 
and Alabama, 0.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Each state likely would give up a small portion for Maryland and  
Pennsylvania tobacco farmers, who are not part of the federal 
government's quota system.

<HEADLINE> IBM Developes Plastic Transistors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers soon may find rugged new laptop  
computers and handheld phones that can survive a drop to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM researchers report in today's edition of the journal Science  
that they have developed transistors based on plastic rather than 
fragile silicon. The new transistors can operate at the low 
voltages needed for the display screens on these devices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if you drop your display you won't have to buy a new  
one,'' said Christos D. Dimitrakopoulos, who led the research 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous polymer transistors have required as much as 100 volts  
of power, which is impractical for equipment like laptop computers, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their plastic transistors, the IBM researchers experimented  
with a different type of insulator between layers. Instead of 
silicon dioxide, they used barium zirconate, which permits more of 
an electric field to pass through it. 
</P>
<P>
	With that insulator, the plastic transistor could operate with  
just a few volts of power, they found. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to making a more rugged computer, it might also cut  
costs, Dimitrakopoulos said. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to speculate on how soon the plastic-based  
transistors might be on the market, citing the need for further 
research.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Votes on Gay Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame voted unanimously Friday not  
to include homosexuality in its anti-discrimination policy, fearing 
the move would allow the courts to interpret Roman Catholic 
doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's Board of Fellows, charged with maintaining the  
school's Roman Catholic character, said in a statement from London 
that they did not ``believe that the university should leave to 
civil courts the interpretation and application of Church 
teaching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision thwarted plans by homosexual students to test the  
university's discrimination policies in federal court, exactly what 
the school feared most, said Tim Byrne, a member of the Progressive 
Student Alliance that has fought for the change. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the short run, we'll try to win some smaller battles to  
attack some other things we're after on a department by department 
basis,'' he said. ``I guess we retract a little bit and get at the 
small gains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Catholic doctrine teaches that homosexuals are to be loved  
like all of God's creatures, but that homosexual sex is a sin. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1995, when a gay and lesbian student group was banned from  
meeting on campus, Notre Dame has struggled to welcome homosexual 
students while steadfastly refusing to change the discrimination 
clause. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the administration issued a spirit of inclusion  
statement, which condemns harassment of gay and lesbian students 
and faculty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our experience is lots of empty promises that we won't  
discriminate year after year,'' Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
	School spokesman Dennis Brown said the Fellows, six priests and  
six lay people, are the highest authority at the school and their 
vote likely ends any chance the issue will be addressed by the 
administration again in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	``This issue has been studied very closely by the  
administration, and we've made what we think is the best choice 
institutionally,'' he said. ``At the same time we have the spirit 
of inclusion on record to indicate that discrimination will not be 
tolerated here.''

<HEADLINE> Brooklyn Bridge Road To Be Repaired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Brooklyn Bridge is falling down -- sort of.  
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors discovered that a road along the 115-year-old bridge  
was disintegrating, prompting city officials to order emergency 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakened road poses no danger to 130,000 motorists who use  
the stone-and-steel bridge every day, Department of Transportation 
Commissioner Wilbur Chapman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``One hundred pound chunks (of concrete) are not going to be  
falling off the bridge,'' he said. ``There is no danger to anyone 
at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chapman said the repairs were designated an emergency ``so we  
would not have to go through the normal procurement process, which 
takes about two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six-month, $33.5 million project is set to begin in April.  
The trouble was first spotted in June when asphalt was removed as 
part of a planned repaving job and inspectors found a 3-by-4 inch 
hole in the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that point it became clear that we should do an entire  
redecking rather than just a cosmetic paving job,'' Chapman said.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Lifts Ban on Louisville </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Louisville's basketball team today was  
cleared to compete in postseason play this year after its ban was 
overturned by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeals committee by the governing body reversed an earlier  
finding. The victory by the school in its appeal appeared to be on 
procedural grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been something held over our head,'' Louisville coach  
Denny Crum said. ``We're happy that it's behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA said in the original case it had not given Louisville  
adequate notice that the infractions under investigation might 
constitute a ``major violation.'' And such a violation could 
warrant a postseason ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville had received a three-year probation for two  
violations by former assistant coach Scooter McCray, and was barred 
from the 1998-99 postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The university appeared before the infractions committee three  
weeks ago to have the ban overturned. The ban would have precluded 
the Cardinals (11-7, 6-3) from playing in the Conference USA 
tournament or the NCAA tournament this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Other penalties against the Cardinals remain in effect,  
including the loss of three scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason that we invested so much effort in this appeal is  
because we wanted our student athletes to be able to go as far as 
their talent, their energy and their ability would take them,'' 
university president John Shumaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the school's appearance before the infractions panel last  
August, NCAA investigator Rich Hilliard said the enforcement staff 
didn't consider Louisville a ``repeat violator'' because he didn't 
consider the violations to be major and because of their timing in 
relation to an earlier probation. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA already had placed Louisville on probation for two  
years in 1996 after an investigation unearthed questions concerning 
former player Samaki Walker's use of two cars during the summer and 
fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville didn't argue the point, but it became the crux of the  
committee's assessment of severe penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA said McCray secured a discounted hotel room in  
September 1996 for Fred Johnson, the father of forward Nate 
Johnson, and later provided his personal credit card to keep him 
from being evicted because of a delinquent bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate appeal involving McCray, who has since been  
reassigned in the athletic department, the NCAA appeals committee 
said the former assistant had not been given adequate notice. 
</P>
<P>
	That ruling immediately lifts a requirement that any school  
wanting to hire McCray had to go before the NCAA infractions 
committee.

<HEADLINE>  King Hussein Returns to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Gravely ill with cancer, King Hussein  
arrived home today to a nation deeply worried about what their 
monarch's death could mean for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The 63-year-old ruler left an American hospital the night before  
after his body rejected a bone marrow transplant meant to fight off 
his lymphatic cancer. A royal statement said the king was returning 
to his homeland at his own ``persistent wish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides carried Hussein, who was attached to an IV, off the plane  
on a stretcher, said royal palace officials. His face flushed, he 
repeatedly reached for the hand of his American-born wife, Queen 
Noor. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobs from female relatives interrupted the somber silence, said  
the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, asked how grave the situation was, an official said  
the king's liver and kidneys had failed, his brain had stopped 
functioning and he was surviving on life support. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists were not allowed to see the 63-year-old king, who  
arrived from the United States on a private jet at the Queen Alia 
International Airport on the outskirts of Amman. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members, including Crown Prince Abdullah, the king's  
37-year-old son and heir, met the monarch. Hussein was accompanied 
on the flight by Noor and others in the royal family. 
</P>
<P>
	A motorcade of more than 70 cars escorted by the king's elite  
security detachment drove slowly from the airport. Two ambulances, 
one of them carrying the king, drove at its head. The streets were 
blocked to the hospital, which was heavily guarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Hassan, whom Hussein deposed as heir last month, arrived  
at the hospital shortly after the king's motorcade. 
</P>
<P>

Medical City, for further treatment. It was not immediately clear 
why plans were changed. The hospital was closed to the public.

paying visits, the sources said.

<P>
	In Amman, a capital of 1.2 million people, streets were quiet

television and scoured newspapers for clues to the king's 
condition.

<HEADLINE>  King Hussein Returns to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Gravely ill with cancer, King Hussein  
arrived home today to a nation deeply worried about what their 
monarch's death could mean for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The 63-year-old ruler left an American hospital the night before  
after his body rejected a bone marrow transplant meant to fight off 
his lymphatic cancer. A royal statement said the king was returning 
to his homeland at his own ``persistent wish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides carried Hussein, who was attached to an IV, off the plane  
on a stretcher, said royal palace officials. His face flushed, he 
repeatedly reached for the hand of his American-born wife, Queen 
Noor. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobs from female relatives interrupted the somber silence, said  
the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, asked how grave the situation was, an official said  
the king's liver and kidneys had failed, his brain had stopped 
functioning and he was surviving on life support. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists were not allowed to see the 63-year-old king, who  
arrived from the United States on a private jet at the Queen Alia 
International Airport on the outskirts of Amman. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members, including Crown Prince Abdullah, the king's  
37-year-old son and heir, met the monarch. Hussein was accompanied 
on the flight by Noor and others in the royal family. 
</P>
<P>
	A motorcade of more than 70 cars escorted by the king's elite  
security detachment drove slowly from the airport. Two ambulances, 
one of them carrying the king, drove at its head. The streets were 
blocked to the hospital, which was heavily guarded.

<HEADLINE> Report: Pats' Edwards May Miss 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Robert Edwards, who rushed for 1,115 yards for  
the New England Patriots this season, could miss the 1999 season 
after injuring his left knee during a beach football game, 
according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards underwent surgery after hurting himself in a flag  
football game for NFL rookies on the beach at Waikiki. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe, citing Patriots officials who spoke on the  
condition of anonymity, reported Saturday that Edwards may be out 
for the entire 1999 season. The Globe said Edwards dislocated his 
knee, injuring an artery. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, a first-round draft pick by the Patriots, hurt his knee  
when he came down in a heap after trying to break up a pass in the 
five-player per side game. 
</P>
<P>
	An NFL spokesman said Edwards underwent surgery at Straub Clinic  
and Hospital in Honolulu, where he was expected to remain for 
several days. No other specifics on the type of injury or 
recuperation time were released. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still collecting information as to the specifics and  
the extent of the injury,'' Patriots coach Pete Carroll said in a 
statement. ``Obviously, we are very concerned about Robert. We are 
anxious to bring him back to New England so our doctors can 
evaluate him and prepare him to begin his rehabilitation process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots' rookie jumped up for a pass with Oakland's Charles  
Woodson and San Francisco's R.W. McQuarters, the three tumbled to 
the sand, and Edwards remained down, in obvious pain. He was 
carried away in an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Rookie Beach Bowl'' is one of the activities leading up to  
Sunday's Pro Bowl. Edwards is not on the all-star roster.

<HEADLINE> Patriots To Finalize Move Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland and New  
England Patriots owner Robert Kraft again put off signing an 
agreement on the team's move to Hartford, saying it will be signed 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	And they say their pact can be changed if they can't figure out  
how to build a $374 million stadium on a site now occupied by a 
steam plant and polluted soil. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowland said talks are ongoing with steam plant owner CTG  
Resources that would allow replacement of the facility and clean up 
of the polluted development site known as Adriaen's Landing. The 
plant heats and cools much of downtown Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	``This development agreement that we'll be signing next week is  
not contingent upon the site,'' Rowland said. ``We do not have to 
have at this moment a complete proposal on CTG -- where it's going 
to go and how it's going to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once signed, the deal will commit Connecticut to building a $374  
million stadium for the Patriots, who will use the stadium for 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday marked the second self-imposed deadline Kraft and Rowland  
missed to sign the development agreement. After the $374 million 
stadium spending bill was passed in December, they said the 
agreement would be signed by Jan. 15. That deadline was then 
extended to Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rowland and Kraft insist their deal is not in jeopardy.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of issues still to resolve, but they're not  
unresolvable,'' Rowland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four of the NFL's 31 team owners must approve the team's  
move from Foxboro, Mass.

<HEADLINE> Scans Study Brain Damage in Strokes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ultra-fast brain scans are giving  
doctors a clearer picture of what's gone wrong inside stroke 
victims' heads so that they can decide in a hurry how to treat 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The innovation is part of a sudden sense of urgency that has  
overtaken the field of stroke treatment. New drugs have been 
developed that can stop a stroke in its tracks, provided they are 
given quickly and to the right patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Until about two years ago, there was little advantage to  
pinpointing the precise location of a stroke because there was 
absolutely nothing doctors could do about it. That changed with the 
discovery that the clot-dissolving medicine TPA can often reverse a 
stroke -- just as it does a heart attack -- if given within the first 
three hours of symptoms. Still more medicines are in development. 
</P>
<P>
	Now doctors see clear advantages to being able to locate the  
stroke, see how much brain tissue it has already killed and 
estimate how much more is at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	At a stroke conference Friday sponsored by the American Heart  
Association, specialists described the arrival of new kinds of 
scanning technology that give them this information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we can look into the black box of the brain and see what's  
going on as it's going on,'' said Dr. Walter J. Koroshetz of 
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The new technology involves souped-up MRI -- magnetic resonance  
imaging -- machines that can almost instantly show which brain 
tissue is already beyond saving and how much more is likely to die. 
</P>
<P>
	One kind of scan, called diffusion-weighted imaging, shows  
exactly which brain tissue is already dead. Another kind, called 
perfusion-weighted MRI, shows which parts of the brain are still 
alive but vulnerable because they are being starved of blood. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 hospitals in the United States already have MRI  
machines that can take these images. Although they are not 
routinely used yet in the first hours after strokes, doctors at the 
meeting said they expect this will happen within the next five 
years as the advantages of these scans become clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, doctors begin treating with TPA by assessing  
patients' outward symptoms, such as slurred speech and paralysis, 
and by giving a CT scan, a kind of X-ray that rules out the 
possibility that the stroke is caused by bleeding rather than a 
clot. However, TPA itself can trigger bleeding, and some patients 
are reluctant to take the risk without being sure it is outweighed 
by the potential benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Koroshetz said that with the scans, doctors can actually show  
patients where their blood clot is and how much brain tissue is 
still at risk but could be saved with TPA. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other uses:  
</P>
<P>
	--Determine whether patients have had mini-strokes -- what doctors  
call transient ischemic attacks, or TIAs. Diffusion scans show 
these as pinpoints of dead tissue. Victims recover fully but run a 
high risk of major strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Study whether so-called neuroprotective drugs work. These  
medicines are intended to guard the brain against a cascade of 
damage that continues for days after a stroke, but proving their 
benefits has been hard. MRI scans will give doctors an objective 
way of judging them. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tailor treatment better. Now doctors do not give TPA beyond  
three hours, because the risks of bleeding are probably bigger than 
the benefits. Yet doctors believe some people might still benefit 
up to 24 hours later. Scans may show which ones still have 
salvageable brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``The therapeutic window of opportunity is not determined by the  
clock,'' said Dr. Steven Warach of Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital 
in Boston. ``Beyond the magical three hours, the stroke is still 
going on, so there is still a chance of doing something.''

<HEADLINE> Delphi Automotive Launches IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Delphi Automotive Systems Corp. on Thursday  
priced its initial public offering of 100 million shares at $17 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi, which is splitting off from automotive giant General  
Motors Corp., will raise $1.7 billion through the IPO. The company 
will begin trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	It is one of the largest offerings ever, though it is dwarfed by  
Conoco Inc's $4.5 billion IPO last October and Lucent Technologies 
Inc.'s $3 billion spinoff from AT&AMP;T Corp. in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi had expected to price its IPO between $15 and $18 a  
share. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  
Delphi said it expects GM to remain its largest customer for a 
significant period but that such sales ultimately would decline. 
Given that, Delphi's strategy will focus on broadening sales to 
other customers as it is no longer ``a captive supplier to GM.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi earned $370 million on revenue of $28.4 billion in 1998,  
which places it among America's largest corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in Troy, Mich., Delphi making brakes, shocks, struts, air  
conditioners, compressors, steering systems, air bags and other 
automotive parts for about 30 automakers worldwide. Delphi has 
204,000 employees in 36 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	While GM will continue to hold more than 80 percent of Delphi's  
common stock, the Detroit-based company plans to distribute the 
remaining shares to GM shareholders later this year.

<HEADLINE> Blumenthal Deposition Excerpts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts of Sidney Blumenthal's deposition testimony from Feb.  
3: 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutor Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif.: After you related the  
conversation that you had with the first lady to the president, 
what do you remember saying to the president next about the subject 
of Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Well, I recall telling him that I understood he felt  
that way, and that he did help people, but that he should stop 
trying to help troubled people personally; that troubled people are 
troubled and that they can get you in a lot of messes and that you 
had to cut yourself off from it and you just had to do it. That's 
what I recall saying to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Do you also remember in that conversation saying to him,  
`You really need to not do that at this point, that you can't get 
near anybody who is even remotely crazy. You're president'? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Yes. I think that was a little later in the  
conversation, but I do recall saying that. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: When you told the president that he should avoid contact  
with troubled people, what did the president say to you in 
response? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I'm trying to remember the sequence of it. He -- he  
said that was very difficult for him. He said he -- he felt a need 
to help troubled people, and it was hard for him to -- to cut 
himself off from doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Do you remember him saying specifically, 'It's very  
difficult for me to do that, given how I am. I want to help 
people'? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I recall -- I recall that.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: And when the president referred to trying to help people,  
did you understand him in that conversation to be referring to 
Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I think it included Monica Lewinsky, but also many  
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Right, but it was your understanding that he was all -- he  
was specifically referring to Monica Lewinsky in that list of 
people that he tried to help? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I believe that -- that was implied.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Mr. Blumenthal, did the president then relate a  
conversation he had with Dick Morris to you? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: He did.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: What was the substance of that conversation, as the  
president related it to you? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: He said that he had spoken to Dick Morris earlier  
that day, and that Dick Morris had told him that if Nixon, Richard 
Nixon, had given a nationally televised speech at the beginning of 
the Watergate affair, acknowledging everything he had done wrong, 
he may well have survived it, and that was the conversation that 
Dick Morris -- that's what Dick Morris said to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Did it sound to you like the president was suggesting  
perhaps he would go on television and give a national speech? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Well, I don't know. I didn't know.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: And when the president related the substance of his  
conversation with Dick Morris to you, how did you respond to that? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I said to the president, `Well, what have you done  
wrong?' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Did he reply?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: He did.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: What did he say?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: He said, `I haven't done anything wrong.'  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: And what did you say to that response?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Well, I said, as I recall, `That's one of the  
stupidest ideas I ever heard. If you haven't done anything wrong, 
why would you do that?' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Did the president then give you his account of what  
happened between him and Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: As I recall, he did.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: What did the president tell you?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: He, uh -- he spoke, uh, fairly rapidly, as I recall,  
at that point and said that she had come on to him and made a 
demand for sex, that he had rebuffed her, turned her down, and that 
she, uh, threatened him. And, uh, he said that she said to him, uh, 
that she was called 'the stalker' by her peers and that she hated 
the term, and that she would claim that they had had an affair 
whether they had or they hadn't, and that she would tell people. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Do you remember him also saying that the reason Monica  
Lewinsky would tell people that is because then she wouldn't be 
known by her peers as 'the stalker' anymore? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Yes, that's right.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Do you remember the president also saying that -- and I'm  
quoting: 'I've gone down that road before. I've caused pain for a 
lot of people. I'm not going to do that again'? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Yes. He told me that.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: And that was in the same conversation that you had with  
the president? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Right, in -- in that sequence.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Can you describe for us the president's demeanor when he  
shared this information with you? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Yes. He was, uh, very upset. I thought he was a man  
in anguish. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: And at that point, did you repeat your earlier admonition  
to him as far as not trying to help troubled people? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I did. I -- I think that's when I told him that you  
can't get near crazy people, uh, or troubled people. Uh, you're 
president; you just have to separate yourself from this. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Do you remember the president also saying something about  
being like a character in a novel? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I do.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: What did he say?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Uh, he said to me, uh, that, uh, he felt like a  
character in a novel. Uh, he felt like somebody, uh, surrounded by, 
uh, an oppressive environment that was creating a lie about him. He 
said he felt like, uh, the character in the novel ``Darkness at 
Noon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Did he also say he felt like he can't get the truth out?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Yes, I -- I believe he said that.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Politicians are always loathe to confess their ignorance,  
particularly on videotape. I will do so. I'm unfamiliar with the 
novel ``Darkness at Noon.'' Did you -- do you have any familiarity 
with that, or did you understand what the president meant by that? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I -- I understood what he meant. I -- I was familiar  
with the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: What -- what did he mean by that, per your understanding?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Uh, the book is by Arthur Koestler, who was somebody  
who had been a communist and had become disillusioned with 
communism. And it's an anti-communist novel. It's about, uh, uh, 
the Stalinist purge trials and somebody who was a loyal communist 
who then is put in one of Stalin's prisons and held on trial and 
executed, uh, and it's about his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: Did you understand what the president was trying to  
communicate when he related his situation to the character in that 
novel? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I think he felt that the world was against him.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogan: I thought only members of Congress felt that way.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutor Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.: That's where you  
start talking about the story that the president told you. Knowing 
what you know now, do you believe the president lied to you about 
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I do.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: Now, you've stated, I think, very honestly, and I  
appreciate, that you were lied to by the president. Is it a fair 
statement, given your previous testimony concerning your 30-minute 
conversation, that the president was trying to portray himself as a 
victim of a relationship with Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I think that's the import of his whole story.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: What type reaction did the White House have when this --  
as you recall -- when this article came to light? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I -- I think the White House was overwhelmed with  
press inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: Was there a sense of alarm that this was a bad story?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Graham: And wasn't there a sense of reassurance by the president  
himself that this was an untrue story? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: The president did make a public statement that  
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: And I believe White House officials on his behalf denied  
the essence of this story; is that correct? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Graham: And basically, you were passing along what somebody you  
trust and admire told you to be the case, and from the White House 
point of view, that was the response to this story, that we deny 
these allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: And this is after the president recants his story --  
recounts his story -- to you, where he's visibly upset, feels like 
he's a victim, that he associates himself with a character who's 
being lied about, and you at no time suggested to your colleagues 
that there is something going on here with the president and Ms. 
Lewinsky you need to know about. Is that your testimony? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I never mentioned my conversation. I regarded that  
conversation as a private conversation in confidence, and I didn't 
mention it to my colleagues, I didn't mention it to my friends, I 
didn't mention it to my family, besides my wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: Did you mention it to any White House lawyers?  
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: I mentioned it many months later to Lanny Breuer in  
preparation for one of my grand jury appearances, when I knew I 
would be questioned about it. And I certainly never mentioned it to 
any reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: Do you know how, over a period of weeks, stories about  
Ms. Lewinsky being called a stalker, a fantasizer, obsessed with 
the president, called the name `Elvira'-- do you know how that got 
into the press? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: Which -- which -- which question are you asking me?  
Which part of that? 
</P>
<P>
	Graham: Okay. Do you have any idea how White House sources are  
associated with statements such as 'She's known as Elvira,' 'She's 
obsessed with the president,' 'She's known as a flirt,' 'She's the 
product of a troubled home, divorced parents,' 'She's known as 'The 
Stalker''? Do you have any idea how that got in the press? 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal: ... I have no idea how anything came to be  
attributed to a White House source.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Track Internet Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department said today it will  
begin tracking sales on the Internet, which it called ``a major 
indicator of the nation's economic health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even as the government touted figures showing that consumers  
spent $9 billion last year on the Internet, it warned that growth 
of electronic commerce will wane unless shoppers trust that 
personal information will be kept private. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't want people selling information about which books I  
buy, or what records I buy,'' said Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the 
Federal Trade Commission. ``The Internet is probably going to grow, 
anyway. It's just not going to grow as fast until these concerns 
are addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers have to feel as comfortable doing business in  
cyberspace as they do on Main Street,'' added Commerce Secretary 
William Daley. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said his agency will begin tracking separately sales over  
the Internet, which currently are included within government 
figures for catalog sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said complete figures for last year and this year won't  
be available until the summer of 2000 -- a virtual eternity in what 
the industry sometimes calls ``Internet time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a joint news conference today, Daley and Pitofsky lauded the  
online industry for improving the protection of consumer privacy on 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But they said the Clinton administration wants continued  
efforts, and added that new federal privacy legislation could be 
passed to mandate such privacy protections. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has taken some strong prodding,'' Daley said. ``This year,  
I want to see more progress, especially among smaller companies. 
... To be frank with you, the laws should not be the last line of 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to look to industry to take the lead in  
self-regulation,'' Pitofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has criticized the online industry for its failure to  
protect privacy rights, and the agency successfully pressed last 
year for a new law that prohibits Web sites from collecting 
personal information from children without parental permission.

<HEADLINE> Witnesses Testify for Mike Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- The hearing has had all the buildup of one  
of Mike Tyson's title fights, including some verbal sparring from 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision in a suburban Maryland courtroom, however, means  
more than any delivered at ringside. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion's freedom and future in boxing  
were at stake today with his sentencing on two counts of 
second-degree assault stemming from an altercation following a 
minor traffic accident in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Stephen Johnson presided at today's hearing, which  
featured character witnesses testifying for Tyson, with sentencing 
to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's decision will help determine whether Tyson will have  
to return to jail in Indiana for violating probation for a 1991 
rape conviction. It also could lead boxing authorities to strip 
Tyson of his license for the second time in less than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, 32, kicked one motorist and punched another after the  
accident in the Washington suburb of Gaithersburg, Md., on Aug. 31. 
The two victims, Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick, settled out 
of court, and their lawyers say both men are ready to tell the 
judge that Tyson should not go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, if it were anyone but Mike, it wouldn't be an  
issue,'' said Tyson's boxing adviser, Shelley Finkel. ``It's a 
shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's lawyers will ask for probation.  
</P>
<P>
	In a memo this week to the judge, they argued Tyson would become  
a ``useful and contributing member of the community'' if he were 
spared more jail time, received more psychiatric help and continued 
to perform volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor, Montgomery County State's Attorney Douglas  
Gansler, wants Tyson behind bars, but is hampered by a plea 
agreement negotiated by his predecessor, Robert Dean. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Tyson pleaded no-contest -- meaning he neither  
protests the charges nor admits guilt. In return, Dean promised the 
state would not seek a jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an agreement that I would have reached,'' said  
Gansler, who defeated Dean in the Democratic primary. Dean then 
endorsed Gansler's Republican opponent, Thomas O'Malley, in the 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he cannot ask for jail in the courtroom, Gansler has done  
so in public. Paul Kemp, one of Tyson's lawyers, said Gansler's 
remarks broke the plea agreement and were a ``violation of the 
rules of professional conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The memo from Tyson's lawyers said the fighter was not taking  
his antidepressant drug, Zoloft, at the time of the accident and 
that ``everything in his life and career were in chaos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers also noted that Saucedo's only injury was a cut lip,  
even though the 62-year-old man was struck by one of the strongest 
men in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mr. Tyson had intentionally struck Mr. Saucedo, one need  
only look at the crumpling of Francois Botha as a result of the 
single punch from Mr. Tyson to envision the result,'' the lawyers 
said, referring to Tyson's fifth-round knockout of Botha last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler's memo to the judge called Tyson ``nothing less than a  
time bomb.'' Gansler detailed Tyson's 1991 rape conviction in 
Indiana, seven brushes with the law as a juvenile, and the infamous 
fight in which Tyson bit off part of Evander Holyfield's ear in 
June 1997. Tyson subsequently had his boxing license revoked for a 
year.

<HEADLINE> Protect Savings When Leaving a Job / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Millions of workers will leave their jobs this  
year through career moves, layoffs or retirement, and many of them 
will face an important decision about what to do with their 
retirement nest eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Should those savings fly the coop, too?  
</P>
<P>
	Several options are available for those participating in  
employer-sponsored retirement plans like the 401(k): They can stay 
invested with their former employer; transfer to a new employer's 
plan; roll it over into an Individual Retirement Account; or take a 
lump sum. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people aren't aware of these options and their tax  
consequences, so the most common move has been to take the money 
and run, which can be a costly strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released in 1997 by the Employee Benefits Research  
Institute found that 60 percent of job changers took cash payments 
from their tax-deferred 401(k)s. Only 7 percent rolled the payouts 
into another plan; 33 percent into an IRA. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people just take the cash and spend it not realizing  
the tax ramifications of it,'' said Ed Slott, a Rockville Centre, 
N.Y., accountant who publishes a monthly retirement benefits 
newsletter. ``They're probably only going to keep 60 percent of it 
(after taxes), but they're spending 100 percent of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lump sum distributions are subject to at least a 20 percent  
withholding for federal taxes, plus those younger than 59 1/2, may owe 
an additional 10 percent penalty tax for early withdrawal. 
Rollovers, on the other hand, are tax free as long as the money is 
transferred to a tax-deferred account like another 401(k) or IRA. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other tax traps to watch out for.  
</P>
<P>
	Those who opt to roll over their retirement savings into an IRA  
must keep a watchful eye on the calendar. Individuals with 401(k) 
withdrawal in hand have 60 days to deposit the entire check into 
another qualified tax-sheltered account or face tax penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	And those planning to temporarily park their funds in an IRA  
before transferring them into a new 401(k) must be careful how they 
handle this transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be a brand new IRA, not an existing IRA ... or it  
can't be done,'' Slott said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that individuals can't make additional contributions to  
this conduit account because it will be considered ``tainted,'' and 
therefore, can't be transferred to a new 401(k). 
</P>
<P>
	Also, those who want to roll their 401(k) money into a new  
tax-free Roth IRA must first transfer their funds into a new 
traditional IRA, then convert some or all of it to the Roth. 
They'll have to pay an upfront conversion tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert B. Wolfe, a financial adviser from Wilmington, Del.,  
urges individuals to contact the benefits departments of both their 
old and new companies before making any decisions since each 
employer's policy may differ. 
</P>
<P>
	Some employers will let former employees remain in their plan,  
while others won't; some employers require new employees to work 
for a certain length of time before participating in their 401(k), 
while other's don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (former) company may give you between 60 days and up to  
one year after you leave to reinvest ... . If you choose not to 
reinvest, you may have to wait until you are 65 years old to get 
access to your retirement money,'' Wolfe noted in his January 
investor newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other companies let you obtain your distribution at any time  
once you terminate employment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The advantage of staying put in a former employer's plan is that  
taxes and penalties are avoided while earnings continue to grow 
tax-deferred. But investment options may be limited, especially 
when compared with those available in an IRA. 
</P>
<P>
	Slott advises against sticking with a former employer's 401(k).  
</P>
<P>
	``I find that ex-employers are not that concerned about  
ex-employees,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Plunge / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell for the fifth straight day today  
on continued worries about rising Japanese interest rates and the 
dollar's weakness against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 188.77 points,  
or 1.34 percent, ending the day at 13,898.08. On Thursday, the 
average closed down 74.46 points, or 0.53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 112.06 yen at late afternoon, down 1.72 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 112.21 yen overnight. During the day, it ranged from 111.31 yen 
to 112.34 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market will continue to monitor movements of interest  
rates and the dollar-yen rate,'' said Shoji Hirakawa, a strategist 
at Kokusai Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in yields has pushed the dollar lower. Higher yields  
have weighed on stocks as it increases corporate borrowing costs, 
while the stronger yen hurts the earnings of exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 2.360 percent from Thursday's finish of 2.190 percent, 
driving its price down to 95.79 yen from 96.97 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on Japanese government bonds have risen recently on  
nervousness over the government's plans to finance its economic 
stimulus steps by boosting the bond supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar in the afternoon was largely stuck between supportive  
remarks from senior Japanese financial officials and strong selling 
by Japanese exporters and foreign funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the United States and  
Japan agree on currency policy and the U.S. stance on currencies 
hasn't changed. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.88 yen, down  
from 128.52 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices were also weighed on by the  
overnight fall on Wall Street, which prompted Japanese 
institutional investors to sell in the futures market, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,304.50  
points, down 62.31. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 6.13 points, or 0.56 percent, to 1,084.64. The 
TOPIX closed down 6.38 points, or 0.58 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors were avoiding major moves ahead of the release  
later today of U.S. unemployment data for January. 
</P>
<P>
	Export-oriented blue chips were mostly lower this session on the  
dollar's weakness and the fall on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 366 million shares,  
up from 337.58 million shares Thursday. Declining issues 
overwhelmed advancers 766 to 341, with 182 issues unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Glickman: Y2K Won't Hurt Food Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans who go grocery shopping at the start  
of the new year aren't likely to find any food shortages due to the 
Year 2000 computer problem, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basic foods Americans expect to be in their grocery stores  
will be there,'' Glickman told a Senate panel. ``An interruption in 
the food supply so severe as to threaten the well-being and basic 
comfort of the American public is highly unlikely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman further warned that consumers doing ``needless and  
frivolous stockpiling of supplies can create isolated shortages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department is working with the Federal Emergency  
Management Agency on a contingency plan should an emergency arise 
at the start of the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to do whatever we can to prevent disruption,''  
Glickman said. He said because fewer than 3 percent of U.S. farmers 
use automated systems for feeding, ventilation, heating or cooling 
animals, producers here are less susceptible to problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, one farm leader says disruption is very possible in a  
food network that is so interconnected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are dependent on so many people,'' said Ken Evans,  
president of the Arizona Farm Bureau. ``I've got to have the entire 
infrastructure from me until it gets to say, an inner city wife in 
Philadelphia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, farmers are especially dependent on  
telecommunications to do everything from ordering supplies to 
scheduling shipments, Evans said. ``We are particularly vulnerable 
because of our remoteness and the lack of technical support in many 
rural communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government established a Food Supply Working Group to ensure  
the food system runs smoothly on Jan. 1. Friday's hearing was part 
of a series by the Senate Committee on the Year 2000 Technology 
Problem, led by Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers originally programmed to recognize only the last  
two digits of a year will not work properly beginning Jan. 1, 2000, 
when machines will assume it is 1900. The government has estimated 
its cost to fix the problem at $6.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman and other agency officials said the entire Agriculture  
system may not be ready for a government readiness check in March 
but promised the kinks would be resolved soon. 
</P>
<P>
	One area of concern is the readiness of U.S. trade partners. The  
United States imports about 40 percent of its fruit, mostly 
bananas, and 60 percent of its seafood. 
</P>
<P>
	Some countries, like Japan, have had a hard time preparing a new  
computer system because of the large number of small stores 
involved in the country's food supply system, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials also stressed that the nation's food system is  
extremely reliant on the readiness of other areas such as 
transportation and utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smaller companies, such as independent truck owners ... are  
further behind in addressing the Year 2000 problem,'' Glickman 
said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Northwestern RB Admits Fumble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Former Northwestern running back Dennis Lundy  
admitted Friday that he intentionally fumbled near the goal line in 
a 1994 game to protect a bet he made against his team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy also acknowledged he lied to a federal grand jury  
investigating gambling at Northwestern when he denied he had bet on 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy pleaded guilty to one count of perjury in a U.S. District  
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted fumbling on purpose during the 1994 game against  
Iowa so his team would not cover the point spread and he would win 
a $400 bet. He also said he bet on Northwestern games against Ohio 
State and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	A teammate had accused Lundy of intentionally fumbling against  
Iowa to protect a bet. An assistant coach overheard the accusation 
and the school launched an investigation, which was quickly turned 
over to federal authorities and led to the indictments of Lundy and 
three other former players. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal sentencing guidelines, Lundy would be sentenced to  
six months to a year in prison, but prosecutors will recommend less 
time as part of their plea agreement with him, Assistant U.S. 
Attorney Mark Vogel said. Sentencing is scheduled for May 5 before 
U.S. District Judge David H. Coar. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy must cooperate with authorities and speak to college  
athletes about the perils of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy was indicted Dec. 3 on perjury charges along with former  
players Christopher Gamble, Michael Senters and Gregory Gill. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamble pleaded guilty last month to lying to the grand jury. The  
others have pleaded innocent.

<HEADLINE> Auburn Buys Out of FSU Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn chose to pay Florida State  
$500,000 rather than face the team coached by the father of ousted 
Auburn coach Terry Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn athletic director David Housel said Friday he knows it  
will be a controversial decision, but now that Terry Bowden is no 
longer Auburn's coach, playing against Bobby Bowden's Seminoles 
didn't seem so appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will catch a lot of heat and criticism the next few  
weeks,'' Housel said. ``Some of it fair, some of it unfair, but 
after that we can get on with our football program. This was an 
institutional decision, not just an athletic decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just two days ago, Bobby Bowden said the game would be played.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't believe the red tape we had to go through to get  
this game,'' he said. ``We went through a lot of extremes, changing 
our schedule and going through the conference to get this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State athletic director David Hart said Friday he had  
received no formal notice of Auburn's decision. He said a voice 
mail message was left on his home answering machine Friday night 
that said Housel ``was instructed to send me a fax informing me of 
this decision. And if he did, it was sometime after 5:20 p.m. 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said he would not comment until he received proper  
notification and had spoken with the conference commissioner, 
television partners, and others affected by the action. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn's Sept. 2 season opener against Florida State was  
scheduled to be televised on ESPN. Under the contract, Auburn could 
buy out the game by paying $500,000 to Florida State. Housel said 
Auburn could recoup the payment by scheduling a seventh home game 
at Jordan-Hare Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we played the game as scheduled, the controversy  
surrounding the game and the turmoil of last season would be 
rehashed again and again and again over the next eight months,'' 
Housel said. ``The controversy would become bigger than the game, 
and that would be unfair to the players and coaches on both 
sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to back out of the game doesn't necessarily mean  
the schools will never face off again, Housel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to keep the contract with Florida State intact,  
just move it back a few years so that the personal controversies 
can die down a bit, but that will be Florida State's call,'' he 
said. ``This is not about Florida State. It is about the turmoil 
and controversy that would surround this year's game, and this 
year's game only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Bowden, who won his first 20 games after taking the reins  
at Auburn in 1993, resigned after the Tigers started the season 
with a 1-5 record. He has said that he was ``fired,'' but Housel 
and other university officials have said he was not forced to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn reached a financial settlement with Terry Bowden on  
Monday, which bans the former Tigers coach and his wife from 
criticizing the school.

<HEADLINE> Unmapped Calif. Quake Fault Is Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALY CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Bad news for folks living just south of  
San Francisco: A geologist has discovered a new earthquake fault in 
the seaside cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The fault, though unknown until recently, has been around for a  
long time. It's not clear if it is active or not, geologist Scott 
Kieffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kieffer was mapping the Mussel Rock area of Daly City last fall  
when he roped down the side of a cliff to examine layers of 
sedimentary rock and found clear evidence of a quake across a 
previously unmapped fault. 
</P>
<P>
	He dated the sedimentary layer around the rupture to 120,000  
years ago, which means the state Division of Mines and Geology 
would classify it as inactive. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fault would be considered active if it has generated a  
quake as recently as 11,000 years ago, and would require urgent 
work to survey its seismic danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major fault trace, no question about it,'' said  
Nicholas Sitar, a University of California, Berkeley, engineer who 
has examined Kieffer's evidence.

<HEADLINE> Suspicious Death at Denver Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- State officials are investigating the death of a  
hospital patient who apparently was given an overdose of morphine 
after knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Catherine Heidenreich, 78, died Wednesday morning after  
having her knee replaced Jan. 29 at Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidenreich apparently was given 10 milligrams of morphine  
injected intravenously, instead of into the muscle as ordered, said 
Bruce Douglas, director of the Colorado Department of Regulatory 
Agencies, which is investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Morphine administered intravenously can suppress breathing, and  
10 milligrams would be considered a lethal dose, medical experts 
say. If given intravenously, it usually is given in doses of about 
2 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death has not been announced, pending lab results,  
said Mel Apodaca, chief investigator in the Denver coroner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Presbyterian-St. Luke's spokeswoman Sarah Spaulding said the  
hospital believes something else happened to Heidenreich but did 
not offer specifics. She said a nurse had been suspended and that 
the hospital was investigating.
