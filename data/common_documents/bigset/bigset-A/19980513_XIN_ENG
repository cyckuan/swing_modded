<HEADLINE> Roundup: Counting of Votes Slow in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The counting of votes for the
Philippine national and local elections had been slow due to the
introduction of a new electoral system in Monday's polls and the
handling of complaints about cheating, a private watchdog
organization said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The watchdog, the National Citizens' Movement for Free
Elections (Namfrel), is the sole non-governmental organization
authorized by the Commission on Elections to conduct a quick count
of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Namfrel Secretary General Guillermo Luz said at a press
conference that the organization had decided to temporarily shelve
the tabulation for the party list system.
</P>
<P>
The party list system was introduced in Monday's elections to
enable small political parties and marginalized and
under-represented sectors to obtain possible representation in the
House of Representatives, which was traditionally dominated by big
political parties.
</P>
<P>
In the polls, 52 members of the House of Representatives were
being chosen under the party list system while the rest by
district.
</P>
<P>
Luz explained that Namfrel was not dropping the party list
system, but just setting it aside because it caused confusion and
delay in the counting of the ballots at the precinct level where
some voters voted for the sector without indicating the party's
name while others only wrote the abbreviation of the party.
</P>
<P>
"In areas where there was slowing-down in count we anticipate
it could be caused by the party list," he said. "But we are not
dropping the party list."
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the delay in counting was that some ruling
party candidates filed petitions claiming there was cheating in
the elections. They asked the Commission on Elections to stop
counting the ballots at some precincts.
</P>
<P>
Namfrel, warning that a halt to the counting would affect the
tabulation at the national level, urged the Commission on
Elections to immediately handle the petitions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Luz said, the failure of some election inspectors to
give a copy of the election returns to Namfrel volunteers also
contributed to the delay.
</P>
<P>
Namfrel had counted votes cast at only 9.26 percent of the
174,000 precincts across the country. It said it would release the
final result within 10 days after the voting day.
</P>
<P>
The counting conducted by employees and workers of the
Commission on Elections was also slow. As of Wednesday, the poll
body had not yet released any official figures.
</P>
<P>
After the counting of votes at the precinct level, the election
returns would be transferred to the municipal or city level where
the total votes of the returns will be recorded and tabulated on
the certificate of canvass.
</P>
<P>
Then the certificate would be sent to the provincial level
which would then give the forms to the House of Representatives
for the counting of presidential and vice presidential positions
while the Commission on Elections will count the votes for the
senatorial and party list positions.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the official result of the elections would not be
known for about four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing President Fidel Ramos has already expressed disgust
over the slowness of the canvassing of votes three days after the
elections ended.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the 34 million registered voters went to
the polls on Monday to elect a new president, a new vice
president, 12 out of 24 senators, all the 260 members of the House
of Representatives and more than 17,000 local officials and
councilors.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest unofficial figures released by Namfrel,
Vice President Joseph Estrada of the opposition Laban ng
Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses)
continued to take a commanding lead with 884,106 votes.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Jose de Venecia, Ramos' anointed candidate of the
ruling Lakas-NUCD party, was ranked third with 320,008 votes.
</P>
<P>
In the vice presidential race, senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo
of the ruling party further consolidated her lead with 932,933
votes, far ahead of the other eight candidates.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramos said it was too early to say Estrada had won the
presidency as only a small portion of the votes had been counted.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a little premature to be looking sad as you are
speculating about some happenings which may be clarified in the
next three of four days," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What have not been reported are the bailiwicks (overwhelming
victory) of the Lakas. For instance, Pangasinan is not yet in, "
he said, indicating that De Venecia had won overwhelmingly in his
home province.

<HEADLINE> EU Examines National Employment Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The European employment
commissioner Wednesday described as real progress the national job
creation action plans (NAPs) by individual European Union member
states.
</P>
<P>
Padraig Flynn made the remark after the European Commission
completed its examination of the NAPs.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that all 15 member states, in spite of the very tight
time frame of only four months, have prepared, adopted and
delivered their NAPs by the end of April 1998, constitutes in
itself a major political achievement," the commissioner told a
European Parliament hearing at Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
The NAPs set out measures for implementing the 1998 employment
guidelines adopted last December by the European council, at
heads of state and government level in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Flynn rated all the NAPs as very serious and well-done, but set
aside Spain's and France's as highly presentable and with
transparency.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, examined what the member states have committed themselves
to doing, and assessed whether they are in line with the
objectives of the 1998 employment guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The commission's assessment of the NAPs will serve as the basis
for a discussion scheduled for the next European summit at
Cardiff, Britain.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kazakhstan Foreign Ministry
issued a statement on Wednesday to express its deep concern about
the underground nuclear tests in India.
</P>
<P>
India's action was against the principles of the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,
the statement said. The tests did great harm to the nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation processes in the world.
</P>
<P>
The statement also stressed that India's tests aggravated
tensions in that region.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakhstan government proposed that India give up the
nuclear option to maintain world peace and stability and promote
international cooperation and development.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Tajikistan government also issued a
statement to express its concern over India's nuclear
tests.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Mayor Pledges to Stem Anti-Arab Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) - Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert on
Wednesday promised to take measures to stop the surging anti-Arab
violence in the city.
</P>
<P>
Olmert made the promise following a stabbing incident Wednesday
morning in the city's Ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim,
in which an Arab man was stabbed to death by a suspected Jewish
extremist, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday stabbing was the sixth attack on Arabs in the
same area over the past six months, though it was the first fatal
one.
</P>
<P>
The victim, reportedly a Bedouin Arab man in his 50s, was
walking through Mea Shearim at dawn, apparently on his way to
work, when he was stabbed several times, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the area and detained one man, who was later
freed due to want of proof.
</P>
<P>
Police believed that an assailant, who obviously avenged
attacks by Arabs on Jews, was responsible for all six attacks.
</P>
<P>
Olmert said he viewed with "grave concern" the violence against
the Arabs and vowed to take measures to protect the Arab residents
just as he did for the Jewish ones.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Communist Hadash Party said the Wednesday attack was
"further proof of the deeply planted anti-Arab sentiment" among
Jews.
</P>
<P>
It strongly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu for fostering the atmosphere that led to the violence
by failing to condemn such attacks.
</P>
<P>
There has been a surge of terrorist attacks by both Jewish and
Arab extremists in Jerusalem at a time when the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are deeply stranded.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai To Reinforce Taiwan Investors Protection Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Starting today, the Standing
Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress began to
examine the enforcement of the Law on the Protection of
Investments of Taiwan Compatriots.
</P>
<P>
This was to further improve Shanghai's soft environment for
attracting overseas funds and push the development of both
Shanghai and Taiwan, according to Chen Tiedi, Chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is the largest industrial city in China. Up to March,
the city had approved more than 3,100 Taiwan-funded projects with
more than 3.4 billion U.S. dollars worth of signed contracts,
accounting for 11.4 percent of the total overseas funds in the
city.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, since the Law on the Protection of
Investments of Taiwan Compatriots was issued four years ago by the
National People's Congress, Shanghai has formulated a series of
corresponding codes and regulations to better enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
She said the examination will last half a month and investors
from Taiwan are welcome to make complaints and offer suggestions.

<HEADLINE> India Claims it Can Withstand Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- India, defying strong criticism
worldwide over its nuclear tests, says it "will be able to bear"
any possible international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Indian Vice-President Krishna Kant told a press conference
Wednesday, at the end of the Group-15 summit here, that India, "as
a united country", carried out the tests after "a great deal of
deliberation."
</P>
<P>
India set off three nuclear devices on Monday and also tested a
short-range Trident missile, capable of hitting targets up to 350
kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
The tests, the first since 1974, have sparked worldwide
concerns and strong protests in the international community with
some countries threatening economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Japan, India's largest aid donor since 1986, decided to suspend
new grants-in-aid to the South Asia nation, and the United States
is considering economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Kant said: "India has not violated any international treaty or
agreement signed by us up to now." He said: "India remains
committed to the process of nuclear disarmament, leading to total
global disarmament."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his country would be prepared to consider
adhering to some of the undertakings in the comprehensive test ban
treaty. But obviously, this could not be done in a vacuum...and
would depend on a number of reciprocal activities."

<HEADLINE> Mainland Scholars Complete Study of Common Law in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A reception was held Wednesday to
bid farewell to 10 law scholars and officials from China's
mainland who have completed their nine-month study in common law
at the University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Li, chief justice of the Court of Final Appeal of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, presented souvenirs to
each of the 10 scholars at the reception held Wednesday evening in
the old Bank of China Building.
</P>
<P>
They were recruited from renowned universities and government
institutions, including the Legislative Affairs Commission of the
National People's Congress, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office
of the State Council, the Center for the Training of Senior Judges
of the Supreme People's Court, and the Chinese University of
Political Science and Law.
</P>
<P>
Their study in Hong Kong was made possible under a scholarship
scheme for Chinese scholars in the interior areas to study common
law at the University of Hong Kong in the Postgraduate Diploma in
Common Law, which was launched last September.
</P>
<P>
The program, which aims at facilitating academic exchange
between scholars of law in Hong Kong and the mainland, enables law
teachers and lawyers from China's mainland to study the common law
of the Anglo-American world.
</P>
<P>
At the reception, Chen Yu Tian from the Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs Office said that through the nine-month study in Hong
Kong, he has had a general idea about Hong Kong's legal system.
</P>
<P>
"I have been deeply impressed by Hong Kong's rule of law and
have a better understanding of the community of Hong Kong," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Basic Law, after Hong Kong returned to China on July
1, 1997, the judicial system previously practiced in Hong Kong
shall be maintained except for those changes consequent upon the
establishment of the Court of Final Appeal of the HKSAR.

<HEADLINE> China's Stock Market Develops Despite Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China's stock market has been
affected little by the Asian financial crisis and is continuing
its steady growth momentum, a senior securities industry official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese stock market has been growing stably since the
start of this year, with the major indices on a steady rise both
in Shanghai and Shenzhen," said Chen Yaoxian, vice-chairman of the
China Securities Regulatory Commission, at an investment forum
sponsored by Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the amount of funds raised by Chinese
companies through share issues soared more than 30 percent in the
first four months of this year compared with the same period last
year. He did not give the specific figure.
</P>
<P>
Chen attributed the steady development of the Chinese stock
market amid the Asian financial crisis mainly to the country's
successful economic "soft landing" and stern market supervision.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that China's stock market has developed
rapidly since it was founded more than seven years ago. By early
this week more than 800 Chinese companies had been listed at home
stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen as well as Hong Kong, New
York and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese investors have opened more than 34 million
stock trading accounts.
</P>
<P>
Chen said at today's forum that China's stock market
capitalization had exceeded two trillion yuan (240 million
U.S. dollars) by the end April, up 18.7 percent since the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
As more companies get listed and more investors buy stocks, the
stock market is gaining a role in China's national economy,
observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that the securities market has raised more
than 250 billion yuan for the nation's enterprises. The funds have
not only helped to ease the financial difficulties of state-owned
enterprises but also boosted their corporate transformation.
</P>
<P>
As time passes, Chinese stock investors have also grown more
rational, basing their trading decisions increasingly on
macro-economic performance and company efficiency.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Revenues from Canadian firms selling
advertizing space on the Internet reached almost 10 million
Canadian dollars (seven million U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
A year earlier, online ad revenue in Canada was only 1.6
million dollars, according to figures from the Internet
Advertising Bureau of Canada, an organization of marketing
professionals formed at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The bureau predicted revenue could more than double to 22.9
million dollars this year and 56.9 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
It found that financial services led the way, generating 2.1
million dollars in ad's revenue. That is in line with growth in
areas such as PC banking and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
Ted Boyd, vice chairman of the bureau, said the research
results will help identify emerging trends and growth areas in the
industry that were not measurable before.

<HEADLINE> G-15 Raps Intervention, Urges Cooperation, Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Group of 15 (G-15)
Wednesday denounced foreign intervention in their domestic affairs
and called for cementing internal solidarity in the southern
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, appearing with presidents,
vice-presidents and ministers of other 15 developing countries at
a joint press conference, strongly criticized any kind of foreign
interference on the pretext of protecting human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Intervention in internal affair is something we cannot
condone...not any country can accept it," he said, adding that the
governments of many developing countries have reiterated this
stance over and over.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in people's rights to education, work, freedom,
democracy, but not the pretension of some NGOs (non-government
organizations" which always try to point an accusing finger at
developing countries, Mubarak added.
</P>
<P>
He was obviously in response to charges of alleged human rights
abuses in Egypt and other developing countries. The United States
has threatened to impose sanctions on a number of countries on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told the press conference held at the end of the
three-day G-15 summit here that the summit was held at a "delicate
juncture of international relations," coupled with the the
repercussions of Southeast Asian financial crisis and prospects
for greater global integration.
</P>
<P>
As the current chairman of G-15, he said the summit at its
final session and the joint communique stressed the need to
consolidate cooperation among its member states in particular and
the developing countries in general.
</P>
<P>
"It is still important to promote south-south cooperation in a
bid to ease the sufferings and develop the national economies of
developing states," he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to reach a common understanding for realizing justice
and equality, the summit also urged for intensifying dialog
between the North and the South to the benefits of both, Mubarak
said.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Vice President Marco Maciel said his country believes
in a constructive South-North dialog, but South-South cooperation
is "of utmost importance."
</P>
<P>
He said that cooperation and coordination among Latin-American
countries have been successful and they will expand to other
continents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysia Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad recommended
continued cooperation on both tracks.
</P>
<P>
"We should continue our interest and our relation with the
North, because they have the market and the money, know-how,
technology and set-up. At the same time we realized North has
always been interested in investing and using the market of the
South," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mahathir noted that it is equally important the South
make use of their own markets in order to develop their
economies. "This is why G-15 was born and concentrates on
South-South cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said trade and economic kinship between Malaysia and its
southern partners has seen tremendous increases, for example, with
a 300 percent rise in trade volume with Latin American.
</P>
<P>
South-South cooperation, South-North dialog and Asian financial
crisis have topped the topics of the G-15 summit which brought
together leaders of the 16 member states to Egypt on May 11-13.
</P>
<P>
The G-15, founded in 1989, is actually a G-15 plus one after
Kenya became the 16th member in 1997, joining Algeria, Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico,
Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Cable TV has been quickly expanding
to become one of the three major electronic information sources in
China, with the total number of users approaching 60 million.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the '98 China CATV Show that opened
here today, cable TV networks cover all the Chinese cities in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Coastal cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou have also
developed two-way CATV networks.
</P>
<P>
An officer from the United States' Scientific Atlanta (SA) said
that China's CATV network has gone neck-and-neck with its western
counterparts in terms of technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
SA is competing with other CATV manufacturers such as General
Instrument and Phillips for the lion's share of the China market,
which is being propelled by the strong interest of users,
advertising companies, enterprises and local governments.
</P>
<P>
The annual China CATV Show is the biggest of its kind in
Asia. This year's show has attracted more than 300 Chinese and
overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
An officer of the sponsor -- China International Enterprise
Cooperative Corp. -- said that many telecommunications companies
jumped into the CATV arena for the first time this year. Such
companies as GPT of Britain, Nokia of Finland and Alcatel are
strutting their stuff at the show.
</P>
<P>
A government official said that China will devote more
resources to the development of CATV network in the next eight
years. It will greatly expand the scale of the country's CATV
network as a trunk line of a national information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's CATV network has a transmitting speed of
750 megabytes per second.

<HEADLINE> Discussion over Cattle Shipment to DPRK Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Inter-Korea discussion over the
delivery of 1,000 South Korean cattle to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) is well underway, a South Korean
government source said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations came after the South Korean business tycoon,
Chung Ju-yung, founder and honorary chairman of Hyundai Business
Group, last week promised a donation of 1,000 oxes to the DPRK
through the truce village of Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
The plan to donate cattle is unprecedented in South Korea's
food aid program for the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The discussion focuses on how to prevent foot-and-mouth
disease, which is reportedly prevalent in the DPRK, from spreading
to South Korea after cattle delivery over land.
</P>
<P>
Kim Young-jin, representative of the ruling National Congress
for New Politics, warned parliament Tuesday that
cattle-transporting trucks returning from the North could bring
back the disease.
</P>
<P>
Foot-and-mouth disease is a contagious, viral disease of cattle
and other hoofed animals, characterized by blisters in the mouth
and about the hoofs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> India's Actions Not to Go Unanswered: Pakistan FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan said Wednesday that India's nuclear tests "pose an
immediate and grave threat to Pakistan's security and will not go
unanswered."
</P>
<P>
The news India conducted two more nuclear tests Wednesday
provides further confirmation "about India's consistent pattern of
irresponsible behavior," Gohar said in a statement to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
"The blind pursuit of intrinsic and inherent hegemonic
impulses, reflected so often in Indian behavior and ignored
largely by the international community, despite Pakistan's
repeated efforts to draw attention to them, has definitely
encouraged and emboldened India to throw all caution to the
winds," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the invoking of mandatory sanctions under the U.S.
Laws against India "hardly constitutes an effective response to
Indian provocative actions or compensates for errors of judgment,
which have seriously disrupted the regional strategic balance."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan once again reiterates that responsibility for
consequences that will inevitably ensue would lie squarely with
India and those who have colluded and acquiesced in the
weaponization of India's nuclear program," he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada, US Moving Towards a Wheat War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States could
be moving towards another wheat war if the U.S. again subsidizes
its grain exports.
</P>
<P>
In an unusual move, three Canadian ministers warned the U.S.
Tuesday that there could be a huge fallout from plans by the
United States to bring back its export enhancement program,
according to the Financial Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Ralph Goodale, minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat
Board, said if the U.S. used the program to subsidize exports,
U.S. domestic grain prices would soar artificially.
</P>
<P>
"That will undoubtedly create greater commercial pressure for
Canadian grain to flow south," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It's "not because of anything Canada has done, but as a direct
consequences of a market distortion created by the United States,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration said this week it is reviving the
program to target specific farm exports that are being shut out
of foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
Any step by the U.S. to reintroduce the program with wheat
"would have a negative impact on our countries' shared goal of
moving towards the complete elimination of trade subsidies,"
Canadian Trade Minister Sergio Marchi warned.
</P>
<P>
It was the U.S. administration's use of the export enhancement
program in 1994 that led to a brief wheat war between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Monetary Policy Adopted by Central Bank to Stimulate Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC),
the central bank, has implemented a series of monetary and credit
measures to stimulate the domestic market and encourage commercial
banks to enhance money and credit supply.
</P>
<P>
The central bank hopes the package will help China attain its
goal of achieving a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 8
percent while holding inflation to 3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Before the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday in late January, the
central bank added 78 billion yuan in discount loans to wholly
state-owned commercial banks to help them deal with the peak for
spending during the holiday.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 1, the PBOC relaxed controls on the limit for
commercial bank loans, and issued a credit-guiding plan for
state-owned banks in 1998, achieving the transition from direct
control to indirect adjustment of the total amount of money and
credit.
</P>
<P>
On March 21, the PBOC reformed its system of reserve funds for
deposits by restoring the fund's payment and clearance function.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, it lowered interest rates for reserve funds
for deposits and for discounts loans.
</P>
<P>
Four days later, the PBOC lowered the interest rates for
deposits by an average of 0.16 percent and those for loans by an
average of 0.6 percent. The falling rates resulted in a reduction
of more than 30 billion yuan in interest payments for enterprises,
which came as a great relief for China's debt-ridden state-owned
industries.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has also enhanced analysis and monitoring of
the economic and financial situations to increase its guidance on
the commercial banks, declaring that it will grant discount loans
to commercial banks only if there are fund shortages for
commercial loans.

</P>
<P>
The forum was attended by more than 200 fund managers

from the state sector.
</P>
<P>
"China has risen into one of the hottest investment
destinations in the world, and the forum is aimed at bridging the
gap between the international investors and Chinese enterprises by
enhancing the investors' understanding of the nation," said Gary
Coull, chairman and chief executive officer with Credit Lyonnais
Securities Ltd. (CLSA), sponsor of the forum.
</P>
<P>
The participating fund managers handle more than four trillion
U.S. dollars in financial assets, almost four times the Gross

make investments globally but have a particular interest in China
and want to commit more funds to the nation.

<HEADLINE> Rumor of Police-Peddler Conflict Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman with the city
government of Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan
Province, today denied a widely spread rumor of police-peddler
conflict.
</P>
<P>
A recent rumor said that late last month 3,000 street peddlers
clashed with 800 local police and that some people were injured or
killed.
</P>
<P>
The rumor was cited as first being announced by a New
York-based human rights organization through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, "there was no conflict at all,
and not any deaths or injuries."
</P>
<P>
He said the police were just doing their job persuading some
peddlers to move into a new shopping building in accordance with
the city planning program, and most of the street peddlers showed
their understanding for the city government's decision.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the reason for moving the peddlers to a new
building was that the original area was being demolished and
rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
"So far, all the street peddlers have moved into the new
building and the demolition and rebuilding work has been started,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> SKorean President Warns Against Violent Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
on Wednesday urged labor unions which are preparing for mass
rallies this weekend to cancel these plans, or to act unharmfully.
</P>
<P>
The president warned that foreign investors will never return
if the rallies become violent again.
</P>
<P>
Kim directed the authorities to prohibit radical students from
joining forces with the labor workers, and to prevent the rally
people from using firebombs and steel pipes.
</P>
<P>
The government will guarantee workers freedom to assemble but
will not tolerate violent demonstrations, as was the case in the
May Day protests, he said.
</P>
<P>
Radical students joined the May Day celebrations organized by
the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions on May 1.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations turned into violent street protests, in which
riot police fired tear gas at protesters who wielded steel pipes
and threw rocks and firebombs.
</P>
<P>
The president blamed the demonstrators for damaging efforts by
the government to improve the economic crisis-plagued nation's
international confidence and ability to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The president appealed to workers to accept layoffs to help
firms sharpen competitiveness, help restructure corporations and
create jobs in the long run.
</P>
<P>
South Korea cannot draw foreign investment without ensuring
flexibility in the local labor market, he added.
</P>
<P>
The recent labor demonstations have put Kim's government on
shaky ground as it fears that a recurrence of violent
demonstrations will badly influence his struggles to overcome the
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the world's dynamic economy, plunged into
economic turmoil in late 1997, and needed a foreign money inflow
to make way out of the situation.

speaking on the sideline of a two-day official visit to Germany
which began Wednesday in Berlin.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Growth of Rural Industry Vital to China's Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The growth of rural industry has
never so closely linked with the growth of China's national
economy today.
</P>
<P>
The speed of its development has a weighty bearing on whether
or not China can achieve its annual economic target of an
eight-percent growth for this year.
</P>
<P>
The predicted growth of 18 percent for rural industrial
enterprises this year mean much to an eight-percent growth for
China's national economy in the wake of the Asian financial crisis
and inefficient performance of the state sector.
</P>
<P>
In a recent inspection to east China's Jiangsu Province, the
cradle of rural industrial development, Jiang Zemin, general
secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
said that the development of rural industry is of strategic
importance to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever the added-value of township-run enterprises grow
three or four percent, the gross domestic product will increase by
one percent," said a noted Chinese economist.
</P>
<P>
To ensure an eight-percent national economic growth,
township-run enterprises should keep a growth rate of no less than
18 percent, or a net increase of 324 billion yuan this year, thus
contributing 3.6 percent to the GDP, he said.
</P>
<P>
A high economic growth rate for rural industry will also
accelerate agricultural development, increase the annual income of
farmers and create more job opportunities, said Chen Jianbo, a
deputy research fellow at the Development Research Center under
the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Growth of Rural Industry Vital to China's Economy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a major invention of hundreds of millions of farmers and a
brilliant achievement of China's economic reforms, township-run
enterprises have succeeded in raising the ratio of its added-value
in the GDP from four percent to 33 percent in less than two
decades, becoming a pillar of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the added-value of township-run enterprises across
China has risen to 1.8 trillion yuan, accounting for two thirds of
the total rural added-value, half of the national industrial
added-value and 38 percent of China's export value.
</P>
<P>
Referring to whether or not the 24 million strong rural
enterprises can maintain its rising momentum, Chen Yaobang,
minister of agriculture, said it should and can attain its goal of
an 18-percent growth.
</P>
<P>
He cited a number of favorable elements including a relatively
strong strength of rural enterprises, government policies
favorable to the development of this sector, abundant farm
produce and labor force and increased government investment in
infrastructures and high-tech firms.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,400 large-and medium-sized rural enterprises are
now quite competitive on the international and domestic
market. Among them, 1,000 firms have obtained the rights of
exporting their own products independently, 4,000 have opened
branches abroad and 40 firms have been listed on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yongtao, director of the Township-run Enterprise Bureau
under the Ministry of Agriculture, said, rural enterprises will
keep developing so long as the state support them in terms of
credit, export, use of investment and technological upgrading.

<HEADLINE> Boeing 737 Inspection Has No Effect on China Aviation: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Orders on safety inspection of
Boeing 737 aircraft recently announced by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) of the United States will not affect the
safety situation in China, civil aviation said here today.
</P>
<P>
Both officials from the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC) and the China Company of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group
expressed that opinion in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The FAA demanded on Sunday that U.S. air carriers conduct
inspections within seven days, on Boeing 737 aircraft series 100
through 500 that have flown more than 50,000 hours, and within 14
days on those aircraft that have flown more than 40,000 hours. The
inspections will focus on the electrical wiring and conduit inside
fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
On April 25, an FAA official found two small holes caused by a
short circuit on wiring "sleeves" near an oil tank on the wings of
a Boeing 737 belonging to U.S. carrier Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors expressed doubts that the explosion of a Boeing 747
near New York City in 1996 should be blamed on a short-circuit
fire near its fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
China's air carriers now have 141 Boeing 737 airliners of
different types, accounting for nearly one-third of its combined
air fleet, with Boeing 737-300 aircraft the largest component.
</P>
<P>
China began to introduce Boeing aircraft in the mid-1980s, and
the oldest has flown only 32,000 hours. Only 17 Boeing 737
airliners have flown more than 20,000 hours. All of them do not
fall within the range of inspection.
</P>
<P>
"The public need not to worry about the safety of travel by
Chinese airlines," said Zhang Yongsheng, deputy director of Air
Worthiness Department of the CAAC.
</P>
<P>
The country reports a sound safety record for airline travel,
with a set of strict, scientific management systems that have
reached advanced world standards in terms of daily care and
high-level maintenance on aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"Safety is the top priority for civil aviation," Zhang
said. "The CAAC still hopes air carriers place great importance on
this. Over the latest routine care time, air carriers should look
over the oil tankers on its Boeing aircraft."

WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton decided Tuesday night to impose a raft of
economic sanctions on India's government on Wednesday for
detonating three underground nuclear explosions, senior
Administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States' inability to foresee or forestall India's
nuclear tests, despite ample warnings, was a failure of both the
Central Intelligence Agency and American foreign policymakers,
government officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- A high-priority weapon under development by the Army to
guard troops in the field against missile attack suffered its
fifth consecutive miss Tuesday in an embarrassing setback for both
the costly system and the Pentagon's broader missile defense
effort.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton, who sometimes complains that he does not
get the credit he believes he is due for the soaring economy, can
at least take comfort in the latest news: his personal investments
are doing just fine.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The White House is mounting its first broad review of
concentration in U.S. business, as a series of recent mergers
accelerate the trend that is redefining industries from auto
making to telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
-- Under election-year pressure from conservatives, Republican
leaders are loosening the reins on tax cuts. In a major shift,
Senate Budget Chairman Pete Domenici said Tuesday that he is now
willing to use tobacco revenues to pay for tax cuts.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Increases Funds for Small Traders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia announced on
Wednesday a 150 million ringgit (39 million U.S. dollars)
allocation for the Petty Traders Economic Fund (Tekun) and an
additional 50 million ringgit (13 million dollars) for the Small
Entrepreneurs Fund (TUK).
</P>
<P>
With the funds, small entrepreneurs and petty traders in the

utilize as capital for their ventures, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim told reporters after a meeting with small entrepreneurs
and petty traders at the Treasury here.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the additional funds were allocated from the
existing budget and newly-acquired loans from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said details of the allocation for Tekun undertaken as a
pilot project by Universiti Sains Malaysia's Center For Policy
Research would be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said loans under TUK would be at an interest rate of 6
percent and repayments could be made fortnightly instead of weekly
previously.
</P>
<P>
He said such assistance would be extended only to small
entrepreneurs and petty traders with a valid license.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking the cooperation of the (concerned) association
to take action against payment defaulters and we are prepared to
revoke licenses and take legal action if necessary," he said.

The small entrepreneurs and petty traders could also obtain
loans from the Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM) funds which totaled
100 million ringgit (26 million dollars) announced earlier.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Israeli Air Raids Reaches Eight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of Palestinians
killed by Israeli air raids on eastern Lebanon province of Bekaa
has reached eight, Lebanon's Voice of the People radio reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of wounded has increased to 40 from the
previous 22.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes fired at least four rockets in three separate
raids from 1:20 a.m. local time (2200 GMT) on the area of Diera
Taniye, central part of Bekaa, less than 10 kilometers from Syrian
border, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
A hospital source said that the wounded Palestinians are now
receiving treatment at nearby hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Israeli raids targeted a training facility possessed by the
Damascus-based Palestinian Fatah Movement led by Colonel Abu
Mousa, and an administrative house owned by the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestinian-General Command (PFLP-GC) led by
Ahmmed Giblil.
</P>
<P>
They all had quit Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah and
opposed the Palestinian-Israeli peace deal.
</P>
<P>
PFLP-GC in a statement vowed that they will make the Zionist
enemy pay for their savage aggression.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, an Israeli army statement confirmed the raids,
saying Israeli Air Force warplanes Tuesday night attacked
terrorist positions in the area of the Lebanese Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
The pilots reportedly hit the targets and returned safely to
their bases, it added.
</P>
<P>
This was the first Israeli attack on the Palestinian groups in
Lebanon since they fired rockets onto northern Israeli territory
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli blast came one day after two Israeli soldiers were
wounded by rockets fired by the Muslim resistance group Hezbollah,
or Party of God, which is backed by Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah fired several Katyusha missiles onto northern
Israeli area of Galilee Monday night to revenge Lebanese
civilians wounded in earlier Israeli artillery shellings.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel occupied a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon in 1985 to buffer guerrilla attacks, Lebanon's
resistance forces have locked Israeli troops and its allied South
Lebanon Army in a war of attrition.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Leader Appeals for Restraint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Defense Minister and
ABRI (Armed Forces) Commander Gen. Wiranto appealed Wednesday to
students and security officers to exercise self-restraint to avoid
further clashes that could claim more lives.
</P>
<P>
"Clashes are getting out of hand. All parties should think
clearly and constructively to maintain a peaceful atmosphere in
solving problems," the official Antara News Agency quoted the
general as saying.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that all clashes between students and
security forces would stop, as they posed grave threats to the
people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said both sides should understand each other's
position. "Students want to express their aspirations, but on the
other hand security forces bear the responsibility of maintaining
national stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will surely take action against both students and security
officers who are proven to have violated the law," he noted.

<HEADLINE> China to Issue More Investment Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China will issue more securities
investment funds this year to develop institutional investors and
ensure market stability, a senior securities industry official
said today.
</P>
<P>
"We will take into consideration the market performance and
unveil new investment funds in the second half of this year," said
Chen Yaoxian, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, at a forum sponsored by Credit Lyonnais Securities
Asia.
</P>
<P>
China issued its first two securities investment funds, Fund
Jintai and Fund Kaiyuan, in March. The third fund, Xinghua, was
issued in April.
</P>
<P>
The three funds, all closed-end and valued at 2 billion yuan
each, met with great investor enthusiasm immediately after they
were listed on stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen on April 7
and May 8. They are believed to have triggered the recent
stock-market rebound.
</P>
<P>
Chen revealed that the investment funds to be issued will get
larger in size and China will experiment with open-ended
investment funds when the time is ripe.
</P>
<P>
China will develop different types of securities investment
funds to co-ordinate with each other, Chen told the forum.
</P>
<P>
China is accelerating the formation of its long-awaited
Securities Law and seeking to increase investment instruments, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that China will continue to take measures to
develop the B-share market, which is currently in the doldrums,
and said that he personally is confident about prospects of the
market.
</P>
<P>
B shares refer to those issued by Chinese companies but open
for overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> Baidoa Meeting in Somalia Might Be Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 13 (Xinhua) -- There are increasing
speculations, controversial images and hopes in Somalia for the
convening of the Baidoa conference which is scheduled to start
two days from now.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdi Osman Farah, deputy chairman of the Hawadle
political faction (USC/PM), it is not likely that the Cairo
agreement will become productive due to reasons he did not
disclose.
</P>
<P>
Farah, together with five other USC splinter political groups
from the central region of Hiran who held a four-day meeting in
Mogadishu, concluded Tuesday that they won't participate in any
national meeting which is not inclusive for all of Somalia's
multiple factions as they put it.
</P>
<P>
They said, instead, they're now trying to establish an
administration of their own for Hiran region.
</P>
<P>
Abdulkadir Mohamed Aden Zoppe, a prominent leader of the
Rahanwein community of Bay and Bakol regions, said aside from the
financial difficulties, the conference won't start as long as
Hussein Aidid's militiamen remain in the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Zoppe said Hussein Aidid has agreed with the Rahanweins to
pull out from Baidoa in a systematic way and would complete the
withdrawal ten days earlier before the convening of the
conference, but he has not honored his words so far.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid's faction is on the contrary very hopeful that
the Baidoa meeting will bring about a lasting solution for
Somalia's long standing political crises.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Qanyare Afrah, Hussein Aidid's outspoken interior
secretary, said Wednesday that the logic reaches them that the
Baidoa conference should be postponed for another term, but he
did not indicate when.
</P>
<P>
Afrah said Mogadishu's administration, air and seaports which
are in reach should first be settled as a proof to the world that
something could be done.
</P>
<P>
Faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed told Xinhua Wednesday that
Somalia's only hope is in the implementation of the Cairo peace
deal and the Baidoa conference.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, he said, the Baidoa conference will
follow the establishment of Mogadishu's administration which will
be concluded in the next two days.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of the postponement of the Baidoa meeting,
Ali Mahdi said it is obvious that it will be postponed, but none
can so far say the final word for its postponement.
</P>
<P>
"The new date will be announced in our next meeting tomorrow
or on Friday," he added.
</P>
<P>
The main backer of the Cairo peace deal, Egypt, is also
optimistic about the convening of the Baidoa meeting for the
formation of a government of national unity for Somalia. Mohamud
Mustafa, Egyptian ambassador to Somalia who is now in Mogadishu,
told Xinhua that it is too early to announce that the Cairo
initiative has failed as far as the Somalis are committed.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa said the Somali faction leaders are now busy in
concluding the administration for Mogadishu, the opening of the
air and seaports, then they will proceed to Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
"It is premature to give a final judgement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to financial support, Mustafa reiterated the full
support of Egypt and the Arab League which are, according to him,
ready to release all the necessary funds for convening the Baidoa
meeting once Mogadishu is settled.
</P>
<P>
"All we need is to see concrete steps taken on the ground here
in Mogadishu," he said, adding "problems of eight years can't be
solved that easily and the faction leaders are very serious about
their tasks."
</P>
<P>
Mustafa also noted that the Baidoa meeting will of course be
postponed by the Cairo signatories of the Cairo peace deal in
their nearest meeting for the third time.

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh's Generals Back For Reintegration Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of resistance
generals loyal to deposed First Prime Minister Prince Norodom
Ranariddh arrived here Wednesday for talks on re-integrating their
forces into the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF).
</P>
<P>
This was the first return of the five-member group, led by
resistance commander Khann Savoeun, to Phnom Penh since last July.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh and his forces have been in exile since last July in
the wake of the ousting of the prince, then first prime minister,
by his co-premier, Hun Sen, in a military clash.
</P>
<P>
The exact date for the start of the talks has not yet been
announced.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh agreed, in an April 17 statement, to transfer
zones controlled by his forces and order integration of his forces
into the RCAF.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen appointed his five officials to
meet and discuss with General Khann Savoeun on May 4.
</P>
<P>
This discussion was the last step in the last requirement of a
peace plan brokered by Japan, which paid the way for Ranariddh to
participate in the July 26 elections, Hun Sen's cabinet said.
</P>
<P>
Resistance commander Nhiek bun Chhay said his team would make
five proposals, including a cease-fire and amnesty for royalist
officers convicted on criminal charges with Prince Ranariddh
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The other demands were the return of old ranks for royalist
officers, the return of property and a guarantee of protection
from the United Nations and the Phnom Penh government.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Holds Fair To Employ Retired Armymen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal government
arranged a fair at the Military Museum today to facilitate
contacts between retired armymen and employing units.
</P>
<P>
In China, the government is responsible for giving jobs to
retired soldiers. The task is heavier in 1998, which is the first
year for the country to cut its army by another 500,000.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government plans to arrange employment for 1,760
demobilized officers this year, an increase of 25 percent over
1997, according to Gao Yunhou, director of the Beijing Municipal
Personnel Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the city has provided jobs to nearly 30,000 people
retiring from the army.
</P>
<P>
Although the capital, like other Chinese cities, faces the
pressing reality of unemployment and redundant government
functionaries, "the municipal government will manage well the
employment of retired officers," Gao said.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with employing units, retired armymen are
popular for they are competent and conscientious about work.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 583 retired officers reached employment
intentions with employing units today.

ROME, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the 1996 French
Open champion, reached the third round by beating Todd Martin at
the Italian Open on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After early exits at his last three clay court events, the
Russian survived the two hour competition against American Martin
1-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3.

</P>
<P>
The third set saw more of the same, including two straight
double faults from Martin on the final two points of the match.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Kafelnikov will next face No. 11 seed Richard
Krajicek, who eliminated France's Nicolas Escude 6-3, 6-3

<HEADLINE> China's Financial Sector Operates Well in First Four Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China's financial sector operated
smoothly in the first four months of this year, with the Renminbi
rate remaining stable and bank loans increasing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) show that, by
the end of April, the total amount of outstanding loans was 7.65
trillion yuan, up 15.2 percent from the same period last year, and
the amount of outstanding loans by state-owned banks was more than
6 trillion yuan, up 14.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Newly increased loans in the first four months totaled 153.75
billion yuan, of which 151.2 billion yuan came from the last two
months, indicating that banks began to implement their plans for
expanding loans this year.
</P>
<P>
In April, medium- and long-term loans increased 10.76 billion
yuan, reversing the declining trend of the previous three months,
which demonstrated that the series of financial policy
readjustments by the central bank to stimulate domestic demand
have become effective.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, the amount of outstanding deposits was
8.44 trillion yuan, up 15.5 percent from the same period last
year, of which enterprise deposits accounted for 2.75 trillion
yuan and residents' deposits were 4.9 trillion yuan, up 13.1
percent and 16.3 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, by the end of April, the
outstanding amount of broad money (M2) was 9.27 trillion yuan, up
14.6 percent from the same period last year; while that of narrow
money (M1) was 3.34 trillion yuan, up 11.2 percent; and money in
circulation (M0) was 1.02 trillion yuan, up 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the PBOC said that the central bank will
continue to carry out macro-financial regulation in accordance
with changes in the economic and financial development, urge
commercial banks to further improve financial services and ensure
an appropriately fast increase of loans to promote the development
of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> 42 Killed in Election-Related Violence: Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said here Wednesday that a total of 42 people were killed in
election-related violence as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a regular press conference held at the Presidential Palace,
he said the death toll went down by 42 percent when compared with
the 73 casualties in the 1995 congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 presidential elections, about 169 people were
killed in various violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos also announced that the number of people
injured in various election-related violent incidents fell by 17
percent from 81 in 1995 to 67 this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the total number of election-related violent incidents
went up from 97 in 1995 to 188 during this election, or an
increase of 93.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
These statistics cover the same 150 day period prior to the
1995 polls and the 1998 national and local elections.
</P>
<P>
Ramos had earlier stated that this decrease in deaths and
wounded could mean that there is less use of deadly weapons during
the year's polls.
</P>
<P>
"The number of incidents could be just because of the
fisticuffs or harassment or things of that nature. So, as far as
blood is concerned, there was much less blood spilled during the
1998 elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
There were early reports saying a total of 46 people killed as
of Monday in the elections.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the 34 million registered voters went to
the polls Monday to vote for a new president, a vice president, 12
out of the 24 senators, 260 House representatives and more than
17,000 local officials and councilors.
</P>
<P>
The elections were generally peaceful and orderly, the
Commission on Elections announced after the voting ended.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest unofficial results released by an
accredited private quick-count company, Vice President Joseph
Estrada of the Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight of
Patriotic Filipino Masses) took a commanding lead.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqis citizens set free by
Kuwait after seven years of imprisonment returned to their
homeland Wednesday, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
INA said that three Iraqis, identified only as Fadhil, 32,
Salem, 30, and Mohammad, 26, are brothers born in Kuwait. They
were detained in 1991 and accused on "false and unrealistic
charges," said INA.
</P>
<P>
They had been handed over to the Iraqi authorities under the
supervision of the International Red Crescent Society, said INA.
</P>
<P>
INA added the three brothers were living in Kuwait because they
were born there and their father, an Iraqi, was a resident in
Kuwait since 1953. They worked in Kuwait before being thrown into
jail.
</P>
<P>
But INA failed to detail the reasons for their detention and
the charges brought against them by the Kuwaitis.
</P>
<P>
According to the brothers, there are more than 35 Iraqi
citizens now being imprisoned in the Central Jail of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that in Talha Prison to which they had been
transferred, some prisoners of Iraqi nationalities tried to commit
suicide because they could not bear torture and bad treatment.
</P>
<P>
They called on international humanitarian organizations to
interfere immediately to save those Iraqis who are still in
Kuwaiti prisons.

<HEADLINE> Japan Imposes Economic Sanctions on India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan applied economic sanctions
against India on Wednesday to protest against the South Asian
nation's latest testing of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Tokyo would
suspend new grants-in-aid to India and shelve the plan to host a
meeting, scheduled for June 30 to July 1, of donor nations to
India.
</P>
<P>
India stunned the world Monday and again Wednesday by
announcing it had conducted a series of underground nuclear tests,
its first since 1974. It said it had the ability to make nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The three underground nuclear tests Monday involved a fission
device, a low yield device and a thermonuclear device.
</P>
<P>
Japan will also make a formal decision on whether to suspend
yen-denominated official loans to India after monitoring how New
Delhi responds to Japan's concerns over the nuclear tests,
Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo Muraoka said in a
statement that the sanctions are based on the principles of
Japan's official development assistance (ODA).
</P>
<P>
Muraoka urged India to stop nuclear tests "immediately" and to
sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which has been extended
permanently, and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty adopted by the
United Nations General Assembly in 1996.
</P>
<P>
India's nuclear testing "can never be tolerated" as it is a
challenge to the efforts by the international community which
seeks a world free from nuclear weapons, Muraoka said.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been the largest aid donor to India since 1986,
providing 3.5 billion yen (about 26.3 million U.S. dollars) in
grants-in-aid to India for fiscal 1997, which ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
In October 1997, Japan committed 132.7 billion yen (about 99.8
million dollars) in loans to India.

</P>
<P>
The National Citizens' Movement for Free Elections is the sole

Elections to conduct a quick count of the votes cast.
</P>
<P>
To alley business people's fears that he might be a disaster to
the economy if elected, Estrada had repeated that he would

<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said he conveyed
that message to Pakistan's High Commissioner Khawar Zaman during
a meeting in Canberra Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make it clear to him personally, not just through
my officials, that it would be a matter of very great concern if
Pakistan were to follow India and detonate a nuclear device," he
told journalists here.
</P>
<P>
"It is the Australian Government's view that Pakistan should
take the high moral ground, should not make the mistake of
detonating any type of nuclear device, and ensure that Pakistan
doesn't contribute to the proliferation of nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
Downer said Zaman promised to convey Australia's views to his
government.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the foreign minister said "the Australian
government strongly condemns" India's nuclear tests, and recalled
Australian High Commissioner to India, Rob Laurie, for
consultations.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's rebel Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) Wednesday vowed to fight to the death
to defend their controlled territory, according to informed
sources here.
</P>
<P>
In a statement broadcast over his clandestine Voice of Tigers
radio monitored in the north of the country, LTTE leader
Velupillai Prabhakaran said the LTTE members "love their land more
than their lives."
</P>
<P>
Prabhakaran warned that thousands of troops would be killed if
the government persisted in pushing ahead with its operation aimed
at recapturing a 75-km section of the Vavuniya-Jaffna Highway
which runs through the rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
The military Tuesday said Operation Jaya Sikuru (Sure of
Victory) launched a year ago would go on till next year.
</P>
<P>
Prabhakaran said the Tigers had been able to stall the military
operation conducted within the jungle region in the north of the
country, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The government troops claimed to have recaptured at least 45 km
of the highway and killed over 2,500 rebels, while some 1,400
troops were killed.

Prabhakaran said the rebels had lost 1,300 cadres in the past
year, and killed over 3,000 government soldiers and injured 7,000
others.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a war against the government
for a separate state in the north and east of the country since
1983.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 13 (Xinhua) -- South Asia has been thrown into
turmoil and "its security has been severely endangered" following
the latest nuclear tests conducted by India, a spokesman for the
Pakistani Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the two nuclear tests by India
Wednesday, the spokesman said that "these tests have once again
brought into focus the utter contempt in which New Delhi holds the
world public opinion, particularly the non-proliferation efforts."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that "the latest tests are particularly
provocative as they are by nature aimed at perfection of
battlefield tactical weapons threatening the security of India's
immediate neighbors."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan once again reiterates that it will take all measures
in consonance with the threat posed to Pakistan's security and the
need for the protection of our national interests," the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by the Indian government, India
conducted two more underground nuclear tests Wednesday in Pokhran
of the northwestern desert state of Rajasthan.

Pakistan's Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan has strongly

<HEADLINE> Russian Mideast Envoy Arrives in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian special Middle East envoy
Viktor Posuvalyuk arrived here Wednesday in a two-day visit aimed
at helping revive the Lebanese and Syrian peace talks with Israel,
stalled for over two years.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Beirut International Airport,
Posuvalyuk told reporters that his country will continue
cooperation with the United States and Europe in an effort to seek
a comprehensive peace deal in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated Russia's support for Lebanon's position in
the Middle East peace process, especially on the Israeli offer of
conditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel in April decided to endorse the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 425 and said it was ready to withdraw from
south Lebanon if Beirut provided security guarantees for the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the offer, saying the resolution called for an
immediate and unconditional withdrawal and there should be no
negotiations over the pullout.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, the Russian envoy will hold talks with
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz on regional affairs,
especially the Israeli withdrawal offer.
</P>
<P>
He will also convey a message from Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov to Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
After visiting Lebanon, Posuvalyuk will go to Damascus and
confer with Syrian leaders over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Syria, a power-broker which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, seeks
a comprehensive peace deal with Israel, which will include the
return of the Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in the 1967
Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Hepatitis C Victims Sue Iran's Blood Transfusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 5,000 hepatitis C victims have
filed suits against Iran's Blood Transfusion Organization (BTO),
the daily Jomhuri Islami (Islamic Republic) reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Director of the BTO's Research and Refinement Company Kheir
Abadi announced on Tuesday that the country's judiciary is
investigating the complaints of the 5,000 hepatitis C patients,
who received the disease from infected blood products provided by
the BTO.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning whether the BTO should be responsible for
infection cases, the official said that measures must be adopted
to provide these patients with costly prescription until those
responsible for the damage are identified and compensation
demanded.
</P>
<P>
Abadi put the number of hepatitis C patients at 300,000 in the
country, saying that thousands of patients had been infected with
the disease through transfusions of blood imported from a French
company but they have not filed complaints.
</P>
<P>
The victims can receive at least 500 million U.S. dollars
compensation from the French company if they sue it, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that some Iranians infected with AIDS
virus through blood transfusion and their relatives also lodged
suit against the BTO.
</P>
<P>
However, the BTO chief Taghi Khani said on Tuesday that blood
products might be infected with some viruses not only in Iran but
worldwide, the newspaper Iran Daily reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first case of AIDS in Iran was recorded in 1985 when a
one-year-old baby was found to have received the disease from a
transfusion of imported blood. According to the official figure,
around 1,230 Iranian have been diagnosed as carries of the HIV
virus.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The development of multi-level and

friendly and cooperative ties between the two armed forces,
especially the two air forces.

<HEADLINE> CPC Central Committee Ends Conference on Taiwan Affairs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A three-day working conference on
Taiwan affairs of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party (CPC) ended here today. The committee called for more
efforts to create favorable conditions for China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
delivered a keynote address at the conference, whose participants
included other members of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee: Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li
Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing.
</P>
<P>
With the return of Hong Kong followed by Macao, the settlement
of the Taiwan issue and its ultimate reunification with the
motherland are desired by the whole nation, including Taiwan
compatriots, as well as a paramount historical mission of both the
Party and the nation, according to the conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference called on the whole Party and the nation to
further implement the principles of "peaceful reunification" and
"one country, two systems" and Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposal
for promoting China's reunification as well as the proper
management of all work in handling Taiwan affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier and Member of the Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee Qian Qichen also delivered an important
speech during the conference. Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan
Affairs offices of the CPC Central Committee and the State
Council, also presented a work report.
</P>
<P>
Since the CPC Central Committee held its working conference on
Taiwan affairs in 1990, great changes have taken place in Taiwan's
situation and cross-straits relations, according to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Under the principles of "peaceful reunification" and "one
country, two systems," severe and complicated campaigns were
launched to fight against the separatist forces on the island and
anti-China forces in the world community, according to the
conference.
</P>
<P>
However, the unofficial trade and economic cooperation as well
as cultural and personnel exchanges have increased significantly
and these activities have greatly promoted mutual understanding
and national emotions among people on both sides of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
The smooth return of Hong Kong last July and the successful
implementation of the "one country, two systems" principle would
surely give an impetus to cross-straits relations and set an
example for the ultimate resolution of the Taiwan issue, the
conference reported.

<P>
The conference called on all Party members to carry out the
guidelines of the 15th National Congress, hold high the banner of
Deng Xiaoping Theory, focus on boosting the national economy, and
-- on this basis -- promote the overall development of
cross-straits relations and create favorable conditions for the
full resolution of the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
Party members should adhere to the basic principle of "peaceful
reunification" and "one country, two systems" and the eight-point
proposal put forward by Jiang Zemin, and make a firm stand against
any attempts to split Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Party members should also continue to push ahead economic,
cultural, sports, educational, scientific, technological and
personnel exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Active steps should be made to hold cross-straits political
talks under the principle of "one China" to end the state of
hostility between the two sides as early as possible, the
committee said. In this sense, procedural talks can be conducted
first about the topics and places for formal talks, according to
the conference.
</P>
<P>
The committee expects the Taiwan authorities to give up its
separatist advocacy and enter political talks as soon as possible
by proceeding from the overall interests of the Chinese nation and
the long-term interests of compatriots in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the motherland's reunification, the conference
pinned hopes on compatriots in Taiwan who have the fine tradition
of patriotism and have made great contributions to boosting
cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
To achieve peaceful reunification in accordance with the
principle of "one country, two systems" meets Taiwan people's
aspiration for peace, stability and maintaining the current
situation, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
Party members should strive to carry out the principle of
relying on people in Taiwan, have a better understanding of their
thinking, fully take their interests into consideration and
respect their aspirations, they said.
</P>
<P>
Policies and regulations concerning Taiwan should be improved
and formalities for Taiwan people's entry to the mainland
should be simplified so that the compatriots in Taiwan will find
it more convenient to travel, visit relatives, expand business and
study in the mainland areas of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
During the critical period at the turn of a new century, the
country's reunification and national revitalization will be
historical tides which cannot be resisted, they said.
</P>
<P>
The work related to Taiwan is a key matter of the Party and the
whole country, and more people should be united and all positive
factors should be mobilized to strengthen the work, according to
the conference.
</P>
<P>
Various departments should follow the unified arrangements of
the CPC Central Committee and make concerted efforts so as to do
the work well, they said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, all patriotic people should unite and work
hard for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the
revitalization of the Chinese nation, according to the
conference.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Holds Meeting on Indian Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Defense Committee of the
Cabinet of Pakistan met here Wednesday to take stock of the
situation arising from Indian nuclear tests and "overt
weaponization by India."
</P>
<P>
The meeting chaired by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif concluded
that the "reckless and highly provocative actions" by the Indian
government dealt a severe blow to global non-proliferation, said a
statement issued by the committee Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
India conducted two more nuclear test blasts on Wednesday
following three explosions on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian actions had fundamentally altered the strategic
situation and further heightened the tension in South Asia, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Indian actions have magnified the immediacy
and the magnitude of the threat to Pakistan's security.
</P>
<P>
The meeting regretted that Pakistan's warnings to the
international community, particularly major powers, to stop India
from crossing the threshold had gone unheeded, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that some countries had sought to bring
"unjustifiable pressure and sanctions" on Pakistan, despite its
impeccable record of utmost restraint.
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility for demolishing the prospects of a
nuclear-free South Asia rested clearly with India and with those
who had adopted a deferential approach and sought to either ignore
or acquiesce in India's blatant attempts to cross the nuclear
threshold," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said the meeting affirmed the government's determination to
"reject any unilateral, selective and discriminatory pressure from
any quarter on matters pertaining to national security."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the meeting reiterated Pakistan's resolve to take
all steps it deemed necessary for national security, which were
within its sovereign rights for self-defense.
</P>
<P>
"After comprehensively evaluating the country's defense
preparedness, the meeting expressed satisfaction over Pakistan's
ability to respond effectively and adequately to the new threats
and challenges," the statement said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish enterprises should actively
participate in Romania's ambitious privatization program, thus
pushing Turkish-Romanian cooperation to a new high, Romanian
Senate Speaker Petre Roman has said.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Turkish newspaper Daily News,
which is published Wednesday, Roman said that a large number of
Romanian state-owned energy, telecommunications and tourism firms
will be sold in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to raise 800 million U.S. dollars through
the privatization program this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The opportunities are now opening up and I am certain that
direct Turkish investments will double or triple in the coming
years," Roman said.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume of Turkey and Romania totaled 750 million
dollars in 1997 and Turkish direct investment in Romania stood at
150 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turkey mainly exports synthetic fibre, machines, plastics,
grains and processed food to Romania and imports fertilizer,
edible oil, aluminium, iron and steel products from Romania.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, some 5,000 Turkish state and
private enterprises have invested in the eastern European country
in industries of brewing, banking and finance, tourism as well as
soft drinks.

GENEVA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
should carry out reforms in order to tackle challenges in front of
the organization, said newly-elected Director-General of the World
Health Organization (WHO) here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"WHO can and must change," Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland said in a
speech immediately after her election at the 51st World Health
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"It must become more effective, more accountable, more
transparent and more receptive to a changing world," the
59-year-old Norwegian stressed.
</P>
<P>
She urged WHO member states to "take responsibility for the
targets they set and provide resources", adding that "they must
practise what they preach from this rostrum".
</P>
<P>
In transition from one century to another, Brundtland said, WHO
member states should forge stronger relations to face changes
which will be faster and more dramatic from an economic, social
and health perspective.
</P>
<P>
"The world is in transition," she said. "So accordingly WHO
must be in transition. Looking ahead."
</P>
<P>
Ms Brundtland, former Norwegian prime minister, will not assume
office until July when her predecessor Dr Hiroshi Nakajima will
leave the post which he has been holding for 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Approves Investment Plan to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet has approved
a Finance Ministry plan to fight unemployment by investing 1
billion shekels (about 270 million U.S. dollars) in
infrastructure, Israel Radio reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the plan was endorsed by a vote of 12 to 4
after more than six hours of stormy debate in the cabinet Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
The investments, which will be financed by budget cuts,
include 800 million shekels (216 million dollars) for constructing
new roads and upgrading existing highways, 120 million shekels
(32.5 million dollars) for building new train stations and
railways, and the rest for renovating slum neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the new investments, the plan also calls for
legislation to reduce the number of foreign workers and
administrative steps to remove bureaucratic impediments to
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Bank of
Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel strongly supported the plan.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel said investment in infrastructure was one of the best
ways to stimulate economic growth and increase employment in the
long run.
</P>
<P>
The plan, however, was blasted by some ministers. Industry and
Trade Minister Natan Sharansky charged that the plan would not
promote economic growth because it would not help the country's
main growth engine -- the high-tech sector.
</P>
<P>
What this sector needs, Sharansky said, is more research and
development funds.
</P>
<P>
Due to the slowdown of economic growth, the unemployment
problem has become more and more serious in Israel.
</P>
<P>
At the end of February, the unemployment rate hit 8.3 percent,
the highest since 1993.

Dealers said that stock prices plunged by 4.9 percent on an
upsurge of violence in Indonesia and active selling of several

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 13 (Xinhua) -- About 80 percent of South Koreans
have suffered pay cuts since the nation signed with the
International Monetary Fund for a 57-billion-U.S. dollar economic
bailout loan last December.
</P>
<P>
Under a survey conducted by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and
Industry Wednesday, of the 800 people polled, 76.5 percent
experienced drops in household incomes, with an average reduction
rate of 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only 22.9 percent of the respondents said their earnings
remained unchanged while less than one in every 100 respondents,
or 0.6 percent, reported increases in income.
</P>
<P>
The low and middle-income brackets were the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
Almost 90 percent of the low-income people earning less than
one million won (about 714 U.S. dollars) a month, and 80.6 percent
of the middle-income earners whose monthly income ranges from one
million to two million won, suffered pay cuts while among the
high-income bracket earning more than three million won a month,
only 58.9 percent reported pay reduction, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
With respect to the pay-reduction scope, the low and
middle-income families reported 45.8 percent and 32.8 percent,
respectively, whereas the high-income ones answered 24.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Harsh economic times are giving enormous pains to the poor and
destroying the middle class while the wealthy people are getting
even richer as banks offer sky-high interest rates, said the
survey.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- High-ranking officials from the
Chinese Central government will be in Hong Kong next month to give
an update on the Chinese mainland's investment climate and
economic policy at the '98 China Investment Policy Seminar.
</P>
<P>
Jointly organized by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) and the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC), the seminar will be held on June 2 at the Hong Kong
Convention &AMP; Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>

autumn, which opened up lots of business opportunities for Hong
Kong companies.
</P>
<P>
"The mainland market will be opened up further to the outside
world, and foreign investors are encouraged to take part in
various projects covering agriculture, infrastructure, pillar
industries, and those requiring high technology," said Yau.

<P>
The seminar will provide an insight into trade and investment
topics, he continued, adding these first-hand information is vital
to investors interested in tapping the markets in China's mainland
areas.
</P>
<P>
Joining Yau at the press conference was MOFTEC's Director
General of Foreign Investment Administration Mrs. Ma Xiuhong, who
hoped that the seminar would enhance the understanding of the
investment environment in China's mainland areas and promote the
direct investment of local firms, and overseas firms doing
business in Hong Kong and in the mainland areas.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the seminar will be from China's key state
ministries and they will speak on the opening of China's financial
market, state-owned enterprises reform, latest customs policies
and regulations, and prospects of China's economic development and
priority projects, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will be held in conjunction with the '98 China
(Hong Kong) Investment Symposium, to be organized by the MOFTEC
from June 2 to 5.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Dong Well in Attracting FDI: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China has been doing quite well
this year in terms of attracting foreign direct investment (FDI),
a senior Chinese official said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the first four months this year, the contracted value of
FDI reached 13.56 billion U.S. dollars, up 12.24 percent compared
with a year earlier, according to Ma Xiuhong, director-general of
Foreign Investment Administration of the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Actually utilized value of FDI totaled 11.72 billion U.S.
dollars during the period, up a minor 0.07 percent from a year
ago," she added.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of foreign-financed projects approved
dipped 6.84 percent to 5,704, the official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
She was here attending a press conference prior to the '98
China Investment Policy Seminar, which is to be held here in early
 June in conjunction with the '98 China (Hong Kong) Investment
Symposium.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official noted that in the first four months of
this year, the nation's economic development was healthy and
stable, with GDP growing by 7.9 percent and inflation dropping by
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although adversely affected by the regional financial turmoil,
China's external trade achieved satisfactory results, she said,
adding "The volume of external trade amounted to 97.4 billion U.S.
dollars in the first four months, up 7.96 percent over the
previous year while exports gaining 11.73 percent to hit 56.18
billion U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
"China will make continued efforts to improve its investment
environment and enhance foreign investors' confidence in China,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, the contracted value of FDI flowing
into China totaled 534.7 billion U.S. dollars and the actually
utilized FDI is 233.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China has for the past several years ranked second, only after
the United States, in attracting FDI.

<HEADLINE> Policing of Hong Kong Unchanged after Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Police have
continued to enforce the law after the handover in exactly the
same way as before, fairly, impartially and professionally, said
the Commissioner of Police in a book published here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his foreword in the Police Review 1997 published here
Wednesday, Commissioner of Police Eddie Hui Ki-on wrote that many
people were concerned at the beginning of 1997 about how Hong Kong
would be policed after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The fact is business as usual -- public demonstrations
continued, the handover did not affect policing and there was no
exodus of senior officers from the police force, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, only 156 officers left the police force, and the vast
majority of expatriate officers remained committed to Hong Kong
and the force.
</P>
<P>
The Commissioner noted that the overall crime rate for 1997
continued to drop to hit the lowest in 24 years. In 1997, the
overall number of crimes recorded dropped by 15 percent from the
previous year, with a marked decrease in burglaries and robberies.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Sharply Down on Asia, Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar slumped to a
12-year low Wednesday, pushed lower by selling by Asian traders,
with the softer gold bullion price also weighing on the currency.
</P>
<P>
After diving through the 63 U.S. cent mark in early European
trade, the local currency was trading at 62.90 U.S. cents
Wednesday, from 63.56 U.S. cents at Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar traded in a narrow band of 63.15 to 63.35
U.S. cents for most of the local session before falling further in
early European trading.
</P>
<P>
Stuart Moore, foreign exchange manager with St. George Bank,
said the Australian dollar was driven lower by weak Asian
currencies and a fall in the price of gold.
</P>
<P>
In New York, COMEX gold for current delivery closed at 298.9
U.S. dollars per ounce, down 2.3 U.S. dollars from the previous
COMEX close.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen weakened in offshore trading Tuesday night,
contributing to the sell-off of the Australian dollar, but had
strengthened slightly during local trade.
</P>
<P>
Moore said the surplus of 1.7 billion U.S. dollars unveiled
Tuesday night in the Australian federal budget for 1998-1999 had
initially seen the Australian dollar rally a little.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't until later when New York walked back in that they
sold it back off again.
</P>
<P>
"So the budget really didn't have a big impact on it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also at the close, the Australian dollar was at 84.63 Japanese
yen, from 84.65 yen Tuesday, and at 1.1218 Deutsche marks from
1.1298 marks.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges Press not to Incite World Cup Hate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- British newspapers were urged on
Wednesday not to incite violence or disorder during the World Cup
in France next month.
</P>
<P>
In a statement sent to all newspaper editors, Britain's press
watchdog Press Complaints Commission Chairman Lord Wakeham said
robust reporting of the competition was desired, but incitement of
violence was not.
</P>
<P>
"What we don't want is there to be -- perhaps by accident --
incitement to violence, incitement to disorder (which would) put
the fans at risk and put the players at risk," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We're just reminding newspaper editors to be extremely careful
about this... self-regulation requires them to exercise a proper
degree of restraint," he added.
</P>
<P>
British newspapers have mounted attacks on the way ticket
allocations were handled, accusing the French of grabbing the vast
majority of seats.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the tabloid Daily Star was criticized for
attacks on the sharing of tickets for the tournament under the
headline "Frogs need a good kicking."
</P>
<P>
But Wakeham added he was sure most newspapers wanted to report
fairly on the World Cup tournament and take pride in the English
and Scottish teams which have qualified for the cup's finals.

<HEADLINE> US Withdraws Support for Mozambique's Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States will withdraw its
support for the local elections scheduled to be held in 33 cities
and towns in Mozambique, the U.S. embassy in Maputo has
announced.
</P>
<P>
The press release issued here Tuesday by the U.S. embassy here
said the U.S. government regretted that most of the opposition
parties including the largest Mozambican National Resistance
(RENAMO) had boycotted the elections, the Noticias newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United States felt regret that the demands of the
opposition for fairness and transparency received no response
from the government and the series of legislations on polls
passed by parliament last year, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the U.S. decided not to provide
support for the elections in Mozambique any longer, it said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government believes that what is important for the
democratic process in the southern African nation is that any
individual or political party should not violate or deprive the
voting rights of the citizens, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The release said any kind of local elections which lack
maximum participation of citizens with different political views
would damage the international image of Mozambique and represent
a setback in the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government called on the Mozambican government and
the opposition parties to work together for a consensus on the
basis of flexibility and compromise when they begin to draft and
pass new laws concerning the general election in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the position of the United States, Mozambican
Minister of State Administration Alfredo Gamito said Tuesday
night that the withdrawal of the U.S. support will have no impact
on the elections because his government has made all
organizational and financial preparations in a bid to hold the
elections as scheduled.

<HEADLINE> G-15 Calls for World Attention on Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 15 (G-15) Wednesday
called on the international community to address pressing problems
facing developing countries, particularly the poorest in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The call was made in a joint communique issued at the end of
the three-day G-15 summit here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The summit was chaired by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
attended, among other leaders, by presidents of Indonesia, Kenya,
Algeria, Zimbabwe and Senegal.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the leaders discussed how to boost
South-South cooperation and South-North dialog, believing such
cooperation will help avoid future financial crises like the one
in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The leaders called for an appropriate global response to deal
with both the financial crisis in Southeast Asia and the
strengthening of regional and international cooperation in
managing such crises in the future.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that "it is imperative that in facing the
current crisis, the attention of the international community is
not diverted from pressing problems facing developing countries
and least developed countries in particular, the majority of which
are in Africa."
</P>
<P>
It noted that "the financial crisis in East and Southeast Asia
is not an isolated or an unprecedented phenomenon. Financial
crises have been occurring with greater frequency in both
developed and developing countries with severe impact on growth,
employment and development."
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the leaders realized the need for
continued consultation and cooperation among developing countries
in exchanging experiences on dealing with the implications of the
financial crisis and avoiding future ones.
</P>
<P>
"There is also a need for greater dialog between the developed
and developing countries on a systematic basis to address the
challenges posed by the rapidly integrating financial markets and
expanding international capital flows," it added.
</P>
<P>
The next G-15 summit will be held in Jamaica next year.
</P>
<P>
As a grouping of developing countries from Latin America,
Africa and Asia, the G-15 was founded in 1989 with the aim of
promoting economic and trade cooperation among the member states
and boosting cooperation among developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The 16 members of the group are Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico,
Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Garment Export Surging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's apparel exports grew
11.3 percent to 830 million U.S. dollars in the first three months
of this year, the first quarterly rise since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The growth, the Korean International Trade Association said
Wednesday, is expected to last through the year as orders from
Hong Kong and Russia are 50 percent higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
The association attributed the growth mainly to aggressive
efforts by local manufactures to make up losses at the home market
and lower price of clothing brought by the devalued won.
</P>
<P>
The three months also saw a brisker garment export to the
United States, which had reduced its quota of imports from China.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's garment export kept a double-digit rise before
the 1990s and accounted for 14 percent of the nation's exports.
In 1989, it sold 8.7 billion dollars worth of clothes overseas.
</P>
<P>
However, since then, South Korean-made clothes have been slowly
elbowed out of the international market by other Asian countries,
which are able to provide apparel of cheaper and better quality.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the country's garment export was down to 3.9 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Over 9,000 Crows Killed by Dar Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Dar es Salaam has launched a
massive campaign to kill disagreeable Indian crows, The Guardian
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since February, more than 9,000 Indian crows have been trapped
and killed in the city, the newspaper quoted an official of the
Wildlife Conservation Society of Tanzania (WCST) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The WCST Conservation Officer, Paul Nyiti, said with the aid
of the Canadian Fund for Local Initiative, people have used
special traps made of wire mesh and timber to kill the crows.
Each trap is able to catch 40 to 50 crows.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the harm done by the crows, Nyiti said that the
crows have stolen people's food and valuable items such as golden
chains.
</P>
<P>
People are also worried about the spread of rubbish by the
crows which cause transmission of diseases. They also complained
about the noise made by the crows.
</P>
<P>
He said that the crows are not only aggressive predators to
domestic poultry but also to native bird species while the crows
themselves have no natural enemy.
</P>
<P>
Nyiti said the crows originated from Asia and were introduced
in the Zanzibar isles one century ago. They were brought to Dar
es Salaam around 1955 by unknown people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a crow control team has appealed to residents
living close to the trap sites to contribute scrap food as bait.

<HEADLINE> Pak Trade Deficit Declines Drastically in 10 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's trade deficit has
declined drastically by 1.57 billion U.S. dollars in the first ten
months of the 1997-98 fiscal year (July 1-June 30) compared to the
same period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar told the reporters here Wednesday
that the decline in trade deficit is "unprecedented in the history
of the country."
</P>
<P>
The government had set the target to reduce the trade deficit
by one billion dollars in the whole 1997-98 fiscal year, but the
deficit squeezed by 1.57 billion dollars in just ten months which
is beyond the target, Dar said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said, the biggest menace facing Pakistan's economy
was the balance of payment problem and the trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's overall deficit in 1996-97 fiscal year was 4.4
billion dollars, out of which the trade deficit was 3.57 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit in 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96 was 1.76
billion dollars, 2.25 billion dollars and 3.1 billion dollars
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Dar said that Pakistan's export increased by 16 percent in
rupee terms during the first 10 months of the current fiscal year
to have reached a volume of 306 billion rupees (6.97 billion U.S.
dollars) compared to the same period of the last fiscal year which
were 264 billion rupees (six billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistan's import in the same period remained at 376
billion rupees (8.54 billion dollars), showing a reduction of 3.8
percent compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said Pakistan's economy started to show signs of
up-turn in the first ten months of the 1997-98 fiscal year, owing
to the economic reform packages initiated by the present
government.

<HEADLINE> Rural Social Security Computer System Being Tried out in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China began experimenting with a
rural social security computer system recently, sponsored by the
Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs and the U.S.'s John Hancock
Mutual Life Insurance Company, for the purpose of setting up a
nationwide rural social security computer network.
</P>
<P>
It is being tried in the cities of Dalian in northeastern
Liaoning Province, and Yantai and Laizhou in east China's Shandong
Province.
</P>
<P>
The system will play an important role in developing rural
social security management, and in improving information
exchanges, a civil affairs ministry official said. It can also
provide help in establishing a nationwide management system in the
future.
</P>
<P>
John Hancock is one of the largest life insurers in the world,
with representative offices in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The company will invite officials from the People's Bank of
China, the State Development Planning Commission, and the Ministry
of Finance for a study tour in the United States this September,
so that these officials will be given a look at the life insurance
and pension system in the United States.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak reiterated on
Tuesday that in the peace process, his party will not cross "a set

</P>
<P>
Yedeot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Netanyahu has invited National Infrastructure Minister Ariel
Sharon to attend the talks with Albright on Wednesday. But he was
rebuffed by Sharon. The main reason given by Sharon for his
refusal was that Netanyahu allegedly made commitments to the
U.S. proposal of a 13 percent redeployment of Israeli troops in
the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> 4 Bidders Picked for Uganda Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Four companies have been chosen by
Uganda's Privatization Unit (PU) to bid for the purchase of a big
portion of shares in Uganda Airlines.
</P>
<P>
They are British Airways, Sabena Airways, Air Mauritius,
Alliance Air/South African Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Micheal Opagi, the PU director, said strict criteria would
be applied to select a strategic investor and that the
divestiture program of the parastatal is expected to be completed
by September.
</P>
<P>
The selling of the airline was fiercely protested by the
airlines staff as most of them would be laid off as a result of
the sale. They vented out complaints in spite of promised
terminal benefits.
</P>
<P>
Opagi warned that personal grudges should not interfere with
the divestiture process of the airline, adding that the
government is looking for a competent investor who will be able
to develop Entebbe into a regional air transport hub.
</P>
<P>
Uganda Airlines is based in Entebbe, 45 km south of Kampala,
and has more than three hundred staff members and two planes. It
has performed badly due to economic problems and shrinking market
share caused by coming of powerful foreign competitors.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Officials Discuss Land Use Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature today
organized a discussion of amendments to the Land-Use Law by
officials from the State Development Planning Commission, Ministry
of Land and Natural Resources, Ministry of Agriculture, and other
offices.
</P>
<P>
The chairmen of relevant special committees of the National
People's Congress (NPC) also attended the discussion.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee decided earlier this month to
publish the amendments, which will have a direct effect on all
Chinese, and solicit opinions from the public.
</P>
<P>
The amendments emphasize farmland protection, said Qu Geping
and Wang Chaowen, who are members of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Huaixi, who is a member of the NPC Standing Committee,
suggested that the revised law should set a minimal level for per
capita farmland in China, in accordance with international
practices.
</P>
<P>
The 71-article draft deals with protection of farmland
resources and prevents farmland from being used for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
China adopted a land-use law in 1986, but the existing law is
considered unsuitable for a market economy.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee unanimously approved the public
discussion of the amendments and Chinese citizens can express their
opinions through certain government offices.

<HEADLINE> Financial Sector Plays Significant Role in Economic Growth (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Analysts say that the central government measures to stimulate
the economy allow ample room for the financial sector and demand
much of it. It will continue an appropriately tight monetary
policy and make minor adjustments when needed, and increase the
money supply to ensure sufficient credit for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
This January, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) published a
series of reform measures, including lifting the ceiling on
commercial bank loans, changing the deposit reserve system, and
lowering interest rates. These measures improved the commercial
banks' loan strength and helped divert funds to new economic
growth areas.
</P>
<P>
Under the central bank policies, the four state-owned
commercial banks and three policy banks announced their expanded
credit plans in April. The Construction Bank said it will channel
100 billion yuan into state-backed key development areas, and the
Industrial and Commercial Bank will put a large part of its 200
billion yuan in new loans into these areas. In addition, the PBOC
is continuing the financial opening up to attract more foreign
capital.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say China is undergoing a transition from a planned
to a market economy, the success of which is critical for
reaching its growth target, and the financial sector plays a
decisive role in this. No reforms, from state enterprise to
employment, can do without the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
As the commercialization of state-owned banks progresses, the
financial sector will put profit in first place and make an effort
to improve credit quality and cut the number of unperforming
loans, a move that will help adjust the industrial structure,
prevent construction duplication, and lead economic development in
a healthy direction.

<HEADLINE> Japan Reports Sharp Rise in 1997 Trade Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's trade surplus in fiscal 1997,
which ended March 31, rose for the first time in five years to
13,613.9 billion yen (about 102.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The surplus, due to an increase in exports and a slowdown in
imports, was up 55 percent from that of the previous year, said
the Finance Ministry Wednesday in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Boosted by the weakness of yen and strong overseas demands,
exports advanced by 11.3 percent, the first double-digit rise in
eight years, to 49,893.0 billion yen (375.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In contrast, said the report, Japan's imports slowed with a
slight year-on-year increase of 0.6 percent to 36,279.1 billion
yen (272.8 billion dollars), because of the weak domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Of the overall favorable balance, the surplus in goods and
services trade in fiscal 1997 totaled 7,340.9 billion yen (55.2
billion dollars), nearly four times that in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Growing Fast in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The private sector in south China
economic powerhouse of Guangdong Province has maintained an
average annual rise of some 20 percent in the past few years, and
is contributing more to local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
By last year, the province had more than 1.53 million
privately-run pop- and -mom shops and larger-scale businesses,
with 126.3 billion yuan in registered capital, and employing 4.2
million people. The sector turned in 7.1 billion yuan in taxes in
1997.
</P>
<P>
After decade-long extensive operations, most of the private
businesses are making new efforts to further improve management
and turn to the modern enterprise system. As a result, 70 percent
of the sector has been transformed into limited companies.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of the private businesses are involved in the
service sector. However, some have begun to try in other areas,
such as industry, agriculture, financial information services,
hotel management, foreign trade, and hi-tech products.
</P>
<P>
The province now has more than 3,000 science- and
-technology-intensive private enterprises, and those in this
capital developed 400-odd new technologies and products, 32 of
which were given the state patents.
</P>
<P>
Xie Yongxing started with only 3,000 yuan (361 US dollars) in
Xuwen County in 1985. But now he owns a pearl company, which has
some 1,000 workers, and produces over 600 million yuan (72.3
million US dollars) in annual output value as well as more than 20
million US dollars of exports.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the private sector also serves as a major channel to
ease unemployment pressure. Statistics show that the number of
laid-off workers in the province amounted to about 500,000, and
half of them have found new jobs, mostly in private businesses.

<HEADLINE> More Tibetans Use New Types of Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Liquefied petroleum gas, solar cooker
and electric stove are becoming a new vogue of consumption among
residents in the Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
At present, eighty percent of urban households in Tibet use
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) instead of the traditional fuel like
coal and dry cow dung, according to the LPG sales company in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Baibar, a resident in the old city area of Lhasa, capital of
Tibet, was very satisfied with the gas cooker his family installed
recently. He said coal and dry cow dung he used previously for
cooking are quite inconvenient and give off too much fume.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980, the central government has increased financial
aid to the economic construction in Tibet. The Yamzho Yumco
Hydro-electric power station with a total installed capacity of
90,000 kw was completed last year, basically putting an end of
electricity shortage in areas near Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tibet developed a type of small solar energy stove
for families and a large amount of bottled liquefied petroleum gas
and kerosene was shipped from the inland areas.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Minister on Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Finance Minister Herbert
Murerwa has said that government's macro-economic stabilization
program and the sustainability of economic reforms face a crucial
test.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister presented a 17-point ministerial policy
statement to parliament Tuesday on the Zimbabwe Program for
Economic and Social Transformation (1996/2000), the daily Herald
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of failure to meet the primary requirement for
macro-economic stability, fiscal balance and a sluggish response
by the productive sectors to the reforms," Murerwa said,"economic
growth only averaged 1.7 percent per annum during the first phase
of reforms (1991/95) against a target of five percent and a
population growth rate of three percent."
</P>
<P>
He said the combined effects of recurrent droughts, high
interests, high inflation, global recession, tight monetary
policies and delays in implementing public sector reforms slowed
down investment, drastically eroded real incomes and consumption
and overshadowed the important progress that had been made in
other areas.
</P>
<P>
But despite these problems, said Murerwa, the reforms had
ushered in a flexible framework for adjustable and progressive
reforms of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The minister explained that the basic philosophy guiding the
new reforms is to achieve a sustained high rate of economic
growth and speedy development in order to raise the incomes and
living standards of the people and expand productive employment
of rural peasants and urban workers.
</P>
<P>
The experiences in the last quarter of 1997, he said, have
underlined the need to urgently restore macro-economic stability,
high growth rate, low inflation and interest rates and a stable
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there is need to facilitate the public and
private savings and investment needed to attain growth.

<HEADLINE> Financial Sector Playing Important Role in China's Economic Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The latest report on China's
macro-economic condition from the State Development and Planning
Commission shows that financial policies are already having an
effect on economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The report says that, in the first quarter, banks increased
loans, many new construction projects started, real estate
investment began to recover, and housing sales were up 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
After the Chinese government set an economic growth target of 8
percent at the beginning of the year, the financial sector began a
new round of reforms, improved controls, and adjusted its
allocation of credit.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that these measures will have an effect in the
third quarter, along with other efforts designed to stimulate
consumer demand, and the slowing growth is expected to be under
control in the second half.
</P>
<P>
The economy has had a "soft landing" in the past few years, but
it also faces a serious challenge from the continued decline in
growth.
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Asian financial crisis has inevitably had a
negative effect on China's exports, one of the major sources of
economic strength, so the central government has designated a
number of new areas for support, to stimulate the economy by
increasing consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure, high-tech industries, technology improvements,
housing construction, and other sectors have been included in the
support list, with the hope that their contribution to the economy
will help the country reach its goal.

BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Qian Qichen, in a
meeting with an Angolese delegation today, said that the Chinese
government supports the African national liberation movement and
appreciates the role Angola played in the continent's liberation
movement, especially its decolonization.
</P>
<P>
He told the group, which is led by Pedro Neto, Angola's
minister of social communications, that China is grateful for
Angola's support of China in international affairs, and that the
Chinese government supports cooperation between the Chinese press
and publishers with Angolan departments. The voice of developing
countries should be heard louder and stronger in the international
community, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian also recalled his Angolan visit in 1989 and discussed
China's reforms and opening up.
</P>
<P>
Neto said that the two countries have had frequent contacts in
recent years and that he hopes to strengthen the cooperation in
information exchange.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Angolan government adheres to the "one China"
policy and hopes to continue cooperating with China in areas like
human rights.
</P>
<P>
Neto and his party are here at the invitation of China's Press
and Publication Administration.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Services Remain Poor in W. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Telecommunications services in west
Africa have remained the most inefficient in the world despite
huge expenses.
</P>
<P>
Countries in the sub-region spend more than three billion U.S.
Dollars yearly to import telecommunication equipment but the
input has not produced cheerful results, according to Nigerian
Minister of Science and Technology Maj.-Gen. Sam Momah.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the need for genuine technological and industrial
revolution of the telecommunication industry must be underscored
in the sub-region, the minister said, quoted by the Post Express
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister admitted that the task of technological and
industrial breakthrough was "arduous and capital intensive". But
he did not mention what measures should be taken in this effect.
</P>
<P>
Earlier communications Minister Maj.-Gen. Patrick Aziza said
Nigeria needed six billion Dollars to increase its telephone
accessibility from 0.46 lines per 100 people to one for every 100
people as prescribed by the International Telecommunications
Union.
</P>
<P>
For Africa as a whole, a minimum of 20 million lines will be
installed by the turn of this century, according to the Africa
Telecom '98 which just concluded in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
This will leave more work for African countries to do to meet
the target.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- City officials from Gothenburg,
Sweden, met with Beijing officials today at a seminar to discuss
urban traffic and environment problems, something that Beijing
needs to learn more about.
</P>
<P>
Anders Sundstrom, Sweden's Minister of Industry, who is in
China on an official visit, presided over the opening ceremony of
the two-day seminar. It is being attended by Swedish officials and
members of the Volvo Group, a natural gas motor vehicle
manufacturer, and Chinese officials and scientists.
</P>
<P>
The Gothenburg representatives brought with them a bus, a car
and a dumptruck that run on natural gas and gave their Chinese
hosts a demonstration ride in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is interested in introducing natural gas motor vehicles
to reduce air pollution. Last year, the city ruled that motor
vehicles must use lead-free gasoline.
</P>
<P>
China is becoming increasingly aware of the use of natural gas
and other fuels to replace gasoline. Chongqing, once one of the
worst polluted cities in China, is a pioneer in the use of natural
gas vehicles. The city plans to have all of its buses and tax cabs
running on natural gas in future.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Fuyang, an agriculture-oriented city
in east China's Anhui Province, has completed a World
Bank-credited project on improving agricultural facilities.
</P>
<P>
A WB official said, after his inspection tour of the project,
that Fuyang people's effort along with World Bank's capital
assistance has resulted in satisfactary achievements.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, 140,000 ha. of medium and low yielding land
or 13 percent of the total farmland in the city have been upgraded
to double the per unit yield of grain and cash crops, which means
more than four time the farmers' capita income.
</P>
<P>
Total investment for the project approximates 800 million yuan
(96 million U.S. dollars) with 44.58 million U.S. dollars of WB
loans and the rest channeled by the city government.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the fund was spent on building an irrigation
and drainage network for improving the circulation of irrigation
water. This includes building or renovating 28 pumping stations,
1,185 draining stations and 100 km-long leaking-proof ditches in
addition to digging 6,415 wells and excavating 36.8 million
cu.m. of earth.
</P>
<P>
Another priority has been given to building shelter-forest
belt. With the project funding, the forest coverage of the city
has grown from 10.5 percent before the launching of the project to
the present 17.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of agro hi-tech during the period has also
contributed to improved soil quality, with which the city has set
up 10 high-yield production bases.
</P>
<P>
Fuyang is the largest agricultural city in this major grain
production province in east China with 12 million people engaged
in farming and its farmland acreage accounting for one percent of
the country's total amount.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Cuts Spending When Oil Prices Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait, a leading oil producer,
will cut its expenditure to keep budget deficit from running out
of control under the impact of the plunge of world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government and parliament reached an agreement on
the expenditure cut following an eight-hour marathon parliamentary
debate Tuesday night
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the closed-door session to discuss the
country's economy, Kuwaiti Finance Minister Sheikh Ali Salem
Al-Ali Al-Sabah said most members of the parliament and the
government turned down the idea of imposing increased charges on
public services during the 1998-99 fiscal year starting July 1,
and chose to axe expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The government will submit a detailed report to the parliament
in one month including its proposals on restructuring the economy
as a whole, he said, whose remarks were carried on all major
newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts have said the impact of the low oil prices
since the start of this year on Kuwait's forthcoming budget will
be severe.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government late last month projected a 1.73 billion
Kuwaiti Dinars (5.7 billion U.S. dollars) deficit for the 1998-99
fiscal year for the oil-depending Gulf state which exports 3.5
percent of the world oil demand.
</P>
<P>
In mid-April, the 1998-99 budget, which is based on an oil
price of 12 dollars a barrel, was approved. It forecasts a deficit
of 5.6 billion dollars, the highest deficit since the Gulf War in
1991 and 41 percent higher than 1997-98 budgeted deficit.
</P>
<P>
Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah warned that Kuwait
could face an "economic catastrophe" if Kuwaiti crudes remained at
10.5 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The government and parliament also agreed last night to entrust
parliament's Finance and Economic Committee with reviewing budget
projections for the fiscal year in a bid to cut spending.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the finance minister also briefed the parliament
about the condition of the country's reserves and Future
Generations Fund.
</P>
<P>
According to independent sources, Kuwaiti state reserves are
at around 19.14 billion dollars and the Future Generation Fund at
39.6 billion dollars. Returns of investments abroad climbed to 4
billion dollars in 1997 from 2.5 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The parliament held the first secret session on May 2 to
discuss the financial situation. After the meeting, Kuwaiti
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs
Nasser Abdullah Al-Roudhan said the government wanted to
"diversify revenue (sources), reduce public expenditures and
improve the management of public funds in response to fall in oil
prices."

<HEADLINE> Malawian Education System in Shambles: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Malawi's education system is in
shambles, rocked by massive examination failures, widespread
cheating, selling of examination forms, drug abuse and student
indiscipline, Zambia Daily Mail reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, the 1996/97 school year
produced the worst recorded results ever. Out of 28,328
candidates who sat for university entry Malawi school leaving
certificate examinations (MSCE), 20,000 failed.
</P>
<P>
At least 6,000 of these candidates were disqualified for
cheating.
</P>
<P>
The Malawi National Examinations Board (MANEB) says there was
cheating in most examination centers. Candidates brought
reference materials to examination rooms, forcing the ministry
of education to nullify results in 24 schools before marking
started.
</P>
<P>
MANEB Executive Secretary Catherine Chimwenje says that
candidates were able to get hold of examination papers before the
examinations were held, but denies to say who should be
responsible for leaking them.
</P>
<P>
Many young people are abusing drugs and alcohol, and more are
experimenting with sex, says the ministry of social services.
</P>
<P>
Some young people, saying they are free to do as they please,
defy established authority. Pupils who are supposed to be in
school can be found in night clubs.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education Brown Mpinganjira says the government
would like parents to become involved in the moulding of
children's characters. "We want teachers to take care of these
pupils and parents the behavior," he says.
</P>
<P>
Fed up with indiscipline, unwarranted dismissals and poor
examination results, guardians with government's blessing, have
formed the Malawi Parents Union (MPU) which will work closely
with schools.
</P>
<P>
"Parents and guardians should equally share the blame for
ignoring and neglecting their role to teach children good
manners," says MPU's coordinator James Chapna.

<HEADLINE> Weed Threatens to Choke Kariba Lake in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Tourism operators in Siavonga along
Kariba lake in Zambia have urged the government to help them get
rid of the hyacinth, which is threatening to choke Kariba harbor
and distort its beauty and marine life.
</P>
<P>
The weed drifts daily in chunks as long as 50 meters from the
Zimbabwean side of the Kariba dam, Zambia Daily Mail reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The national newspaper quoted Manchinchi Bay Manager Jeremy
Lousada as saying that they are forced to spend hundreds of
thousands of Kwacha every month to keep the harbor clear and
attractive.
</P>
<P>
"We need a lasting solution because the weed drifts in
everyday. It is expensive to hire workers. The government should
help us keep tourism in Siavonga on its feet," he said.
</P>
<P>
The weed depletes oxygen for marine life and use of herbicides
though effective, could be fatal for aqua life forms.
</P>
<P>
Manchinchi bay spends about 200,000 Kwacha (about 100 U.S.
Dollars) per month to keep the harbor from being choked by the
weed.
</P>
<P>
Workers removing the weed at the bay complained that the work
is strenuous. They also fear that crocodiles are now getting
nearer to the harbor to prey on them as they clear the weed.
</P>
<P>
Lousada has commended Siavonga local authority for agreeing to
crop the crocodiles.

diplomatic discussions going on to see how this can be worked
out."
</P>
<P>
However, the source said it seems that the Zambian government
will succeed in turning what appears to be Mandela's "private"
visit to Kaunda into a "state" one. And it will be very
difficult for Mandela to completely turn down the Zambian
government's request.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday here with The Post, Walter Thabethe,
South African High Commissioner to Zambia, confirmed that Mandela
will be visiting Zambia sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mandela is "definitely" coming to Zambia next
week, but the date is unknown.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, an old friend of Kaunda, is one of the southern
African presidents who called for the release of Kaunda, leader
of Zambia's largest opposition party -- the United National
Independence Party (UNIP).
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, 74, who led Zambia to independence from Britain in
1964 and ruled the country for 27 years, was arrested last
December in connection with the foiled military coup on October
28, 1997 on grounds that he had conspired with others to
overthrow the elected government.
</P>
<P>
On February 12, Kaunda was formally charged with misprision of
treason.

<HEADLINE> Arab Man Stabbed to Death in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) - An Arab man was stabbed to death
in a northern Jerusalem neighborhood Wednesday morning by a
suspected Jewish extremist, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place on the corner of Hanavim and Shivtel
Israel streets in the Bet Israel neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Large forces of Israeli police were deployed in the area to
search for the assailant believed to be Jewish, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The incident was the sixth stabbing of Arabs in the same area
in the past months.
</P>
<P>
Police said that they believed the series of attacks were
carried out by the same man out of nationalistic motivation.
</P>
<P>
They suspected the assailant was also responsible for setting
up explosive devices outside the apartment rented by three Arab
students in the nearby Mea Shearim neighborhood for a few months.
</P>
<P>
There has been a surge of terror attacks by both Jewish and
Arab extremists in Jerusalem at a time when the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process is deeply deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
A Jewish religious student was stabbed to death by suspected
Arab extremist in East Jerusalem last Wednesday. In another
similar attack last February, a 30-year-old Jewish student was
killed on his way to a synagogue also in East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firm Unveils New Digital Copiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Xerox Corp., of the United
States, unveiled Tuesday a pair of new digital copiers that are
25-30 percent cheaper than comparable old-style copiers.
</P>
<P>
Initial list prices, as quoted by the company, are 2,095
U.S. dollars for Xerox 212, a 12-page-per-minute model, and 2,550
dollars for Xerox 214, a 14-page-per-minute version.
</P>
<P>
Xerox "is breaking some ground" by bringing out a digital
machine less expensive than competing analog ones, said industry
consultant Barry Tepper with CAP Ventures Inc.
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Tepper said, digital copiers were 50-80
percent more expensive than their analog competitors.
</P>
<P>
Xerox drove down production costs for the machines by using
premanufactured kits from four outside suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Digital equipment now makes up nearly 40 percent of Xerox's 18
billion dollars revenues.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Remains Tough on LRA Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has said the government will maintain its hard-line policy of
fighting fire with fire when dealing with the rebels of the
Lord's Resistance Army (LRA).
</P>
<P>
The president Tuesday told the faithful in the northern
rebel-infested district of Gulu that both military and peaceful
means would be explored to end the 12-year-old northern
rebellion, local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni said: "We shall pursue both peace and
pressure on the bad people and have that combination: peace and
hash ways. Everybody can struggle."
</P>
<P>
"Our Ugandan experience over the years is that bad people
cannot voluntarily give up their bad ways unless put under
pressure," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The LRA is a rebel group operating in the northern districts
of Kitgum and Gulu. It had 2,000 fighters in previous years and
only hundreds of remnants are left in its ranks now. The rebels
abducted local residents and looted their properties, posing a
major threat to the security in northern Uganda.

<HEADLINE> China's Trade With Asia This Year To Match Last Year's Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official says
that China's trade with Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and
ASEAN nations this year is expected to be worth at least 109.8
billion US dollars, matching last year's figure, although
first-quarter statistics show some problems in that trade.
</P>
<P>
The director of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation's Asian Affairs Department, Hu Guocai,
attributes these to Japan's sluggish economic situation and the
impact of the Asian financial crisis on the ROK and ASEAN nations.
</P>
<P>
But, he says, the most difficult period has passed and the
prospects are still bright. He expects exports to these countries
this year to drop and imports from them to rise by a large margin,
meaning that total trade this year will be no less than for last
year.
</P>
<P>
He says that Japan is China's biggest trade partner and the ROK
is fourth, while Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are
among China's top 20. Export to Japan, the ROK, and nine ASEAN
nations in the first quarter were down and exports to the ROK down
by as much as 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
China is concerned about these countries and has tried to
assist them, he says, and the government will encourage more
flexible means of trade between enterprises to expand bilateral
trade.
</P>
<P>
China's total trade with Japan, the ROK and the nine ASEAN
nations in the first quarter was worth 22 billion US dollars, up
6.9 percent from the same period of last year. Exports to these
countries were worth 10.2 billion US dollars, a decrease of 6.4
percent, and imports from them were worth 11.9 billion US dollars,
an increase of 5.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Academics Say Laws Are Needed to Protect Rare Fossils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A group of 74 academics from the
Chinese Academy of Sciences have appealed to government
departments to provide greater legal protection of fossils here to
prevent improper excavations.
</P>
<P>
China boasts a large number of fossils, many of which are rare
specimens that could help the study of the evolution of the earth
and living things, said Yang Zunyi, a member of the group.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that there are many problems in the study of
fossils in China that have had a bad effect on the search for and
protection and study of rare fossils.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of fossilized dinosaur eggs found in Xixia in Henan
Province have been smuggled abroad, Yang said, and one exhibition,
sponsored by the Cambridge University museum, had more than 20
fossilized dinosaur eggs on display, which had been taken from
China. One, which contained an embryo, was the most perfect
example of its kind in the world. There is nothing similar in
China.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 rare bird fossils from the Mesozoic period, which
were unearthed in north east China's Liaoning Province, have
appeared in markets overseas and this situation needs to be
addressed, Yang noted.
</P>
<P>
He and other CAS academics have suggested that the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC) improve the law on rare fossils
and designate certain departments and research institutes to
handle digging permits for rare fossils.
</P>
<P>
They also suggest that the Ministry of Science and Technology
set up a committee for the protection of rare fossils to be
responsible for planning and coordinating fossil searches by
various organizations.
</P>
<P>
In this way, China can improve researches on fossils and
improve its status internationally, the academic said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Improve Hygienic Conditions in Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has stepped
up its efforts to improve hygienic conditions in fishing
processing firms and the beaches in compliance with the European
Union (EU) requirements.
</P>
<P>
Major campaigns had been launched along the beaches of Lake
Victoria to improve handling of fish, the East African Standard
Wednesday quoted George Otieno, Nyanza Provincial Public Health
Officer, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen cooperative societies have agreed to build enough
latrines at the beaches to meet one of the EU conditions,
according to the health officer.
</P>
<P>
He noted that other conditions like having piped water at the
beaches and required temperature in processing plants were being
addressed.
</P>
<P>
A task force comprising fishermen, fishery and public health
officials, and fish processors was set up to oversee the
campaigns, he said, adding that the task force would soon visit
fish processing plants to assess their hygienic conditions.
</P>
<P>
EU imposed a ban on import of fresh fish from Mozambique,
Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya early this year on the pretext of
their failure to meet health standards set by the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU requires Kenyan fish exporters and processors to
harmonize fish inspection standards by June this year, which
covers capture, killing, handling and packaging.
</P>
<P>
All fish products must be analyzed and examined by an
accredited laboratory prior to export to the EU market, according
to EU requirements.

LOS ANGELES, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Jim Gilmore, governor of the
state of Virginia, called Tuesday for a national conference next
month on a proposed tobacco legislation in U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
The legislation proposed by Sen. John McCain, a Republican

</P>
<P>
Under the bill, a 516-billion-dollar settlement would replace
the 368-billion-dollar deal reached last June to settle 40 state
lawsuits seeking coverage of tobacco-related health care costs.
</P>
<P>
"We need to join together to send a clear message to Congress
that we are united in opposition to these measures," Gilmore said
in a letter to the state chapter of America's largest union group.
</P>
<P>
He also asked labor leaders nationwide to help organize the
June meeting, to be focused on preventing underage smoking and
protecting families whose livelihood depends on tobacco.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Calls for Better Agricultural Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Agriculture Minister
Musalia Mudavadi has called for better agricultural performance
to speed up overall economic growth in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has already taken policies aimed at
enhancing the performance of the agricultural sector as the
engine of economic growth, the Daily Nation newspaper Wednesday
quoted the agriculture minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting on "Strategies for Raising Productivity
in Agriculture" on Tuesday, Mudavadi noted that agricultural
growth is a prerequisite for industrial and overall economic
growth in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Given our current state of economic depression and widespread
poverty, any measure that spurs economic growth and reduction of
poverty is most desirable," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that all the agricultural subsectors, with
the exception of tea and horticulture, have been recording a
steady decline due to poor planning and ineffective
implementation of government policies.
</P>
<P>
While agricultural performance has fluctuated over the years,
particularly since the beginning of the 1990s, population growth
has maintained an upward trend, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current situation implied there was a
deterioration of food security and increased poverty. To avoid
this situation, the minister called for doubled efforts for the
Kenyans to ensure sustained agricutural growth.

<HEADLINE> PNA Asks Israelis to Stay out During Mass March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has asked Israelis to keep away from its
territories starting Wednesday, to prevent possible trouble during
or before a massive march there on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
PNA officials have told their Israeli counterparts not to
allow Israelis, even peace groups, to enter PNA territories,
warning of possible attack by radical Palestinians on them, a
senior PNA official told Xinhua on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA will organize a massive march on Thursday in Gaza
Strip and the West Bank to mark the 50th anniversary of "Nakba"
(catastrophe), or the 50th anniversary of the state of Israel, on
the secular calendar.
</P>
<P>
The march, which is expected to attract about 1 million people,
comes as PNA officials and legislators are expressing concern that
the breakdown of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks will result
in violence in the territories.
</P>
<P>
The marchers will be well-organized, but the PNA can not rule
out the possibility that the demonstrations could turn into
violent anti-Israeli protests, said the official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The PNA's request also comes as Israeli defense officials
predict that the massive march would result in violent Palestinian
clashes with the Israeli Defense Forces if the demonstrations run
out of control.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians regarded the founding of the state of Israel 50
years ago was a disaster for them, because millions of
Palestinians were forced to leave their homeland and turned into
refugees.

MANILA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Four persons died and one female

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Four palestinians were killed and 22
others wounded early Wednesday morning in eastern Lebanese
province of Bekaa in an Israeli air raid, Lebanon's NAN radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The heavy casualties were caused when Israeli airplanes
blasted positions of Palestinian Fatah Movement and Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestinian-General Command in Diera Taniye
area, central part of Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
Following the attack, the radio said, the wounded, one
seriously, were rushed to nearby hospitals.
</P>
<P>
It is unknown why Israeli troops launched the attack on
Palestinians, who are now living as refugees in Lebanon, after
Israeli soldiers were wounded by Katyusha attacks launched by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah fired Katyusha missiles onto Israeli territory on
Monday night, wounding two Israeli soldiers in its northern area
of Galilee. This is the first casualties of Israelis on Israeli
territory in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel occupied a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon in 1985, Lebanon's resistance, spearheaded by
Hezbollah, has been engaged in a guerrilla war trying to drive the
2,000 Israeli occupying troops from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Athletes Should Have More Competitions, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, Southwest China, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese
athletics chief said here on Thursday that Chinese athletes should
cut their training time short to expose themselves more in
international competitions.
</P>
<P>
Lou Dapeng, president of the Chinese Athletics Association and
executive memter of the world athletics ruling body IAAF, said
that both athletes and coaches had to change their traditional
concept that hard training was sure to lead to better results in
competitions.
</P>
<P>
"Such concept is out of date. If you stay in a closed
environment, you won't gain battle experience no matter how hard
you are training," Lou told Xinhua after the eye-popping World
Fastest Woman 100m Race on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Li Xuemei, hailed as a tough challenge to American
world champion Marion Jones before the race, finished only fourth
with a modest 11.21 seconds, well out of her personal best of
10.79 set in the Chinese National Games last year.
</P>
<P>
Jones took an easy win before a partisan crowd of 20,000,
clocking a superb 10.71, her personal best and the world's best
since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Bahamas's Savatheda Fynes and Chandra Sturrup, third and fourth
finisher in the race, clocked their personal best time of 11.06
and 11.09 respectively.
</P>
<P>
"I had believed that I could run well before the race," Li
said. "But when I stepped onto the track and saw so many fans
cheering for me, I was really nervous."
</P>
<P>
Li's coach Zhang Rongwei had predicted the gap between Jones
and his protege would be within 0.05 seconds since Li posted 10.90
in her training Tuesday morning. The final results turned out a
heavy blow to the training-oriented coach.
</P>
<P>
"Training and competing are no longer two different things for
foreign athletes," Lou said. "Competing is part of training.
</P>
<P>
"World-class athletes usually take part in 20 competitions
every year while Chinese athletes always bury themselves in
training before big events."
</P>
<P>
Within 10 days prior to the Fastest Woman Race, sprinter-jumper
Jones had competed in two meets in Japan. She long-jumped 7.05
meters in her first meet and ran a fabulous 10.79 in her second
outing in the Osaka Grand Prix, while Li skipped several
competitions in Europe to prepare for a shot at the American.
</P>
<P>
Li admitted that lack of experience was the main reason for her
second waterloo defeat since last year's world championships.
</P>
<P>
In the Athens world championships, Li was ousted out of the 100
meters semi-finals after clocking 11.21 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"There is a gap between Jones and me, but not as big as shown
in Wednesday's race," said the 21-year-old Chinese sprint
queen.
</P>
<P>
"I can run sub-11 seconds," Li said. "I need more head-to-head
meetings with the world best sprinters to steel my nerves."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Rongwei said his student would stick at closed-door
training because "competition was by no means the key to good
performance."
</P>
<P>
"We prefer daily closed-door training, which remains the
foundation of good performance," Zhang said. "We will not blindly
copy foreign athletes' methods."

24, The Rising Nepal reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will be operating one flight every week all the year round
and two flights a week in October and November which is the peak
tourist season for Nepal," Robert Stainoch, country manager of the

The airlines is planning to operate two flights every week all
the year round from the winter of 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
The airlines, the national flag carrier of Austria, is the

Stainoch said the direct flight is expected to bring in 5,000
European tourists to Nepal in the first three months of its
operation.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's tourism industry suffered a setback after Lufthansa of
Germany pulled out about a year ago.

<P>
The limited seat capacity of the Royal Nepal Airlines has been
a major constraint for bringing in more tourists.

The Visit Nepal Year'98 is believed to have paved the way for
international airlines to operate flights to the Himalayan
kingdom, the daily said.

Bank will increase its capital by eight billion baht (2.1 billion
U.S. dollars) through selling shares to a strategic foreign
partner, according to a report here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Four billion baht will be raised through the sale of common
shares, with the other four billion baht raised from the sale of
convertible debentures.
</P>
<P>
The bank's current registered capital of four billion baht is
owned by the Finance Ministry. The bank was established earlier
this year to bid for assets from the 56 finance companies ordered
closed last December.
</P>
<P>
Vichit Suraphongchai, the bank's chairman, was quoted as saying
that the increased capital would allow the bank more leeway to
bid.
</P>
<P>
The new strategic partner could end up with a majority share
holding when debentures were converted in the future.
</P>
<P>
The new partner could be announced by late June.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Lithuania, Latvia
and Estonia have condemned Russia for trying to pressure Latvia in
its treatment of ethnic Russians.
</P>
<P>
But at a summit meeting of the three Baltic states on Tuesday
in the Latvian capital Riga, they unanimously stressed that they
were keen to maintain good relations with all their neighbors,
including Russia.
</P>
<P>
Gontis Vlmanis, Latvia's president, his Lithuanian and Estonian
counterparts Valdas Adamkus and Lennart Meri also met to discuss
regional affairs, economic cooperation and the implementation of
the U.S.-Baltic Partnership Charter.
</P>
<P>
The three presidents said cooperation among the three Baltic
states would not be affected by the political and economic
pressure Russia brought to bear on Latvia.
</P>
<P>
Relations with Russia have grown tense since the Baltic nations
signed the partnership charter with the United States on January
16, sparking Russian fears of the eastward expansion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
Russian-Latvian ties worsened in early March, when ethnic
Russians in Latvia protesting against rising tariffs were beaten
by Latvian police, causing anger in Russia.
</P>
<P>
In response to Russian threats, the Latvian Foreign Ministry
said on March 9, "Attempts to influence Latvia by economic
sanctions will draw a negative response from the European Union
countries and other partner states."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Anniversary Of Certain Victory Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- One year ago to this day, Sri
Lankan government forces launched a major offensive to clear a
main supply route of 75 kilometers through Tamil rebels-held
territory in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20,000 troops were mobilized for the operation
code-named Jaya Sikuru (Certain Victory). But to date, despite the
superiority of strength, equipment and air and naval resources,
the government troops have been able to advance only 45
kilometers, leaving a further 30 kilometers to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
During the year-long operation, both sides suffered heavy
casualties. At least 2,500 rebels have been killed and over 7,500
others injured while about 1,400 government troops died in action
with over 5,500 wounded, according to reports in the newspaper
Sunday Times.
</P>
<P>
Additionally military hardware including artillery guns,
mortars, armed vehicles and tanks worth millions of U.S. dollars
have been lost or damaged.
</P>
<P>
In terms of expenditure, an estimated 9 million U.S. dollars,
excluding the cost of military hardware, has been spent on the
operation.
</P>
<P>
The slow progress of the operation and the heavy resistance
encountered by the government forces have raised the question
whether the strength, capability and strategies of the enemy had
been under- estimated when the operation was launched, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The government has also now come to realize that the army is
short of manpower. Army Commander Lt. Gen. Rohan Daluwatte has
admitted that the army's advance has been hampered by the lack of
manpower.
</P>
<P>
The manpower shortage has been aggravated by the desertion of
an estimated 15,000 soldiers. The amnesties offered to deserters
on a number of occasions and a high geared recruiting drive
indicate the real predicament of the army with regard to manpower.
The suggestion of resorting to conscription should manpower levels
not be filled through normal recruitment underscores the problem
the government is facing,.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the operation has neither been a
success nor a failure so far in the theater. But given the inputs
that have gone into the operation at the expense of security in
other vulnerable areas, the validity of a main supply route
strategy is arguable.
</P>
<P>
Operation Jaya Sikuru should be assessed in the light of its
failures, successes and overall objectivity. The observers said it
appears that the operation planners had either underestimated the
enemy and overestimated their own capability or subordinated it to
a political agenda disregarding a rational appreciation.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the contributory factors, it is clear that there has
been a mismatch between the military and political plans and the
assessment of capabilities, logistics and aims, they said.
</P>
<P>
These shortcomings have at the end of one year of fighting
every inch of the way been able only to develop a stalemate
situation. The Tamil rebels may be weaker than what it was when
the operation began but that has not made an appreciable dent to
their military ambitions.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were not quiet during the year. In addition to
holding the forces back from over-running their stronghold and
making them pay heavily for every inch won, they attacked other
urban targets.
</P>
<P>
They bombed the Galadhari Hotel in Colombo last October, the
Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Tooth) in Kandy sacred to Buddhists
and the Maradana intersection in the heart of Colombo city at
lunch time peak hour in February and March this year respectively.
They further persisted in their attacks on military establishments
in the east and other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, military sources said the Jaya Sikuru operation will
go on to next year unless another strategy is evolved.
</P>
<P>
As commander-in-chief, President Chandrika Kumaratunga, to her
credit. has spared on costs once she made her decision to combat
the Tamil rebels. This was after they reneged on their undertaking
during the last 1994 peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a 15-year-old war against
the Sri Lankan government for a separate Tamil state in the north
and east of the country. Over 55,000 people have reportedly been
killed in the war.

<HEADLINE> U.S. China Policy Defined in Terms of Objective: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States' China policy
should be defined in terms of its objective, strategy and tactic,
a senior U.S. official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at American Enterprise Institute for Public Research,
Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs
Stanley Roth said the reality was far broader than engagement.
</P>
<P>
"All too often, China policy is reduced to one simple
word, 'engagement,' or sometimes people are more generous; they
reduce it to two words, 'comprehensive engagement,' but the
reality ... is far more complex," he said.
</P>
<P>
Roth said the objective of U.S. China policy was to seek a
strong, stable, prosperous and open China, and its strategy is
integrating China into regional and global institutions.
Engagement is the tactic for achieving the goals, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is the framework that we have in mind as we were moving
towards the last summit," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the United States and
held a summit meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton last
October, an event which was described by both sides as a
milestone in the bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
"I think one of the least noted accomplishments of the summit
was the fact that we agreed upon regular high-level engagement and
we took out the notion that engagement is now somehow a reward for
specific behavior patterns and instead substituted the notion that
engagement is something you do because these are two very
important players who for better or for worse have to deal with
each other and, preferably, get along with each other," Roth said.
</P>
<P>
After the summit, U.S.Secretary of Defense William Cohen and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited China prior to the
next Sino-U.S. summit scheduled for late June. "This engagement
is really proceeding quite vigorously," Roth said.
</P>
<P>
The meetings between high-ranking Chinese and U.S. officials
had focused on such important issues as human rights,
non-proliferation and economic links. Progress has been made on
these issues, Roth believed.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that "the biggest accomplishment was our
agreement, as noted in the joint statement, to move towards a
constructive strategic dialogue, or partnership."
</P>
<P>
He said he was surprised to hear some people interpret the
phrase of constructive strategic partnership as a military
alliance. "I think the easiest thing is to simply say: never
intended in that fashion. That's not China's concept of this, this
is, you know, not what we mean.
</P>
<P>
"What we're rather talking about is looking for a framework on
which we can, you know, come up with maximizing the number of
issues we can work on together," he said.
</P>
<P>
Roth believed that the better U.S.-China relationship had
helped to foster better cross-strait dialogue, and had immensely
strengthened U.S.-Taiwan relationship.

PHNOM PENH, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The clandestine Khmer Rouge
radio went off the air on Wednesday morning amid speculation over
its whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
General Chea Sarun, head of the Operations Bureau of the

Rouge's military chief Ta Mok, or it had technical problems.

According to Meas Sophea, deputy chief of general staff of the

place known as "Ta Tum camp" from its original base in Anlong Veng
along the Cambodia-Thai border.
</P>
<P>
Meas Sophea, who commanded government troops against the Khmer
Rouge guerrillas, said the automobile-mounted radio always
retreated when government soldiers approached.
</P>
<P>
The mobile radio was claimed to be captured by government
troops on Monday's attacks, but it continued to broadcast Tuesday,
with the announcers alleging that 16 government soldiers were
killed by land mines during the fighting on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dhaka Silent Over India's Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
remained silent since its close neighbor India announced that it
had conducted three underground nuclear tests Monday, its first in
24 years.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh continued to remain committed to world peace and
stability, particularly in South Asia, State Minister for Foreign
Affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury said Tuesday, shunning to comment on
the blasts, press reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that all the countries of the region
would move away from arms race to utilize resources "for the
welfare of mankind as well as poverty alleviation and eradication
of illiteracy."
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in October
1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have no comment now and we are observing the developments",
a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi scientists and experts, however, have expressed
their concern over India's nuclear tests which they said would
trigger a fresh arms race in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Professor B.K. Jahangir, a political scientist and vice
chancellor of National University on the outskirts of Dhaka, said
that the latest provocation to arms race in the region following
India's first nuclear test conducted in 1974 was "very
unfortunate" for a region troubled by problems like poverty,
illiteracy and very large but unskilled population.
</P>
<P>
Such developments, he said, were bound to create serious
imbalance of power particularly when spending on deadly weapons
was getting priority by neglecting problems like poverty,
illiteracy and lack of skill of the unfortunate population.
</P>
<P>
He said that the arms race to be triggered by the multiple
blasts conducted in a single day by India would force the two big
countries of South Asia to go on a spending spree on armaments
spoiling much of their resources.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Talukdar Moniuruzzaman, a renowned political scientist,
said he could not understand how India could gain out of its
latest tests.
</P>
<P>
The blasts conducted by India Monday were unlikely to change
the existing status quo of arms between the two arch rival nations
-- India and Pakistan -- of the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Professor M. Shahiduzzaman of the International Relations
Department of Dhaka University said the nuclear explosions
conducted by India would heighten instability in the subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
He said India already demonstrated by its latest actions that
it possessed much more developed nuclear capability than Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
India's new government, after coming to power last month, made
its option to introduce nuclear weapons, a key plank of its
platform in the elections.
</P>
<P>
India has refused to sign the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty
and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, claiming the two treaties
to be discriminatory.

After the counting at the precinct level, election inspectors will
turn over the election returns to the municipal or city level.
</P>
<P>
The total election returns will be recorded and tabulated and
then given to the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
The forms will then be forwarded to the House of
Representatives for the counting for the presidential and vice
presidential positions, while the Commission on Elections will
count the votes for the congressional posts.
</P>
<P>
The process is expected to take four weeks. But the Namfrel can
release the unofficial final results within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commission on Elections, about 80 percent of
the 34 million voters turned out Monday to cast ballots to choose
a president, a vice president, 12 out of 24 senators, 260 members
of the House of Representatives and more than 17,000 local
officials and councilors.

<HEADLINE> Zhongguancun Embraces International Name Brands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Zhongguancun, Beijing's computer
trading hub, has attracted a number of international computer name
brands for its mature marketing system as well as rich resources
of research and marketing personnel.
</P>
<P>
The likes of Microsoft, IBM, Intel and Mitsubishi have
established their Asian Headquarters or research-and-development
centers in Zhongguancun, or cooperate with local businesses in
making information products.
</P>
<P>
There are 920 overseas-funded new-technology enterprises with
an investment of 960 million U.S. dollars registered in the
Haidian area around Zhongguancun, which is the city's education
and research center.
</P>
<P>
Many overseas managers said that Zhongguancun provides the best
market conditions and personnel, which means higher returns for
businesses here than elsewhere since high-tech tends to be a
costly and risky business.
</P>
<P>
International cooperation between businesses, universities and
research bodies from both home and abroad have permeated the
research, manufacturing, marketing and after-sale service of all
the leading businesses in Zhongguancun.
</P>
<P>
Many joint ventures make products developed from local
research. A survey of 390 joint ventures in the area shows that
the Chinese partner uses technology as investment shares in 107 of
them, while the overseas partner does the same in 33.
</P>
<P>
Economic globalization is giving Zhongguancun businesses easier
access to international funding, technology, personnel, and
markets, said Shao Xinping, an official with the administration
committee of the Haidian area.
</P>
<P>
However, facing competition from foreign consortia, the
fledgling Chinese electronics industry must work together on the
global scene, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Larry Bird of the Indiana Pacers
became just the fourth rookie coach in the history of the
U.S. National Basketball Association to win Coach of the Year
title on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bird received 50 of a possible 116 votes from a panel of sports
writers and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada.

<P>
OTTAWA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada said Tuesday that it is
recalling its high commissioner in New Delhi to protest India's
nuclear weapons test explosions.
</P>
<P>
"We are recalling our High Commissioner to India as a first
concrete step in signaling our disapproval to the Indian
government," Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a
statement released here.
</P>
<P>
Canadian High Commissioner Peter Walker will be returning to
Canada this week for an indeterminate period of time, according to
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government will "determine the best course of
action in response to India's clear breach of international
security," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Canada strongly deplored the three nuclear weapons test
explosions carried out India early Monday, and announced by Indian
Prime Minister Vajpayee later on.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned and very disappointed with India's
decision to carry out these nuclear tests," Axworthy said shortly
after India announced the explosions.
</P>
<P>
"This incident is contrary to the international norms
established by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"These tests could have grave implications for global
non-proliferation and disarmament, as well as for regional
security," he warned.

Also Tuesday, Canada's Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific
affairs Raymond Chan reiterated that Canada strongly urges India
to sign on to the NPT and CTBT.

their reaction to yesterday's incident," Chan added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives voted Tuesday to raise the penalties for parents
who cross state lines to evade child support.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would make it a felony, with prison terms of up
to six months, for a parent to cross a state border to avoid child
support when the amount of money owed is 5,000 dollars or more and
is more than one year past due.
</P>
<P>
Parents owing 10,000 dollars or more or those fail to pay for
two years could face up to two years in prison. Parents could
also face fines and would be responsible for making restitution
for unpaid child support.
</P>
<P>
Current law makes it only a misdemeanor, with crimes, to cross
state lines to avoid payments.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which passed 402-16, was approved in almost identical
form by the Senate last November.

Harapan Indah, Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, Tuesday, police
here confirmed Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government has
condemned India for its recent nuclear tests, describing it as an
unnecessary threat to international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean foreign ministry said in a communique that the
tests had severely damaged the nuclear test ban treaty, which is
supported by the majority of the international community and is
struggling to come into force.
</P>
<P>
With the tests, New Delhi had violated the agreements on
promotion of nuclear disarmament, the communique said. The
agreements were adopted at the Ninth Summit of the Non-Aligned
States held in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
India, a founding member of the non-aligned movement, set off
three nuclear devices and tested a short-range Trident missile on
Monday. The tests have triggered worldwide protests, including
from the United States, which is considering sanctions against
India.
</P>
<P>
The communique also reaffirmed Chilean opposition to nuclear
tests and to any country breaking the nuclear test ban.

<HEADLINE> Italy Voices Disappointment with Indian Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Foreign Ministry Tuesday
described India's unexpected nuclear tests as "deplorable" and
urged New Delhi to join a global ban on nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also expressed concern over Indian behavior that
contrasts with the international community's efforts to
consolidate disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry hopes that despite this deplorable act, everyone
will show responsibility in supporting the international
community's determination to pursue the goals enshrined in the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty," the ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"Italy invites the new government in New Delhi to review its
position and adhere to the Test Ban Treaty as soon as possible,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty had
been signed by 149 countries and was in the process of ratification.
</P>
<P>
Outside the Indian embassy in Rome, about 20 members of the
Italian Green party demonstrated Tuesday against the tests. They
also called on the Italian government to urge the European Union
to take strong action, at least on a par with the United States,
which is looking at sanctions.
</P>
<P>
India set off three nuclear devices on Monday and also tested a
short-range Trident missile, capable of hitting targets up to 350
kilometers away. The tests, the first since 1974, have sparked
worldwide protests.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Greenpeace group also issued a statement, saying: "To
prevent a possible arms race triggered by the Indian tests, the
international community should send a clear signal: nuclear tests
are unacceptable and intolerable."
</P>
<P>
It said that the U.S., France and Canada must be blamed for the
tests. "It is they who provide India with nuclear materials or
help it build nuclear facilities."
</P>
<P>
The statement revealed that India is capable of producing 75 to
200 kilograms of plutonium a year, five to ten times more than
needed to generate nuclear electricity.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi has signed neither the nuclear nonproliferation
treaty nor any test ban agreement, arguing that the treaties
discriminate against developing nations in favor of the wealthy
nuclear states.

<P>
KIEV, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The newly elected Supreme Soviet of
Ukraine, the national legislature, held its first plenary session
Tuesday, formally beginning its four-year term.
</P>
<P>
A five-member interim presidium was elected to preside over the
meeting until the new chairman is chosen.
</P>
<P>
Nominations for chairman will open from May 14. Since the
parliament is divided into eight party-affiliated groups and each
has its own man for chairmanship, competition and bargaining
before voting are expected to be fierce.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma made a state of the nation
address to the 450-seat congress on Tuesday morning. Also present
at the session were cabinet members headed by Prime Minister
Valery Pustovoitenko.
</P>
<P>
Only 435 legislators were officially recognized. The rest were
still vacant on Monday night either because ballots have to be
recast in several constituencies or the qualifications of some
congressmen elected are still under evaluation by the central
election committee.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Climbs to 139 Following Mudslides in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Italy's mudslides
rose to 139 while 146 people are still listed as missing one week
after the disaster hit the southern Campania region.
</P>
<P>
Official reports Tuesday said 89 people were hospitalized and
1,034 left homeless after torrents of mud and debris rushed down
hills following days of heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 rescue workers were still searching the five
disaster-stricken towns between Naples and Salerno for survivors.
</P>
<P>
In the worst hit city of Sarno, Mayor Massimo Siano said most
roads leading to the town have been cleared and work would begin
on the local cemetery where the slides toppled tombs and scattered
human remains.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sensitive problem because of hygienic
considerations," said Siano.
</P>
<P>
On the plight of the homeless, the mayor said the municipality
would use containers and campers only as a last resort because
housing was available in the surrounding communities, and there
were buildings constructed for victims of previous earthquakes
that were never used.
</P>
<P>
The catastrophe last week put Italy's environmental issues in
the spotlight as unregulated development, illegal construction and
deforestation were in part to blamed for the massive mudslides.

<HEADLINE> First "Telephone Village" in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Goinbo, a 71-year-old Tibetan, was
very excited after telephoning his grandson who was studying in
east China's Fujian Province more than 3,000 km away.
</P>
<P>
"It used to take more than 20 days to receive a letter from my
grandson. Now we can telephone him and get his voice so clearly,
just like a face-to-face conversation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Goinbo lives in the Gonchum Village in Nyingchi Prefecture, 410
km east to Lhasa, capital of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Since March, 12 households among the 14 ones in the village
have had telephones with direct distance dialing (DDD) function,
through which villagers can reach other parts of the
country. Gonchum, thus, became the first "telephone village" in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the infrastructure in Nyingchi in
recent years, residents in the nearby Gonchum Village began doing
businesses of forestry product processing and transportation. Last
year, their average income per capita surpassed 2,000 yuan (240 US
dollars), twice of the region's average.
</P>
<P>
Ngagwang Dunba, director of the Gonchum Villagers' Committee,
said telephone brought much convenience to their life.
</P>
<P>
"More important," he said, "we can get timely information with
telephone, and adjust our business accordingly."
</P>
<P>
Yang Yunlin, from the telecommunication bureau of Nyingchi
Prefecture, said the prefecture used to have only 6 DDD lines. But
Guangdong Province in south China helped build communication
optical fiber linking Lhasa and the prefecture with 50 million
yuan investment and enabled herdsmen to have access to telephone
at home.
</P>
<P>
Although it costs a great deal to extend telephone service in
rural areas, the local telecommunication bureau plans to help
build two to three "telephone villages" in the near future to pave
way for a better life of Tibetan people, Yang said.

192 Tuesday to give green light to the ruling center-left
coalition's new economic and financial plan for 1999-2000, which
was submitted in April.
</P>
<P>
The center-left parties, as well as deputies from the Communist
Refoundation Party and the new Democratic Union for the Republic
supported the plan while the Freedom Front and the Northern League
voted against.
</P>
<P>
The plan is believed to meet no objection in the Senate for
approval because the ruling center-left coalition enjoys a
majority in the house.
</P>
<P>
Under the new guidelines, the government plans to realize a
nine percent growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) in three
years' time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government aims to reduce the national debt to
100 percent of the GDP from the present 120 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
It wants to create 700,000 new jobs to cut the unemployment
rate from 12 percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection and disaster prevention were also
given priority in the plan.
</P>
<P>
The government must commit Italy to renegotiate plans for the
use of European Union structural funds and ask Brussels for value
added tax reductions in some labor-intensive sectors, according to
the plan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Begin to Accept Mother's Day In Various Ways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- When a young woman in the city of
Nanchang in east China's Jiangxi Province got a Mother's Day card
from her teen-age daughter, she remembered that she should say
hello to her own mother who was thousands of kilometers away -- so
she did it over the phone.
</P>
<P>
But, carnations, the pink version that is thought to be one of
the best gifts for mothers, seemed to be the clear favorite in
this provincial capital on Mother's Day. One man named Shu in his
40s, who said he never knew about this celebration before, bought
a bunch of carnations for his mother.
</P>
<P>
One florist said that, in a single day, she sold more than 200
carnations.
</P>
<P>
History tells us that an American woman began the holiday 84
years ago, but there are at least 40 countries around the world
that take the second Sunday in May as a banner day for mothers.
</P>
<P>
And now the Chinese have become familiar with the foreign
holiday, especially since it reinforces the traditional Chinese
respect for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
One non-government organization even added an aid program
especially directed at poor mothers in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The employees of 30 drugstores in Shanghai, the country's
largest metropolis in east China, held charity sales to help the
people with needy mothers living in other places. The authorities
in Nanchang also organized activities for the holiday.

JAKARTA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia needs to import a
significant amount of rice to meet this year's demand for the
commodity, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
Head of the National Logistics Agency Beddu Amang said here
Tuesday that it will be difficult for Indonesia to regain
self-sufficiency in rice in the near future, Antara News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The country has been hit by a long drought, some rice
producing areas are suffering from disease and insect and pest
attacks, while many rice fields have now been turned into
residential or industrial areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Indonesia managed to become self-sufficient in rice
after many years of being the largest importer in the world.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia imported one million ton of rice last year.

SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Colombian defense
minister, retired General Fernado Landazabal Reyes, was shot dead
by three gunmen in the street here on Tuesday, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Argemiro Serna, commander of the police of Santa Fe de Bogota,
said the ex-minister was killed while walking along the street to
his office. He was shot three times in the head and his body was
riddled with bullets.
</P>
<P>
Reyes was defense minister and commander of the national army
during the administration of President Belisario Betancourt
Cuartas in 1982-1986. He resigned later when his strict policy
against guerillas was repeatedly criticized by others.
</P>
<P>
The independent presidential candidate Noemi Sanin said the
assassination is probably a reprisal between right and left
wingers.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Alfonzo Lopez Caballero described the
accident as a "horrible crime" and added, "it would seem that a
dirty war is escalating in Colombia."

ISLAMABAD, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Health Minister Javed
Hashmi has rejected a bid by Taiwan to seek observer status in the
World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Tuesday by Pakistan's Health Ministry quoted
Hashmi as saying that "Pakistan and the vast majority of the WHO
members recognize that there is only one China -- the People's
Republic of China -- and that Taiwan is a part of China."
</P>
<P>
Hashmi, who is leading the Pakistani delegation to the current
session of the World Health Assembly in Geneva, said that "being a
province of China, Taiwan does not qualify to join the WHO in any
capacity whatsoever."
</P>
<P>
He recalled the resolutions of the U.N. General Assembly and
the WHO adopted 27 years ago which recognized that "the People's
Republic of China is the sole representative of the Chinese
people."
</P>
<P>
This was, moreover, a political issue not suited for
consideration by the World Health Assembly, the Minister added.

Following statements by Pakistan and China, the World Health
Assembly adopted a decision without a vote not to include the item

CARACAS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Andean Corporation of

in the European market as of Tuesday; it is the second such
issuance this year.
</P>
<P>
The executive president of the CAF, Enrique Garcia, said
Tuesday the issuance is in response to a diversification strategy
of the institution, oriented to maintain a continuous presence in
Europe which will introduce a single currency in January 1, 1999.

<HEADLINE> China's Most Serious Windy Area Brought Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- China's most serious windy area in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is now covered
with lush trees and becomes less harmful.
</P>
<P>
The Old Wind Gap, as is called, was measured to have a wind
speed of 40 meter per second, and lies in Tacheng Prefecture, 100
kilometers away from Sino-Kazakhstan border. Snowstorms used to
block the traffic there more than 20 times every winter, causing
12 million yuan in losses annually.
</P>
<P>
Local people would turn pale at the mention of strong
windstorms in winter seasons. Local history book recorded that
Genghis Khan's five hundred armoured cavalrymen lost their lives
in a windstorm in the 13rd century during a mission.
</P>
<P>
However, more than 800 hectares of shelter-forest and 100 ha of
grassland have been developed in the area since 1992 when a
10-year treatment project was started which aims to grow more than
10,000 ha of snow-and-wind-resistant forests, to raise forest
coverage rate to more than 20 percent, and to reduce wind speed by
30 or 40 percent, upon completion, said Liu Shiguang, a local
forestry official.
</P>
<P>
The afforestation efforts have been paid off. In recent years
the strong sandstorms caused only minor losses to the surrounding
areas thanks to the shelterbelt.
</P>
<P>
As more forests and grassland have been able to help slow down
wind speed and reduce evaporation, farmers have cultivated more
than 500 ha of farmland and grow wheat, watermelon and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that we can tame the wind draught at the Old
Wind Gap area, and we are also planning to develop rich wind
energy," Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Parliament Lifts Immunity for Fugitive Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Austrian National Council
(parliament) on Tuesday lifted its parliamentary immunity for
a deputy who allegedly fled the country with millions of
schillings in embezzled funds.
</P>
<P>
The move paved the way for the International Criminal Police
Organization (INTERPOL) to issue a worldwide arrest warrant
against Deputy Peter Rosenstingl.
</P>
<P>
Justice officials said Rosenstingl, a 46-year-old deputy from
the Freedom Party, embezzled at least 28 million shillings (2.15
million U.S. dollars), while the media said more than 200 million
schillings (15.2 million dollars) disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The Rosenstingl scandal has made headlines in Austria's
newspapers recently. The Freedom Party and its chairman Joerg
Haider have also become targets of public criticism.
</P>
<P>
Two other deputies of the party, who had close relationship
with Rosenstingl, have already handed in their resignations.

<HEADLINE> IMF Ready to Extend More Loans to Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) is ready to offer additional financial support to Thailand
if the crisis in Indonesia and the region intensifies, the Bangkok
Post Wednesday quoted Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda
as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the Thai government has been
contacting the IMF for months about additional funds to shore up
the country's official foreign reserves if needed.
</P>
<P>
However, Tarrin refused to give the exact amount of the fund
available or necessary.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Thailand, the country's central bank, reported that on
April 16, Thailand's official foreign reserves stood at 28.6
billion U.S. dollars with forward obligations of 16.4 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the IMF requirement, Thailand must maintain its foreign
reserves at 23-25 billion dollars at the end of this year, with
obligations reduced to 9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economists agreed that additional foreign funds would be needed
to support Thailand's foreign reserves if the regional situation
deteriorates and leads to increased capital flight and pressure on
the local currency baht.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said Thailand was closely watching the events in
Indonesia and the impact on currency volatility in the region.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been wracked by student protests and rioting over
the past few weeks, reflecting growing social unrest over the
country's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said the recent events in the region had signaled that a
regional economic recovery had not yet taken hold.
</P>
<P>
this could in turn affect Thailand's own efforts toward
recovery, he added.

<HEADLINE> BMW Not to Raise Offer for Rolls-Royce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- German auto maker BMW AG reaffirmed
Tuesday that it will not raise its offer for British luxury car
manufacturer Rolls-Royce despite a much higher counter bid offered
by its German rival Volkswagen AG.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a shareholders assembly in Munich on Tuesday, BMW
chief Bernd Pischetsrieder said: "Under no circumstances will BMW
withdraw or change its current offer."
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the battle over Rolls-Royce was not over yet,
Pischetsrieder also noted that only BMW now had an agreement with
British engine maker Rolls-Royce PLC on the exclusive right to the
name of Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
Pischetsrieder's remarks came after the bidding war for the
British noble brand took a surprise turn last Thursday after
Vickers, the parent firm of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, turned to
support Volkswagen to take over the British carmaker.
</P>
<P>
The aboutface was due to an improved bid from VW, worth 430
million pounds (713.2 million U.S. dollars), well above the 340
million pounds (564 million dollars) offered by BMW.
</P>
<P>
BMW had previously engaged in exclusive talks with Vickers on
the planned takeover. But the British company argued that the
higher offer made by Volkswagen would bring more benefits to its
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
A decision is due to be made by a special shareholders meeting
of the British company on June 4.

<HEADLINE> Canadians' Incomes Down in Early 1990s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The recession of the early 1990s
lowered incomes of Canadians by six percent between 1990 and 1995,
wiping out gains made during the second half of 1980s, Statistics
Canada said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After adjustment for inflation, the average income received by
Canadians in 1995 was 25,196 Canadian dollars (17,637
U.S.dollars), almost the same as that received in 1985 and
slightly below the level of 1980.
</P>
<P>
The average income of men was 7.8 percent below their average
income in 1990, while the average income of women saw a 2.1
percent drop from 1990, the statistics agency said in its 11th
report from the 1996 census.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Canadians' employment income continued to
decline as a proportion of total income. In 1995, employment
income accounted for 75 cents for every dollar of income, down
from 78 cents in 1990 and 86 cents in 1970.
</P>
<P>
The share of government transfer payments, such as old-age
pensions and unemployment insurance benefits, doubled over the
past quarter century.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, these transfers contributed 14 cents of every dollar
of income, compared with 11 cents in 1990 and less than seven
cents in 1970.
</P>
<P>
"This increase resulted from changes in both social security
programs and the demographic composition of the population," the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Between 1971 and 1996, Canada's total population increased 34
percent, while the population aged over 65 and older, which
received many of the transfer payments, more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1990s, the incidence of low income among
families increased from 13 percent in 1990 to 16 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The rate was highest among lone-parent families, aboriginal
people and the visible minority population," the agency noted.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Defense System Test Fails Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon's fifth missile
defense system failed to intercept a target on Tuesday, the
Defense Department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The test on the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD
system, was done at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. The
missile, built by Lockhead Martin Corp., lost control shortly
after launch, the statement said. It appeared to be caused by a
booster rocket problem.
</P>
<P>
The missile hit the missile range about three kilometers north
of the launch site. The interceptor missile and target debris
landed on the missile range, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The test at 7:20 a.m. EDT was the eighth overall for the THAAD
and the fifth involving an actual missile flight and attempted
intercept.
</P>
<P>
The THAAD system is designed to provide U.S. forces in the
field protection from attack by Scud and other short- and
medium-range missiles. It is to provide broader defensive coverage
than the Patriot missile system.
</P>
<P>
The program, emerging from former U.S. President Ronald
Reagon's "Star War" plan 15 years ago, was to be deployed in three
years if necessary.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Calls on Japan to Be Sincere in Talks on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) Tuesday called on Japan to be sincere in meeting its
promise to normalize relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK General Delegate in France and Extraordinary and
Plenipotentiary Ambassador to the UNESCO, Ri Tae Gyun, said at a
press briefing here that the normalization of relations between
the DPRK and Japan conforms with the wishes of the people of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
But despite the efforts made by the DPRK side and because of
the non-confidence stand maintained by Tokyo, the bilateral talks
by officials of foreign ministries of the two countries held in
Beijing since last year have been stalled for eight months, said
Ri.
</P>
<P>
Ri recalled that the Korean Labor Party and three major parties
of Japan reached an agreement in 1995 in Pyongyang on launching
the process of normalization of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK side holds that the talks on normalization of
relations should be held without pre-condition, but the Japanese
side has posed pre-condition for moving forward the talks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The high personalities of Tokyo based their excuses for
suspending the talks on "fictive" stories without any witness to
support them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ri said despite the tremendous sufferings inflicted upon the
Korean people by Japan during the colonial rule in the early half
of this century, DPRK is willing to turn a page of history and
renew its relations with Japan.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that during the Japanese colonial rule, six million
Korean men were kidnapped by Japanese imperialists to carry out
slave labors, 200,000 Korean women were enslaved as comfort women
by the Japanese imperial army, and one million Koreans were
massacred by the Japanese imperialists.
</P>
<P>
So far the Japanese government has not made any excuse for
these atrocities and instead ridiculously presented fictive
stories in which Japan posed itself as the victim, he said.

<HEADLINE> New Kimberley Mines Discovered in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Angola's National Diamond-Mining
Corporation and South Africa's De Beers Angola Prospecting have
discovered two new Kimberley mines in the northeast of Angola,
with rich reserves.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique issued here Tuesday by the two companies
said this is the first Kimberley mines discovered since Angola's
independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The new mines, said the communique, are located to the north
of Saurimo, capital city of Lunda-Sul Province near the
diamond-rich mine of Catoca.
</P>
<P>
The two companies started their cooperation in June 1996.
Lunda-Sul is one of the three regions they are approved of
exploitation under the rules of Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
The two companies have reported the news of discovery to the
Ministry of Geology and Mines and submit the samples of the
mineral to De Beers' geological science laboratory in
Johannesburg for test.
</P>
<P>
In early 1970's, the communique said, De Beers found over 120
Kimberley mines in various parts of Angola. However, due to
certain regulations at that time, the company did not mine the
reserves and evacuated from the mines. Enditme

<HEADLINE> WWF Calls for Protection of Whales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 18,000 whales have been killed
since 1985 despite the international efforts to conserve them,
according to a new report released Tuesday by World Wide Fund for
Nature (WWF).
</P>
<P>
The report, Great Whales in the Wild, is in preparation for
this year's meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC)
to be held in Oman on May 16-20.
</P>
<P>
The report claimed that most of the 18,000 whales were killed
by Russia, Japan and Norway although the international moratorium
on whaling came into effect in 1985-1986.
</P>
<P>
"Today, six out of the eleven great whales species are
considered to be endangered or vulnerable," said the WWF report.
</P>
<P>
The northern right whale is now the most endangered of the
large whales, with no evidence of recovery.
</P>
<P>
The blue whale, the largest mammal to have ever lived on earth,
shows no recovery at all in the Southern Hemisphere, with around
500 left.
</P>
<P>
"The IWC must regain control over the management of whaling,"
said Elizabeth Kemf, co-author of the report. "Other urgent
priority actions that can help save the whales include a strict
ban on international trade in whale meat, creation of more whale
sanctuaries and marine protected areas, significant reduction of
marine pollution and making the existing Southern Ocean Whale
Sancturary safer for the whales."

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's fast-growing tourism
sector is expected to earn about 300 million U.S. Dollars this
year, an increase of 100 million Dollars from last year, chief
executive of Zimbabwe Tourism Authority Joe Chigwedere said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chigwedere attributed this development to growing recognition
of Zimbabwe as a favorite tourist destination in the southern
African region.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe is being recognised as a favorite destination with
more to offer than other places in the region," he told the
Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the sector's publicity and marketing campaigns were
leading to increased interest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that Zimbabwe has experienced a steady
growth in the tourism sector with the number of arrivals
increasing from 1.4 million in 1995 to 1.7 million in 1996 and
1.9 million last year.

<HEADLINE> UK Rail Firms Urged to Improve Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's rail companies were
criticized for their poor performance after official figures
showed that fewer trains ran on time last year, national
newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that figures provided by the Office of
Passenger Rail Franchising indicated punctuality worsened on more
than two thirds of routes in the year to March, the first year in
which all routes were under private management.
</P>
<P>
John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, was reported as
describing the operators' record as "unacceptable", and promising
that next month's transport White Paper would set out ways of
achieving higher standards.
</P>
<P>
"Poor performers must take immediate steps to improve their
performance and to maintain levels throughout the year," Prescott
said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that those firms that performed worst were fined
up to 1.35 million pounds (2.2 million U.S. dollars), but they
blamed problems caused by maintenance work for the deterioration
in time-keeping.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the rail firms said that the volume of
passengers had risen seven percent last year, prompting 30,000
extra trains. The capacity of the system's infrastructure to cope
with such expansion was an increasing cause of concern.

<HEADLINE> African Bankers Eye Boom of Small Loans for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Top banking experts from 15
African countries gathered here Tuesday to explore the means to
boost small loans for the poor as part of anti-poverty campaign
across the continent.
</P>
<P>
The three-day African Conference on the Commercialization of
Micro-finance brings together more than 130 participants from
countries such as Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, South
Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"In the recent years, commercial bankers in Africa have become
increasingly interested in micro-finance mainly due to the
potential size of the market and the ability of micro-lending
methodologies in reaching large numbers of poor clients more
effectively," said the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID).
</P>
<P>
"Micro-finance is a good business for Africa" and has been
expanding quickly in the past seven years, said Bethuel Kiplagat,
chairman of Kenya Rural Enterprise Program (K-REP) which is one
of the leading five micro-finance organizations in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"Some seven years ago it was unthinkable that hard-nosed
bankers and welfare-oriented development workers like me could
sit a round table... to discuss business prospects for making
small loans to and accepting small deposits from the poor at a
profit," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
"The collective wealth of the poor in Africa is enormous, just
as their demand for appropriate financial services," he concluded
in a key-note speech.
</P>
<P>
While he noted a major challenge facing African bankers is how
to increase their scale of operations since "most of the
micro-finance institutions in Africa have less than 20,000
clients."
</P>
<P>
"The low scale of operation of most micro-finance institutions
limits their ability to achieve financial sustainability.
Micro-finance organizations must therefore strive to achieve high
volumes of loan advances and savings," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Kiplagat quoted the 1997 Microcredit Summit report as saying
that eight million very poor families worldwide are already
receiving credit for self-employment, leaving 92 million families
still to be reached by 2005. Most of them live in the Third
World.
</P>
<P>
The report said about 21.6 billion U.S. Dollars will be
required to meet the estimated micro-credit needs from the poor.
</P>
<P>
The conference to end Thursday is sponsored by the USAID, the
British Department For International Development (DFID), Citicorp
Foundation and the World Bank.

HARARE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Defense Ministry of Zimbabwe is
planning to spend billions of Dollars to replace its old fleet of
jet-fighters, Air Marshal Perence Shiri, commander of Airforce of
Zimbabwe, said Tuesday.
</P>

<P>
"We used to have Pakistan instructors training our pilots, but
this is now being done by local experts," he said.

<P>
"We have to enhance our capacity to train because the future
of Airforce of Zimbabwe depends on this," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Embassy Refutes So-Called "China Threat" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Charge D'affaires Ad Interim of
the Chinese Embassy in India Lin Shanglin rejected here Tuesday
what he called the recent slanderous rumors of a "China Threat" by
some Indians. He reiterated China's independent foreign policy of
peace.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the embassy, Lin said China is
now fully dedicated to its modernization drive as well as reforms
and opening up. This needed a long-term peaceful international
environment, particularly a good surrounding environment.
</P>
<P>
He said China has always adhered to an independent policy of
peace and striving to develop a friendly relationship with all
other nations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistense.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that recently some Indians had insisted on spreading
the rumor of the so-called "China Threat". The groundless
accusation has not only hurt the feelings of the Chinese people,
but has undermined the atmosphere favorable to improving
Sino-Indian ties and the furtherance of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese President Jiang Zemin's successful visit to
India at the end of 1996 brought the Sino-Indian ties into a new
stage of development at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two countries established a constructive
partership geared toward the 21st century on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistense, and reached broad consensus on
high-level exchanges of visits and cooperation in a range of
fields such as economy, trade, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the development of good-neighborly and cooperative
ties between China and India, as the two most populous nations in
the world, not only conforms to the basic interests of the two
peoples, but also to the needs of peace and stability in the
region and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the border problems left over by history between
the two nations, Lin said China has always taken a positive stand
toward the problems.
</P>
<P>
He said China hoped the two sides would continue to seek fair
and reasonable solutions to the border issues in the spirit of
mutual understanding and compromise.
</P>
<P>
Lin said Sino-Indian ties had achieved a marked improvement
thanks to the joint efforts of the two countries. He hoped both
sides would cherish the hard-won improvement and work to enhance
bilateral ties and friendship by both words and actions.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Talks to Resume in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The stalled negotiations
between the Burundi military authority and leaders of Great Lakes
countries will resume next month, media reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Julius Nyerere, the international mediator in the Burundi
political conflict, has set June 15 as the date for the formal
start of the negotiations, according to a statement issued here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the negotiations involving all warring
parties of Burundi will be held in the farming town of Arusha in
northern Tanzania on June 15.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi peace talks were stalled last year after the
Burundi military authority led by Pierre Buyoya said it had no
faith in Nyerere, who is an advocate of imposing economic
sanctions on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
East and central African countries backed by the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) have imposed economic sanctions on Burundi
since August of 1996 after Major Buyoya toppled a civilian
government of President Ntibantunganya in July of the year.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere insisted that one of the conditions to resume Burundi
peace talks is the release of former Burundi presidents,
Jean-Baptiste Bagaza and Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, and also
Speaker of the Burundi National Assembly Leonce Ngendakumana.
</P>
<P>
According to Nyerere, the conditions, set during the last

<HEADLINE> Israel's New Chief of General Staff Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet on Tuesday
approved the nomination of Major General Shaul Mofaz as next chief
of general staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai submitted the nomination
Monday to cabinet, saying that the two top candidates, Mofaz and
Major General Matan Vilani, were both qualified, but he considered
Mofaz more suitable.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that since the chief of
general staff would have to work closely together with the
defense minister, he is in favor of Mordechai's choice.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz, a father of two, is to replace the current chief of
general staff, Amnon Lipkin Shahak, who will step down on July 9.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz, born in Tehran, Iran in 1948, immigrated to
Israel at age nine with his family. He had been living in the
southern city of Eilat until he was sent to an agriculture high
school in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
He has a bachelor's degree in business administration from
Israeli Bar-Ilan University and is a graduate of the U.S. Marine
Corps Command and Staff College.
</P>
<P>
First drafted to the paratroops of the IDF in 1966, he rose
through the ranks to brigadier-general and led an armored
division. He then commanded the troops in south Lebanon and in
August 1993 was promoted to major general and appointed the IDf
commander in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In late 1994, Mofaz became head of the southern command of
the IDF and held this post until March 1996, when he became head
of the IDF Planning Branch. Last year, he was named deputy chief
of general staff.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai has been cultivating Mofaz since he assumed the
defense portfolio two years ago. The other candidate, Vilani, is
more popular in the army.

<P>
HARARE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Gordon Chavhunduka, president of
the Zimbabwean National Traditional Healers Association, said
Tuesday that the organisation has identified medicines that are
likely to remove some or all the symptoms associated with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates attending the AIDS exposition in Harare,
the president said medicines used by his members on AIDS patients
were analyzed by a research institute in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Identification and isolation of pure compounds from some of
the plants that were active against HIV/AIDS had been done.
</P>
<P>
However, the question of ownership of the compound or drug had
become a deterring issue as rich opportunists would want to
capitalize on that.
</P>
<P>
He added that discoveries which had been made could be
patented should funds become available.
</P>
<P>
The association has 50,000 practising healers.

<HEADLINE> Russian Envoy to Visit Lebanon on Israeli Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian special Middle East envoy
Viktor Possevalyuk is expected to visit Lebanon on Wednesday in
his fresh efforts to activate the Lebanese and Syrian tracks in
peace process stalled for over two years.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Beirut, Possevalyuk will hold talks with
Lebanese leaders on regional affairs, especially the recent
Israeli withdrawal offer.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Israeli cabinet formally endorsed the 20-year-old
United Nations resolution 425 and offered to withdraw troops from
south Lebanon if Lebanese government agrees to provide security
for Israeli border areas.
</P>
<P>
However, Lebanon and Syria, which agreed to coordinate stances
in the peace process, firmly rejected the offer, insisting on an
unconditional Israeli pullout from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel, after two invasions of Lebanon, carved out a
1,200-square-kilometer border strip in the south in 1985 as
security zone, under the pretext of protecting its northern areas
from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, seeks a
comprehensive peace deal that would also involve an Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy will convey a message from Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov to his Lebanese counterpart Farez Boueiz
on Russian positions over the Israeli offer.
</P>
<P>
After visiting Lebanon, he will go to Damascus and confer with
Syrian leaders over the issue.
</P>
<P>
It is not known if Possevalyuk will carry any initiatives to
restart the Syrian and Lebanese peace talks with Israel, which
have been deadlocked since the hardline Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in June, 1996.

BRUSSELS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- European Commission Vice-President
Sir Leon Brittan met on Tuesday Chau Tak Hay, Hong Kong's
secretary for trade and industry.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong trade official assured Brittan that Hong Kong
would continue to promote multilateral trade liberalization and
that events had shown that Hong Kong had been truly exercising
autonomy in its external trade policy.
</P>
<P>
Chau, who is scheduled to fly to Geneva for a series of
bilateral meetings with trade officials of other countries in the
context of the World Trade Organization (WTO), also reiterated
Hong Kong's determination to protect intellectual property rights
by combating pirated CDs.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong had recently introduced administrative
and legislative measures to reinforce the protection of
intellectual property rights in respect of CDs in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong trade secretary told the commission
vice-president that Hong Kong would support a WTO ministerial
declaration in Geneva next week which would enable a new round of
comprehensive multilateral trade negotiations to be launched
before the start of the new century.
</P>
<P>
Chau expressed satisfaction at the currently sound trade and
economic relations between Hong Kong and the 15-nation European
Union and expected that bilateral cooperation would be furthered.
</P>
<P>
The commission vice-president and the Hong Kong trade secretary
also discussed issues such as electronic commerce and regionalism
on the multilateral trading system.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Parliament Launches Second Probe of PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish parliament voted Tuesday to
launch a second probe into allegations that Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz cost state money by awarding consulting work to private
firms.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament launched its first investigation in April into
Yilmaz's personal wealth on allegations that he had omitted some
shares in the Finans Bank between 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The inquiries were both urged by his bitter rival ex-premier
Tansu Ciller's True Path Party.
</P>
<P>
In the latest case, Ciller's party accused Yilmaz of awarding
a feasibility study for the construction of a second Istanbul
airport to two private firms instead of government agencies,
arguing that the government agencies could do the same job 18.4
million U.S. dollars cheaper.
</P>
<P>
A 15-member commission will be set up to conduct the inquiry,
which will last two months and political parties will name their
candidates for the panel.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the two inquiries against Yilmaz were a
retaliation for the probe now underway into Ciller's private
property.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Syrian and Lebanese held a meeting
here Tuesday to coordinate their stance on the latest developments
in the Middle East, particularly the Israeli offer of conditional
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and Minister of
Foreign Affairs Farouq al-Sharaa met the visiting Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri as part
of the consultations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hariri briefed the meeting the results of his recent visit to
Paris and his talks with French President Jacques Chirac,
according to informed sources here.
</P>
<P>
The viewpoints were identical on most of the issues discussed
and the two sides agreed on the continuation of cooperation in the
face of the Israeli maneuver which aims to "eviscerate the U.N.
Security Council resolution 425."
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon have been conducting intensive consultations
since Israel declared its intention to implement the resolution
and quit south Lebanon provided security arrangements are worked
out with Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
The two countries deemed Israel's offer "a mere maneuver" that
aims to drive a wedge between Syria and Lebanon and evade a
sincere and unconditional implementation of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon agreed to launch a large scale diplomatic
campaign to explain their positions on the Israeli designs and on
the rejection of any talks with Israel about the security
arrangements under Israeli request.

AMMAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A prominent opposition leader, Leith
Shbeilat, was convicted of inciting pro-Iraqi "illegal gathering"
and sentenced to nine months in jail Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's State Security Court said Tuesday that it had
"sufficient" evidence that Shbeilat, former president of Jordan
Engineers Association, was the instigator of the February riot in
the city of Ma'an, some 250 kilometers south of the capital,
official Radio Jordan reported.
</P>

Shbeilat made a "sensational" sermon to the Ma'an prayers at
its main Mosque on February 20, the radio said, just a day before
a pro-Iraq riot there, which led to one death and 23 injuries.
</P>
<P>
Shbeilat was arrested on his way from Ma'an to Amman, but no
time was given.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Insecurity in Angola Creates 70,000 New Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Deputy Minister of
Assistance and Social Reintegration Eufrazina Maiato said here
Tuesday that insecurity ensuing from armed operations by remnants
of UNITA soldiers has created 70,000 more refugees in the
country.
</P>
<P>
She told the press that the militiamen of the former rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) have
launched attacks in Bie, Huambo and Benguela provinces in central
Angola, Luanda-Norte and Lunda-Sul provinces in the northeast and
Huila in the south, displacing many families and putting their
lives in great difficulties.
</P>
<P>
This situation is "unexpected" and disturbed the
implementation of the national rehabilitation program, she said,
adding that the United Nations mission in Angola are not prepared
for the emergency, thus having difficulty in providing assistance
to the refugees, the Angola News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
International aid agencies are not able to reach all the
refugees areas due to security reasons, Maiato said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the sabotage by UNITA militiamen has been on the
rise recently and the situation is deteriorating despite repeated
government warnings.
</P>
<P>
Arao Chiteculo, Deputy Governor of Huambo Province, revealed
Tuesday to the press that 10 people, including Vice-Mayor of
Caala city and national Police Commander of Kuima town, had died
in two attacks on buses within four days' time, and nine others
wounded.

<HEADLINE> LIFFE And Aex Launch FTSE Eurotop 100 Index Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The London Financial Futures and
Options Exchange (LIFFE) and Amsterdam Exchanges (AEX)
respectively launched Tuesday new futures and options on the FTSE
Eurotop 100 index, according to an announcement released here.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE Eurotop 100 is an index of the 100 most liquid stocks
in the largest stock markets in Europe. It currently covers the
nine largest markets in UK, Germany, France, Switzerland,
Netherland, Italy, Sweden, Spain and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The Index - calculated by FTSE International - is Europe's
benchmark for trading the performance of the most liquid major
companies in Europe's highest capitalized markets.
</P>
<P>
By listing futures on the FTSE Europtop 100 Index, LIFFE will
be able to provide users with an instrument to trade the most
liquid stocks listed on Europe's major equity markets in a single
transaction.
</P>
<P>
LIFFE is listing the futures as proprietary traders and hedgers
are increasingly focusing on Europe's equity markets in the run-up
to Economic and Monetary Union and a time of declining European
bond yields.
</P>
<P>
LIFFE and AEX intend introducing futures and options on the
broader based FTSE Eurotop 300 Index early in 1999 as the market
for pan-European products develops.
</P>
<P>
Mark Makepeace, Managing Director of FTSE International, said:
"European monetary union has begun. You can now trade on Amsterdam
Exchanges and LIFFE."
</P>
<P>
"These contracts, based on 100 stocks, not only provide much
greater flexibility in designing pan-European products -
importantly they also track the established European benchmark
indices," he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UK Manufacturing in Technical Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The UK's manufacturing output fell
for the second consecutive quarter, officially confirming that the
sector is now mired in recession.
</P>
<P>
Factory output fell by 0.1 percent in the first three months of
this year following a 0.5 percent drop in the previous quarter,
according to the latest official figures by the Office of National
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Depressed by the strength of the pound, which makes exports
more expensive and imports cheaper, manufacturing production has
been flat since last summer.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts said that despite the recent slide in the
value of the currency, it remained at levels that would continue
to damage exporters.
</P>
<P>
Further evidence that the slowdown is beginning to spread to
other parts of the economy emerged in the latest British Retail
Consortium survey of high street sales.
</P>
<P>
The value of sales on a like-for-like basis rose 5.7 percent in
the year to April, up from just 0.4 percent in the previous month.
But adjusting for the late Easter this year by taking the two
months together suggested sales growth had slowed.
</P>
<P>
Nervousness about the economic outlook is reaching investors,
with the latest Merrill Lynch/Gallup survey of fund managers
revealing they have become net sellers of commercial property for
the first time in two years.
</P>
<P>
Trevor Cheetham, of Merrill Lynch, said this reflected a belief
that the economic cycle is turning downwards with investors
switching into gilts.
</P>
<P>
An UK economist at Nikko Europe said: "The main unanswered
question is 'How deep the recession will be?'"
</P>
<P>
It is also believed here that Manufacturing is only 20 percent
of UK's economy but against the background of a slowing service
sector the danger is that the psychological effect of a recession
in manufacturing could turn the expected soft landing for the
economy into a hard one.

<HEADLINE> Air China, Northwest Airlines to Share Codes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China's flag carrier Air China and
U.S. Northwest Airlines signed a commercial cooperation agreement
here on Tuesday to benefit from the code-sharing service.
</P>
<P>
According to the accord, Air China's flight codes will be put
on Northwest's China-U.S. flights and on certain U.S. domestic
flights, and Northwest's flight codes on Air China's service
between China and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also cooperate in flight schedules and
connections, computer reservation systems (CRS) linkage, through
check-in and "seamless" service including downline seat
assignments and boarding passes, reciprocal frequent flyer
programs and joint marketing programs.
</P>
<P>
The code-sharing service is made available under the China-U.S.
bilateral aviation agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based Air China, the largest airline in China,
currently operates round-trip service from Beijing and Shanghai to
San Francisco and New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. It plans to
inaugurate non-stop service between China and Los Angeles in June.
</P>
<P>
Northwest, a major U.S. airline with the longest history of
service between the United States and Asia since 1947, operates
the Detroit-Beijing service five times weekly and provides the
only non-stop service by a U.S. airline between North America and
China.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also provides for the opportunity for Air China
to share codes with Northwest's partners Continental Airlines,
Alaska Airlines and America West Airlines.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Bishop Says No Contact with Koroma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Amidst reports that the leader of
Sierra Leone's former military junta, Johnny Paul Koroma, has
offered surrender to the Catholic mission in the country, the
bishop involved denied Tuesday any contact with the fugitive man.
</P>
<P>
"I have not contacted with Johnny Paul Koroma," said Bishop
George Biguzzi, quoted by a British Broadcasting Corporation
report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The bishop of the Catholic Dioceses in Makeni, northern Sierra
Leone added the reports of any contact by Koroma who he does not
know personally were "rumors and speculations".
</P>
<P>
If Koroma wants to surrender, he should first inform the
president who has the last and final word, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bishop also promised that as a religious person, he would do
according to the directive of the presidency in the interest of
the country.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely reported that Koroma has offered to
surrender via the Catholic bishop.
</P>
<P>
The west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG, which
ousted Koroma's military junta three months ago, has said the
alleged development is encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Koroma resorted to Bishop Biguzzi for fear of his life and
that of his family.
</P>
<P>
According to the bishop, the people in his dioceses are still
suffering as a result of continued attacks by remnants of the
junta forces and allied rebels.
</P>
<P>
Only on Monday, he said, houses were burnt in some villages,
people were killed and others injured.
</P>
<P>
Koroma, who seized power from the elected government of
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah last May, was dislodged in
mid-February by the Nigerian-led ECOMOG forces.
</P>
<P>
While he ran out of the net of the sub-regional force,
remnants of his army, along with the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) rebels, have since been waging war against the advancing
ECOMOG in the eastern and northern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG forces are intensifying the mopping up exercise and
progress has been reported in the past few days.

Berlin, May 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will
start a European trip with a visit to Germany on Wednesday and
Thursday, where he will highlight new prospects for the
transatlantic relations between the United States and Europe, U.S.
ambassador to Germany, John Kornblum, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Clinton will attend ceremonies at the Tempelhof

bring supplies to the then West Berlin during a blockade by Soviet

<HEADLINE> U.S. Forecasts Winter Wheat Crop down 9 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Agriculture Department
predicted here Tuesday that the American farmers will harvest a
winter wheat crop down 9 percent from last year at 1.71 billion
bushels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the early predictions for this country's corn crop,
indicated farmers will have 9.64 billion bushels, which would be
the second-largest on record. Soybean production is tentatively
projected at 2.8 billion bushels, up 3 percent from last year's
record.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are expected to harvest over 1 million acres less
winter wheat than last year, when averages prices topped 4 U.S.
dollars a bushel. This year's crop could sell at just over 3
dollars a bushel, leading many growers to switch to other crops.
</P>
<P>
Kansas, the leading winter wheat producing state, expects a
crop of about 377.4 million bushels, down from 506 million bushels
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Including Spring wheat just now being planted, total U.S. wheat
production this year is projected at 2.3 billion bushels, a 7
percent drop from last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the lower crop estimate, prices will remain depressed
due to higher level in storage from last year and export demand is
weak. At the same time, U.S. growers face a strong challenge from
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
With wheat, corn price projections are down, the Agriculture
Department predicts prices could go as low as 2.05 dollars a
bushel, compared to 2.71 dollars two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Hussein Slaps Israel for Rejecting U.S. Idea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein on Tuesday
criticized Israel for rejecting a U.S. proposal aimed at reviving
the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I think Israel owes too much to the United States as
it is the case of many of our friends in the region," the
king told reporters after inaugurating the Al Karamah Dam in
the Jordan Valley, some 50 kilometers northwest of Amman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal, calling for a 13.1 percent more Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank, has been accepted by the
Palestinian side but rejected by Israel, who insisted on no more
than 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has done its uttermost and taken a
"constructive" stand by accepting the proposal while Israel
appears aloof and irresponsible, he said.
</P>
<P>
The king then pinned hope on the U.S. efforts to remove the
current obstacles to bring forth peace for the region based on
mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for what the U.S. can do as a partner
to peace making," added the king.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations was deadlocked last March
due to Jewish settlement expansion in Arab East Jerusalem.

LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe all
suspended Monday's rally and ended sharply lower Tuesday, dragged
down by consolidation, Wall Street's mixed opening and fears over
U.S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares gave up all Monday's
gains and was driven back below the 6,000-point level in
futures-led trade amid worries about the outlook for U.S. interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
But dealers said that selling pressure was light among leading
shares, with around 60 percent of trade in non-FTSE stocks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some investors were sidelined ahead of U.S. retail
sales and inflation figures and UK jobless and earning numbers
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares ended 44.34 points or 0.83 percent
down at 5,297.35 on the DAX-30 index as the market continued to
consolidate.
</P>
<P>
"We are moving lower but there is no real selling pressure and
the DAX-30 index remains pinned in a 5,200-5,300 range," said one
dealer.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, the CAC-40 index retreated from Monday's
new record closing high and closed 29.91 points or 0.74 percent
down at 3,987.33 as the market booked profits made in the 2.84
percent rise in the previous session.

health services.
</P>
<P>
The third credit of some 10 million dollars equivalent will be

WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist of the United States Supreme Court raised questions
about efforts in Congress to federalize the prosecutions of
juveniles who are made to stand trial as adults.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the American Law Institute, the nation's top
judge described two bills now before Congress as "especially
troubling" because they would "increase substantially the
potential workload of the federal judiciary" without a showing
that state courts cannot handle such cases just as well or better.
</P>
<P>
"Both bills eliminate the traditional preference for state
prosecutions of juvenile defendants," Rehnquist said, and they
"would eviscerate this traditional deference to state
prosecutions."
</P>
<P>
Copies of his Monday speech were distributed by Supreme Court
officials Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Current law favors state prosecutions unless a state's juvenile
programs are deemed inadequate or a minor's violent crime or
drug-trafficking offense raises some substantial federal interest.
</P>
<P>
A bill pending before the Senate would let federal prosecutors
treat juveniles 14 and older as adults for a variety of criminal
violations. A corresponding bill in the House would apply to
juveniles 13 and older if the attorney general approved of a
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The House bill also would lower the age -- from 18 to 16 -- at
which the federal government can seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
"Whether these policies are wise ones is debatable, but what is
not debatable is that, if implemented, they will significantly add
to the caseload burdens of the federal judiciary," the chief
justice said.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks closed higher
Tuesday after seesawing through the day, rallying to approach its
record high in the final hour as interest rates sank in the bond
market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 70.25 points to
9,161.77. It's just 30 points below last Monday's record finish
at 9,192.66.
</P>
<P>
Decliners still outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-8 margin on
active volume which totaled 600.90 million shares, up from 556.97
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 8.51 to 1,115.15, and the NYSE
composite index rose 3.01 to 578.28.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 12.09 to 1,860.16, led by

</P>
<P>
But the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.77 to
476.13, and the small-company dominated American Stock Exchange
composite index fell 0.45 to 743.58.
</P>
<P>
The late advance came as the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
fell back below 6 percent just one day after bobbing above that
psychologically important level.

<HEADLINE> Report: World Population Hits 6 Billion in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The world population, growing by
80 million a year, will hit 6 billion next year and is expected to
be doubled in the next 50 years, said a population research body
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an annual assessment of global trends, the Population
Reference Bureau, a nonprofit research organization, also expected
that the current world, which adds a billion people every 12 or 13
years, will have a declining birth rate worldwide in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
The report said the size of the world population will be
decided by the number of children women would have. If women
average two children, the population would rise to 9.4 billion by
2050, and then reach 11 billion in the following century.
</P>
<P>
However, if the average would be 2.5 children, the world
population would grow to 11.2 billion in 2050 and 27 billion by
2150. And if the rate would be 1.6, the population would decline
in the 21st century, peaking at 7.7 billion in 2050 and then
dropping to 3.6 billion by 2150.
</P>
<P>
The report said most industrial nations would maintain their
population size, with the size in some countries shrinking, but
the number of people in most developing countries will continue to
increase.
</P>
<P>
The report said the urbanization, rising educational
attainment, and lower infant mortality often greatly contribute to
a growing desire for smaller families. And family planning use has
helped couples to achieve the family size they wish.
</P>
<P>
But population will grow for a long time even if each couple
only have two children because of the big group of child-bearing
young women.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 2 billion young people, about 90 percent
of them in developing countries, are entering or about to enter
their child-bearing years. Each year 18 percent of women 15 to 19
years of age give birth in Middle Africa; 5 percent in Southeast
Asia; and 1 percent in Western Europe, the report said. In
sub-Saharan Africa, the total fertility rate remains very high at
nearly 6 live births per woman.
</P>
<P>
In terms of ranking, the world's four largest nations -- China,
India, the United States and Indonesia -- will retain those places
in 2025, the bureau said. But Pakistan will move from the seventh
to fifth place, Nigeria will rise from 10th to seventh, Mexico
will jump from 11th to ninth and Bangladesh from ninth to eighth.
</P>
<P>
Current sixth-position Russia will fall to 10th place in 2025,
Japan, now eighth, will drop to 11th and Brazil, from fifth to
sixth.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Higher Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose sharply
against the yen Tuesday, as Japanese long-term interest rates fell
to a record low.
</P>
<P>
But the dollar eased against the German mark on increased
confidence for the unified European currency.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 134.07 yen,
up from 132.75 late Monday. The dollar bought 1.7762 marks, down

</P>
<P>
The dollar rose early against the yen after the yield on
Japan's benchmark long-term government bond fell to a record low.
</P>
<P>
The mark also gained against the yen, which helped the dollar's
advance against the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Clinton to Visit Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will
start a European trip with a visit to Germany Wednesday and
Thursday, where he will highlight new prospects for transatlantic
relations between the United States and Europe, U.S. Ambassador to
Germany John Kornblum said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will attend ceremonies Thursday at the Tempelhof
Airport of Berlin marking the 50th anniversary of the Berlin
airlift, an operation staged by the Western allies in 1948-49 to
bring supplies to the then West Berlin during a blockade by Soviet
troops.
</P>
<P>
He will also hold talks with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in
the historic city of Potsdam to discuss a wide range of issues
including NATO and EU expansions, European integration,
U.S.-German ties, as well as situations in the Middle East, Bosnia
and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders would also exchange views for the upcoming
Group of Eight (G-8) summit to be held in Birmingham, England,
later this week which both of them will attend, German officials
said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, which is his third one to the country since
1994, Clinton is also due to meet Gerhard Schroeder, the Social
Democratic chancellor candidate who will challenge Kohl in the
German national elections on September 27.
</P>
<P>
With his visit focusing on eastern Germany this time, the U.S.
president is also expected to address special social problems
facing the region in a speech to be delivered in the eastern
German town of Eisenach Thursday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Try to Revive Mideast Summit: Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Tuesday that she would re-issue invitations to the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders to Washington for a summit if she
could reach agreement with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Wednesday's talks.
</P>
<P>
But she insisted a U.S. proposal on Israel's pullback from 13
percent of the West Bank would not be watered down for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Press Club, Albright said she hoped
"there is a way that we can get this (peace) process back on track
and in fact re-issue the invitation for accelerated permanent
status talks to be held under President (Bill) Clinton's auspices
in Washington very soon."
</P>
<P>
Albright described herself as "an eternal optimist" and said
she was looking forward to the Wednesday meeting with Netanyahu,
which is aimed at laying the ground for final Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal from the
West Bank is the "only way" to end a 15-month impasse and
re-launch talks with the Palestinian Authority on a permanent
settlement.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to water down our ideas," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to couch the U.S. demands in reasonable terms, Albright
said the 13 percent pullback proposal was much closer to Israel's
position than to the Palestinians' and did not attempt to define
what territory Israel should give up. That, she said, was up to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Albright denied that the United States was giving ultimatums or
threatening Israel's security. The U.S. proposals were just
"suggestions," she said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said Albright's speech
sought to show how far U.S. ideas met criteria laid down by Israel
itself. They came closer to Israel's offer -- of a 9 percent
withdrawal -- than to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's original
demand of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
After the speech, Albright went to the Capitol Hill to try to
win support among members of Congress for the administration's
stand. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and several other leading
Republicans have accused the Clinton administration of unfairly
pressuring Israel.
