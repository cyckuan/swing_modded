VACCO SAYS MAN LED RING IN ILLEGAL SALE OF MEDICINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Bronx man who is suspected of leading one of the
largest black-market prescription drug operations in the state was
indicted Friday after more than $1 million worth of prescription
medicine was found in his apartment, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Elvin Mendez, 27, is accused of running the
operation by buying prescription drugs from street-level dealers,
stockpiling them and reselling large quantities to middlemen who
then sold them to pharmacies throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The street-level dealers typically either bought the drugs from
Medicaid patients for a fraction of their cost, stole the drugs
from hospitals or clinics, or enlisted the help of medical
professionals who could write and fill prescriptions, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Mendez was indicted after a six-month investigation in which
investigators said they found plastic bags stuffed with AZT, the
expensive AIDS medication, and other drugs at his Bronx apartment
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from state Attorney General Dennis Vacco's
Medicaid fraud unit also found a large number of empty prescription
bottles, counterfeit drug manufacturers' labels, seals and
packaging inserts, the attorney general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Mendez is charged with one count of criminal diversion of
prescription medications and prescriptions in the second degree, a
felony, and faces up to seven years in prison if he is convicted.
He was arraigned in state Supreme Court in the Bronx and was being
held in $50,000 bail. Mendez has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This increasingly common scam, known as drug diversion, costs
taxpayers millions of dollars,'' Vacco said, ``and also potentially
places the public at great risk because the drugs that are diverted
from regulated channels of distribution are often expired,
mishandled and potentially unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendez is accused of paying only a fraction of the cost for
powerful drugs. Among the drugs the authorities said they found
were Invirase and Viracept, two AIDS medications; Biaxin, an
antibiotic; Procardia, a heart medication; Prozac, an
antidepressant, and Proventil, an asthma drug.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to inconsistencies in the laws for such offenses, Vacco
has proposed stiffer penalties for drug diversion. ``A drug
diverter who is caught selling a $1,100 bottle of medication would
be slapped with a felony,'' he said. But if Mendez had been
prosecuted solely for the $1 million worth of prescription drugs
stashed in his apartment, he would have been subject to only a
misdemeanor charge, Vacco said.
</P>
<P>
   Most prescription medications that are diverted through the
black market end up on the shelves of pharmacies, Vacco said.

EDITORIAL: EMBASSY TERROR IN AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Changes 2nd and 6th grafs to include updated information and
to correct the distance between the two bombing sites.)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 8:
</P>
<P>
   The deadly terrorism that struck U.S. embassies in Africa on
Friday stunned Americans. It came as an unwelcome reminder that, in
a terrorist's eyes, the world's most powerful country remains the
world's No. 1 target. American embassies everywhere will need to be
provided with the highest possible standards of physical security.
</P>
<P>
   The car-bomb attacks in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, some 400 miles apart, killed at least 80 people and
injured more than 1,600. At least eight of those killed in Nairobi
were Americans, while several other Americans in the Kenyan capital
are still missing. The largest number of victims were Kenyans who
had been working in an office building next to the American
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   These were the worst attacks on American government
installations since a truck bomb tore apart the Khobar Towers
military apartments in Saudi Arabia more than two years ago. But
100 or so less spectacular acts of international terrorism were
directed against Americans last year, killing seven and injuring
21.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing certain is yet known about who planted the bombs that
exploded on Friday. But the fact that the two embassies were
attacked almost simultaneously, with powerful explosives, in
countries that are not known for popular hostility to the United
States suggests a coordinated assault, possibly with the direction
and assistance of a foreign government.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has sent criminal investigators and counterterrorism
specialists from the State and Defense departments and the FBI to
learn more about how the blasts occurred and to aid in the search
for evidence and suspects.
</P>
<P>
   It will need to be determined why the two embassy buildings,
both built before the wave of terrorism against American embassies
in the early 1980s, had not yet been upgraded to modern security
standards. American embassies should have their building facades
reinforced, their glass coated with plastic film to prevent
shattering, and their security perimeters extended.
</P>
<P>
   America and other countries have made modest progress in curbing
international terrorism, in part by putting pressure on nations
like Libya, Syria and Iran that have supported terrorist activity
in the past. But as Friday's attacks make uncomfortably clear,
terrorism, both freelance and government-supported, is far from
defeated, and American embassies remain vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic outposts of a democracy cannot be made into
indestructible fortresses. But Washington is obliged to make them
as secure as possible for those who work and do business there and
for their neighbors as well.

GELLERT TAPPED TO HEAD FOUNDATION HEALTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Foundation Health Systems Inc., the nation's
fourth-largest publicly traded managed care company, promoted Jay
M. Gellert to its top management post.
</P>
<P>
   Gellert, previously Foundation Health's president and chief
operating officer, is now president and chief executive officer,
succeeding Dr. Malik M. Hasan, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   One of Gellert's chief goals will be boosting member confidence
in the managed care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary focus we have is managing the company so people
view us as partners with their doctors and hospitals in providing
better care, not ... giving people the impression we are depriving
them of medical care,'' Gellert said.
</P>
<P>
   Hasan will continue as chairman of the board but will resign
from that post and from the board sometime between January and May,
the company said. A new chairman will be selected at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a natural, evolutionary step in the growth of FHS. I
have, for some time, wanted to step aside as CEO,'' Hasan said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Gellert credited Hasan with making Foundation Health, which has
annual revenue of nearly $9billion, a major player in its field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few people in any field who have built
companies from scratch to a Fortune 500 level,'' Gellert said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Hasan founded QualMed, a predecessor to FHS. Through a
series of acquisitions he built QualMed into a multistate, managed
health care company with operations concentrated in the West.
</P>
<P>
   QualMed went public in 1991 and merged with Health Net in 1994
to form Health Systems International.
</P>
<P>
   Hasan designed the company's expansion into northeastern
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the company merged with Foundation Health Corp. and
now has 4.3million members enrolled in health plans in 18 states.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the management change is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay Gellert has been running the company and doing a good
job,'' said Todd Richter, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover &AMP;
Co. analyst who has put a ``neutral'' rating on its shares.

A BRONX POLITICAL LEADER EVOKES THE BOSSES OF OLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four years ago, when Roberto Ramirez became the first
Hispanic county political chairman in the state, he took the reins
of a Bronx Democratic organization whose influence was a mere
shadow of its glory days.
</P>
<P>
   Like its counterparts in the other boroughs, the Bronx
organization may never reclaim the clout it had when ``Boss''
Edward Flynn had easy access to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s
and '40s, and when Charles Buckley boasted in the 1960s of being
able to deliver 500,000 votes. But Ramirez has demonstrated that
whatever cogs of a political machine remain in the Bronx, he
commands them with a measure of control.
</P>
<P>
   In his years at the helm of ``County,'' as the Democratic
organization is known, Ramirez has achieved a degree of party
discipline unusual in the Bronx since the days of the old bosses.
His organization has kept the number of intraparty primary battles
to a minimum, raised substantial amounts of money and delivered
solid Democratic results in general elections. When the city,
despite a large Democratic edge in registration, voted
overwhelmingly last year to re-elect a Republican mayor, the
Democratic candidate, Ruth Messinger, carried only one borough: the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of results, he's got one of the most effective
organizations in the party,'' said Carl McCall, the state
comptroller, who is running for re-election this year. ``It's clear
that all the elected officials are lined up behind him. When I go
for support, I don't have to go to six different leaders. He can
pull together everyone else in the borough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez plays down any suggestion that he might be the closest
thing on the political scene to the bosses of old. ``I want people
to have their say,'' Ramirez said. ``I want people to believe that
they have someone running the organization who hears their concerns
and ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's detractors denounce him as an autocrat unwilling to
listen to anyone who does not share his vision of how _ and by whom
_ the Bronx should be governed. Some suggest that his tireless
efforts to dissuade potential challengers to incumbents are
fundamentally undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   None of the critics are more vociferous than Pedro Espada Jr., a
former state senator from the Bronx who is Ramirez's major
political nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ramirez's confrontation with Espada has now landed the
chairman in the thickest controversy of his stewardship. Espada has
accused Ramirez of using illegal tactics to pressure him to stay
out of a new race for a state senate seat. Espada claims that
Ramirez offered to ask District Attorney Robert Johnson to call off
an investigation into the finances of a health clinic operated by
Espada if the former senator withdrew his candidacy. Ramirez has
vehemently denied that he made any such threat.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation has caused a stir among Bronx politicians and
drawn attention to Ramirez's tactics in pursuing his major goal:
keeping primary battles, particularly threats to incumbents, to a
minimum. (In much of the Bronx, the Democratic nominee is all but
assured of winning the general election.)
</P>
<P>
   Several would-be insurgent candidates suggested that Ramirez
first used gentle persuasion, often calling in potential
challengers for a chat at the party's headquarters in the
Westchester Square section. He urges candidates to forgo their
electoral aspirations in the short term and work within the
organization, postponing their candidacy for another day.
</P>
<P>
   If a challenger persists in a campaign, the next step is often
to attack his election petitions. Teams of lawyers hunt for flaws
that could invalidate petition signatures, forcing the challenger
to pay for lawyers and consultants to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez acknowledged that he sought harmony in the ranks by
urging would-be challengers to work with the organization rather
than run against incumbents, though he said his efforts relied
simply on cordial persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have bruising primaries, where there is little
temperate discourse, people harm each other so badly that they
cannot work together after the race is over,'' Ramirez said. ``And
so, to the extent that you can avoid a primary, you try to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's influence reaches beyond the Bronx: he is chairman of
a statewide organization of Hispanic legislators, whose annual
conference, Somos El Futuro , lures state and national political
figures. For officials running for statewide office, the conference
is considered an important symbolic stop.

ARBITRATOR SETS HEARING DATE TO DECIDE IF PLAYERS GET PAID 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiators for the National Basketball Association and its
players have no idea when they will next meet at the bargaining
table, but they learned Friday that they will confront each other
at the arbitration table on Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   John Feerick, the arbitrator for NBA grievances, set that date
for a hearing on the union's grievance over the league's failure to
pay the players who have guaranteed contracts salaries during the
league's lockout. He scheduled a second day, if it becomes
necessary, for the following day.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with the arbitrator Friday, lawyers for the two
sides expressed a desire to have the hearing on different dates.
The union pushed for next Friday; the league proposed a date after
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   But under the compromise schedule Feerick selected, he could
have a decision by Labor Day. The timing of the decision is
important because the two sides may not hold any negotiating
sessions until they know the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we had hoped for the hearing to be sooner,'' said
Jeffrey Kessler, a union lawyer, ``the importance for us is the
decision will come out significantly before the start of training
camps. We would hope to have a decision by Labor Day. That timing
works for the players, so we're happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the hearing will be critical to the negotiations
for a new collective bargaining agreement because whichever side
wins, it will gain immense leverage in the bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   If the players win and the league has to pay the approximately
220 players (out of 410) while they are locked out, the cost would
be tremendous, especially if the dispute delayed the season and the
teams had no revenue coming in. The union says that players with
guaranteed contracts have salaries totaling nearly $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   A victory for the league would place greater pressure on the
players, who would stand to lose millions of unrecoverable dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike major league baseball, which began putting lockout
clauses in player contracts about 10 years ago, NBA teams have
ignored that form of self-protection. Kessler said only one player,
whom he declined to identify, has a contract clause saying he would
not be paid during a lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no lockout language in other contracts,'' he said.
``They could have negotiated that clause. Since they didn't, they
are obligated to pay the players their salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's chief legal officer, said the
league would have no comment on the case. ``We'll have more to say
as this thing develops,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mishkin did acknowledge that the New York regional office of the
National Labor Relations Board has asked the league to provide a
written statement in connection with the unfair labor practice
charge the union filed last month. He said the statement would be
delivered to the NLRB next week.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which says there cannot be a lockout because the
players do not go to work until October, contends that what the NBA
has actually done is unilaterally change the conditions of
employment before the two sides negotiated to impasse. During the
lockout, teams are not permitted to sign free agents, and that is
one change, the union argues.
</P>
<P>
   The union has asked the NLRB to seek an injunction in federal
district court that would end the lockout and allow the league's
normal schedule to go forward while the two sides negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   It was an injunction won by the labor board in 1995 following a
similar charge by the baseball players union that prompted the
players to end their strike and return to work while their lawyers
negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement.

JUDGE SAYS STARR'S LEAKS MAY HAVE VIOLATED RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Repeating for all needing.)  (lb) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge has found that prosecutors
investigating President Clinton's relationship with a former intern
may have violated federal rules by providing protected grand jury
testimony to journalists, according to court papers that were
unsealed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare ray of good news for the White House, Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson of U.S. District Court declared that Kenneth
Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, may have broken the
ethical code governing criminal investigations, in his remarks to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Finding that Clinton's lawyers had compiled a persuasive list of
potential violations by Starr's office, she said in her ruling on
June 19 that the prosecutors now carry the burden of proof and must
demonstrate their innocence in a hearing to avoid contempt
citations and possible penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Starr appealed aspects of the ruling, delaying the hearing. On
Monday the U.S. Court of Appeals dealt a setback to Clinton. It
ruled that to prevent the disclosure of more secret information,
the president's lawyers could not question prosecutors themselves
during the hearing, nor subpoena documents, as Judge Johnson had
decreed.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court did not address the substance of the
accusations against Starr, and its ruling will probably not affect
the grand jury investigation. All the court motions and decisions
related to the appeal of Judge Johnson's ruling were released
Friday by the appeals court, the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has repeatedly denied that his office illegally slipped
grand jury secrets to reporters. Dozens of members of his office
submitted affidavits to the judge declaring that they had not
disclosed any protected information cited in a laundry list of news
articles and broadcasts compiled in February by David Kendall, the
president's personal lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But in an opinion crackling with anger, Judge Johnson swatted
aside the affidavits as defining the secrecy rules ``too
narrowly,'' and complained of ``the serious and repetitive nature''
of the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   She cited comments by Starr quoted in the magazine ``Brill's
Content'' that he and his deputy, Jackie Bennett, spoke anonymously
with reporters. She challenged his quoted assertion that it did not
violate federal rules to disclose what witnesses had told
prosecutors or federal agents before they testified.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson also wrote that in May, Starr publicly praised as
``magnificent'' a ruling by her against a White House claim of
executive privilege. The ruling was sealed, Judge Johnson said with
unmistakable scorn, so Starr's comment both confirmed its existence
and revealed that it was favorable to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confirming the existence and substance of a sealed court
ruling presents a prima facie violation'' of the rules, she wrote,
and ``a violation of the court order not to discuss the ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Friday, Starr said that he would provide the
court with evidence to assure it ``that we are committed to an
investigation that is conducted thoroughly, fairly, professionally,
and in full compliance with the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Since January, when Starr began looking into whether Clinton
lied under oath in denying a sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky and tried to cover it up, the White House has complained
bitterly about press reports on the investigation's progress that
were based on anonymous sources. Fanning public suspicion of the
prosecutors, Clinton's advisers and lawyers have repeatedly accused
them of violating federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans responded by accusing the White House itself of
leaking the information to discredit the prosecutors. Under the
federal rules, witnesses before a grand jury may describe their
testimony, but prosecutors and others with direct access to it are
bound to secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has put news organizations in a paradoxical
position. Besides the leakers themselves, reporters covering the
Lewinsky investigation are the only ones in Washington who know the
truth of the accusations against Starr. Yet because they have
guaranteed their sources anonymity in exchange for information,
they are unable to inform their readers, listeners or viewers.
</P>
<P>
   In her decision, Judge Johnson cited news reports by several
organizations, including CBS News, the New York Daily News, and The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson's June 19 ruling was sealed, so White House
lawyers and advisers say they have stayed silent about it to avoid
committing the very transgression that so irritated her. They were
as delighted on Friday at the unsealing of the documents as fidgety
children for whom the recess bell has finally rung.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in the 20-year history of the Independent
Counsel Act, a federal court has found prima facie evidence of
potential criminal wrongdoing by an independent counsel,'' said
James Kennedy, a spokesman. It is unlikely but possible that a
judge who finds that prosecutors deliberately leaked grand jury
secrets could refer them for disbarment or perhaps even criminal
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, the president's private lawyer, said in a statement:
``The endemic and casual disclosures of grand jury information
which have characterized the past seven months'' of the
investigation ``are highly unprofessional and utterly
indefensible.''

</P>
<P>
   The White House was particularly pleased with Judge Johnson's
ruling because she has been widely perceived as favoring Starr,
having rejected repeated efforts by Clinton's lawyers to assert
various forms of legal protection.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the documents followed by one day Ms. Lewinsky's
appearance before a grand jury, in which she contradicted a
previous sworn account and testified that she and the president had
had a sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
   In his own statement, Starr said that in prompting a hearing
Kendall had faced a ``minimal'' burden of proof of illegal leaks.
All he had to do was put together a list of articles and broadcasts
that referred to ``sources in Starr's office'' and made similar
attributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspaper articles and media reports supporting the allegation
may be capable of various interpretations,'' Starr said. ``They may
even be erroneous.''
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals on July 10, Clinton's
lawyers went so far to as to argue that the investigation of the
prosecutors was at least as important as the investigation of the
president. The prosecutors, they wrote, ``are public servants
endowed with extraordinary power to conduct a grand jury
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson had given permission to Clinton's lawyers to
question members of Starr's office about their contacts with the
press, with the discovery process to begin on July 11. But the
appeals court, which had previously blocked the discovery while it
weighed the case, found that this approach would improperly impede
Starr's investigation into the president ``at a crucial juncture,''
and also risk the same sort of disclosure of grand jury secrets
that started the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it ruled, Judge Johnson must conduct the hearing
herself. If she is not satisfied with Starr's argument for his
innocence, she may then take further steps, including appointing a
``special master or other individual'' to conduct a further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Appeals Court wrote in its decision that charges of
violating grand jury secrecy were ``not to be taken lightly.'' It
quoted Justice Felix Frankfurter as saying that to have a
prosecutor feed reporters information is to turn the state ``into a
conscious participant in trial by newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr took no testimony Friday. But in a further sign that
Capitol Hill is girding for the eventual delivery of his report on
the Lewinsky matter, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee announced
that they had hired three more lawyers to serve on their
investigative team.
</P>
<P>
   They include Abbe Lowell, a Washington litigator and lecturer,
who will serve as chief investigative counsel; Lis Wiehl, a
prosecutor from Washington state; and Deborah Rhode, a professor of
law at Stanford University and legal columnist.

SCANDAL IS GOOD NEWS TO ALL-NEWS NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Repeating for all needing.)  
(lh) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The images hardly make for compelling television: mostly Monica
Lewinsky getting out of cars and Kenneth Starr getting into them.
The talking heads make up a largely over-exposed collection of
former prosecutors, defense attorneys and pundits. And often there
hasn't been a whole lot of hard news to headline.
</P>
<P>
   But for 24-hour cable news networks like MSNBC, CNBC, Fox News
and CNN, all that does not seem to matter. The questions that would
dominate dinner party conversation these days are apparently enough
to sustain what some have come to call ``All Monica All the Time'':
Will the dress test positive? Will the president submit his saliva?
What is Ms. Lewinsky's state of mind?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the talk show clatter, the Monica Lewinsky story is big
business, meaning more revenue and higher ratings to shows that
mostly struggle at the margins, looking for, at best, the
mysterious murder of a beauty queen.
</P>
<P>
   Where initially this kind of round-the-clock coverage, ushered
in by the Gulf War, appeared to be dictated by news developments,
now it seems largely fueled by the bottom line. All-news channels
depend on events like the O.J. Simpson trial, the death of Princess
Diana and now the trials and tribulations of President Clinton for
their very survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs live or die on issues of this sort,'' said
Marvin Kalb, director of the Shorenstein Center on the Press,
Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. ``Because talk is
the cheapest form of entertainment, it can fill hours of air time
at the lowest possible cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable news executives say they are simply responding to the
demands of the marketplace. ``Do I think we're crisis-driven now?
No,'' said John Moody, vice president of news editorial at Fox
News. ``The nation's viewing habits are changing. There's always
someone who wants to find out what's going on. This is not a
country that's all at home at 6:30 to watch Dan or Peter or Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   But media experts say cable news networks are not yet
established enough to eat into the networks in the absence of a big
breaking story. ``The worst thing that can happen to a CNN is for
there not to be a Monica Lewinsky or an O.J. Simpson or a war,
because you don't get any of these peaks and surges in viewing,''
said Larry Gerbrandt of Paul Kagan Associates, a media research and
consulting firm based in Carmel, Calif. ``No news is bad news for
these services.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the cable universe is so much smaller than the broadcast
universe, media experts say _ 66 million households vs. 100
million, according to one estimate _ a little lift goes a long way.
A story like this one, for example, can boost a program's rating
from a 0.1 or 0.3 to a 0.3 or a 0.6. ``In broadcast terms, that's
nothing,'' said John P. Ellis, a marketing and advertising
consultant who has advised CNBC. ``But in cable terms, it's called
doubling your audience. To cable news people, Monica is a huge
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a story like the Lewinsky scandal not only helps
fledgling all-news cable shows build ratings and get noticed,
television experts say, it goes straight to the bottom line,
particularly because these programs have fixed costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A case like this, for cable news shows over the coming year,
is probably worth in the tens of millions of dollars,'' said Larry
Gerbrandt, a senior analyst with Paul Kagan Associates Inc. a
Carmel, Calif.-based media research and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on how long it drags out, maybe even in the
hundreds,'' Gerbrandt continued, ``because future ad time is based
on historic viewing patterns. So the benefit really comes over the
next year to 18 months.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   For what are called spot advertising buys _ time that has not
been purchased in advance _ for example, cable news channels can
adjust their prices upwards depending on the daily Nielsen ratings
data, Ellis explained. ``Cable news is very spot market heavy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While the cable shows may reach a relatively small audience
compared with the networks, media experts say, their influence is
considerably broader. Networks and print organizations, cable news
executives note, are fueled by the constant scandal updates
available from their cable competitors. ``When the soap opera on
the news channels is better than the soap opera on the networks,
then I think it does provide a certain amount of pressure,'' Moody
said. ``Despite protestations that we're saturating America's
living rooms with tawdry detail, that same detail is exactly what's
being demanded by our audience.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this means people like Geraldo Rivera are having a very
good time. Prime time ratings for his program, ``Rivera Live'' on
CNBC, which has devoted its hour to the Lewinsky-Clinton story
night after night, are up nearly 30 percent for the month of July
compared with the same period last year, from 438,000 households to
567,000.
</P>
<P>
   ```Rivera Live' has clearly found its niche,'' Rivera said.
``It's by seeking the nuance and promising your audience that
you'll report every significant development that you build an
expectation that, when push comes to shove, there's only one show
to turn to.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ``Hardball With Chris Matthews,'' which started a
year and a half ago and appears just before Rivera's program on
CNBC, saw its prime-time ratings increase 57 percent for July
compared with last year and 147 percent in the program's midnight
time slot, when it is rebroadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Not all cable news anchors are quite so proud. Keith Olbermann,
whose program ``White House in Crisis'' on MSNBC was started in
February in response to the Lewinsky story, has done some public
chest-thumping about his own coverage. In a May 23 speech to his
alma mater, Cornell University, he said: ``There are days now when
my line of work makes me ashamed, makes me depressed, makes me cry
... . About three weeks ago, I awakened from my stupor on this
subject and told my employers that I simply could not continue
doing this show about the endless investigation and the
investigation of the investigation, and the investigation of the
investigation of the investigation. I had to choose what I felt in
my heart was right, over what I felt in my wallet was smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Olbermann, who declined to comment, is still on the air
every night, discussing the latest Lewinsky speculation on MSNBC's
``The Big Show.'' Erik Sorensen, the executive vice president in
charge of programming at MSNBC who only started at the network last
week, said this kind of ambivalence comes with the territory.
``There is a lot about this story that a lot of us covering it
aren't particularly crazy about,'' he said. ``But that's what we do
for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable news shows have been criticized on the Lewinsky story,
along with the mainstream press, for vamping without substance and
for vague attribution. Indeed, Gerbrandt suggested that the report
about nerve gas in Vietnam, which got CNN into trouble recently,
was an example of an ill-fated effort to generate excitement in a
slow news period. ``That story on nerve gas is the result of a CNN
trying to make sure they have an ongoing series of reports that can
attract viewers,'' Gerbrandt said, ``realizing that you can't count
on a scandal or a disaster or a trial of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, correspondents say their information is no less
reliable because they have so much time to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, for example, made a point of saying on the air last week
that he stood by his report of Aug. 4 alleging that the infamous
dress had tested positive for ``human genetic material,'' which he
attributed to ``one source very close to the president.'' NBC last
week sent out a message warning its other reporters not to pick up
Rivera's report and saying the network had not confirmed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been wrong yet,'' Rivera said. ``In that sense, I'm
still living as queen for a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, is viewing newscasters like Rivera as
royalty. ``For me, I am finding _ as there is this explosion of
talk, talk, talk _ that I cannot listen to the din,'' said Kalb of
Harvard. ``I'm not learning anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton story shows few signs of receding, cable
news executives acknowledge that there will come a time when Ms.
Lewinsky will be old news. ``I'm already losing sleep over it,''
said Sorensen of MSNBC. ``Inevitably, this story is going to end
and, as an all-news channel, we rely on reality _ and we need
reality to cooperate.''

BOY GENIUS' NEXT FEAT _ SLEEPING IN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Tenn.)  (js) 
 By TIM TESCONI   Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Michael Kearney, a former Santa Rosa whiz
kid who graduates Saturday with a master's degree in biochemistry,
plans to take a semester off before pursuing a doctorate degree at
Purdue or the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   After all he's only 14 and in no real hurry to become Dr.
Michael Kearney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to take some time and be a kid for a little
while,'' said Kearney, who experts classify as ``severely gifted.''
</P>
<P>
   This brainy boy was talking in complete sentences when he was 6
months old and was reading soup can labels at 14 months. When he
was 3 he watched Jeopardy and and blurted out responses, often
before the TV contestants.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Santa Rosa Junior College when he was 8 and on
Saturday gets his master's degree in chemistry from Middle
Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, southeast of Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I graduated I asked for a car,'' Kearney said. ``I'm
asking for one again but I don't think I'll get it because I'm
still not old enough to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearney holds three Guinness world records, including being the
youngest high school graduate in the history of mankind and
finishing college at age 10. He's up for two more Guinness records:
enrolling in graduate school full time at age 11 and receiving a
master's degree at 14.
</P>
<P>
   Kearney considers himself a normal kid. His career goal is to
become a game show host. Or a geologist. Or cancer researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any difference between me and other
kids my age, except I go to a different school. That's it,''
Kearney said in a phone interview this week from Murfreesboro.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, Kevin and Cassidy, say their son's brilliant mind _
in constant need of academic stimulation for his insatiable
intellect _ is both a blessing and burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the start, it appeared to Cassidy and me that when
Michael was not allowed to learn new things he was actually in
pain,'' said Kevin Kearney. ``We never pushed Michael, he pushed
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kearneys' other child, Maeghan, 13, also is ``severely
gifted'' and doing college-level work.
</P>
<P>
   When Michael Kearney was 4 he was doing fifth-grade level work.
His parents put him in a Montessori program in the Puget Sound area
of Washington state where they lived at the time. Soon after that
they moved to Santa Rosa, but moved away in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 5 Michael was ready for high school but no Sonoma
County school would accept a child so young. His parents taught him
at home and he earned his high school diploma when he was 6. That's
when he enrolled at Santa Rosa Junior College, the youngest
community college student ever in California.
</P>
<P>
   The Kearney family credits SRJC administrators with looking
beyond Michael's age and allowing him to enroll based on his
intellect.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Kearney graduated from SRJC with high honors. He then
polished off a bachelor of science degree at the University of
Southern Alabama. The family then moved to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Kearney said just being a kid for the next semester includes
playing video games, shooting hoops and sleeping until noon. And
not fretting over chemical formulas and complex research projects
at Middle Tennessee State where he has been enrolled since January
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The research for my master's in biochemistry was heavy work
and very time consuming. I would be in the laboratory until 9
o'clock at night and sometimes until 3 in the morning. Now I'm
done,'' Kearney said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has mastered the intricacies of biochemistry,
Kearney really wants to be a game show host _ an ambition he has
held since he was toddler. He was a game show fanatic at 8 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to be a game show host. I like the speed and how
fast you have to think,'' Kearney said. ``Besides it's so much fun
watching people screaming about winning an Amana freezer.''

PENALTY KICK ENOUGH FOR UNITED TO BEAT BURN, 1-0
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ They call him El Diablo, and he played a devil of a
good game last night.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United midfielder Marco Etcheverry, one of Major League
Soccer's do-everything rare specimens, did enough against a Dallas
Burn team intent on reinventing its season.
</P>
<P>
   Etcheverry's back-heel flick pass to Roy Lassiter drew a
57th-minute penalty kick that Lassiter converted, all D.C. United
(20-5) needed to beat the Burn (11-12), 1-0, before 9,437 at the
Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Etcheverry perfectly manipulated an upfield chip by John Harkes.
Burn goalkeeper Mark Dodd was forced to slide-foul Lassiter, who
had plenty of room to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to lose it on a PK,'' Dodd said. ``But you know
you're going to be tested by Etcheverry. They've got attack to
spare.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-time MLS champion D.C. became the league's first club to
clinch a playoff spot and ended Dallas' winning streak at two.
Dallas has split one-goal games against MLS' top teams after
beating Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was our best game of the season, to be honest,''
Burn coach Dave Dir said. ``I hate to say that on a losing cause.
In games like this, little things make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   D.C. and Dallas unloaded every trick except a finishing touch in
a scoreless first half. An apparent goal by Etcheverry was negated
when officials ruled Dodd trapped a save on the line just inside
the near post.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the last time Etcheverry took aim or the last time
Dodd denied him. Etcheverry hammered a running shot off Dodd and
had the Dallas keeper darting all over his line on D.C. corner
kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd made Etcheverry pay once for being tentative. The All-Star
midfielder had a shot lined up, but instead tapped inside to
Lassiter, giving Dodd enough time to recover for one of his seven
saves.
</P>
<P>
   While Etcheverry, Lassiter, Jaime Moreno and Ben Olsen put the
heat on Dodd, the Burn offense also struck a deliberate tone. Jason
Kreis was a visible organizer in the midfield, stepping in front of
D.C. defenders to spawn promising counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   Kreis and Burn forwards Dante Washington and Mickey Trotman
ultimately couldn't convert. Trotman had his moments, but offsides
and an untimely shirt-tugging foul cost him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept fighting and fighting,'' Trotman said. ``With the guys
they've got, sometimes it's all you can do. The effort was good and
maybe it'll pay off at the end of the season.''

POLLUTION MAY SAP HURRICANES' FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BRIAN FEAGANS   N.Y. Times Regional Newspaper Group   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ If you think Hurricane Fran was at full force
when it slammed into the Carolina coast that fateful Friday two
years ago, think again.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been worse on a Monday or Tuesday, say researchers
at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   The costliest storm in North Carolina history, like the infamous
weekend hurricanes Hazel and Hugo before it, was probably choked a
bit by air pollution drifting off the East Coast during the
workweek, according to climatologists Randall Cerveny and Robert
Balling Jr.. Their study is published in Wednesday's edition of the
science journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The duo found that average hurricane intensity over the past 50
years has been weaker for storms coming ashore at the end of the
week and on weekends than for tempests striking on Mondays,
Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   They believe pollution particles coming out of smokestacks and
tailpipes during the workweek drift into the Atlantic and provide
tiny seeds for raindrops to form around. The rain-forming particles
help approaching hurricanes blow off some of their steam before
landfall, they concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricanes are the biggest storms that we have on this planet,
in terms of energy and precipitation,'' Cerveny said. ``And what
we've found is that we're having an impact on them. It's a little
daunting when you start to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers compared three sets of climate data _ daily
carbon monoxide and ozone measurements from a Canadian monitoring
station on Sable Island off the coast of Nova Scotia, daily
satellite-derived rainfall records for the Atlantic and key
measurements for Atlantic hurricanes from 1945 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   All three databases showed a seven-day cycle, including
pronounced differences in rainfall and hurricane intensity between
the beginnings and ends of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human week is not a natural time period,'' Balling said.
``Human effect on weather is the only explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon also explains why Atlantic boaters are more
likely to encounter rain on a weekend and clear skies during the
early part of the week, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   They studied rainfall data for a 200-foot-wide band stretching
along the Atlantic seaboard from Florida to Nova Scotia. Average
rainfall peaked on Saturday and bottomed out on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane findings were met with interest and skepticism by
one regional weather expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a darn interesting idea,'' said Tom Matheson, who is in
charge of hurricane warnings for the National Weather Service in
Wilmington. ``I don't buy it, but I don't not buy it either.''
</P>
<P>
   Variations in the amount of pollution along the East Coast
during the past five decades and the importance of salt crystals as
rain seeds in hurricanes gave Matheson some pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what you can do with statistics,'' he said.

McGWIRE VS. SOSA HAS HEAVYWEIGHT LOOK, `FUN'

   ST. LOUIS _ Sammy Sosa walked into Busch Stadium yesterday and
saw the oversized bandage patched on a St. Louis Post-Dispatch sign
on the upper-deck facade, high and beyond the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' Sosa said with a smile. ``Incredible. He is The Man.

<P>
   Mark McGwire certainly was the man on that night in April with
his herculean swing against Florida Marlins pitcher Livan
Hernandez. The sign wasn't harmed when the ball came crashing down,
but the bandage is still a nice touch, symbolizing a home run that
measured 545 feet and is the longest ever hit at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hoping to get a couple of singles,'' Sosa said,
another smile spreading across his face. ``This is going to be
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 47,911 thought so as well, especially the couple
thousand or more that crammed the outfield bleachers two hours
before the game in anticipation of nothing more than McGwire taking
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   That is a shown unto itself, and the Cardinals' first baseman
didn't disappoint. In the span of 10 minutes, alternating with two
faceless teammates, McGwire hit one into the upper deck, two off
the facade, one off the scoreboard towering beyond the left-field
bleachers and visitors bullpen and two more into the grassy area
beyond the center-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared with each shot, and dozens of cameras roped off
behind the batting cage clicked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ought to see him take BP at Wrigley,'' Cubs catcher Scott
Servais said with a smile. ``They're lined up in the streets
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa had a firsthand view of the show, watching McGwire while
leaning on the batting cage with Cubs teammate Henry Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having the fifth Beatle,'' Cardinals pitcher Bobby
Witt said. ``You go to a place like Atlanta and the bleachers are
sold out before we even go out there. It's fun just to watch the
other team when they're supposed to be stretching and they're all
watching him take batting practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday was extra special. The Cubs were in town, which is a
big deal in St. Louis even under normal circumstances. But the
final score was only secondary in most people's minds. The Cubs are
leading the National League wild-card chase, but the Cardinals have
long since drifted out of any kind of playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   The show yesterday was a face-to-face meeting between McGwire
and Sosa, two of baseball's celebrated three who are chasing Roger
Maris' single-season home-run record.
</P>
<P>
   This had all the aura of a heavyweight title fight, only with a
run-of-the-mill baseball game spliced in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of the time Nolan Ryan was going for his 300th
victory,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-series buildup has been sizable. The local newspaper ran
a Sosa-McGwire story on the front page, right next to the rundown
on Monica Lewinsky's testimony in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire squirmed when the subject was broached before the game.
Home runs that is, not the ex-intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never look at stats until the last day of the season was
over,'' McGwire said. ``I don't even know what I'm batting. Of
course I know how many home runs and RBI I have. The home runs are
up there on this big billboard I drive by on the way to the
ballpark. The Queen Casino. It says, Home Runs: 45. Good luck Mark,
The Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama was all pregame. The Cubs scored three in the first
with Sosa drawing a walk. But the Cardinals came back with 11 of
their own. McGwire contributed a key two-run single, fighting off
an inside pitch from Cubs pitcher Steve Trachsel and blooping it
into right field.
</P>
<P>
   The swing was indicative of an intelligent hitter trying to win
a baseball game rather than swing from the heels trying to break a
record.
</P>
<P>
   Party-pooper.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa followed the walk with an 0-for-3, one strikeout and a
couple of pop-ups. He wasn't trying for any measly singles.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire also went hitless in three at-bats. He batted in the
seventh with runners on second and third, but Cubs reliever Felix
Heredia walked him on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd booed lustily. The Cardinals' 16-3 victory was hardly
satisfying. They came to see long ball, and the two heavyweight
will go after it again today with another 47,000 expected.

   Johnson leaves Phillies impressed
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Randy Johnson did not have to throw his hardest to make a shutout
look easy Friday night. His fastball was not his usual supersonic
variety; it was mostly in the 93- to 95-mph range, only
occasionally hitting 97.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Philadelphia Phillies never had faced the sidearming
lefthanded giant before, and they were somewhat surprised by what
they saw.
</P>
<P>
   After his team lost 9-0 to the Astros, Kevin Sefcik, a
27-year-old outfielder, said, ``Everybody was talking about how
hard he throws, but I've never seen a slider that has so much late
break.''
</P>
<P>
   Sefcik caught up to a Johnson fastball in the third inning,
leading off with a double to center field while there was still no
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty excited,'' Sefcik said. ``I thought maybe if we
get something going there .''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson put away the next three batters, and in the bottom
of the inning the Astros battered Phillies rookie Mike Welch for
four runs. This issue was decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like (Greg) Maddux,'' Sefcik said, referring to Atlanta's
pitching ace. ``You can't get four or five runs behind and have
much chance of catching up.''
</P>
<P>
   After his initial success with Johnson, Sefcik was hopeful of a
productive evening in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he didn't throw me any fastballs after that,'' Sefcik
said.
</P>
<P>
   What Johnson showed was a side that many fans are unaware he has
_ more Maddux-like precision than power ball. He worked quickly
(game time: 2 hours, 21 minutes), walking only one batter and
allowing five hits.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's Gregg Jefferies, who faced Johnson in the
pitcher's early days with Montreal and later with Seattle, observed
how the Big Unit has expanded his repertoire over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Montreal, he was pure gas,'' Jefferies said. ``But in
Seattle, he learned to master the slider, and a changeup, too. He
and Maddux are the ultimate; unfortunately, they're both in the
National League.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillies manager Terry Francona didn't know what to make of
Johnson's performance. His team seemed mesmerized by the towering
6-10 lefthander, who was pitching before a frenzied capacity crowd
getting its first look at the new hero in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good, and he's tall, and he can be intimidating,''
Francona said. ``I don't think our guys got carried away with the
hype and everything. He's good, no question about that, but it was
9-0; it wasn't a good game to judge him.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch, the antithesis of Randy Johnson, gave the visitors no
chance. He was underpowering, in the middle of the plate and in way
over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his matchup with Johnson, Welch said, ``I knew he
was pitching, but he could have a good game or a bad game. I just
wanted to go out and pitch a good game. But when I had to come in
with the fastball, I couldn't hit my spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Francona observed that while all the attention now is on
Johnson, the rest of the Astros team is first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good ballclub, with good players and good role
players,'' the Phillies' manager said. ``They run Billy Spiers out
there about half the time, and he finds a way to beat you. They've
been waiting for Derek Bell to have a Derek Bell year, and he's
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sefcik says he thinks the crowd factor could weigh heavily in
the Astros' favor if the city unites behind the new pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crowd like that gets their team fired up,'' he said. ``They
play hard, but that's gonna make them play even harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Coors Field,'' he added, referring to the usually
sold-out home of the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, without Johnson, the crowd would have been about half
as big. And the Astros might not have had the same enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best in the game, and it looks like his
teammates are real excited _ and the fans too,'' Sefcik said.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder what the scene will be like when Johnson has
his good fastball.

With clever deals, 
good will abounds
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WHEN Randy Johnson joined the Astros, he didn't know much about
them or their Houston home. He hadn't done his homework, because
neither Houston nor the Astros seemed to figure in his future,
until he was told he had been sent our way.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his official posture remained somewhere between puzzled
and ambivalent. Houston? Nobody had said anything about Houston. No
matter. Johnson would be leaving his heart in Seattle, wherever he
landed. It didn't take him long, nonetheless, to see the upside
regarding his unanticipated exile to Southeast Texas, the summer's
particularly oppressive heat wave notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, you see, lead the National League in runs scored. As
a pitcher, he responded favorably to that tidbit of information.
</P>
<P>
   His new mates were a tad slow to prove it to him in Pittsburgh,
but a five-run outburst in the last two innings there assured him
of his first National League victory in a decade. Manager Larry
Dierker suggested afterward the Astros might have been nervous, or
at least overeager, playing behind such an esteemed presence.
</P>
<P>
   If so, they have apparently refound their comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Friday night's particulars, Johnson's tenure here
should be a spectacularly, and mutually, profitable experience,
however ephemeral it might prove in the end. Houston extended a
record-breaking ``howdy!'', his teammates got with the program in
kind by spotting him a nine-run lead, and in return he made the
traffic gridlock outside the Astrodome well worth the hassle.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Johnson work gives a ball fan religion in a hurry.
Suddenly, we're a city chock full of Unit-arians.
</P>
<P>
   The long, lefthanded drink of water sold 52,071 tickets in his
Houston debut, the most ever for a regular-season game, and his
performance _ merely a five-hit shutout with eight K's _ was such
that most of the folks are apt to return when he goes again
Wednesday night against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Do I hear any seconds for Gerry Hunsicker as baseball's
Executive of the Year?
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker, who Hun-suckered the Mariners out of Johnson right
before the no-more-switching hour July 31, might even have won Jeff
Bagwell's grudging vote. No Astro was angrier about the general
manager's losing Darryl Kile to the Rockies over the offseason, but
apparently no Astro is more delighted to play behind the Big Unit _
and hitting ahead of Big Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The reeling in of Moises Alou, the first Marlins big fish to get
away, gave the Astros the NL's best every-day offense that doesn't
play half its games above the tree line. But Alou's hefty price
tag, alas, hindered Hunsicker's efforts to retain Kile's services
and D.K. wound up taking a huffy hike to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, probably Kile's best buddy, didn't like it one bit. He
blasted Hunsicker for what he saw as an unacceptable gaffe, full of
deceit and dishonesty, not to mention stinginess. And then, Baggy
hit poorly early in the year, like the anger and frustration was
making his bat lead-heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Baggy was drinking _ to forget? _ in a Pittsburgh bar when he
got word Johnson had been added to the roster. He quickly bought a
round for the house and has been the happiest of campers ever
since. He drove in two runs Sunday afternoon on Johnson's behalf,
then pummeled the Phillies with two home runs and five RBIs Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he must see a glimmer of light at the end of the
Astros' tunnel. He realizes his team's potential, although he warns
of looking too far ahead into October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten everything we bargained for in Randy Johnson,''
he said. ``It's exciting. But let's get into the playoffs first. We
can talk about the World Series when we're in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk would have been laughable even nine days ago, when
Johnson practically had Yankees pinstripes painted on his
pinstripe-shaped frame, or so we thought. Now, guys like the
Phillies' Gregg Jefferies are shaking their heads and pronouncing
the Astros the new team to beat in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   ``With him,'' Jefferies said, ``I think Houston's better than
San Diego or Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, with Alou. Moises jacked No. 29 himself this
fine evening as his RBI count reached 97. Add Derek Bell's 82 and
Bagwell's 77 with a bullet, and Mr. Johnson must realize he has
come to the right place. Home Sweet Dome II.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful thing,'' Dierker said, a dreamy look in his
eyes.

2 Bagwell homers 
let Johnson breeze
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Do you believe in love at first sight? Astros fans apparently do.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Randy Johnson walked onto the field Friday
night, an Astrodome record crowd rose in support of its new hero.
Three hours later, the fans were still standing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, making his Dome debut, remained perfect with his new
club with a five-hit shutout and Jeff Bagwell hit two home runs to
pace the Astros to a 9-0 rout of the Philadelphia Phillies before a
sellout crowd of 52,071, the largest regular-season turnout in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know what a lot of rock stars feel like,'' said Johnson,
who received a standing ovation prior to the game while warming up.
``I got that occasionally from a couple hundred people in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got 50,000 it's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros offered customers a two-for-one deal on tickets to
the game. Johnson brought the strikeouts _ eight _ and his
teammates provided plenty of runs.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson got the `K' placards flashing after one batter when he
started with a strikeout of Doug Glanville. He did not allow a
runner past second base in his third shutout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Since his July 31 trade to Houston from Seattle, Johnson is 2-0
with a 1.13 ERA and 20 strikeouts in 16 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember losing too many games when the team scored
eight or nine runs,'' said Johnson, who has gone the distance in
four of his last six starts. ``I felt kind of spoiled today.
Overall, we played great defense and had a great offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made my job easier to go out there and throw strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros made sure Johnson didn't have to work too hard,
belting three home runs. Bagwell hit his 24th and 25th homers and
drove in a season-high five runs. Moises Alou added a two-run homer
and Bill Spiers was 3-for-5 with two doubles and a stolen base and
scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   The night, however, belonged to Johnson. The 6-10 lefthander
said he felt a little ``overwhelmed'' by all the attention given to
his first start in the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies know the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who increased his major league-leading strikeout total
to 234, struck out four of the first nine batters he faced and at
one point retired 10 in a row. Two of Philadelphia's five hits did
not make it out of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   He needed only 112 pitches, and three batters over the minimum
27, to send the Phillies to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually I thought (bench coach) Matt Galante and I were the
masterminds of the game tonight,'' said manager Larry Dierker. ``I
don't think we gave one single (pitching) sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hit home runs and pitch shutouts, you don't have to
think too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros provided Johnson all the support he needed with a
pair of four-run innings to build an 8-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers hit a one-out double to center field in the third inning
and Derek Bell walked. Three pitches and one flick of the bat
later, Bagwell sent a pitch from Philadelphia starter Mike Welch
(0-2) over the left center-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Then Alou singled, Tony Eusebio was hit by a pitch and Ricky
Gutierrez delivered an RBI double to put the Astros comfortably
ahead 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Craig Biggio led off with a walk, Spiers doubled
down the right-field line and Bell bounced out as Biggio scored.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell drove in a run with a fielder's choice that allowed
Spiers to slide home ahead of the throw to the plate by shortstop
Desi Relaford, and Alou followed with a two-run homer, his 29th, to
put the Astros in front 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   Alou's 29th moved him into a tie with Lee May for ninth on the
club's single-season home run list.
</P>
<P>
   Welch allowed eight runs, seven hits, four walks and two home
runs in 3 innings, and was handed a ticket to Class AAA
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell completed the scoring with a solo home run off Yorkis
Perez in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great thing for Houston,'' Bagwell said of the huge
turnout. ``Everybody had a lot of fun tonight. But I actually felt
sorry for the guy with all the pressure and expectations. I guess
it didn't bother him.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Phillies' view?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my job to rate their pitchers,'' manager Terry
Francona said. ``He's good. He's tall and can be intimidating, but
I don't think our guys got carried away with the hype. He is good
and he's hard to judge when the score gets like that.''
</P>
<P>
   After a nine-year absence, Johnson has shown a fondness for the
National League. But he said much of his early success has to do
with teams getting used to his first tour through the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test will be when I pitch again in Pittsburgh and
Philadelphia,'' Johnson said. ``The first time through the league,
teams probably know my characteristics being a power pitcher but
facing somebody that throws 95 to 98 miles per hour is a different
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make adjustments, and I'm assuming they will the next
time I face him. I don't walk on water. In due time I'm going to
get roughed up.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Johnson and his new admirers seem like the perfect
match.

RANGERS STAY HOT, STOP RED SOX, 4-3
</HEADLINE>

By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ These white-hot Rangers of August succeeded
where the sizzling Rangers of April and May failed.
</P>
<P>
   This collection beat Red Sox right-hander Pedro Martinez, and
last night's 4-3 victory at The Ballpark in Arlington required a
multitude of significant contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of those well-played ballgames where you can't
put a finger on any one particular play that won the game,'' said
first baseman Will Clark, whose two-run, first-inning home run
against Martinez (15-4) gave the Rangers a 3-0 advantage and
perhaps established the tone.
</P>
<P>
   The victory represented the Rangers' sixth consecutive and _
more importantly _ dropped the second-place Angels 21/2 games
behind in the American League West standings.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions _ even on an evening in which Martinez
recorded a season-high 13 strikeouts during his 62/3 innings _ came
from everywhere:
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Rick Helling (15-6) matched Martinez, one of the
league's leading candidates to receive the 1998 Cy Young Award, by
allowing only three runs on seven hits during his six-inning
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Closer John Wetteland, who pitched for the fourth consecutive
night and fifth time in six days, recorded his 31st save by
retiring the Red Sox's Nos. 1-3 hitters in order during the ninth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the job description,'' said Wetteland, who
retired first baseman Mo Vaughn on strikes to end the game for the
second time in as many nights. ``It's just nice to see that even
though I wasn't 100 percent, I still had something out there. This
would have been a very difficult one to let slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Eric Gunderson _ who entered this game having
surrendered six runs on seven hits, including three home runs,
during his previous three appearances _ retired the switch-hitting
Jason Varitek on an inning-ending foul pop with runners at first
and third in the eighth inning. It also required an
over-the-shoulder catch from Clark, whose back faced toward home
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Tim Crabtree, who had not pitched during the past
five games, replaced Helling and provided 12/3 innings of scoreless
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Tom Goodwin, left fielder Rusty Greer and third
baseman Todd Zeile also turned in defensive gems.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it's going to take down the stretch: Everybody
doing their job,'' Gunderson said. ``You've got to play like this
with the schedule and the teams we're playing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' pitching made a fifth-inning sacrifice fly ball _
actually a line drive _ off the bat of right fielder Juan Gonzalez
stand as the game-winning run after the Red Sox tied the score with
their three-run fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Helling issued only a walk through the first three innings
despite balls sent to the warning track by Red Sox right fielder
Darren Lewis, Vaughn and center fielder Damon Buford.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the shutout remained intact until a fourth-inning
single by left fielder Darren Bragg. The Red Sox tied the game
later in the inning with a run-scoring single by Buford and a
sacrifice fly ball off the bat of catcher Scott Hatteberg.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, though, likely deserved better than being strapped with
a three-run inning.
</P>
<P>
   Miscommunication between Greer and Goodwin resulted in a
potential fly-ball out off the bat of designated hitter Mike
Stanley being played into a long single. The ball landed between
the two outfielders. The Red Sox parlayed the extra out into one
and perhaps two extra runs after Stanley scored on Hatteberg's fly
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, though, would also prove generous.
</P>
<P>
   His fifth-inning throwing error on a sacrifice-bunt attempt
advanced Goodwin to third and allowed Alicea reach second. Alicea
ran inside the first-base line and forced Vaughn to throw over the
top. Vaughn's throw sailed over the head of second baseman Mike
Benjamin, and Gonzalez later delivered what proved to be the
game-winning run home with his line drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys played inspired all the way around,'' Wetteland said,
``and we beat one of the best in baseball.''

EASTON SUES NCAA; NEW GUIDELINES MAY BATTER FIRM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Easton Sports, the industry's leading aluminum
bat manufacturer, has filed a restraint-of-trade lawsuit against
the NCAA, seeking $267 million in damages and injunctive relief to
save the company's lucrative position in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's lawsuit came as a response to a decision made Thursday
by the NCAA Baseball Rules Committee to alter specifications on
bats used by college teams beginning Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If upheld, the rule change would render obsolete nearly 1.3
million bats already in circulation, costing the industry an
estimated $140 million and forcing companies to scramble to meet
the new standards by the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something you do only as a last chance when you have a
situation that becomes irrational,'' said Easton Sports chairman
Jim Easton, who has estimated that his 400-employee company could
lose between $75 million to $80 million under the new guidelines.
``(The NCAA decision) would keep us out of the market for about a
year, and we think it's unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of aluminum bats, often a touchy issue, became a hot
topic after this spring's College World Series, when the
high-scoring tournament culminated in USC's 21-14 victory over
Louisiana State in the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complained about the proliferation of scoring while
wondering about the safety of using the metal bats. The NCAA's
ruling Thursday would force a maximum batted-ball exit velocity and
change both size and weight specifications to make the bats perform
more like their wooden counterparts used in professional leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love scoring runs, so I don't have a problem with (aluminum
bats),'' said Cal State Northridge baseball coach Mike Batesole,
voted Collegiate Baseball's 1998 Coach of the Year. ``Nobody's
getting hurt out there, so from that standpoint I don't see the
logic. The real deal is the kids. They're just getting bigger and
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Easton said concerns about safety were overblown and thinks the
NCAA used the argument to justify its decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone puts a gun to your head, you have to react,'' he
said.

INJURY NEWS BAD FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Friday came and went without an update on the
status of center fielder Raul Mondesi and his ailing back, but the
injury report the Dodgers did receive was not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Jose Vizcaino (right ankle sprain) and starter Ismael
Valdes (strained stomach muscle) are both progressing more slowly
than hoped, and neither one is expected back soon.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino, out since June 22, was expected back within a week or
so, but manager Glenn Hoffman said the latest examination by Dr.
Philip Kwong determined it could be another three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just another blow for us,'' Hoffman said. ``And I'm just
feeling for him, because he's been working hard, trying to get
back.... I saw him out there moving, and he wasn't moving right.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, placed on the DL on July 27 and eligible to return
Tuesday, probably won't be activated for at least another week
after that. He played catch for a third straight day, increasing
his workout to about 12 minutes, but Valdes is still sore beneath
his rib cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not coming along,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes was a bit more optimistic: ``I'm improving. I'm feeling
better each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, meanwhile, missed his second straight game. He was
examined by Dr. William Dillin at the Anaheim branch of the
Kerlan-Jobe Clinic, then went to Centinela Medical Center in
Inglewood for an MRI and a bone scan on his stiff lower back. Test
results are due back today.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi has now missed four games and parts of two others with
the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman must wonder if he'll ever manage a game with the
Dodgers' best starting nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're gonna come back,'' he said of the injured parties.
``Injuries are part of the game. You just hope you can overcome
them and you can battle.... We're still not done battling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some key injuries, but let's just keep our fingers
crossed on the big guy in center field.''
</P>
<P>
   Young gunned: When the Dodgers' Eric Young hit into a double
play in the third inning Friday, it marked the first time all
season he had done so, a streak of 342 at-bats, longest in the
major leagues this season.

HOFFMAN DOOMED NO MATTER WHAT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Glenn Hoffman stood in the shade near the Dodgers'
dugout late Friday afternoon, surveying the scene before his team
opened the make-or-break homestand that followed the make-or-break
trip that followed the last make-or-break homestand.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rough trip. Before separate flights, the team plane had
a mechanical breakdown and an air-conditioning outage. In New York,
the equipment truck got into a fender bender. Oh, and to top it
off, the Dodgers lost three embarrassing games to the Montreal
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is happy to be home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little cooler out,'' he said, there in the shade. ``I
thought it was going to be hot.''
</P>
<P>
   But it (begin ital)was(end ital) hot. To feel it, he had only to
turn on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   There, with 50 days left in the season and the Dodgers clinging
to contention for a wild-card playoff spot, under circumstances
that always seem to spin just beyond his grasp, the heat on Hoffman
is being turned up in a most peculiar way.
</P>
<P>
   On the air, they're speculating about who will manage the
Dodgers in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyland? Davey Johnson? Bobby Valentine? Mike Scioscia? If
you have a telephone, you're eligible to join the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Hoffman? The name of the man in the manager's office
hardly comes up when the talk shows talk about next year. Not that
he's responsible for the Dodgers' place in the standings. He's just
(begin ital)not(end ital) coming back. That's the popular take.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Dodgers position is that everybody, including
Hoffman and general manager Tom Lasorda, is subject to evaluation
at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   And here's what's funny: On June 21, the night general manager
Fred Claire and manager Bill Russell were replaced, Lasorda was
introduced as the ``interim'' GM but Hoffman had no such qualifier
in his title. Yet the conventional wisdom was that, while Lasorda
has a chance to keep the job, Hoffman is simply a stand-in for a
Fox-friendly, high-profile manager to be named next winter.
</P>
<P>
   The theory: Dodgers management decided not to promote either
Scioscia or Reggie Smith, major-league coaches thought to be
managerial timber, because each might be too popular to easily push
aside at season's end. Hoffman, a lower-profile former Dodgers
player who had been managing the Albuquerque farm club, was the
perfect man for the job precisely because he wouldn't be missed.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Hoffman's concerned, he might be in limbo, but he's
not even sure of that. How hot is it really? Hoffman doesn't know.
He's in the shade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here right now,'' he said of the job. ``I'm not worried
about it. It's out of my control. What I do on the field with this
team is what I can control right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But not even that is strictly true.
</P>
<P>
   If he could control what happens on the field, would he have let
six Dodgers starters go on the disabled list, and four remain there
today, during his tenure?
</P>
<P>
   If he could control what happens on the field, would he have
asked for a revolving-door roster?
</P>
<P>
   If he could control what happens on the field, would Friday
night's game against the Pittsburgh Pirates have started, grimly,
with a Tony Womack ground ball slipping through Adrian Beltre's
legs for an error?
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were 36-38 when Russell was fired. They are 23-19
under Hoffman after winning 3-1 on Friday. The consensus is that
Hoffman is a good man doing a good job even if it might not be good
enough to put them in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into that right now,'' he said, asked if
it's fair to judge him on results, ``because I'm trying to do a job
out here with the guys I have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Injuries are part of the game that I can't control. So we've
just got to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't want to get into that, he also wants no part of
Lasorda's guarantee that the Dodgers will make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make guarantees,'' Hoffman said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   If he was given a mission on June 21, he thinks it was to help
the team ``get it going, somehow, some way.'' And ``I feel like
we've battled pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``the bottom line is winning,'' he admits, and if winning
means making the playoffs in October, then by next April, Hoffman
is probably going to be doing his managing in the minors again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty tough, to be evaluated on these three months,''
said first baseman Eric Karros, who thinks Hoffman has done a good
job. ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it might be, though, in this job in which Hoffman
started with nothing to lose but might end up with nothing to win. &QL;

SERGEANT PLANNED TO MAKE THE ARMY HIS CAREER 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 27-year-old career Army sergeant who grew up partly in the
small Missouri town where President Harry S. Truman was born and
who served in the Persian Gulf War, was identified by the Defense
Department late Friday as one of the eight Americans killed in the
terrorist explosion that tore through the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi,
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   While State Department officials declined to release the names
of any of the dead pending the notification of their families, the
Pentagon said that one of the victims _ the only military service
member killed in the blast _ was Sgt. Kenneth R. Hobson II, a
clerical aide to the embassy's defense attache.
</P>
<P>
   Another victim, Arlene Kirk, was identified by her brother,
Dennis Bradley of South Bend, Ind. In a telephone interview with
The Associated Press, he said she had just returned to Africa after
spending six weeks in the United States visiting relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson, who grew up mostly in Nevada, Mo., but who spent time in
nearby Lamar, the Truman birthplace near Missouri's western border
where his parents and a great aunt reside, had been in the Army
since 1989, and was posted to Nairobi last winter for a two-year
tour of duty. He took along his wife, Deborah, and their 2-year-old
daughter, Meghan.
</P>
<P>
   In Lamar, a community of 4,000 people, the sergeant's father,
Kenneth Hobson Sr., a Vietnam War veteran, and mother, Bonnie,
declined a request for a telephone interview Friday night. Hazel
Hicks, the sergeant's great aunt, said the parents had been swamped
and exhausted by the local news media and would say no more before
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But a neighbor and family friend, Leona Doyle, 72, said she had
known the sergeant since he was a boy, and she recalled a strong,
popular youth.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Lake Tahoe, Calif., on May 1, 1971, he was brought to
Missouri at an early age by his family and attended schools in
Lamar and Nevada, towns about 25 miles apart near Missouri's
western border with Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   He was known to friends as Kenny Ray, Mrs. Doyle said, and he
grew into a strapping 6-foot athlete with close-cropped dark blond
hair, a fair complexion and blue eyes. She said he played
basketball at high school in Nevada, graduating in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff William Griffitt of Barton County also knew Hobson
through his father, a communications officer for the Sheriff's
Department, and the sergeant's wife, a former secretary for the
department. Griffitt said the youth had enlisted in the Army in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   After basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., he spent time in
a variety of posts, including stations in Germany, in the Persian
Gulf during the 1991 conflict with Iraq, at Fort Campbell, Ky., and
in Monterrey, Calif., where he was trained in the Arabic language
for translation work. He also completed military intelligence
training at Ft. Gordon, Ga., and in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   He met his future wife, a native of Maine, who was also an Army
enlisted woman. After their daughter was born, Hobson was posted to
Washington to complete his military intelligence training, and his
wife and child moved in with the sergeant's parents until the
posting to Kenya last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Doyle, who lives two doors from the Hobson family, said the
sergeant loved the Army, and spoke often of being ``proud to be an
American.'' She said he had intended to make a career of military
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a loving boy, a very caring boy and such a family
man,'' Mrs. Doyle said in a voice that broke with emotion. ``He
loved his country and his home, and we are all shocked that he's
not coming home. It's a complete shock to the community that
something like this has happened to a Lamar boy.''

   Johnson, making his Dome debut, remained perfect with his new
club with a five-hit shutout and Jeff Bagwell hit two home runs to
pace the Astros to a 9-0 rout of the Philadelphia Phillies before a
sellout crowd of 52,071, the largest regular-season turnout in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I know what a lot of rock stars feel like,'' said
Johnson, who received a standing ovation prior to the game while
warming up. ``I got that occasionally from a couple hundred people
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got 50,000, it's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros offered customers a two-for-one deal on tickets to
the game. Johnson brought the strikeouts _ eight _ and his
teammates provided plenty of runs.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson got the ``K'' placards flashing after one batter when he
started with a strikeout of Doug Glanville. He did not allow a
runner past second base in his third shutout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Since his July 31 trade to Houston from Seattle, Johnson is 2-0
with a 1.13 ERA and 20 strikeouts in 16 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember losing too many games when the team scored
eight or nine runs,'' said Johnson, who has gone the distance in
four of his last six starts. ``I felt kind of spoiled today.
Overall, we played great defense and had a great offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made my job easier to go out there and throw strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros made sure Johnson didn't have to work too hard,
belting three home runs. Bagwell hit his 24th and 25th homers and
drove in a season-high five runs. Moises Alou added a two-run
homer, and Bill Spiers was 3-for-5 with two doubles and a stolen
base and scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   The night, however, belonged to Johnson. The 6-10 lefthander
said he felt a little ``overwhelmed'' by all the attention given to
his first start in the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies know the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who increased his major-league-leading strikeout total
to 234, struck out four of the first nine batters he faced and at
one point retired 10 in a row. Two of Philadelphia's five hits did
not make it out of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   He needed only 112 pitches, and three batters over the minimum
27, to send the Phillies to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I thought (bench coach) Matt Galante and I were the
masterminds of the game tonight,'' said manager Larry Dierker. ``I
don't think we gave one single (pitching) sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hit home runs and pitch shutouts, you don't have to
think too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros provided Johnson all the support he needed with a
pair of four-run innings to build an 8-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers hit a one-out double to center field in the third inning,
and Derek Bell walked. Three pitches and one flick of the bat
later, Bagwell sent a pitch from Philadelphia starter Mike Welch
(0-2) over the left-center-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Then Alou singled, Tony Eusebio was hit by a pitch and Ricky
Gutierrez delivered an RBI double to put the Astros comfortably
ahead 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Craig Biggio led off with a walk, Spiers doubled
down the right-field line and Bell bounced out as Biggio scored.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell drove in a run with a fielder's choice that allowed
Spiers to slide home ahead of the throw to the plate by shortstop
Desi Relaford, and Alou followed with a two-run homer, his 29th, to
put the Astros in front 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   Alou's homer moved him into a tie with Lee May for ninth on the
club's single-season home-run list.
</P>
<P>
   Welch allowed eight runs, seven hits, four walks and two home
runs in 3 innings, and was handed a ticket to Class AAA
Scranton-Wilkes-Barre after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell completed the scoring with a solo home run off Yorkis
Perez in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great thing for Houston,'' Bagwell said of the huge
turnout. ``Everybody had a lot of fun tonight. But I actually felt
sorry for the guy with all the pressure and expectations. I guess
it didn't bother him.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Phillies' view?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my job to rate their pitchers,'' manager Terry
Francona said. ``He's good. He's tall and can be intimidating, but
I don't think our guys got carried away with the hype. He is good,
and he's hard to judge when the score gets like that.''
</P>
<P>
   After nine years in the American League, Johnson has shown a
fondness for the National League. But he said much of his early
success has to do with teams getting used to his first tour through
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test will be when I pitch again in Pittsburgh and
Philadelphia,'' Johnson said. ``The first time through the league,
teams probably know my characteristics being a power pitcher, but
facing somebody that throws 95 to 98 miles per hour is a different
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make adjustments, and I'm assuming they will the next
time I face them. I don't walk on water. In due time, I'm going to
get roughed up.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Johnson and his new admirers seem like the perfect
match.

DODGERS DEFEAT PIRATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gary Sheffield's appeal of a three-game suspension
was denied by the National League, but when he returned from exile
Friday evening at Dodger Stadium, Sheffield looked appealing
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   With Raul Mondesi still out with a sore back, and the Dodgers in
dire need of a power source, Sheffield delivered two hits, a run
and an RBI in a 3-1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates before 41,676.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bohanon pitched a season-high 71/3 innings, giving up just
two hits and two walks, as the Dodgers mercifully ended their
losing streak at three games and kept their fading playoff hopes
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great win, it's given us a chance,'' Bohanon said.
``Everyone's counting us out. I think we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' being the wild-card playoff berth, which now stands five
games out of the Dodgers' reach but would have been much closer if
not for their three-game skid in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing road trip now behind them, the Dodgers tried
to find hope in opening a nine-game homestand that starts with six
games against bottom-feeders Pittsburgh and Florida. Of course, the
Expos were supposed to fit that category as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put all that behind us and move on. That's three
games that we'd like to forget,'' manager Glenn Hoffman said.
``We're just glad to be back and starting a good homestand right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   They're off to a nice start, in any case, thanks to Bohanon,
Sheffield and the sparkling defense of rookie third-baseman Adrian
Beltre. The 20-year-old's bat has yet to come alive, but he showed
off Gold Glove-like prowess at the hot corner, converting nine of
10 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre flubbed a Tony Womack grounder to start the game, then
followed with a series of spectacular assists, including a charging
snag of Womack's sacrifice bunt down the line in the top of the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one on the bunt play, you're not gonna see a better play
than that,'' Hoffman said. ``I've seen a lot of guys, but that was
pretty good right there. You've gotta go back a few years to see
some guys make that play....
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some tough hops, and he was aggressive to the ball.
That's what you like to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield and Jason Kendall, whose brawl last month led to
suspensions for both men, managed to keep the peace this time. But
Sheffield, who spent the entire Expos series at home in Florida,
was still upset Friday _ with the league, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought just by the fact they took up my time to come down
there (for the appeal hearing), maybe they wanted to review the
case. Why hear the case when your mind is already made up?''
Sheffield said. ``I didn't start the fight, and I didn't throw the
first punch.... If another man swings at you, you have to defend
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's swing was still in fine form despite the layoff. He
singled in the first inning, doubled and scored the Dodgers'
decisive second run in the fourth and drove in the third and final
run with a sacrifice fly in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must have been hitting in his backyard cage or something,''
Hoffman quipped. ``He gave us a lift in the middle of the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates wasted a surprisingly solid performance by the
well-traveled Todd Van Poppel, who allowed all three runs, two
earned, on eight hits in 61/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dodgers leading 1-0 on a Charles Johnson home run,
Kevin Young drove in Pittsburgh's only run and later tied the score
with an RBI double in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took the lead back immediately, as Sheffield scored
in the bottom of the inning on a double-play grounder by Bobby
Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Eric Young reached on an error by shortstop Kevin
Polcovich, then scored on Sheffield's sac fly.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon, the former Met who now has a 3-3 record and 2.25 ERA
with the Dodgers, did the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good tonight,'' he said. ``Hoff and Tommy (Lasorda),
they're giving me a chance to go out there every five days and show
what I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Which on this night, was just enough to keep the Dodgers'
postseason hopes intact.

METS' TROUBLES VANISH IN THIN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ They are the two New York Mets most likely to be booed.
But Friday night, a change of scenery made a difference for Mike
Piazza and Mel Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the not-so-friendly confines of Shea Stadium, the
embattled Piazza was 3-for-5 with a home run, a double and three
runs batted in, and he threw out a runner at second base. Piazza
raised his career batting average at Coors Field to .450.
</P>
<P>
   And then, after the Mets almost blew a seven-run lead, the
struggling Rojas, who earlier in the week had appealed to Manager
Bobby Valentine for more work, shut down the Colorado Rockies in
the seventh and eighth innings, and the Mets barely held on for an
8-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big stop, as good a performance as he's had all
year in as important a game,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Even John Franco, who has also been booed at home lately, was
able to close out his second save in his last five tries. The Mets
bailed out Rick Reed (13-7), who equaled his victory total of last
season, even though he tied his career highs in hits (12) and runs
allowed (7).
</P>
<P>
   It appeared shaky for Franco in the ninth, until he induced
Neifi Perez into lining out to shortstop Rey Ordonez with the tying
run on second to nail down his 22nd save.
</P>
<P>
   Franco extended both hands upward and looked to the sky.
``Usually a bloop hit falls in,'' Franco said. ``Finally I got a
line drive hit at somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza and Rojas had to feel the same way as the Mets (61-52)
pulled to within one and a half games of the Chicago Cubs in the
National League wild-card race.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is not a stretch of the imagination to believe Piazza will
wind up with the Rockies next season. Piazza, an All-Star catcher,
must have felt at home here Friday night. First of all, he was
booed. Second, he owns this park.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Friday night's game, Piazza was 42-for-95, with 11 home
runs and 34 runs batted in, at Coors Field. He hit a two-run home
run _ his 20th of the season _ in the top of the first, and then
capped a five-run second (all five runs were unearned) with a
run-scoring single up the middle, to give the Mets a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored all their runs with two outs, thanks to two
Colorado errors. One error _ by second baseman Mike Lansing on a
Tony Phillips grounder _ scored Brian McRae to make it 3-0. After
Edgardo Alfonzo singled to load the bases, John Olerud hit a
bases-clearing double into the left-field corner to give the Mets a
6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza followed with his run-scoring bouncer into center, and
the Mets were up by seven runs. Did someone say insurmountable? Not
at this altitude.
</P>
<P>
   In any other city, Reed would have coasted with such a cushion.
But no lead seems safe here.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who had last suited up at Coors Field as a member of the
National League All-Star team last month, had faced the minimum
nine batters over the first three innings, with a little help from
Piazza, who threw out Lansing on an attempted steal of second in
the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   But then Larry Walker lined his 15th homer of the season, with a
man on in the fourth, to make the score 7-2. And in the fifth, the
Rockies strung together four consecutive two-out hits, including a
two-run homer to center by Darryl Hamilton and a two-run double to
right-center by Dante Bichette. Suddenly, the score was 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who were able to knock Pedro Astacio from the game,
answered with a run in the top of the sixth on Ordonez's leadoff
double off Astacio, and Alfonzo's two-out sacrifice fly off
reliever Mike DeJean. But the Rockies scored again in the bottom of
the sixth on Vinny Castilla's leadoff double and Jeff Reed's
two-out single.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the bottom of the seventh, the Mets were clinging to an
8-7 lead when Valentine decided to bring in Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel did a great job,'' Franco said. ``He deserves a lot of
credit tonight. We're going to need Mel just as we're going to need
me and everyone else in that pen down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley entered the game 22-for-51 (.431) at Coors Field
with six home runs and 23 runs batted in. Hundley was 2-for-4 with
a double and a stolen base and is 5 for his last 7, raising his
batting average to .217. ... John Olerud's 21-game hitting streak
is the fourth longest in franchise history. Hubie Brooks holds the
club record of 24 games in 1984. ... The Mets, who could use some
bullpen help, nevertheless passed on the former Met Randy Myers,
who went from Toronto to San Diego on Thursday in a waiver-wire
deal. The left-handed Myers has five blown saves in 33 chances this
season and a 4.46 earned run average.

   A 27-year-old career Army sergeant who grew up partly in the
small Missouri town where President Harry S. Truman was born and
who served in the Persian Gulf War, was identified by the Defense
Department late Friday as one of the eight Americans killed in the
terrorist explosion that tore through the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi,
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   While State Department officials declined to release the names
of any of the dead pending the notification of their families, the
Pentagon said that one of the victims _ the only military service
member killed in the blast _ was Sgt. Kenneth R. Hobson II, a
clerical aide to the embassy's defense attache.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives identified two other victims as Arlene Kirk, 50, who
worked for the Air Force, and Molly Huckaby Hardy, 51, a veteran
State Department employee, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kirk's brother, Dennis Bradley of South Bend, Ind., said in
a telephone interview that she had just returned to Africa after
spending six weeks visiting their elderly parents in South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said Mrs. Kirk, 50, and her husband, Robert, had spent
about three years in Kenya. Kirk was a project director for the
State Department. Mrs. Kirk had found a job as an accountant in the
Air Force's budget department about six months ago, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a terrific mother and wife,'' Bradley said. ``She was
just a very supportive person, whatever was happening. She was
terrific. She was helping my parents, helping them however she
could.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple had three children. Their youngest, a girl, died from
cancer at age 5 in 1992, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hardy, a native of Valdosta, Ga., had been waiting for
almost two months to be relieved of her embassy duties in Kenya,
her mother told The Valdosta Daily Times Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was fixing to come home,'' Jayne Huckaby said as family
members gathered at her Valdosta home. ``She was supposed to be
home June 15. She was waiting for someone else to come over to take
her place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hardy had worked for the State Department for 26 years in
Brazil, Laos and other countries. She had told her mother she was
returning to the United States to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson grew up mostly in Nevada, Mo., but spent time in nearby
Lamar, the Truman birthplace near Missouri's western border where
his parents and a great aunt reside, had been in the Army since
1989, and was posted to Nairobi last winter for a two-year tour of
duty. He took along his wife, Deborah, and their 2-year-old
daughter, Meghan.
</P>
<P>
   In Lamar, a community of 4,000 people, the sergeant's father,
Kenneth Hobson Sr., a Vietnam War veteran, and mother, Bonnie,
declined a request for a telephone interview Friday night. Hazel
Hicks, the sergeant's great aunt, said the parents had been swamped
and exhausted by the local news media and would say no more before
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But a neighbor and family friend, Leona Doyle, 72, said she had
known the sergeant since he was a boy, and she recalled a strong,
popular youth.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Lake Tahoe, Calif., on May 1, 1971, he was brought to
Missouri at an early age by his family and attended schools in
Lamar and Nevada, towns about 25 miles apart near Missouri's
western border with Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   He was known to friends as Kenny Ray, Mrs. Doyle said, and he
grew into a strapping 6-foot athlete with close-cropped dark blond
hair, a fair complexion and blue eyes. She said he played
basketball at high school in Nevada, graduating in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff William Griffitt of Barton County also knew Hobson
through his father, a communications officer for the Sheriff's
Department, and the sergeant's wife, a former secretary for the
department. Griffitt said the youth had enlisted in the Army in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   After basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., he spent time in
a variety of posts, including stations in Germany, in the Persian
Gulf during the 1991 conflict with Iraq, at Fort Campbell, Ky., and
in Monterrey, Calif., where he was trained in the Arabic language
for translation work. He also completed military intelligence
training at Ft. Gordon, Ga., and in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   He met his future wife, a native of Maine, who was also an Army
enlisted woman. After their daughter was born, Hobson was posted to
Washington to complete his military intelligence training, and his
wife and child moved in with the sergeant's parents until the
posting to Kenya last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Doyle, who lives two doors from the Hobson family, said the
sergeant loved the Army, and spoke often of being ``proud to be an
American.'' She said he had intended to make a career of military
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a loving boy, a very caring boy and such a family
man,'' Mrs. Doyle said in a voice that broke with emotion. ``He
loved his country and his home, and we are all shocked that he's
not coming home. It's a complete shock to the community that
something like this has happened to a Lamar boy.''

YOUNG QBS MANNING, KITNA STEP INTO SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY _ Before writing off Saturday night's preseason game
between the Seahawks and Indianapolis Colts as just another
meaningless exhibition, consider what it means to the two young
quarterbacks who will start the game and the futures of their
teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' Jon Kitna and the Colts' Peyton Manning are making
their first preseason starts after arriving at this intersection
from opposite ends of the quarterback hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Manning is the football equivalent of royalty. Son of a former
NFL quarterback, Archie Manning. National high school player of the
year at Isidore Newman High in New Orleans. Runner-up for the
Heisman Trophy as a senior at Tennessee. First pick in April's NFL
draft. Recent recipient of an $11.6 million signing bonus, the
largest ever for an NFL rookie, as part of a six-year contract that
could be worth almost $48 million.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Kitna didn't start at quarterback at Tacoma's
Lincoln High School until his senior year. He went to Central
Washington University to play baseball. He cleaned dorm rooms for
two summers while attending college in Ellensburg. He joined the
Seahawks as a rookie free agent in 1996 only because coach Dennis
Erickson saw something in him that eluded everyone else in the NFL.
He is playing for the NFL minimum of $216,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting to see how Jon performs. That's why
we're giving him this opportunity,'' Erickson said. ``It's a
different opportunity for him than it's been in the last two
preseasons, where he's come in with the third and second groups and
done very well. Now he's got an opportunity to play with the
starters against their starters. We'll see exactly where he's at.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Manning offers, ``Obviously, it will be more
physical than I've ever played against. But I think I'm ready to
handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell Kitna or Manning that Saturday night's game doesn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna's performance is linked short-term to the club's
still-simmering contract talks with holdout Warren Moon, and
longer-term to the future of Erickson _ who is well aware that this
is a win-or-else season for him.
</P>
<P>
   It was Erickson who dubbed Kitna the quarterback of the future,
before Kitna quarterbacked Barcelona to the World League
championship and then won his first NFL start by rallying the
Seahawks past the Raiders in December. Some in the organization
feel the Seahawks have acquired enough talent and depth in the past
two offseasons that they can win with Kitna or John Friesz. If
Kitna performs well Saturday night, it will only add to the growing
sentiment of moving on _ with or without Moon.
</P>
<P>
   In Indianapolis, the Colts are starting over.
</P>
<P>
   They have a new general manager in Bill Polian, who was the
architect of the Buffalo Bills' Super Bowl teams and then built an
expansion team in Carolina that reached the NFC Championship game
in only its second season.
</P>
<P>
   They have a new coach in Jim Mora, the former Seahawks and
University of Washington assistant and head coach of the New
Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   They have a new, brighter future, and have placed it in the
hands of Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Once the game starts, however, the future will give way to the
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches on both sides are expecting the same things out of
us,'' Kitna said. ``It doesn't matter that he's getting paid what
he's getting paid and I'm getting paid what I'm getting paid, or
where we came from. All that's not going to matter once the game
starts.''
</P>
<P>
   That, in a word or a few, explains one of the things that
Kitna's coaches and teammates like best about him. The kid from
Tacoma is unaffected by all this.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Kitna was planning to finish his student-teaching
assignment in Yakima and become a high school math teacher when the
Seahawks called in April 1996 and invited him to a workout.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, nobody knew this guy even when he was leading Central
Washington to a share of the NAIA national title his senior season.
Erickson first saw Kitna only because he went to see his nephew
play.
</P>
<P>
   And remember, even Kitna admits his performances in training
camp and preseason didn't warrant him being carried on the practice
squad his first season.
</P>
<P>
   But here he is, taking the next big step toward the future _ his
and that of his team.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna's first step, however, could look like one from the past.
He reminds more than a few of Dave Krieg, the unorthodox producer
of so many impromptu plays during his stint as the Seahawks'
starting quarterback from 1983-91.
</P>
<P>
   Like Krieg, practice is almost too restrictive for Kitna. He is
at his best when things are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some aspects, we are the same,'' Kitna said of the Krieg
comparisons, which he considers a compliment. ``We're both scrappy,
and I don't think he cared what people thought about him and how he
looked on the field as long as he got the job done. That was his
mentality when I watched him growing up, and that's the same
mentality I have.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a mentality that has endeared Kitna to his teammates. Kitna
is a leader without trying to be. He is at ease and in control
whether surrounded by a group of defensive backs or in the company
of his offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it will be fun because Jon has a great attitude about
everything, and he is very calm and wants to make plays,'' running
back Ricky Watters said. ``I played with Steve Young (in San
Francisco) who wanted to make plays, and I see a lot of
similarities between the two.''

MARINERS EARN RARE DOUBLEHEADER SWEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Jamie Moyer surrendered a run to the Detroit Tigers
Friday night for the first time since becoming a Mariner, but
another first stood out even more.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Ibanez's first 1998 at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than five hours after putting on a Mariner uniform for the
first time since spring training, Ibanez delivered a game-winning,
pinch-hit double with the bases loaded in the eighth inning,
propelling Seattle to a 6-3 victory in the opener of a
double-header at Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer tamed the Tigers in the nightcap, running his personal
scoreless-innings streak against them to 27 before giving up a run
that didn't really matter as the Mariners rolled to a 7-1 victory
before 29,039 fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners got more good news Friday: first baseman David
Segui's knee injury is not as serious as it looked Thursday night
(see story, Page E2).
</P>
<P>
   In Friday night's nightcap, Alex Rodriguez hit his 34th homer
and came within a triple of hitting for the cycle for the second
time in 14 months at Tiger Stadium, Ken Griffey Jr. drove in two
runs and rookie left fielder Shane Monahan singled three times in
the Mariners' 13-hit assault against Tiger ace Brian Moehler and
two relievers.
</P>
<P>
   The sweep was Seattle's first since May 6, 1989 against
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The M's had split their nine previous doubleheaders and might
have divided this one if not for Ibanez.
</P>
<P>
   Promoted from Class AAA Tacoma Friday in case Segui's knee
injury proved serious, Ibanez joined the Mariners without much
rest. But he used an adrenaline surge to deliver the most important
hit of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was well worth bringing him up,'' manager Lou Piniella
said. ``Something like that (game-winning double) picks up the
whole team.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's news was certainly more welcome than Thursday's. While
the M's were being rained out Thursday night and Segui's right knee
locked up, Ibanez was in Nashville, Tenn., playing most of the 13
innings in Tacoma's 2-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   After sleeping for about two hours, Ibanez flew to Detroit early
Friday morning, unaware of Segui's injury or the Mariners' plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty tired when I got here,'' Ibanez said, ``but I
found some energy. I think the adrenaline kicked in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibanez watched as Mariner reliever Bobby Ayala squandered a
two-run lead in the seventh inning. He then grabbed a bat in the
eighth with the game tied and a new teammate on every base.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me (Tiger reliever Matt Anderson) throws hard and
hit the first good pitch I saw,'' said Ibanez, referring to a chat
with his teammates. ``I got the fat part of the bat on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had loaded the bases on Edgar Martinez's leadoff double
and one-out walks to Russ Davis (intentional) and pinch-hitter Joe
Oliver (unintentional).
</P>
<P>
   When Tiger manager Buddy Bell changed pitchers, Piniella changed
batters, switching from right-handed hitting John Marzano to the
left-handed Ibanez. Although it was a predictable move, it also was
a bold move by Piniella, considering M's left-handed pinch-hitters
were a combined 1-for-23 this season and no RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Ibanez, oblivious to the season-long trend, drilled a
first-pitch double into right-center, putting the M's ahead for
good. Monahan added an RBI single to center, leaving Heathcliff
Slocumb and Mike Timlin to protect the second three-run lead of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Both got the job done. Slocumb got the win, his second, and
Timlin secured his eighth save.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, however, prevented Jeff Fassero from winning his 11th
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner starter had trouble breathing because of the high
humidity and finally departed in the sixth inning after walking
Bobby Higginson with two outs. Detroit catcher Joe Siddall had
opened the inning with his first career home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't pitched in humidity like this in a long time, and I
couldn't breathe,'' Fassero said. ``I was just trying to throw
strikes and throw as few pitches as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero said Florida is the only other place that bothered him
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer, his rotation sidekick, wasn't bothered as much by the
humidity as the Tiger Stadium pitching mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had horrible command of my pitches,'' Moyer said. ``The
mound is different here (than other parks) and I couldn't figure it
out until the fifth inning. But I battled through it and eventually
got into a groove.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped that the Mariners pounced on Moehler early.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Cora's leadoff single and Rodriguez's first hit, a double,
ignited a two-run first inning. Seattle tacked on three more in the
second inning with Cora, Griffey and Martinez driving in the runs.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer bobbed and weaved his way through the first four innings,
leaving the bases loaded in the first, another runner on base in
the third and pitched through a leadoff double by Geronimo Berroa
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   His shutout streak ended in the fifth when Joe Randa singled and
eventually scored on Higginson's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain why I've had so much success against them,''
said Moyer, who has a 5-2 record and 1.94 ERA in 16 career games
against the Tigers. ``I feel they have a lot of (offensive) threats
on that team.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
made a few cautionary comments about the economy and uttered an
ominous warning about ``irrational exuberance'' among stock market
investors. Investors were jolted upright for a few days, then
shrugged, and stock prices soared even higher in the months
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Greenspan gave a surprisingly upbeat report on the
economy and suggested that stock prices did not appear out of line
with the current good times. Almost immediately, investors grew
wary, and stock prices beat a retreat that quickened considerably
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Which, among rational souls, raises perplexing questions. Does
the stock market's performance have anything to do with the outlook
for the economy? Can the economy be helped or hindered by the
performance of the stock market? And, above all, which comes first:
a strong economy or a bull market? Recession or crash?
</P>
<P>
   The mystifying nature of that chicken-or-egg quandary is no
longer solely a topic in ivory towers. Down in the barnyard, the
groundlings know that they are expected to play a big part in
determining the future of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, on cue, individual investors reacted to the
market's swoon with predictable bleatings about buying
opportunities and impending rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual investors believe they have learned that the
market, like Joe Palooka, always bounces back,'' said Ira Kaminow,
an economist and president of Capital Insights Group, a Washington,
D.C., consulting firm. One day the market will not bounce back,
however, and a sustained decline will lead to a drop in consumer
spending, now a key source of fuel for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would take a fairly substantial and persistent
decline, one lasting six to nine months, for their enthusiasm and
optimism to begin to wane,'' Kaminow said.
</P>
<P>
   When the downturn comes, the effect might be more pronounced
than it was during the boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the way up, the stock market's gains did not boost spending
as much as people had expected,'' said Anthony Chan, chief
economist at Banc One Investment Advisors, based in Columbus, Ohio.
``For every $1 of capital gains, we've seen consumer spending rise
by about 3 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the black ink on investors' mutual fund account
statements starts turning to red, he said, ``for every $1 in losses
we'll see a decline in consumption of 4 to 4.5 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the performance of the stock market influences whether
individuals spend money, and thus affects the nation's economy. The
savings rate has fallen to historic lows in recent months not
because people believe that they do not need to put away a few
dollars for retirement. Rather, they have grown to believe they can
put away some loose change, then wait for the ever-rising stock
market to turn that into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   With the rest of their money _ some of which they would
otherwise be saving _ individuals feel free to buy new cars, take
more exotic vacations, finish paneling the basement or likewise
spend on frills that they would have ignored.
</P>
<P>
   That spending creates demand for goods, causing factories to
hire workers to assemble automobiles, staff hotels and churn out
linoleum. Sales of their products and services create greater
profits for those companies; higher earnings help to boost the
companies' stock prices, resulting in greater returns for and Ms.
Spendthrift's mutual funds. The virtuous circle starts anew.
</P>
<P>
   The rising tide, moreover, lifts even the heaviest boats. The
gains that average Americans reap from their investments result in
more tax dollars for federal and state coffers. Budget surpluses,
in turn, lead to calls for lower taxes and even greater optimism
among individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock market can also work against the economy, quickly
turning the virtuous circle into a vicious cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger can be anything _ Asian tremors, the unraveling of a
merger, a border skirmish. Often, traders sell first, leaving the
questions for later.
</P>
<P>
   When capital gains turn into capital losses, government revenues
dry up, as does spending by consumers, as does hiring by companies.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan recently pointed out that Japan had a similar
experience. Revenues were pouring into the government during the
bubble economy, then when things turned bad, the deluge turned into
a drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that respect,'' Kaminow said, ``the Japanese might be seven
to nine years ahead of where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States over just the last three and a half years,
sharp gains in the stock market have produced substantial profits
for most people in their mutual funds. Those profits have been
maintained even as many individual stocks have suffered big
declines.
</P>
<P>
   In each year since the beginning of 1995, investors have poured
a record amount of money into mutual funds that invest in American
stocks, and the total in the first six months of 1998 is ahead of
last year's pace.
</P>
<P>
   Weighting those $600 billion of investments by the stock-market
levels at which they were made shows that Americans have aggregate
profits of 45 percent over that three-and-a-half year span.
Clearly, it would take a much sharper decline than last week's to
get their attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the current stock market decline is enough to
drag consumption growth down to recessionary levels,'' said Chan
said on Thursday. ``Before we get there, we'll need to see
employment growth slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy
added jobs in July at the slowest pace in more than two years.
Weakness in the manufacturing sector could easily be traced to the
General Motors strike, but service companies, like those in the
financial industry, also slowed. The stock market responded by
moving higher.
</P>
<P>
   A market downturn could give a sharp and sudden jolt to
employment, however.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in the securities market has spawned rapid growth not
only in the financial services industry but also in the innumerable
pilot fish that swim alongside _ more mutual fund salesclerks, more
real estate agents selling apartments to bonus-toting brokers, more
deliverymen bringing sandwiches to late-night dealmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the equity market doesn't continue to do very well, the
first areas you'll see it is in the Northeast,'' particularly New
York City, Chan said. ``The market has driven real estate prices in
New York. The luxury sectors will start to slow. And at some point
it will spill over into Main Street.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what is the likelihood that the current weakness will morph
into a brutish downturn anytime soon? ``It's a non-trivial
probability,'' said Kaminow. ``But less than 50-50. I'm more
optimistic than pessimistic, but compared to a year ago, I can see
the dangers more easily.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Greenspan, he is undoubtedly happy that investors are
heeding his words, said Chan. ``The entire Federal Reserve is
probably dancing in the street after seeing that some of the air
was let out of the market.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Assuming his usual role defending and defending and
defending President Clinton on television, Lanny Davis looked a bit
weary last Wednesday night on MSNBC's ``The News With Brian
Williams.'' He was spun out.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, he had been interviewed by MSNBC's Keith
Olbermann and by CNBC's Geraldo Rivera. Wednesday morning, he had
answered the call of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on Williams' show, he was sparring with the conservative
pundit Laura Ingraham, who was once more grinding her heel into
Bill Clinton, lambasting ``the O.J. presidency.'' Davis, a former
special counsel for the Clinton White House, could only muster a
muted response, protesting the attack as ``entirely unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a They-Shoot-Lawyers-Don't-They? marathon for viewers
of the legal analysts who fog up the TV screens with talk about the
Monica Lewinsky investigation. With the drama peaking as Ms.
Lewinsky met the grand jury, the babble about transactional
immunity, obstruction and executive privilege grew even more
feverish. The usual suspects were lined up like shuttles at the
Washington airport on a Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Davis interrupted a business trip to make a round of appearances
because, he said, he felt an obligation to ``defend President
Clinton and bring some balance to some of the coverage.'' Davis
returned to Patton Boggs &AMP; Blow, one of the biggest law and
lobbying firms in Washington, earlier this year. But he said he
checks in with the White House for the latest public information
before he goes on television.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing their nightly star turns might end after the Monica case
fades, the pundits are making the most of every moment _ even if it
means interrupting vacations. Stuart Taylor, legal affairs writer
for The National Journal, agreed to let a crew from MSNBC interview
him on Cape Cod. Bugs were swarming around Taylor, who was
outdoors. ``I was trying not to swat at them while I was on
camera,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The gaggle of legal analysts appearing on
all-Monica-all-the-time cable news shows has grown because, despite
polls showing a lack of public concern about the investigation,
ratings still soar for moments like Linda Tripp's courthouse plea
for sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon exploded with the O.J. Simpson case, which made
CNN's Greta Van Susteren, Johnnie Cochran and most of the lawyers
on both sides TV stars, and has escalated with the president's
legal travails. Like Ms. Van Susteren, many of the Simpson pundits
have permutated into Clinton pundits, notwithstanding any lack of
political expertise.
</P>
<P>
   In the Simpson case, the commentators were usually former
prosecutors or criminal defense attorneys with no particular stake
in the outcome. In the Lewinsky case, the affiliations of some
commentators are more complex and, in some cases, obscured. Like
reporters, legal analysts have embraced the culture of conflict,
choosing sides so they can bark at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' former job as the White House's spinner-in-chief makes
his sympathies obvious to most viewers, and Jack Quinn, the former
White House counsel who might return in a Gore administration, is
an obvious Clinton partisan. Quinn has downgraded the president's
alleged sin so many times that he now argues that, even if there
was a relationship with the intern, it was consensual and
therefore, ``trivial.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor caused a stir when it came out that he had considered
joining Starr's staff, a fact rarely mentioned now. The ideological
or partisan backgrounds of other analysts aren't always disclosed,
either.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bradford Berenson, a Washington lawyer who has
appeared often as a legal commentator on the Lewinsky case, is
usually identified as a criminal law expert. Berenson, a 1991
Harvard Law School graduate, practices criminal defense law in the
Washington office of Sidley &AMP; Austin, a Chicago-based firm. He is
also active in the Federalist Society, a group of conservative
lawyers that includes Starr. He said in an interview that he has
met Starr three times and is close to several younger lawyers who
worked on Starr's Whitewater investigation. It was those friends
who first encouraged him to talk to reporters and producers about
the Starr investigation, Berenson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that I'm sympathetic to Starr and feel he's been
unfairly treated by the White House,'' he said. ``But I try to be
clear and objective and I don't spin for anyone.'' He said some
interviewers do mention his conservative leanings when they
introduce him.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Olson also frequently provides analysis on the Starr
investigation and is often identified as a former prosecutor. Mrs.
Olson worked in the U.S. attorney's office in Washington for three
years and is in demand because she is telegenic and offers clear
explanations of legalities.
</P>
<P>
   But her resume also includes prominent partisan positions, like
counsel to Republicans on House and Senate committees that
investigated alleged Clinton administration ethical improprieties
and Democratic fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Olson began receiving television invitations _ from
Rivera and CNN _ the appearances were mainly at night. Then she
began receiving daytime invitations, too. So she asked for and was
given a leave of absence by her boss, Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.
Then, in June, her appearances became so frequent that Mrs. Olson
resigned. In an interview, she said, ``I didn't want there to be
any questions about whether I was voicing his opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Olson and her husband, the lawyer Theodore Olson, are also
close friends of Starr. While this fact isn't part of Mrs. Olson's
usual introduction, she said she sometimes referred to her
friendship with the independent counsel in her comments about him.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons she wanted to talk about the Starr
investigation on television was that other legal commentators were
calling Starr's tactics ``unheard of,'' she said. ``It sounded out
of line and like politics. It seemed so lopsided and that I could
add some balance.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Mrs. Olson's Democratic counterparts, Richard
Ben-Veniste, who served as counsel to the minority during the
Senate's Whitewater probe, also appears on television frequently to
discuss the Lewinsky case. Like Mrs. Olson, Ben-Veniste, a veteran
of the Justice Department's Watergate Task Force, is usually
identified as a former prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Giuffra, a New York lawyer, is frequently identified as a
``former Whitewater special counsel'' or a ``former Senate
Whitewater counsel,'' but his background is more complex. He was
hired three years ago by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., as chief
counsel to the Republican majority on the Senate Banking Committee,
which conducted a Whitewater investigation under D'Amato's
direction. Before that, Giuffra had represented D'Amato's brother,
Armand, successfully appealing his mail-fraud conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In a sound-bite culture, when there are only a few minutes for
each lawyer to offer his comments, it's impossible to provide
detailed resumes for all guests. One network producer said his
Sunday public affairs show was careful to quiz guests about their
ideological or partisan affiliations so that panels could be
assembled with a variety of points of view, even if individual
affiliations weren't fully disclosed on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Several law professors are also in demand. Georgetown's Paul
Rothstein, who also offered commentary during the Simpson case,
said, ``The public and network appetite for commentary is
surprisingly large.'' Rothstein, who appears on network and local
television several times a week, said he found it difficult to
discuss ``grungy sexual matters and the president in the same
breath.''
</P>
<P>
   And on a clear day, you can see Jonathan Turley forever. The
George Washington University professor specializes in environmental
law, and he certainly knows how to permeate the atmosphere. He
instantly blossomed into the most promiscuous quote on Ms. Lewinsky
and the president, saturating newspapers as well as NBC's ``Today''
show, ABC's ``Nightline,'' NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' CNN's
``Crossfire'' and other cable shows.
</P>
<P>
   Why do they do it? Lanny Davis, being lawyerly, answered the
question with a question. ``How do you spell meshugana?''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans love lists, even bad ones, which serve mainly to start
conversations about what is and is not on them.
</P>
<P>
   Establishmentarians hate lists, unless they are the ones making
them, especially as a marketing gimmick. The recent roster of the
100 best novels of this century, promulgated by the Modern Library
division of Random House, met endless snickers among the culturally
refined. The New Yorker mocked the very idea with a cartoon
suggesting an even more outlandish undertaking _ it showed the New
York Metropolitan Museum of Art dressed in a banner proclaiming
``One Week Only! The 100 Greatest Paintings of All Time.''
</P>
<P>
   But if learned panels can choose the 100 greatest novels, movies
or even historically influential people, why not the 100 greatest
works of art? Art world cognoscenti say it cannot and should not be
done. There is too much art to consider. Visual art, unlike novels,
movies and television, has been around since the beginning of
recorded history.
</P>
<P>
   And artists seem to churn out much more than their peers in
other disciplines. Van Gogh, for example, painted for only 10 years
before committing suicide at the age of 37 but still left behind
2,000 paintings and drawings. Vermeer, with just three dozen works
to his credit, is considered a slacker. So maybe, some experts
said, you could produce a list of the 1,000 greatest works of art,
but no fewer than that.
</P>
<P>
   Each piece of art is unique and should be experienced in person
_ which complicates matters. Many experts believe that the
16th-century Isenheim altarpiece painted by Matthias Grunewald is a
masterpiece that should be on anyone's top 100 _ anyone who has
made the trip to Colmar, France, where it resides.
</P>
<P>
   Even when art experts concede the inherent entertainment value
of a list, they just don't think that the 100 greatest works of art
promotes art the way parallel lists prompt people to reach for
books and watch movies. That's because viewing art takes more
initiative; you have to go to it. Arnold Lehman, director of the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, has another objection. ``By putting an
object on a list, you're turning it into a precious commodity in a
way that doesn't benefit art. People see the value, the dollar
signs and who owns the object before they see the object. That
cheapens this incredible, tangible expression of genius.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may be too late. Two people who strive to popularize art
are already doing the inconceivable. Thomas Hoving, the former
director of the Metropolitan Museum, and Sister Wendy Beckett, the
British nun whose television programs and books have made her a
one-woman art industry, have separately compiled lists. Neither
author follows the top-100 rubric to the letter, nor arranges the
choices in any order, but it hardly matters. Hoving's book, titled
``Greatest Works of Art of Western Civilization'' (Artisan, 1997),
promises to give readers ``the pinnacles of quality, elegance and
artistic strength, the best mankind has created, the hallmarks of
unalloyed genius.''
</P>
<P>
   The icons are there _ van Gogh's ``Starry Night,'' Vermeer's
``View of Delft,'' Manet's ``Bar at the Folies Bergere,'' Titian's
``Rape of Europa,'' Munch's ``Scream.'' But so are some surprises _
George Bellows' ``North River,'' Montezuma's headdress, Leonardo da
Vinci's ``Woman with an Ermine'' (but not the ``Mona Lisa.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Sister Wendy's Favorite Things,'' a list of 75 items, is due
out mid-1999. Her publishing company, Harry N. Abrams, declined to
disclose exactly what will be included but offered a taste of her
taste: classics like the bust of Nefertiti from 1360 B.C. and
Pierre Bonnard's ``The Open Window.'' Sister Wendy also wants to
surprise, so she will include the Metropolitan's 16th-century
carving of St. Anthony Abbot, a 19th-century Shaker table from the
Philadelphia Museum of Art and George Stubbs' ``Mare and Foals in a
Wooded Landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Even from this scant evidence, a consensus emerges. Hoving chose
Nefertiti, too, and Sister Wendy picked the same Manet and Vermeer
paintings as he did. Hoving chose Michelangelo's ``David,'' while
Sister Wendy selected his ``Creation of Man'' in the Sistine
Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Marzio, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts in
Houston, is one member of the establishment who is not horrified by
the whole subject. He even suggested two lists, one drawn up by
experts and one voted on by the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know what the general public thinks are the
greatest works of art,'' Marzio said. ``It would probably be Monet,
Monet and Monet at the top. The one work that might make it on both
lists is the `Mona Lisa,' and maybe the bust of Nefertiti.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. Maybe the whole idea isn't such a stumper, after all.

   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ For anyone setting out to write a history
of recent strife in Central Africa, few opening lines could be more
tempting these days than: In the beginning there was Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The former Zaire, now again known as Congo, has certainly
figured more in the news in the last two years as the continent's
most graphic study in strife. It has seen the fall of its longtime
dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, and the rise of his conqueror, Laurent
Kabila, at the head of a stunningly successful African foreign
legion.
</P>
<P>
   As if jealous of its notoriety, Congo even staged a news
comeback last week with a reprise of the very kind of rebellion
Kabila led two years ago, with the difference that this time Kabila
was the intended target.
</P>
<P>
   But if Congo, this continent's third largest country, has been
the scene of most of Central Africa's recent dramas, a primary
actor has been operating barely off stage in each of them:
minority-ruled Rwanda, one of the continent's smallest nations.
Repeatedly, it has intervened to pursue its self-defined interests
in a sphere that seems to include a quarter of the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the Congo crisis on the BBC, Philip Reyntjens, a
Belgian expert in Central African affairs, recently explained that
the country's renewed troubles result from two unresolved problems:
the legal status of eastern Congo's so-called Banyamulenge
population, and Rwanda's own festering conflict between its large
and disenfranchised Hutu majority and the Tutsi regime that seized
power in the midst of a campaign of genocide aimed against its
people in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Banyamulenge are relatively recent arrivals in Congo, most
of them having migrated from Rwanda one to three generations ago;
considering that fact, it is no longer hard to imagine that Congo's
recent crises are, to a large degree, expressions of tiny Rwanda's
own intractable problems.
</P>
<P>
   With its lush, hilly countryside, where the next village seems
to begin as soon as the last has ended, no country in Africa is as
densely populated as Rwanda. And when the long-poisoned relations
between the Hutu (85 percent of the population) and Tutsi (15
percent) boil over in violence, as they have repeatedly and on a
terrible scale, Rwanda's less crowded neighbors typically pay the
price.
</P>
<P>
   The unwritten rule of these dramas, with their death tolls
routinely running into the hundreds of thousands, is that the
region's sickest countries _ the poorest and least well governed _
bear the brunt.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, following a massive exodus of Tutsi from Rwanda
after a series of massacres in the early 1960s, that burden was
carried by neighboring Uganda, which by the 1970s had become the
sick man of the region.
</P>
<P>
   During his own rise to power at the head of a guerrilla
insurgency, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni recruited as many as
a quarter of his fighters from his country's large Tutsi immigrant
population, many of whom were fixated on revenge for Hutu attacks
that had driven them into exile.
</P>
<P>
   Then, shortly after winning power in 1986, Museveni began to
back Tutsi efforts to overthrow the Hutu-led government in Rwanda
by force _ in part to repay a debt to people who had fought at his
side, and in part so as not to be forever saddled with a large
group of foreign exiles whose presence was arousing resentment.
</P>
<P>
   After years of up and down struggle, the Uganda-based Tutsi
fighters triumphed in 1994, capturing the Rwandan capital of Kigali
in a lightning offensive and restoring Tutsi authority over the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of their victory could hardly have been more
tragic, however. The final Tutsi assault on the capital came amid
one of the century's worst bouts of ethnic cleansing, in which Hutu
militias waged a machete-wielding extermination campaign against
ordinary Tutsi. At least half a million people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the scene of their crime, as many as 2 million Hutu then
left Rwanda, and most settled in the region's newest basket case:
Mobutu's Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   Although few saw it at the time, from that moment the history of
the Congo came to be dominated by the problems of its vastly
smaller neighbor, Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of huge refugee communities quickly upset an
already delicate ethnic balance in eastern Zaire, helping revive
local resentment of anyone seen as Rwandan, especially the
so-called Banyamulenge.
</P>
<P>
   From their sprawling refugee camps where the United Nations fed
them, the Hutu exiles began attacking their homeland, waging
hit-and-run attacks on army posts and butchering innocent
civilians. Their apparent aim was to make Rwanda ungovernable for
the Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda, using as a pretext a regional governor's threat to strip
the Banyamulenge residents of eastern Zaire of their Zairian
citizenship, mounted a scarcely concealed invasion of its western
neighbor aimed at cleaning out the Hutu refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   Mortar attacks near Goma and Bukavu quickly sent at least
200,000 Hutu refugees, including genocidal militiamen hiding among
them, fleeing westward. Another 700,000 Hutu returned home on foot,
preferring to take their chances in Rwanda. As it pursued the Hutu
into the Zairian bush, Rwanda scrambled to hammer together a
coalition of anti-Mobutu forces in the region who could serve as a
front for their invasion.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, the story of how Zaire became Congo is none
other than the story of how Rwanda pursued its civil war in
neighboring territory. As Rwandan-led insurgents chased Hutu
refugees across Zaire, the crumbling of Mobutu's large national
army surprised all involved.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, as the Rwandan-led ``rebellion'' swept Zaire, Kabila,
the Rwandan-selected front man for the invasion, went from being an
obscure and inconsequential Mobutu opponent to
President-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   International impatience with Mobutu, who had been promising a
transition to democracy for five years, and a deep streak of
sympathy for Rwanda's Tutsi over the recent genocide, preempted
most criticism of the Rwandan invasion.
</P>
<P>
   If the outside world failed to get upset about Rwanda's Zairian
adventure, in recent months Rwanda itself began to show signs of
disgust at the outcome. Perhaps in anticipation of promised
elections, President Kabila had begun to weed out prominent Tutsi,
who have come to be as resented in Congo as they once were in
Uganda, from his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Even more seriously from Rwanda's perspective, Kabila has proven
unable to stop raids from eastern Congo by Hutu insurgents that
have turned much of western Rwanda into a killing ground.
</P>
<P>
   Now fighting for its survival against another Rwandan-led
uprising in Congo, Kabila's government has complained bitterly that
the international community has become blind in its sympathy with
Rwanda. Because of the 1994 genocide, Congolese officials say, the
world tolerates adventures by Rwanda in Central Africa that would
be seen as outrageous almost anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be hard to work up much sympathy for Kabila, given that
he allowed himself to be installed by the Rwandans,'' said one
Central African diplomat. ``But what we are all realizing is that
over the long term there is going to be trouble in our region until
the problems of Rwanda itself can be sorted out. And almost no one
seems to focus on that.''

   NEW DELHI, India _ In an era when some of the world's bitterest
disputes have begun to give way to accommodation, the enmity
between India and Pakistan over Kashmir erupted again over the past
10 days in ways that underscored how intractable and potentially
dangerous the confrontation has become, especially since both
countries have now demonstrated their ability to build and detonate
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike hostilities that have yielded, or begun to yield, in
Germany, Ireland, the Middle East and South Africa, those in
Kashmir show every sign of being frozen in time. After 50 years of
division, two wars and ceaseless propaganda, the territory remains
the touchstone of all that sets India and Pakistan apart _ all the
religious, cultural and territorial passions that have raged since
the partition of British India in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it remains the most likely flashpoint of another war,
one with potential now to involve nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hazards, just about everybody involved, including
ranking Indian and Pakistani officials and Western emissaries who
have talked with both sides, seems to agree that the issue is so
tangled in resentments that there is almost no likelihood of
settlement, and that the 1.1 billion people of Pakistan and India
will stay hostage to the dispute for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   From this pessimistic viewpoint, India will continue to regard
the predominantly Muslim territory as essential to its security and
coherence as a secular state; Pakistan will press, without real
hope of success, for India to honor its pledge in the 1950s to
allow a United Nations-supervised plebiscite among Kashmir's 9
million people to choose between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The latest demonstration of the intransigence on both sides came
in Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, when the two prime ministers,
Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India and Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan, met
during an annual conference of South Asian leaders at the end of
July, only to fall quickly into old arguments over Kashmir. Still
unable to agree even on procedures for discussing the territory,
Vajpayee and Sharif abandoned plans to restart broader negotiations
that have faltered on and off throughout the 1990's.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the leaders reached home, their failure was echoing
in Kashmir. Artillery duels across the 550-mile ``line of control''
that separates the Indian and Pakistani armies reached a new
crescendo, killing dozens of civilians. Before dawn Monday, armed
men identified by Indian police as Kashmiri Muslim rebels crossed
from the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir into the neighboring
Indian state of Himachal Pradesh and opened fire on two groups of
sleeping construction workers. Police said that 34 men, most or all
of them Hindus, died, with a dozen others wounded. Later in the
week, at least another 50 people died in similar attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, at least 30,000 and perhaps 50,000 civilians
have been killed in the Kashmir dispute, most of them victims of
the struggle between Indian forces and Muslim rebels that Pakistan
has armed and financed in the Kashmir Valley, the heartland of the
old, undivided Kashmir. Unable to seriously challenge Indian
control in the valley, the rebels have shifted their attacks
increasingly into less heavily-fortified areas to the south, and
now beyond Kashmir's borders. These forays employ terror tactics,
mostly against Hindus, that have prompted waves of anger across
India.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter in Himachal Pradesh was at least the seventh such
incident involving unarmed Hindu victims this year. Villagers at a
remote settlement have had their throats cut for refusing to eat
beef on the orders of Muslim rebels, and members of two wedding
parties have been gunned down while waiting for buses to take them
home. Counterpart attacks across the frontier in the Pakistan-ruled
part of Kashmir, with Muslim civilians as victims, have been blamed
by Pakistan on Indian commandos. Although India has denied the
Pakistani allegations, Indian officers acknowledge that commando
missions across the line of control have been one means of
punishing Pakistan for supporting the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the scale of the violence and the risks of a wider
war, Kashmir's miseries have only rarely attracted the attention
that has focused on other long-running international disputes.
Perhaps because it is a small territory, tucked up in the folds of
the Himalayan mountains, and with a history not widely known
outside the region, Kashmir and its problems have been largely a
specialists' domain.
</P>
<P>
   A compelling example was the sporadic interest, at least in the
West, in the plight of six Western tourists, two of them Americans,
who were kidnapped by Muslim rebels while on hiking trips in the
Kashmir Valley in July 1995. One American escaped; a Norwegian was
savagely murdered in the first month, his headless body dumped on a
village path. In 1997, Western diplomats concluded that the other
four hostages _ two Britons, a German and the missing American _
were almost certainly killed in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But how many Americans who had known the name Terry Anderson
could identify Donald Frederick Hutchings, a neuropsychologist from
Spokane, Wash., as the American hostage missing in Kashmir?
</P>
<P>
   This indifference could be jolted if India and Pakistan remain
at an impasse over the territory, and refuse even to discuss it,
raising the risks that the violence may someday provide the spark
for another full-scale war, like the ones that erupted in 1947 and
1965.
</P>
<P>
   Although both nations said after the nuclear tests that they
were ready to negotiate measures that will lessen the risks, even
the kind of ``confidence-building measures'' that helped stabilize
the Cold War will be impossible until negotiations begin; and
those, in turn, are blocked for now by the animosities and
suspicions that envelop Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, some in India and Pakistan question whether the
two governments really want to lessen tensions. Vajpayee served as
foreign minister in the late 1970s _ a time when many in both
countries say relations between India and Pakistan improved more
than at any time since 1947. But he is today the parliamentary
leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a Hindu nationalist group
that has never truly forgiven Pakistan for the partition of 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In its five months in power, Vajpayee's 14-party coalition has
tottered from one domestic crisis to another, causing Indian
skeptics to worry that party hard-liners might welcome renewed
hostilities in Kashmir for the political boost it might give them
among India's 700-million Hindus.
</P>
<P>
   And Sharif, like every Pakistani leader, has shown an instinct
to stoke up tensions over Kashmir whenever his domestic problems
mount. He reaped a surge in popular backing after ordering
Pakistan's nuclear tests in May, but his support has since
plummeted across his country, largely because of a weak economy
made worse by international sanctions imposed after the tests.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombo, even Pakistani journalists accused Sharif of
``playing the Kashmir card,'' meaning that he used the Kashmir
issue to block any move toward lessening tensions with India,
partly in the hope of boosting his popularity at home.

   NEW DELHI, India _ In an era when some of the world's bitterest
disputes have begun to give way to accommodation, the enmity
between India and Pakistan over Kashmir erupted again over the past
10 days in ways that underscored how intractable and potentially
dangerous the confrontation has become, especially since both
countries have now demonstrated their ability to build and detonate
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once again, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is
thumbing his nose at the world community. Last week, he said he is
through cooperating with international weapons inspectors and wants
the crippling economic sanctions on his country lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council berated Iraq for its intransigence, and
demanded that Baghdad change its decision. The Clinton
administration has vowed to block any easing of the sanctions the
United Nations imposed in 1991 after the Persian Gulf war until
Baghdad accounts for all of its nuclear, chemical, biological and
missile programs.
</P>
<P>
   But these days sanctions aren't very popular in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Largely in response to complaints from farm groups and business
organizations, Congress and the White House have concluded that
most sanctions, especially unilateral ones, are an ineffective tool
in foreign policy. And in the highly competitive global market,
Washington's sanctions in particular actually hurt U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to support the Hitlers of the world, but if
you're the only country imposing sanctions, they have no effect,''
said Tom Mick, chief executive of the Washington Wheat Commission,
a trade group in Spokane that has urged the administration to end
sanctions against Iran, a former top customer of Pacific Northwest
wheat.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of sanctions are less likely to acknowledge that
most existing penalties are riddled with exemptions, waivers and
legal loopholes. Exemptions are designed to permit humanitarian aid
and give presidents some diplomatic wiggle room. Farmers have been
adept at using them to keep a commercial toehold, and sometimes
much more, in even the most reviled rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   Congress often puts profits ahead of principle when the business
interests are big enough. Just a few weeks after it angrily
condemned India and Pakistan for conducting nuclear tests in May,
Congress enacted sanctions but exempted food exports, removing the
biggest sting the penalties could inflict. Why? Wheat farmers in
the Pacific Northwest howled because Pakistan was their biggest
customer, and the sanctions would have barred them from bidding on
a $37 million wheat order from that country.
</P>
<P>
   The same legislation that waived food exports also included a
little-noticed provision that exempted fertilizer from the
sanctions. That's because India is the second-largest importer of
American phosphate fertilizer, mostly from Florida, which exports
$1.7 billion in fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fertilizer is just as important as food and medicine,'' said
Kathleen Mathers of The Fertilizer Institute, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Iran may still be virtually closed to U.S. companies, but
Midwestern wheat farmers from Kansas to Texas are benefiting from a
year-old United Nations program that allows Iraq to sell a limited
amount of oil to buy food and medicine for humanitarian purposes.
In the program's first year, Iraq bought 817,000 metric tons _
about $114 million worth _ of hard red winter wheat, which placed
that country eighth among foreign buyers of American wheat. At a
time when wheat prices are at 10-year low, and orders from Asia
have plummeted because of the economic crisis there, the new
business from Baghdad is welcome news in Topeka and Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, American businesses prefer to avoid sanctions
altogether. Last year, as the administration was weighing whether
to impose a ban on new American investment in Myanmar because of
its human rights abuses, the Unocal Corporation signed a deal with
that government to expand a $1.2 billion joint venture with the
French oil company, Total, to develop gas fields off the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Unocal denied that there was any rush to sign the deal ahead of
impending sanctions. ``It was coincidental,'' said Barry Lane, a
company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In other pariah states like Cuba and North Korea, American
farmers and businesses are donating food or agricultural products
outright with the administration's blessing, hoping to position
themselves to compete with international rivals when embargoes are
finally lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Grains Council, the export development arm of the
American corn, barley and sorghum industries, donated 4,000 pounds
of mixed feed grain last spring to a Cuban aid organization.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas wheat farmers and the wheat industry's export development
arm donated 22,000 pounds of flour to Cuba in February with an eye
on the day a new regime rules in Havana. ``Cuba could be a pretty
significant market,'' said Lisa Jager, a spokesman for U.S. Wheat
Associates, the export arm.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, Washington state and Mercy Corps International, a
relief organization in Portland, Ore., donated 500 apple trees to
North Korea. ``We've been trying to figure out ways to open the
door there,'' said Ralph Munro, Washington's secretary of state,
who helped organize the donation.
</P>
<P>
   But commercial dealings with cash-poor rogue nations are still
risky. Last year, North Korea abruptly abandoned a plan to barter
zinc for 20,000 tons of American wheat.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's snub came as the ship-bound wheat was only days
from delivery, and left the American company, Cargill, Inc., a
Minneapolis-based commodities dealer, in the lurch. ``We sold the
grain on the market at a significant loss,'' said Bonnie Raquet, a
Cargill spokeswoman.

   Hours after the deadly car bombings at the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, President Clinton vowed to hunt down
those responsible ``no matter what or how long it takes.'' But
history suggests it can take a very long time.

   When terrorists take aim at Americans abroad, the perpetrators
are rarely identified with any certainty and seldom caught or
punished _ almost always because of the complications of joint
investigations with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   This time U.S. officials hope for better cooperation in what the
State Department described as the first nearly simultaneous
terrorist attacks in separate countries. The bombs, apparently in
vehicles parked outside the embassies, killed more than 60 in
Nairobi, including eight Americans. Another 1,100 people were
wounded. At least nine people were killed in Dar es Salaam, none
American, and scores were injured.

   The Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia in June 1996 is a grim
example of the difficulties of solving a case: A truck bomb
detonated at an apartment building, killing 19 U.S. airmen. The
second anniversary of that attack passed two months ago with U.S.
authorities expressing exasperation over their inability to
identify those involved, and admitting privately that the
investigation had collapsed because of disputes with Saudi
investigators.

<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Aug. 9:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFRICA BOMBINGS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-BOMBINGS (Nairobi, Kenya) _ Lede-all on developments
after the bombing of the U.S. embassies. By James C. McKinley Jr.
</P>
<P>
   With
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-U.S. (Washington) _ President Clinton said today that the
United States would not shirk from its role as world leader as a
result of terrorism, even though Americans are prime targets and
the capture of terrorists can take decades. By Jeff Gerth.
</P>
<P>
   And
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-VICTIMS (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ After a confusing
scene at the Nairobi airport this morning, three injured employees
of the U.S. embassy in Kenya were flown to Pretoria on a South
African military airplane as other bombing victims awaited medical
approval to be transported.
</P>
<P>
   Others as warranted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Other International &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SHIP-GRAVEYARD (Alang, India) _ After more than a million miles
of plying the world's oceans, the Milagro, a 35,000-ton,
Malta-registered bulk carrier, completed her final journey from the
Persian Gulf on a recent afternoon and dropped anchor off this
windswept point on India's northwest coast. Few maps show Alang, a
soulless spot on the coastline of Gujarat state 185 miles northwest
of Bombay. But in recent years, what had once been a
poverty-stricken village has become the world's biggest
shipbreaking yard. In the 1990s, Alang has served as the graveyard
for almost half the ships scrapped by the world's navies and
merchant marines. By John F. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-AIRCON (Rome) _ When Americans rushed to cool their air,
Europeans traditionally just slowed down and endured the summer
heat. But now Europeans have decided to stop going without. Indeed,
Europe is becoming a big market for the air-conditioning industry.
Sales of air-conditioners for homes and small businesses have grown
more than 20 percent over the last three years, even as they stayed
flat in the United States, and the growth shows no sign of abating.
By John Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-U.S.-OIL (Baku, Azerbaijan) _ American oil companies, the
largest players on the energy-rich Caspian Sea, are expressing
growing exasperation with the White House policy forbidding
American investment in Iran. Despite an overture to Iran by
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright in June, the
administration has insisted that geopolitical strategy outstrips
the commercial advantages being ceded to European companies doing
business there. By Jane Perlez and Steve LeVine.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-KOSOVO (Pornoc, Yugoslavia) _ How ethnic Albanian refugees
are faring. By Mike O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   CONGO-REBELLION (Abidjan, Ivory Coast) _ Developments in eastern
Congo. By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   BURMA-CRACKDOWN (Bangkok, Thailand) _ Tenth anniversary of the
military crackdown on student-led demonstrations. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-FLOODS (Shaoxing, China) _ Developments in central Hubei
province Flood as China battles the swelling Yangtze river. By Seth
Faison.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE (Washington) _ In 1994, when President Clinton's
effort to reshape the American health care system collapsed, a
political consensus emerged from the rubble: in the future, any
such changes should be made piecemeal, one step at a time. But four
years later, the limits of that incremental approach are becoming
clear, in the view of many experts. Most immediately, Congress is
confronting demands to provide broad new consumer protections for
patients fed up with the restrictions of managed care. Lawmakers
also face a deeper, more intractable problem. Despite the passage
of several laws intended to expand coverage step by step, the
number of Americans without insurance has risen steadily, by an
average of 1 million a year. By Robert Pear. (A special report.)
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-REPUBS (Washington) _ Republicans in Congress left for
their summer vacation this week deeply divided, fighting themselves
as hard as they fought Democrats, and unable to fill the policy
vacuum left by the hobbled Clinton presidency. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS-TRUCE (Undated) _ Two long-feuding pillars of the
Democratic Party, the liberal AFL-CIO and the centrist Democratic
Leadership Council, have agreed to a detente in which they pledge
to stop attacking each other and to seek common ground to help the
Democrats this fall and beyond. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-GOVERNMENT (Washington) _ Federal agencies are reporting
progress in fixing their computers to cope with the Year 2000
problem, but some of them are exaggerating what they have done,
according to independent federal experts. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-DNA-TESTS (Undated) _ As FBI scientists conduct tests on
one of Monica S. Lewinsky's dresses, trying to determine whether it
contains physical evidence of a sexual encounter with President
Clinton, they are employing a science that, though still sharply
debated in court, is considered highly reliable and capable of
answering a number of questions with remarkable speed and accuracy.
By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   JONESBORO-SHOOTINGS (Jonesboro, Ark.) _ Mitchell Johnson will
turn 14 on Tuesday, the day that he and Andrew Golden, 12, will be
tried on murder charges in the shooting spree on March 24 that 5
people dead left 10 others wounded at Westside Middle School here.
Under state law, the boys must be tried as juveniles and, even if
found to be ``delinquent,'' they will be released on their 18th
birthdays unless they have committed crimes while in detention. By
Rick Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   PRISON-GROWTH (Undated) _ The nation's prison population grew by
5.2 percent in 1997, according to the Justice Department, even
though crime has been declining for six straight years, suggesting
that the imprisonment boom has developed a built-in growth dynamic
independent of the crime rate, experts say. In a new report, the
Justice Department said the number of Americans in local jails and
in state and federal prisons rose to 1,725,842 in 1997, up from 1.1
million in 1990. By Fox Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   FUGITIVE-LAWYER (Miami) _ When Michael Abbell, a former Justice
Department extradition chief, and William M. Moran, a criminal
defense lawyer, were charged with the crimes of the Colombian drug
cartel they represented, lawyers nationwide denounced the
prosecution as a government effort to intimidate the defense bar.
In July a jury convicted them on charges of racketeering and
money-laundering conspiracy. Now some lawyers are also grappling
with a more immediate question: Where is Moran? The 59-year-old
defendant was last seen on July 17 in the federal courthouse here,
shortly after he learned that the jury had reached a partial
verdict, and he remains a fugitive. By Mireya Navarro.
</P>
<P>
   ASSASSINS (Chicago) _ Portraits of assassins are fixed in the
American mind: the deranged madman, the lonely loser obsessed with
his target, the political killer following threats with violence.
These portraits are the stuff of myth, the Secret Service has
concluded in ``Preventing Assassination,'' a new study of all 83
people who attacked or tried to attack an American political figure
or celebrity in the last 50 years. The results, recently made
available, challenge several stereotypes. By Bill Dedman.
</P>
<P>
   HAIGHT-ASHBURY (San Francisco) _ A Love Child might not
recognize the place. Here at Haight and Ashbury streets, ground
zero of the 1960s counterculture revolution, a Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice
cream store now stands on one corner, a Gap clothing store on
another. But The Haight's most compelling change is one less
discernible to the roving eye. While the now romanticized flower
children were painted as being spiritually connected by political
ideology and the haze of a marijuana high, many young people on the
same streets today share the common pain of broken lives and harder
drugs. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW YORK &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   NY-PHONE-STRIKE (Undated) _ Developments as more than 35,000
Bell Atlantic workers in New York are ready to go on strike at
midnight unless new contacts are reached with two unions, officials
say. By Steven Greenhouse.

   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada _ The high point of Fidel Castro's state
visit to this 133-square-mile ``Spice Isle'' last week was the
speech he delivered at Tanteen, a cricket field flanked by a simple
grandstand and a stack of cargo containers. As a couple of thousand
people listened patiently and the occasional dog ambled across the
grounds, the Cuban leader lectured Grenadians for an hour and a
half on the history of slavery in the West Indies and assorted
other topics.
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to power nearly 40 years ago, Castro has used all
the world as his stage, but he seems to be playing smaller houses
these days. Leslie Pierre, editor of the leading newspaper in this
country of 100,000 people, the weekly Grenadian Voice, intended it
as a compliment when he called the Cuban president ``a Caribbean
man.'' Yet that designation also implies that Castro and his
message matter little these days outside a region that itself seems
increasingly on the fringe of world events.
</P>
<P>
   Treated in recent years as a dotty old uncle in most capitals,
even those of Latin America where his calls for revolution once
resonated, Castro found himself saluted in Grenada by Prime
Minister Keith Mitchell as an historical figure ``who can only be
compared in the 20th Century to Nelson Mandela.'' He was also
serenaded with a rousing version of the ``Internationale.''
</P>
<P>
   But the atmosphere was festive rather than threatening. Without
the Soviet Union to back it up, the communist anthem has lost its
ability to frighten the capitalist world. So, too, Castro.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, the Reagan administration's fear of Castro
and his seemingly unlimited ability to make mischief generated a
bonanza of aid and attention for the newly independent
English-speaking states in the Caribbean. Even as the other islands
were being promised preferential trade benefits as part of a
regional Caribbean Basin Initiative, some 6,000 U.S. troops invaded
Grenada in October 1983 to expel Cuban forces, and Washington
followed that up with a promise to bring Grenada into the circle of
preferred treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s, in contrast, have seen the Clinton administration
close down its regional aid office, downgrade the embassy here to a
mission and slash aid, grants and scholarships. While Cuba, itself
economically prostrate, cannot make up for that gap, Mitchell and
his regional colleagues have seized on Cuba's own need for friends
in hopes of creating a countervailing weight to Washington's
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such a strategy will work is another matter. ``In a
post-Cold War world, this region unfortunately is no longer
relevant'' to the great powers, one diplomat in the region said.
Caribbean leaders may see Castro as a useful card to play to get
Washington's attention, ``but I'm not sure even that is true,'' the
diplomat added. ``Cuba wants to be headmaster of the Caribbean
family, but since it is a Soviet proxy no longer, the United States
really doesn't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the heyday of Cuba's alliance with Grenada, Castro aimed
high, agreeing to build an airport that could be used to bring in
tourists _ and to refuel Cuban planes ferrying troops to and from
Africa. This time around, what he was offering seemed modest, even
innocuous, reflecting straitened circumstances in both countries: a
new wing on a hospital here and 22 additional scholarships for
Grenadians to study at Cuban universities.
</P>
<P>
   For Cuba, the principal benefit of such aid efforts today is not
that they advance a geopolitical strategy. Rather, it is that they
provide employment for Cuban doctors, engineers and teachers who
would otherwise be idle at home or seeking jobs as hotel doormen or
taxi drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most telling moment of Castro's visit, however, came
when Grenada Education Minister Lawrence Joseph acknowledged during
a meeting that one thing is always certain when local students get
scholarships to Cuba. Unlike those who enroll in Britain, Canada or
the United States, they always return home just as soon as their
studies are done.

   CANTERBURY, England _ Before the world's Anglican bishops
wrapped up their once-a-decade gathering Saturday, they offered a
glimpse of what Christianity may well look like in the next century
from a global perspective.
</P>
<P>
   It was a vision that was multicultural and, at times, decidedly
conservative _ enough to make some of the prelates of the Episcopal
Church in the United States and the Church of England appear as
marginal players in a landscape their institutions once dominated.
</P>
<P>
   The Lambeth Conference, which was last held in 1988, was rich in
racial and ethnic diversity, with participants from churches in 160
different nations, and began July 18 with a worship service in
Canterbury Cathedral, the seat of the archbishop who is considered
the ``unifying figure'' of the 73 million-member Anglican
Communion.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops discussed such issues as international poverty and
pollution, but they seemed to speak loudest on questions of sexual
ethics and the authority of Scripture. Their tone, said Dr. R.
William Franklin, dean of Berkeley Divinity School at Yale
University, made this ``the most conservative conference of the
20th century,'' among the Lambeth gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone needed evidence of that conservatism, it came
Wednesday when the approximately 750 bishops settled in to tackle
an advisory resolution on human sexuality. Its original text,
written in committee, affirmed a traditional position on marriage
as the lifelong union of a man and a woman. It also condemned
homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   But when the document was brought before the whole conference,
socially conservative bishops toughened its language with
amendments, one calling for abstinence from any sex outside
marriage, another pointedly rejecting homosexual activity as
``incompatible with Scripture.'' Those who took the lead in this
process were mainly from the churches of Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows us to uphold biblical teaching, especially biblical
morality,'' said Archbishop Donald Mtetemela of Tanzania, speaking
for the amendment against homosexual activity. A Nigerian bishop
was more blunt: ``To accept homosexuality in our church is for
Anglicans to commit evangelical suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Their emphatic approach seemed to take liberal bishops by
surprise, leaving them out-organized and out-talked. In the
Episcopal Church, by contrast, conservatives had failed to block
some bishops from ordaining gay men and lesbians as priests.
</P>
<P>
   After two hours of debate, the amended resolution was passed.
</P>
<P>
   The story here had partly to do with numbers. At the 1988
gathering, Anglican leaders proclaimed the next 10 years as a
``decade of evangelism.'' The results were spread unevenly, to say
the least. The churches in Africa and Asia grew, while those in
England and North America did not. In fact, American membership
fell. This time, 228 African bishops who were heads of dioceses
came to the conference, up from 130 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Such growth in Africa and South Asia is a major trend within
Christianity. ``This is still news for most of the Christian
population in the United States of America,'' said Dean Gilliland,
a professor of contextual theology and African studies at Fuller
Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif. ``They don't know the
center of gravity has moved from the West.''
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, where the faith has been growing fastest, there are
an estimated 27 million Anglicans, more than 10 times the number of
Episcopalians in the United States. To take another example,
African Lutherans increased from 5.7 million to 9 million since
1991, surpassing the total membership of Lutheran denominations in
North America.
</P>
<P>
   But numbers do not tell the whole story. Many of the African and
Asian churches exist in societies where Christianity is a minority
faith, often confronted by antagonistic religious competitors, such
as militant Islamic groups, or overtly hostile secular governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unlike the experience that formed John Paul II,''
Franklin said, referring to the pope's formative years as priest
and later a bishop under a communist regime in Poland that regarded
the Catholic Church as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders forged in such environments, Franklin said, often
espouse a ``Christianity of clarity'' that has little room for
ambiguity and is suspicious of accommodating the surrounding
culture. They may take ``a harder line, a more authoritative line
in Scripture and morals,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bishops supporting the amended resolution, which is
nonbinding, were those who said they were concerned about how any
perceived wavering on homosexuality would be regarded in their own
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Alexander Malik of Lahore, Pakistan, said after the
meeting that a statement rejecting homosexuality would help him
respond to verbal challenges to his faith from some Muslims. ``They
say, `What kind of ethics and morality are you preaching?''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative bishops from the United States, England and
Australia were pleased about the stand on homosexuality. But those
who disagreed were left to ponder their place in an Anglican
Communion whose ground seemed to have shifted beneath them.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Frederick Borsch of Los Angeles issued a statement saying
he was disappointed with the resolution, noting that gay men and
lesbians ``are still very much a part of us.'' But he also said, in
a response that sorted out priorities, that he looked forward to
the conference ``going on to deal with critical matters'' like
outreach to young people and help for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Another prelate, Archbishop Njongonkulu Ndungane of Cape Town,
South Africa, said that at the heart of the communion's differences
are people who interpret the Bible differently, with some looking
to it for an explicit moral code and others for a broad revelation
of God's purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Ndungane said he subscribed to a historic view of Anglicanism,
in which respect for Scripture, tradition and reason allowed the
member churches a certain latitude in their practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want to characterize things as a split between
north and south,'' he said. ``What has been characteristic here has
been our differences and otherness. The struggle and pain has been
to live creatively within the differences.''

   CUBA-CASTRO _ MIAMI _ Summer is always the time for feverish
speculation about the health of aging Cuban President Fidel Castro,
who turns 72 on Aug. 13, and this summer is no exception. Just a
few weeks ago, a Cuban doctor-turned-defector living in Costa Rica
claimed that Castro suffers from a fatal brain disorder. There was
a barrage of similar ill-health rumors last summer, some even
announcing Castro's death. But, if anything, Castro appears more
robust than ever. He appears to be traveling more these days than
at any time in his 39 years in power. He continues his commitment
to communism, even as he's been striking a conciliatory tone
towards President Clinton. (Emling, Cox News Service).

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1994, when President Clinton's effort to reshape
the American health care system collapsed, a political consensus
emerged from the rubble: In the future, any such changes should be
made piecemeal, one step at a time.
</P>
<P>
   But four years later, the limits of that incremental approach
are becoming clear, in the view of many experts. Most immediately,
Congress is confronting demands to provide broad new consumer
protections for patients fed up with the restrictions of managed
care. Lawmakers also face a deeper, more intractable problem.
Despite the passage of several laws intended to expand coverage
step by step, the number of Americans without insurance has risen
steadily, by an average of 1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of uninsured has increased each year since 1987 and
now exceeds 41 million, roughly one-sixth of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, this steady rise has occurred despite a remarkable
economic boom. The nation has created more than 14 million jobs
since 1993, but most of these are in small businesses, which are
far less likely to provide health insurance than are large
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, members of both parties keep returning to the
problems of the uninsured, but the cost and complexity of the issue
pose extraordinary hurdles. Lawmakers say they are determined not
to repeat the mistakes that killed Clinton's plan, but beyond that,
there is little agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has enacted two significant health care laws since the
collapse of the Clinton plan. It created a new program to finance
health care for low-income children last year. And in 1996 it
passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy law, to make insurance more readily
available to millions of people who change their jobs or lose them.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts, along with previous expansions of the Medicaid
program, have made a difference; without them, experts say, the
number of uninsured would be even higher.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been problems:
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal and state officials say that insurance companies have
found ways to skirt the Kassebaum-Kennedy law by shunning people
with medical problems or by charging them very high premiums. The
law does not limit what insurers can charge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sweeping changes in federal welfare policy may inadvertently
increase the number of uninsured children, offsetting some of the
expected gains in coverage from the new Children's Health Insurance
Program.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government has struggled to carry out its duties under the
new laws. Federal officials had assumed that states would quickly
adopt the standards established by the Kassebaum-Kennedy law, but
that has not happened in California and four other states. In such
states, the federal government is supposed to enforce the law
directly, but the Clinton administration acknowledges it was
unprepared for this immense new responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   So, while officials grapple with these problems the number of
uninsured keeps growing.
</P>
<P>
   The Workers: Patchwork System for the Uninsured
</P>
<P>
   Neither the new laws nor the power of a fiercely competitive
medical marketplace has delivered health insurance to Mildred
Davis, a custodian and security guard in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no health insurance, no dental plan,'' Ms. Davis said
as she sat at the front desk of the community health center where
she works. ``When you walk into a doctor's office, the first thing
they say is: `How will you pay? What insurance do you have?' I have
to go to the bank before I go to the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many people who are uninsured, she deferred doctors' visits
and medical care until she had a serious need.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, said Ms. Davis, who is 48, she had an emergency
hysterectomy in January after several weeks of uterine bleeding.
She received a hospital bill for $8,000 and a doctor's bill for
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have gotten care earlier if I had had health
insurance,'' she said. Instead, she waited until the pain became
unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would get up to patrol this area,'' Ms. Davis said, pointing
to the corridors of the health center. ``The pain was so bad that
I'd fall over. I lost four and a half pints of blood. I was
literally bleeding to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis' case highlights the patchwork nature of the current
insurance system and illustrates what can happen to uninsured
people when they become ill. Even if parents have coverage through
their employers, their children may be uninsured. (Many companies
have cut back benefits for dependents.) Conversely, many children
covered by Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income
people, have parents who are uninsured because Medicaid's
eligibility rules are much more generous for children than they are
for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis said that her 7-year-old daughter was covered by
Medicaid. But Ms. Davis herself, like many of the uninsured, was
caught in between. Her income was too high for her to qualify for
Medicaid, and she could not afford private insurance. Ms. Davis
says she hopes to get health insurance later this year when she
becomes a full-time city employee.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicaid eligibility rules are devilishly complex. They
differ from state to state, and family income limits vary with a
child's age. So a healthy 4-year-old boy may be protected by
Medicaid, while his 8-year-old sister, though severely ill, is
ineligible for coverage because the income limit for her age group
is lower.

   The Cost: Opting for Pay Over Insurance
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the uninsured may seem distant to members of the
middle class riding the current economic boom. People are less
anxious about losing their jobs and their benefits than they were
in the recession of the early 1990s. ``Health security'' was the
buzzword then, just as ``patients' rights'' is now. But William
Custer, an economist at Georgia State University in Atlanta, said:
``The problems that the Clinton health plan was intended to address
have not gone away and may worsen in the future. If the economy
slows or if health costs rise much faster than prices in general,
we'll probably see more rapid growth in the number of Americans
without health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, as in the early 1990s, the cost of coverage is crucial.
Paradoxically, the Public Health Service says, the number of
workers offered health insurance by their employers has increased
in the last decade, but the proportion of workers who accept such
offers has declined, in part because of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Cooper and Barbara Schone, economists at the federal
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, found large declines in
the proportion of people accepting employer-sponsored insurance
among two groups: workers with low wages (less than $7 an hour) and
workers younger than 25.
</P>
<P>
   They estimate that 6 million workers are offered health
insurance by their employers or their unions but do not take it.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Carrillo, 26, works 30 to 40 hours a week as a customer
service representative for a company that schedules repairs for
Frigidaire appliances in Texas. The company offers health
insurance, she said, but ``for me as a single mother, it's too
expensive to afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carrillo explained: ``My paycheck after taxes is $350 to
$400 every two weeks. For health insurance, they would deduct $60
from each paycheck. I would be left with $290, which is not a lot
to deal with. If I could afford the insurance, I would take the
children to the doctor more often. Lucky for me, they are healthy
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, about half of all uninsured workers are either
self-employed or working in businesses that have fewer than 25
employees. When coverage is available in such companies, the
employees are often required to pay a large share of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses give many reasons for not providing insurance
to their employees. They say that premiums are too high, that their
profits are too uncertain for them to make a commitment to
insurance and that health benefits are not always a high priority
for workers.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Valiani, who operates four dry-cleaning shops in Austin,
said that he offered health insurance long ago and even paid half
the cost. But, he said, employees repeatedly asked him not to
deduct their share of the premiums from their wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one or the other, a pay raise or health benefits,''
Valiani said, and in the eyes of many employees, higher wages are
considered more important.
</P>
<P>
   The Laws: Guarantees Prove Not to Be Foolproof
</P>
<P>
   None of the measures passed by Congress in the last few years
raised higher hopes than the 1996 law to guarantee health insurance
for people who change jobs or lose jobs. The law is known by the
names of its authors, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Nancy
Kassebaum Baker, a Kansas Republican who retired from the Senate
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In signing the legislation, President Clinton said, ``It seals
the cracks that swallow as many as 25 million Americans who can't
get insurance or who fear they'll lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kassebaum-Kennedy law guarantees that people losing group
health insurance will have access to coverage in the individual
insurance market, regardless of pre-existing medical problems, but
it does not limit how much they may be charged. The law generally
guarantees that people moving from one job to another will be
promptly eligible for coverage if the new employer provides health
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
said recently that the law was not working as intended. People who
exercised their rights under the law were often charged premiums
far higher than the standard rates. Deborah Chollet, vice president
of the Alpha Center, a health policy research institute in
Washington, said the cost of such insurance _ $10,000 to $15,000 a
year, or more _ ``has to be prohibitive to most people.''
</P>
<P>
   One insurer, American Medical Security of Green Bay, Wis., said
it reserved the right to charge high-risk individuals five times
the rates charged to healthy people.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Krieger, a pediatrician who is speaker of the
California Medical Association, was more blunt. ``The promise of
the Kassebaum-Kennedy law has proved to be a sham,'' he said.
``Insurers are dumping patients by simply charging premiums much
higher than what the patients paid when they were part of their
employer plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has denounced such behavior, and he says the government
will no longer do business with insurers that flout the law. But
whether he can use it as a lever to increase the number of people
with insurance remains to be seen. For the Kassebaum-Kennedy law
does not guarantee coverage for people who want to buy insurance as
individuals and have never had group coverage. And conservative
Republicans say they do not want to use the law as a vehicle or
precedent for more federal regulation of private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   There are some problems, as well, in the other major initiative
to expand coverage: the Children's Health Insurance Program, which
provides almost $24 billion over five years to finance coverage for
some of the nation's 10 million uninsured children.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts fear that unrelated changes in welfare policy made
by the federal government and the states in the last few years may
have the opposite effect _ inadvertently increasing the number of
uninsured children. The new welfare laws impose time limits and
other restrictions on welfare benefits.

</P>
<P>
   Children are often still eligible for Medicaid after they lose
cash assistance, but their Medicaid coverage may be interrupted or
lost. Many parents do not know that their children still qualify
for Medicaid, and state officials do not always check such families
to assess their eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Ellwood, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research
in Cambridge, Mass., said, ``States have tried to keep Medicaid
open to those losing welfare benefits, but the number of people on
Medicaid has still dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of people on the federal welfare rolls has dropped by
5.2 million, or 37 percent, since January 1993, to 8.9 million in
March of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falling welfare caseloads are leading to unexpected declines
in Medicaid enrollment,'' even though many states have slightly
expanded eligibility for Medicaid, Ms. Ellwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has repeatedly expressed dismay that many children who
are eligible for Medicaid are not enrolled. In January, federal
officials estimated the number of such children at 3 million. In
May, after more rigorous studies that included older children, the
government suggested a much higher figure: 4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Adults who leave welfare often get low-wage jobs in small
businesses, the type of employment least likely to offer health
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Solutions: No Consensus on How to Proceed
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers say they keep looking for ways to expand coverage, but
there are sharp divisions over how to do it. Republicans are
philosophically opposed to price controls, which play a role in
some schemes to expand coverage, and few Democrats openly advocate
such regulation. Some liberal Democrats continue to push
legislation that would require employers to provide coverage, but
such mandates are anathema to conservatives in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Federal lawmakers in general are reluctant to dictate programs
to the states. And they say they cannot find the money for the
subsidies that would be needed to make insurance truly affordable
to millions of low-income Americans. As a result, the plight of the
uninsured appears to be a low political priority in the current
Congress, much to the frustration of their advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., a potential presidential
contender, says: ``Here we are at peak economic performance, and we
are being told that we cannot provide health coverage for everyone.
If not now, when?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, and Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del., chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, want to create tax breaks to help people
buy private insurance. Rep. Thomas Bliley Jr., R-Va., chairman of
the Commerce Committee, wants to create ``health marts'' to offer
insurance to self-employed people and businesses with fewer than
500 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy has introduced a bill that would require employers with
50 or more employees to offer insurance to their workers and to pay
at least 72 percent of the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every business is expected to pay a minimum wage and to obey
the child labor laws,'' Kennedy said. ``It is long past time for
businesses to contribute to the cost of basic health insurance
coverage for their workers. There can be no excuse for large firms
to shirk their responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wellstone recently introduced a bill that would give states
large sums of federal money to help achieve the goal of universal
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals like those from Kennedy and Wellstone stir little
interest in a Congress controlled by Republicans, who are
viscerally opposed to any new mandates on employers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say such mandates will not work in a voluntary
employer-sponsored health insurance system. There is, they say,
strong evidence that employers will drop coverage (especially for
workers' dependents), curtail benefits or shift costs to employees
if the government imposes new requirements. And in interviews,
uninsured workers say that, while they yearn for coverage, they are
very sensitive to the cost. They often pass up the offer of health
insurance if it will take a noticeable amount from their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   But concern for the uninsured will not die. The Health Insurance
Association of America, which helped kill Clinton's proposals with
its ``Harry and Louise'' commercials in 1994, is now seeking ways
to extend private coverage to the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspapers, television and radio news reports may no longer
focus on the plight of the uninsured as they did in 1993 and
1994,'' said Donald Peterson, chairman of the association and of
Trustmark Insurance Co. in Lake Forest, Ill. ``But for millions of
Americans, the lack of affordable coverage remains a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurers worry that if the erosion of private employer-sponsored
insurance continues, consumers will demand new government programs,
to which the industry is opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Altman, president of the Henry Kaiser Family Foundation,
which has done many studies of the uninsured, said: ``This is the
biggest problem we face in American health care, and it's not on
the political agenda. There's no significant solution on the
horizon. The country doesn't want to put up the tens of billions of
dollars it would take to provide coverage for the uninsured. We
have been making some progress with the small incremental reforms,
but it's like shoveling sand against the tide.''

   HEALTHCARE (Washington) _ In 1994, when President Clinton's
effort to reshape the American health care system collapsed, a
political consensus emerged from the rubble: in the future, any
such changes should be made piecemeal, one step at a time. But four
years later, the limits of that incremental approach are becoming
clear, in the view of many experts. Most immediately, Congress is
confronting demands to provide broad new consumer protections for
patients fed up with the restrictions of managed care. Lawmakers
also face a deeper, more intractable problem. Despite the passage
of several laws intended to expand coverage step by step, the
number of Americans without insurance has risen steadily, by an
average of 1 million a year. By Robert Pear. (A special report.)

<P>
   Now that the federal budget is actually in balance, there is
probably no subject on which Congress has legislated with more
short-term success but less long-term impact than campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Thursday the House passed the Shays-Meehan bill, which
sought to outlaw the huge, unregulated soft-money contributions at
the heart of the 1996 election scandals, and to curb the
issue-advocacy advertisements by which outside groups set the
agenda for elections. The vote was an impressive 252-179.
</P>
<P>
   But in February the Senate killed a companion bill with a
filibuster. Fifty-two senators backed the bill, but that was eight
too few to cut off debate. And the House stalled long enough to let
the Senate get out of town before sending the bill across the
Capitol. So prospects are dim this year.
</P>
<P>
   If no bill becomes law, that will hardly be unusual. Campaign
finance bills have been passed eight times in the last 20 years,
but sometimes it's just the Senate that does it, sometimes it's
just the House, and sometimes they both pass a bill, but never work
out even the most trivial differences.
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptics detect a lack of congressional will here,
remembering that in 1992 House Speaker Thomas Foley only got a bill
passed by assuring wavering Democrats that President Bush would
veto it. But of course they doubted that Congress wanted to balance
the budget, too.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As a father of two pre-teen boys, I have in the last year or so
become a huge fan of the word ``duh.'' This is a word much maligned
by educators, linguistic brahmins and purists, but they are all
quite wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Duh has elegance. Duh has shades of meaning, even
sophistication. Duh and its perfectly paired linguistic partner,
``yeah right,'' are the ideal terms to usher in the millennium and
the information age, and to highlight the differences from the
stolid old 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Even my sons might stop me at this point and quash my hyperbole
with a quickly dispensed, ``Yeah, right, Dad.'' But hear me out: I
have become convinced that duh and yeah right have arisen to fill a
void in the language because the world has changed. Fewer questions
these days can effectively be answered with yes or no, while at the
same time, a tidal surge of hype and mindless blather threatens to
overwhelm old-fashioned conversation. Duh and yeah right are the
cure.
</P>
<P>
   Good old yes and no were fine for their time _ the archaic,
black-and-white era of late industrialism that I was born into in
the 1950s. The yes-or-no combo was hard and fast and most of all
simple: It belonged to the Manichean red-or-dead mentality of the
cold war, to manufacturing, to ``Father Knows Best'' and ``It's a
Wonderful Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The information-age future that my 11-year-old twins own is more
complicated than yes or no. It's more subtle and supple, more
loaded with content and hype and media manipulation than my
childhood _ or any adult's, living or dead _ ever was.
</P>
<P>
   And duh, whatever else it may be, is drenched with content.
Between them, duh and yeah-right are capable of dividing all
language and thought into an exquisitely differentiated universe.
Every statement and every question can be positioned on a gray
scale of understatement or overstatement, stupidity or
insightfulness, information saturation or yawning emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   And in an era when plain speech has become endangered by the
pressures of political correctness, duh and yeah right are
matchless tools of savvy, winking sarcasm and skepticism: caustic
without being confrontational, incisive without being quite
specific.
</P>
<P>
   With duh, you can convey a response, throw in a whole basket
full of auxiliary commentary about the question or the statement
you're responding to, and insult the speaker all at once! As in
this hypothetical exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Parent: ``Good morning, son, it's a beautiful day.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old boy: ``Duh.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is a kind of esthetic balance as well. Yeah-right is
the yin to duh's yang, the antithesis to duh's emphatic thesis.
Where duh is assertive and edgy, a perfect tool for undercutting
mindless understatement or insulting repetition, yeah right is laid
back, a surfer's cool kind of response to anything overwrought or
oversold.
</P>
<P>
   New York, for example, is duh territory, while Los Angeles is
yeah-right. Television commercials can be rendered harmless and
inert by simply saying, ``yeah, right,'' upon their conclusion.
Local television news reports are helped out with a sprinkling of
well placed duhs, at moments of stunning obviousness. And almost
any politician's speech cries out for heaping helpings of both at
various moments.
</P>
<P>
   Adolescent terms like ``like,'' by contrast, scare me to death.
While I have become convinced through observation and personal
experimentation that just about any adult of even modest
intelligence can figure out how to use duh and yeah right properly,
like is different. Like is hard. Like is, like, dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Danesi, a professor of linguistics and semiotics at the
University of Toronto who has studied the language of youth and who
coined the term ``pubilect'' to describe the dialect of pubescence,
said he believes like is in fact altering the structure of the
English language, making it more fluid in construction, more like
Italian or some other Romance language than good old hard-and-fast
Anglo-Saxon. Insert like in the middle of a sentence, he said, and
a statement can be turned into a question, a question into an
exclamation, an exclamation into a quiet meditation.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these hypothetical expressions: ``If you're having
broccoli for dinner, Johnson, I'm, like, out of here!'' and ``I
was, like, no way!'' and, perhaps most startlingly, ``He was, like,
duh!''
</P>
<P>
   In the broccoli case, like softens the sentence. It's less harsh
and confrontational than saying flatly that the serving of an
unpalatable vegetable would require a fleeing of the premises.
</P>
<P>
   In the second instance, like functions as a kind of a verbal
quotation mark, an announcement that what follows, ``no way,'' is
to be heard differently. The quote itself can then be loaded up
with any variety of intonation _ irony, sarcasm, even
self-deprecation _ all depending on the delivery.
</P>
<P>
   In the third example _ ``He was, like, duh!'' _ like becomes a
crucial helping verb for duh, a verbal springboard. (Try saying the
sentence without like and it becomes almost incomprensible.)
</P>
<P>
   But like and duh and yeah right, aside from their purely
linguistic virtues, are also in many ways the perfect words to
convey the sense of reflected reality that is part of the age we
live in. Image manipulation, superficiality, and shallow media
culture are, for better or worse, the backdrop of adolescent life.
</P>
<P>
   Adults of the yes-or-no era could perhaps grow up firm in their
knowledge of what things ``are,'' but in the Age of Duh, with
images reflected back from every angle at every waking moment, kids
swim in a sea of what things are ``like.'' Distinguishing what is
from what merely seems to be is a required skill of an 11-year-old
today; like reflects modern life, and duh and yeah right are the
tools with which such a life can be negotiated and mastered.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a concealed paradox in the Age of Duh. The
information overload on which it is based is built around the
computer, and the computer is, of course, built around _ that's
right _ the good old yes-or-no binary code: Billions of
microcircuits all blinking on or off, black or white, current in or
current out. Those computers were designed by minds schooled and
steeped in the world of yes or no, and perhaps it is not too much
of a stretch to imagine my sons' generation, shaped by the broader
view of duh, finding another path: binary code with attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, most computers I know already seem to have an attitude.
Incorporating a little duh would at least give them a sense of
humor.

SMALL TOWN MOURNS SOLDIER KILLED IN NAIROBI

 (ATTN: Ind., Ga., Maine)  (mk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON

<P>
   NEVADA, Mo. _ Restless in a little Missouri town set to a safe
but predictable rhythm, young Kenneth Hobson could scarcely wait to
grow up and start chasing adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to see the world,'' said his mother, Bonnie Hobson,
sitting on a porch suddenly filled with flowers of condolence. ``He
knew there was more to life out there, and he was determined to see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Word came early Friday that her 27-year-old son, Sgt. Kenneth
Hobson Jr., who has a wife and a 2-year-old daughter, had been
killed in the terrorist attack on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi,
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Saturday that 11 Americans had been
killed in the Nairobi blast. No Americans were among the victims in
a simultaneous bombing on Friday in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Only two other Americans have been identified so far. They are
Arlene Kirk, 50, a civilian Air Force employee from South Bend,
Ind., and Molly Huckaby Hardy, 51, a longtime State Department
employee who was originally from Valdosta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in a modest blue house at the corner of Tucker and
Austin Streets, behind a sturdy old maple tree, young Kenneth
Hobson was known as a talented, handsome and popular boy who never
wasted a minute of life.
</P>
<P>
   He loved to debate world affairs and play tennis, act in school
plays, go hiking, cook gourmet meals and paint. One of his mother's
favorite artworks was a drawing he had done from the opera La
Maison.
</P>
<P>
   In school, he was a good student. Friends complained that he
never seemed to crack the books, but always performed well on tests
and projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was our only child,'' the young man's mother said Saturday.
``He was my baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The telephone rang at the mother's home in nearby Lamar before
sunrise. It was her daughter-in-law, Debbie, calling from Nairobi,
and crying uncontrollably. ``He's gone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier's widow, who is from Maine, will soon be returning
to the United States with the couple's daughter, Meghan.
</P>
<P>
   In this town of about 9,000 a bit north of the Ozarks region,
people reacted with shock and sadness that a native son had been
lost in the horrifying attack on Friday that killed more than 100
people.
</P>
<P>
   At the Quick Dine restaurant, where heaving plates of biscuits
and gravy crowded the lunch counter, Jim Dilly said it was
difficult to imagine that anyone could prove a political point by
killing innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there's a good reason that our people were over
there,'' he said. ``But what a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the fallen soldier, a Gulf War veteran, were
formally notified on Friday by an emissary from the Army, who
carried a blue folder as he walked up to the family's front door.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Kenneth Hobson Sr., had been a Vietnam veteran who
was seriously injured by an explosion in that war.
</P>
<P>
   Their son ``had a lot of dreams,'' his mother said. ``And if he
had lived, he would have fulfilled every one of them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One dream was to retire from the Army at age 37, attend culinary
school and then open a bed and breakfast, perhaps in New England,
his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from a working-class family, he had joined the Army after
graduating from Nevada High School in 1989, hoping to earn money
for college. His father was a police officer in town. His mother
worked at a drive-in restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   But he enjoyed the travel of military life, and decided to make
a career of it, his mother said. Before going to Africa, he had
been given a choice of four other assignments, all of them closer
to his base in Fort Gordon, Ga. But he chose the most exotic
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The young man told his parents he was not allowed to talk much
about his job in Nairobi. The military has described him as an
administrative specialist at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The Hobsons moved to Nevada from nearby Lamar when young Kenneth
was in the fourth grade, and moved back to Lamar after their son
graduated from high school. Hobson is now a deputy in the Barton
County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Hobsons are a highly regarded family in Nevada, known as a
decent family that treated other people well. ``The one thing that
stuck out about the young man,'' said Doug Allard, referring to the
killed soldier, ``was how polite he was as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was not afraid to have opinions, according to his family
and others who knew him. Some people joked that he was happiest
when engaged in a passionate argument about issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a great sense of humor, too,'' said his mother.
``People just liked to be around him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ritual of compassion, a parade of neighbors and friends
lined the sidewalk in front of the Hobson home in Lamar, bringing
hugs and hams, vows of prayers and resolutions to ``keep strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of them told the tearful parents that their boy was a hero.
His father said, ``Anybody who wears the uniform is a hero.''

   Legislators Vote to Accuse Reno of Contempt
</P>
<P>
   No top government official has ever been prosecuted for contempt
of Congress. But that did not stop the House Committee on
Government Reform and Oversight from voting along party lines last
week to charge Attorney General Janet Reno with the crime. The
committee's complaint is that Reno refuses to turn over memorandums
from the Justice Department's top investigators, including FBI
Director Louis Freeh, holding that the law requires her to ask for
an independent counsel to investigate Democratic campaign finance
abuses in the last election.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Reno has adamantly refused to seek an outside
prosecutor. But even before the committee voted, there were
indications that she was reconsidering the question.

   The No. 1 Gun Dealer
</P>
<P>
   The United States has kept its title as the world's biggest arms
merchant, but Russia and France are poised to overtake it, the
Congressional Research Service reported.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has led the world arms trade for seven
straight years. It sold $15.2 billion worth of weapons to other
nations last year, a 44 percent share of the shrinking global arms
market. That shrinkage has a number of causes: the end of the Cold
War, the end of a splurge of weapons purchases after the 1991
Persian Gulf war, the economic crisis in Asia and the long slump in
crude oil prices, which has helped slow arms purchases by Saudi
Arabia and other Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the world remains awash in arms. Developing nations
alone have bought $172 billion worth in the 1990s.

   Trauma at 2 Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   Past was all-too-palpable prologue in last week's turmoil at The
Boston Globe and The Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   At The Globe, where wounds caused by the revelation of
fabrication by a prized columnist were still healing, a second
prominent columnist found himself in the crosshairs. Mike Barnicle
came under fire after The Boston Herald documented that 10 items in
his column titled ``I was just thinking,'' paralleled jokes in
comedian George Carlin's book, ``Brain Droppings.''
</P>
<P>
   That led his editors to suspend him. But when Barnicle, who said
he had not read the book, turned up on a video clip recommending it
as summer reading, Globe editor Matthew Storin asked him to resign.
He declined. Friday, to resolve the impasse, Barnicle met with the
Globe's publisher, Benjamin Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Miami Herald publisher David Lawrence told
an emotional crowd in the newspaper's cafeteria that he was
resigning. The announcement came after the staff had received memos
alluding to possible cutbacks. The Herald had a round of cuts three
years ago; some employees feared that the new publisher, Alberto
Ibarguen, whose experience was gained on the business side of
newspapers, would preside over more cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ibarguen spoke of ``streamlining,'' not
layoffs. The question, he said, was, ``How can we grow with this
community _ how do we take a mature and traditional institution and
fit an untraditional and evolving area?''

   Watching Kosovo Simmer
</P>
<P>
   Washington and NATO, embarrassed by a brutal Serb campaign
against ethnic Albanians in the southern Serbian province of
Kosovo, warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic yet again that
he risks military retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The warning came in a message to Milosevic from Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, who is seeking rapid negotiation between
the Serbs and Kosovar representatives.
</P>
<P>
   To make this latest threat more credible, NATO drafted
operational plans for limited air strikes against Serb forces that
could be more easily authorized by the alliance. And it announced
military exercises next week in Albania and next month in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials recognize Milosevic's right to put down a
rebellion, but say they are horrified by his tactics, which include
the razing of villages and the displacement of at least 10 percent
of the population.

   A Slap for Arafat
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat turned 70 last week, but along with a celebration
the Palestinian leader received a rebuke to his governance.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat had been under pressure since last year from Palestinian
lawmakers to root out corruption and mismanagement from within his
Palestinian Authority. But the response that he finally unveiled
was so widely seen as inadequate that two ministers _ including
Hannan Ashrawi, an internationally prominent figure _ quit in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's standing had already been diminished among Palestinians
by the lack of progress toward a broader peace with Israel. He has
always been able to rally support by blaming Israel for the
faltering peace, and he still commands great respect. But
increasingly now, Palestinians have felt freer to conclude that in
his aversion to addressing problems of efficient administration at
home, he is leaving himself no one to blame but Yasser Arafat.

   A Case of Switched Identity
</P>
<P>
   Paula Johnson of Ruckersville, Va., had been raising little
Callie Marie for three years when, in order to induce the presumed
father to pay child support, she had a paternity test done. The
test showed that Callie wasn't his child _ and another test showed
Ms. Johnson wasn't the mother.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl had been switched at birth, with another at the
University of Medical Center in Charlottesville. Callie was the
daughter of a couple in Buena Vista, Va., Kevin Chittum and Tamara
Whitney Rogers, and Rebecca, the child they were raising, had been
born to Ms. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Monday it was discovered that Carrie's biological
parents had died in a Fourth of July car wreck. Ms. Johnson and the
Chittum and Rogers clans are now grappling with how the girls
should be raised. They are talking to lawyers, but none is named
Solomon.

   A Swimmer Founders
</P>
<P>
   At the Summer Olympics in Atlanta two years ago, Michelle Smith
de Bruin of Ireland won three gold medals, a feat that surprised
many because her performance times had improved dramatically late
in her career.
</P>
<P>
   Now the International Swimming Federation has banned her from
competition for four years after finding that she tampered with a
drug test by spiking her urine sample with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The swimmer, now 28, denied wrongdoing, said she would appeal
the ban, and would sue the federation in a fight to clear her name.
She passed her drug tests in Atlanta; the test she was said to have
manipulated was conducted while out of competition this year.
</P>
<P>
   Doubt on Crime Statistics
</P>
<P>
   Crime has been dropping dramatically for the past six years, to
the lowest level since the 1960s, when the late-20th-century crime
wave exploded in the United States. But now charges are being
raised that police commanders in several cities have falsified
their crime statistics to keep up with the nationwide decline, and
this is raising concern that some crime data may be skewed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, senior police officials have been
demoted or forced to resign because some crime statistics were
manipulated in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Boca Raton, Fla.
Typically, felonies like burglary were downgraded to less serious
crimes like trespassing or vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these incidents, criminologists say the general downward
trend in crime is undoubtedly true, since it has shown up not only
in police reports but also in a Justice Department survey of
victims of crimes nationwide.

   Indian Rights, Canadian Style &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 years after they made their first land claim, the
Nisga'a people of British Columbia signed a treaty that gives them
title to an area more than half the size of Rhode Island, along
with control over almost everything that happens there.
</P>
<P>
   But a treaty is only a first step to self-sufficiency, as
American Indian tribes who gathered in Washington last week for a
conference on development know.
</P>
<P>
   If the Nisga'a treaty is ratified by the provincial and federal
parliaments, traditional federal support will be cut. The 5,500
Nisga'a will then have to collect their own taxes and figure out
how to provide services and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This is a problem that some American tribes have solved by
turning to gambling casinos. But Canada's Nisga'a say they have
other plans: to rely on traditional economic enterprises like
timber and fishing.

<P>
   Shhh. It Was a Secret. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The British government does not like it when its spies talk
about their jobs. In fact, under the Official Secrets Act, workers
at the security services are forbidden to disclose anything to
anyone about any aspect of their work.
</P>
<P>
   That was why it took 25 years for Sir John Masterman to get
permission in 1972 to publish ``The Double-Cross System,'' about
how Britain subverted Germany's World War II spies _ and then only
after Yale University Press in America forced the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Something even more peculiar happened in the ``Spycatcher'' case
in the 1980s, when a book disclosing British spy secrets was
published in the United States. That time, British newspapers were
forbidden to reveal what the book said, but Britons smuggled it in
and sold it by the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, history seemed to repeat itself when David Shayler, a
former officer at the Libya desk of Britain's domestic security
service, was arrested after threatening to disclose embarrassing
agency secrets on the Internet. Newspapers that were poised to
publish his allegations found themselves slapped with far-reaching
injunctions in the name of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Thursday, the newspaper The Guardian reprinted an
article by The New York Times that described the British news
media's inability to cover Shayler's story. It included details of
Shayler's allegation that Britain's foreign intelligence service
botched an assassination attempt against Moammar Gadhafi in 1996 _
details subject to the injunction.
</P>
<P>
   The British government didn't prosecute The Guardian. But it
reissued its warnings to reporters not to repeat anything else
Shayler had told them.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 9, moved Saturday in the `a' category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This final budget adds: ENGLISH-REVIEW. The previously budgeted
IRAQ-REVIEW is now SANCTIONS-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-REVIEW _ The mystifying nature of that chicken-or-egg
quandary is no longer solely a topic in ivory towers. Down in the
barnyard, the groundlings know that they are expected to play a big
part in determining the future of the stock market. And last week,
on cue, individual investors reacted to the market's swoon with
predictable bleatings about buying opportunities and impending
rebounds. By Edward Wyatt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MONICA-TV-REVIEW _ It has been a They-Shoot-Lawyers-Don't-They?
marathon for viewers of the legal analysts who fog up the TV
screens with talk about the Monica S. Lewinsky investigation. By
Jill Abramson. WITH GRAPHIC.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LISTS-REVIEW _ Americans love lists, even bad ones, which serve
mainly to start conversations about what is and is not on them. By
Judith H. Dobrzynski. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RWANDA-REVIEW _ For anyone setting out to write a history of
recent strife in Central Africa, few opening lines could be more
tempting these days than: In the beginning there was Rwanda. By
Howard W. French. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KASHMIR-REVIEW _ In an era when some of the world's bitterest
disputes have begun to give way to accommodation, the enmity
between India and Pakistan over Kashmir erupted again over the past
10 days in ways that underscored how intractable and potentially
dangerous the confrontation has become, especially since both
countries have now demonstrated their ability to build and detonate
nuclear weapons. By John F. Burns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SANCTIONS-REVIEW (subsked) _ These days, sanctions aren't very
popular in Washington. Largely in response to complaints from farm
groups and business organizations, Congress and the White House
have concluded that most sanctions, especially unilateral ones, are
an ineffective tool in foreign policy. And in the highly
competitive global market, Washington's sanctions in particular
actually hurt U.S. companies. By Eric Schmitt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASTRO-REVIEW _ The high point of Fidel Castro's state visit to
this 133-square-mile ``Spice Isle'' last week was the speech he
delivered at Tanteen, a cricket field flanked by a simple
grandstand and a stack of cargo containers. As a couple of thousand
people listened patiently, the Cuban leader lectured Grenadians for
an hour and a half on the history of slavery in the West Indies and
assorted other topics. By Larry Rohter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TERRORISM-REVIEW _ A terrorism scorecard. By Philip Shenon. WITH
GRAPHIC.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANGLICANS-REVIEW _ Before the world's Anglican bishops wrapped
up their once-a-decade gathering Saturday, they offered a glimpse
of what Christianity may well look like in the next century from a
global perspective. By Gustav Niebuhr. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-REFORM-REVIEW _ Now that the federal budget is actually
in balance, there is probably no subject on which Congress has
legislated with more short-term success but less long-term impact
than campaign finance. By Adam Clymer. WITH GRAPHIC.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ENGLISH-REVIEW _ Today's kids are, like, killing the English
language. Yeah, right. By Kirk Johnson.

<P>
   SHAOXING, China _ Chinese officials say the nation's worst
flooding in 40 years, caused by a fast-swelling Yangtze River, now
threatens to overwhelm several large cities in the central part of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The army is evacuating more than half a million people from an
area in Hubei Province, state news organizations reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They said increasingly desperate officials there might have to
blow up several dikes and deliberately inundate millions of acres
of farmland to divert water that endangers larger cities
downstream.
</P>
<P>
   The floods have killed more than 2,000 people, destroyed more
than 5 million homes and indirectly affected over 240 million
people, or nearly one-fifth of the country's population, according
to official figures.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have mobilized millions of soldiers and government
officials to help in rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In Hubei, where a state of emergency was declared on Thursday,
floods have already broken through more than 100 separate
embankments.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as flooding begins to threaten Wuhan, a major industrial
center with seven million residents, authorities are frantically
searching for ways to divert part of the Yangtse River's overflow.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jingjiang plain, more than 300,000 residents have already
been evacuated with the help of the army, the New China News Agency
reported, and 200,000 more are expected to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   Local governments will compensate families whose homes are
destroyed, the agency promised.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding occurs virtually every summer in China. In the past,
official statistics on flood casualties have sometimes been
unreliable because local officials have exaggerated conditions in
hopes of receiving additional money from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The central authorities, in turn, often use natural disasters as
a political rallying cry nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding in 1996, for instance, was also called the worst in
decades by officials in badly affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   This year's flooding appears to affect more areas than the
floods of 1996, but it is difficult to assess accurately because
the authorities are barring foreign reporters from badly flooded
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, state television broadcast pictures of soldiers
venturing into fast-rushing water to try to rebuild dikes with
canvas bags filled with sand and rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Other soldiers were shown ferrying residents out of badly
stricken areas in rowboats and senior officers were seen exhorting
the troops to greater efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Warning that soldiers risked contracting cholera and other
diseases from contaminated water, the authorities reported that all
manner of preventative measures were being taken, including
traditional Chinese potions.
</P>
<P>
   According to official accounts, the Yangtze River has not
flooded so badly since 1954, when 30,000 people died.
</P>
<P>
   This year, most of the 2,000 people reported killed died in
landslides and mud flows that swallowed houses and villages, said
Fan Baojun, Deputy Minister of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   An unknown number of soldiers have died fighting the floods.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 people were washed away when a dike burst Saturday
in Jiayu County, in Hubei Province, the official China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the newspaper said, the bodies of five soldiers and
eight civilians have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Some 40,000 people were stranded near Jiujiang, in neighboring
Jiangxi Province, when flooding from a collapsed dike left them
surrounded by water, the New China News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Farther downstream on the Yangtze, in Anhui Province, an
onslaught of water arrived from two sides as the river swelled in
the west and a typhoon brought heavy rains in the east.
</P>
<P>
   In Hunan Province, farther south, 2.3 million soldiers and
civilians worked to build flood defenses in case the typhoon caused
rain there.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about long-term weather forecasts, the New China News
Agency quoted meteorologists' predictions that five to seven
typhoons would hit China in the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people evacuated from their homes in
Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi provinces were living in makeshift tents
provided by the army, surviving on government supplies of rice,
state news organizations also reported.
</P>
<P>
   The New China News Agency said that another danger had emerged
from thieves trying to take advantage of flooded homes and
unprotected evacuees.
</P>
<P>
   Night patrols have been organized in several areas, it said, to
prevent theft from submerged houses and from refugees.

   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Dozens of volunteers continued a slow,
desperate effort Saturday to save people still trapped under tons
of rubble from a terrorist attack on the U.S. Embassy here, as
American medical teams and FBI investigators began to arrive in two
East African capitals.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll from the simultaneous car-bomb explosions, here
and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, rose above 90 people and is likely
to rise even higher as the debris from a leveled seven-story
building in Nairobi is cleared away, Kenyan authorities said.
Streams of wounded overwhelmed the city's hospitals, where more
than 500 people have been admitted and more than 4,200 treated in
less than two days.
</P>
<P>
   At least 40 people, many of them secretarial students, are
believed to be buried and hope for their survival dimmed as the
hours went by. ``It is probable the death figures will go much
above this,'' the Kenyan foreign minister, Bonaya Godana, said.
</P>
<P>
   The official U.S. investigation of the bombings here and in
Tanzania, which the State Department has said were coordinated
terrorist acts, was off to a slow start. The authorities here said
the explosion was believed to have been caused by a car bomb, but
the U.S. government maintained a strict silence about its efforts
to dig out its own dead and to investigate the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The worse devastation was in Nairobi, where the volunteers
continued trying to to save at least three people believed to be
buried alive in the collapsed Ufundi Cooperative House, 30 hours
after the attack. The building took the brunt of a huge explosion
that also gutted the rear of the U.S. Embassy next door. President
Clinton said the blast killed at least 11 Americans and an unknown
number of Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
   A child was among the dead and five others were still missing,
the State Department said earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue efforts were going slowly and did not seem well
organized. By late afternoon Saturday, the ad-hoc team of
volunteers, private contractors, engineers, Red Cross workers and
Kenyan soldiers were still trying to find a way to lift several
large slabs of concrete without causing a general collapse that
would doom the few people still left alive beneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been slow and there is no coordination,'' complained
Aloys Okello, the 47-year-old general manager of a credit union
housed in the building. ``Everyone is trying to give his own
orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Very few details had emerged by late afternoon about the bomb
itself, or how it was detonated. Kenyan authorities said it
appeared that a car-bomb had been parked near the entrance ramp
leading to the underground garage beneath the American mission. A
blackened crater gapes amid the rubble at that point, and the blast
has warped a wrought iron fence around the building's perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses told local newspaper reporters they saw a man
driving a pick-up truck onto the ramp just before the explosion.
But if that was the bomber, the authorities here said it was still
unclear whether the bomber was blown up in the attack or escaped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the blast seems to have been exactly at the front
of the entrance of the basement parking lot,'' Godana, the foreign
minister, said Saturday afternoon. ``It is probable that the person
tried to get into the garage and could not.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two FBI agents had arrived by late afternoon, and there
appeared to be little or no police activity at the blast site.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials at the embassy denied reporters access to the
building and put up a screen around it to mask their rescue
operation. They declined to say how many bodies had been found in
the embassy building, though they did say no one had been found
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Marines and other government employees could be seen digging
through the devastated offices at the rear of the building, but it
was unclear by late afternoon what they had found.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions began to rise between the American workers and tired
Kenyan volunteers who were combing the remains of the Ufundi
building next door.
</P>
<P>
   Several Kenyan rescue workers complained that the U.S. Marines
and other U.S. officials had done little to help them extricate
people from the Ufundi House and had even prevented them from
taking dead Kenyan nationals out of the embassy building and from
searching for survivors there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very unfair, because all of this problem happened
because of them,'' said one volunteer, Lorna Matewa, a 36-year-old
banker, who was in his second day of helping to find survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The city's seven hospitals were also struggling to cope with a
flood of injured people. More than 542 people had been hospitalized
by Saturday afternoon, including 24 in critical condition. Another
4,257 were treated for minor injuries and released.
</P>
<P>
   Godana said the hospitals were short of everything from blood to
bandages to sutures and appealed for help from overseas. ``The
sudden rush was overwhelming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some relief began to arrive Saturday morning as American medical
teams flew into Nairobi. An American cargo aircraft carrying 44
personnel with medical supplies, food and communiaations equipment
touched down just after 9 a.m., and a second arrived a few minutes
later with more medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Israel was expected to send 200 soldiers trained in rescuing
people from collapsed buildings Saturday afternoon, but they had
yet to arrive in Kenya at 2:30 p.m. Local police officials have
pinned their hopes on the Israeli army, which has vast experience
in terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the rescue effort at Ufundi House limped along.
Kenyan and British army engineers worked through the night to
rescue about five people trapped in the rubble. Rescue workers said
Saturday afternoon they had made contact with at least two people,
a man and a woman, in the wreckage who were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   But another man died Saturday morning on the verge of being
saved, having survived for more than 24 hours with his legs pinned
under tons of masonry. Though rescue workers could not see him,
they heard his voice and lowered water and biscuits through a hole
to nourish him through his ordeal. He died before the workers could
dig him out.

</P>
<P>
   ``We will still go on,'' said Stephen Kamau, a Kenyan army
surgeon. ``We have lost a battle but we are still going to win the
war.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nairobi, grieving people struggled to come to terms with what
had happened, as they searched the hospitals for lost relatives.
</P>
<P>
   At the City Council Mortuary on Ngong Road, crowds of people
whose relatives were missing pressed up against the main gate and
demanded entry to find out if their worse fears were true.
</P>
<P>
   Samson Maunda, a 46-year-old accountant, said he had been
looking all night for his brother, Daniel Mutinda, who was an
employee of a bank on the sixth floor of the Ufundi building. He
had visited hospitals and their mortuaries, looking among the
disfigured bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have gone through all the hospitals where I could find him
alive and I have not,'' he said. ``If he was in the building at
that time, he is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Veronica Odhiambo, a 34-year-old teacher, was waiting
for word about her cousin, John Odhiambo. The 28-year-old
electrical engineer had been in the bank building next door to the
Ufundi house just minutes before the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect such a thing like this,'' she said. ``You
wonder why someone would want to do this. Even if you have a
problem with any country, why attack innocent people?''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the mortuary, the dead were laid out in ugly rows. There
were so many that some were lined up next to each other on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   There were more than 70 bodies. One victim, a young woman in
blue jeans, had been decapitated. Several were burned into charred
parodies of the human form. Many had suffered shrapnel-like
injuries to their heads. Others appeared to be sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   The linoleum floor was covered with blood. There was no place to
step without walking over a corpse.
</P>
<P>
   Orderlies let people wander through, looking for their kin. Some
had trouble telling if they had found their family members or not.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Pastor Wilfred Mayaka left the mortuary and put his arm
around his daughter as she wept quietly. After a long night, their
search was over. His wife, Lydia Mayaka, who was 40, lay in the
morgue among the other disfigured dead. She had worked in the
embassy as a clerk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lost a wife, the mother of my children. How do you
think I feel?'' the pastor said when approached by a reporter.
``Whatever you do, it doesn't help me, because I have lost a
wife.''

   ALANG, India _ After more than a million miles of plying the
world's oceans, the Milagro, a 35,000-ton, Malta-registered bulk
carrier, completed her final journey from the Persian Gulf on a
recent afternoon and dropped anchor off this windswept point on
India's northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting for the high tide that comes with a full moon, the
ship's Greek captain, Marinos Galatoulas, raised anchor and nosed
her inland, steering a zigzag course toward flapping red and yellow
flags on the beach. Smoke pouring from her funnel, the vessel
sailed the last few hundred yards full steam ahead until her rusted
prow crested the shore and rose gently into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Few maps show Alang, a soulless spot on the coastline of Gujarat
state 185 miles northwest of Bombay. But in recent years, what had
once been a poverty-stricken village has become the world's biggest
shipbreaking yard. In the 1990s, Alang has served as the graveyard
for almost half the ships scrapped by the world's navies and
merchant marines.
</P>
<P>
   Alang's drawing card has been its natural conditions _ heavy
tides and a gently sloping beach that allow a ship simply to be run
up into the sand _ as well as the availability of limitless amounts
of cheap labor for the dangerous, backbreaking job of cutting and
hammering the ships into scrap.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, environmental and safety regulations that
make shipbreaking prohibitively expensive in the United States and
other major industrialized countries are rare here, and largely
unenforced even when they exist.
</P>
<P>
   Vessels like the Milagro, mammoth 500,000-ton Japanese
supertankers and in 1995 even the U.S. aircraft carrier Bennington,
which saw service in the Vietnam War, have been scrapped by armies
of mostly illiterate migrant workers, many of them earning as
little as $2.50 a day.
</P>
<P>
   For the Indian shipbreaking companies, there has been no need
for dry docks and piers, only grimy, oil-slick patches of beach
known as ``plots,'' sparse brick structures to serve as offices,
and winches to haul the scrap back from the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Tight Scrutiny on Sale of U.S. Ships
</P>
<P>
   The desolate scene is made more so by the finality that
accompanies the last moments of the doomed ships, which arrive at
the rate of two or three a day when tides are running high.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like a hangman,'' said Andriopoulos Panagiotis, 59, a
former supertanker captain assigned by the Milagro's Greek owners
to oversee the ship's handover to Shreeram Steel and Rolling Ltd.,
operators of Plot 119, one of 183 shipbreaking yards that stretch
more than six miles along the beach. One of Panagiotis' tasks was
to complete financial arrangements with the shipbreaking yard,
which paid the Milagro's owners $1.2 million for the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The 347 ships scrapped here last year, many of them from Korea,
Japan, the Philippines, Russia and the United States, helped
generate at least $500 million in earnings for the yards, perhaps a
third of it profit after accounting for the shipbreakers' costs in
buying the vessels and paying their labor.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Gujarat Maritime Board, the state agency that
oversees Alang, the industry employs 40,000 migrant workers on the
beaches, generates jobs for at least another 200,000 people in
associated enterprises and provides 2.5 million tons of steel
annually for Indian rolling mills.
</P>
<P>
   But Alang's success has been accompanied by growing controversy,
mainly in the United States, where environmentalists and
human-rights activists have questioned the propriety of allowing
organizations decommissioning ships for scrap, including the U.S.
Navy, to sell the vessels to foreign shipbreakers who observe few
if any of the regulatory standards that have virtually crippled
shipbreaking in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, congressional hearings have resulted in
tightened scrutiny of the sale of U.S. ships to Alang, and in
tougher environmental standards that have discouraged the sale of
many U.S. merchant ships. Stricter U.S. oversight has also halted,
at least for now, Alang's purchase of U.S. Navy ships, which have
been sold for scrap in large numbers since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional concern has reverberated in India, where
authorities have scrambled to begin drawing up minimal standards of
safety, health care and housing for Alang's workers.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials at Alang, the combination of tighter U.S.
regulations and growing environmental and safety consciousness in
India has prompted many shipowners to find alternative markets for
their vessels at similar shipbreaking yards in Bangladesh, Pakistan
and Vietnam, where regulation is said to be even less rigorous than
at Alang.
</P>
<P>
   Alang's workers live in slum conditions, in wooden shacks across
from the shipbreaking yards with neither electricity nor toilets.
Most of the migrants come from three distant states, Uttar Pradesh,
Bihar and Orissa, among India's poorest, and spend months or even
years without making the long rail journeys home to their families.
</P>
<P>
   But more than the living conditions, concerns have focused on
job hazards. Until recent months, when yard owners began
distributing helmets, goggles and gloves, workers toiled on the
ships in cotton pants or loincloths, often bare-headed and
barefoot. The workers' equipment has always been rudimentary,
mostly oxyacetylene cutting torches, sledgehammers and the rusting
winches that pull the scrap steel and equipment onto the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, emergency medical help and fire-fighting
equipment were minimal. Even now, with new safety rules haphazardly
enforced and two small beach-front clinics that are financed by the
shipbreakers, at least two workers die every month, and dozens more
are injured, mostly from exploding gases and falling steel,
according to Capt. Vivek Pandey, overseer of the yards for the
Gujarat Maritime Board.
</P>
<P>
   Pandey said accident victims were eligible for compensation
payments of up to $6,250, but anecdotal evidence among the workers
suggested payments have often been far lower, where they have been
paid at all.

<P>
   Danger by Day, a Shack at Night
</P>
<P>
   Across India, Gujarat state is best known as the birthplace of
Mohandas Gandhi, leader of India's freedom struggle and champion of
the downtrodden. But it is also the font of a wily business
culture. In the first decade after shipbreaking began in 1983,
Alang became the center of a gold rush, making millionaires of men
with little knowledge of shipping, shipbreaking or industry of any
kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could call this the Wild West of Indian industry,'' said
Subodh Kumar, secretary of the Gujarat Shipbreakers Association.
Kumar, 53, said Alang's shipbreakers rarely used their own capital,
relying instead on borrowed money to buy the vessels, and then
rushing to dismantle the ships within 90 or 120 days to meet
repayment deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar said this meant that yard owners were under pressure to
dismantle the ships hastily so the yards could sell the scrap, pay
the banks and take their profits.
</P>
<P>
   A string of serious accidents culminated in April 1996 with a
huge explosion as workers dismantling a Japanese supertanker
inadvertently cut into a tank filled with explosive fumes, setting
off a blast heard more than 10 miles away. An inquiry concluded
that 16 workers were killed, but unofficial accounts suggested a
far higher toll.
</P>
<P>
   The mood among the workers is subdued, even sullen. In the
yards, under the careful watch of supervisors, few of the workers
were ready to talk about their lives. But during a lunch break, a
small group who sheltered from the harsh sun under a thorn tree
above the beach painted a gloomy picture.
</P>
<P>
   The men said that the yards' exclusion of unions left workers
powerless, and that promised benefits, including compensation when
they were injured, were frequently denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all afraid of losing our jobs,'' said Shyam Kewal
Patel, 28, a migrant from Bihar. ``If anybody raises their voice
against the shipbreaker companies, they find a way to silence him.
Either they send him away, or they pay him a little more to keep
him quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Patel led visitors to a shack at the foot of the hill. Inside
the tumbledown structure of wooden planks and steel sheeting
scavenged from the yards, he displayed his meager belongings,
including a few tattered movie magazines, a pair of rubber boots
and a rusting gas-powered stove. With another worker who shares the
shack, Patel sleeps on slatted planking spattered with mud.
</P>
<P>
   The men said they earned $75 a month for a six-day week, working
from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., about average for unskilled industrial
workers in India. Of this, they said, they tried to send at least
$17.50 a month home to their families in Bihar. At nights, they
said, they went from the yard to the shack, to cook an evening meal
before the light failed, and then went directly to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good way to live, but what's our choice?'' Patel
said. ``Either we work here or we go home to Bihar and starve.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who defend the shipbreaking companies, harsh working
conditions are explained as an Indian reality, little different at
Alang from many other industrial sites across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we don't care about the workers, but some things
are beyond our reach,'' said Pratap Shah, proprietor and editor of
the Saurashtra Samachar, the leading Gujarati-language newspaper in
Bhavnagar, a city 30 miles north of Alang. ``We are being asked to
maintain Western standards, and we simply cannot do it.''
</P>
<P>
   His comment helped to underscore another point commonly made by
Alang's shipbreakers _ that countries like the United States like
to have it both ways, criticizing poor working conditions at Alang,
in the safe knowledge that the conditions prevailing here are what
allowed the West to export an unwanted industry in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Shipbreaking Rules, and Big Loopholes
</P>
<P>
   Pandey, the official of the Gujarat Maritime Board, made the
point by paging through a thick file of documents for a copy of
regulations drawn up by two U.S. agencies, the Maritime
Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. The
regulations were tightened in 1997 after conditions at Alang, and
in similar yards in the region, stirred concern among investigators
in Washington and prompted the Navy to suspend sales to Alang.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. worries have focused on toxic substances found in many
aging ships, including asbestos and hazardous chemicals known as
PCBs that are rife in the ventilator ducts, transformers and
hydraulic fluids of many ships built in the 1970s and earlier.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. regulations require that these be removed from any ship
sold for shipbreaking before it leaves U.S. waters, and they also
specify steps to eliminate explosive gases from empty fuel and
lubricant tanks. However, the rules contain major loopholes, in the
form of exemptions where U.S. ship exporters can show that removing
toxic substances is technically difficult, dangerous or too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you see,'' Pandey said, ``even the Americans are not
faultless.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent U.S. steps to tighten the ship-export regulations
included a provision in an appropriations bill approved by the
Senate in July that would ban shipbreaking sales to any country
that does not enforce environmental laws comparable to those in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gujarat has tightened its environmental regulations,
putting inspectors on all newly arrived ships to check that tanks
are gas free before the vessels are beached, the Senate rule, if it
became law, would almost certainly end the breaking of all U.S.
ships here.
</P>
<P>
   That would distress the Indian shipbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``American ships are the best,'' said Kumar, the shipbreakers'
spokesman. ``The materials are of the best quality, maintenance is
super and their specifications are so darned honest that you know
exactly how much steel you're going to get from them. In fact,
they're so good, scrapping them makes you want to cry.''

<P>
   ROME _ Marco Liberali decided not to fiddle around while Rome
burned. Seeking relief from Rome's tropical temperatures, the
41-year-old mechanic installed central air-conditioning in his
family's apartment on the edge of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a difference it makes,'' Liberali said with the
assuredness of the newly converted. ``Humid heat is bad for you.''
</P>
<P>
   When Americans rushed to cool their air, Europeans traditionally
just slowed down and endured the summer heat. But now people like
Liberali, who got to know air-conditioning at the hotel where he
works, have decided to stop going without.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is becoming a big market for the air-conditioning
industry. Sales of air-conditioners for homes and small businesses
have grown more than 20 percent over the last three years, even as
they stayed flat in the United States, and the growth shows no sign
of abating.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, sales of air-conditioners for homes and small
businesses, including central air units for homes, are expected to
reach $3.2 billion this year, from $2.5 billion in 1996. In the
United States, they are expected only to inch up to $7.74 billion,
from $7.73 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Credit some of the growth to the pressures of a global economy,
which are increasingly forcing Europeans to work summers. Air
pollution is also bolstering the demand for air-conditioning, and
Europeans are becoming more accustomed to it in offices and their
cars, and increasingly want it in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists are concerned. Air-conditioners consume a
significant amount of energy, and their emissions help deplete the
ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many hurdles must fall before Europe can fully
indulge its new fondness for the big chill. Both electricity and
air-conditioners are costly, many homes lack proper wiring, home
power supplies are often weak and many Europeans view
air-conditioning as unhealthy: there is simply a bias to rely on
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the trend toward a cooler Europe is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above all in the whole area of small businesses and homes, the
use of air-conditioning is increasing,'' said Alfred Voss, director
of the Institute for Energy Use and Rational Use of Energy at
Stuttgart University.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe has a long way to go before air-conditioning becomes
the norm in homes. In Italy, 7 percent of homes are
air-conditioned, and in Spain 11 percent, compared with 71 percent
in the United States and more than 90 percent in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels, post offices, police stations, even hospitals, except
for operating rooms, generally do not have air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   So it is hardly surprising that the world's biggest
air-conditioner makers _ Japanese giants like Mitsubishi and Daikin
Industries, and American leaders like Carrier Corp., a unit of
United Technologies, and Trane Co., a unit of American Standard _
view Europe as a potential El Dorado. European companies, like
Riello and De Longhi in Italy, are jockeying to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture of air-conditioning is spreading,'' said Carlo
Segato, head of marketing at De Longhi, a specialist in portable
and room air-conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   But as temperatures climbed over Italy this summer, the
country's Green Party, echoing warnings from environmentalists
across Europe, argued that air-conditioners, while cooling the
inside of homes, forced out warm air, raising temperatures outside.
Moreover, they argued, more air-conditioners mean more
ozone-depleting gases in the atmosphere, which contribute to global
warming. ``Turning on your air-conditioner today,'' said Fulco
Pratesi, a Green Party spokesman in Rome, ``means suffering more
from the heat tomorrow.''

</P>
<P>
   The European air-conditioning market did not arrive overnight.
It was created after World War II by the companies that pioneered
the technology in the United States, including Carrier and York
International Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s the Japanese arrived. Mitsubishi and Toshiba have
factories in Britain and Daikin has one in Belgium. And the
Japanese got a leg up by introducing small, quiet portables and
wall models suited to small European dwellings. The Americans
responded quickly. Carrier bought local manufacturers in Spain and
Italy and redesigned its products to meet European demands.
</P>
<P>
   European companies, for their part, took a chapter from the
Japanese and copied Japanese models. The Italians introduced snappy
new models at competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
   De Longhi, long a maker of room heaters, began importing Toshiba
air-conditioners in 1988, then built its own, and its engineers now
use refrigerants that do not damage the atmosphere, including a
butane mixture similar to lighter fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Air-conditioning makers must scramble to find economical
substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons, gases traditionally used as
refrigerants, which were banned by the Montreal Protocol, a 1987
treaty signed by more than 150 countries, because they deplete the
earth's ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent accords banned the production of the interim
substitute, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, after 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's industry is under particular pressure because Germany,
Italy and Sweden, heeding environmentalists, want these gases gone
by 2000. When a company in eastern Germany first produced
refrigerators using butane in 1992, Greenpeace bought the first 10
prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   But substitutes are expensive. Sergio Zanolin, De Longhi's head
of research, said butane air-conditioners cost 10 percent to 20
percent more than conventional models. While Americans can trundle
down to a Home Depot and pick up a window unit for about $200, the
least expensive room models in Europe sell for almost $1,000
because of low production runs and expensive components.
</P>
<P>
   This year De Longhi expects to sell about $165 million worth of
air-conditioners and has even carved out a niche in the United
States. In part, sales received a boost in Europe from
air-conditioning's use as a marketing tool by stores, shopping
centers and professional offices of dentists and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last five years have seen a revolution in light commercial
use,'' said Halsey Cook, Carrier's head of marketing in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   When automobile air-conditioning caught on in the early 1990s,
it was largely thanks to stagnant auto sales, which prompted car
makers to offer air-conditioners to attract buyers. Five years ago,
hardly any European cars were air-conditioned; now, 28 percent are.
</P>
<P>
   That may be peanuts compared with the United States, where 95
percent of cars are air-conditioned, but the market continues to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting started, people are buying it, and the technology
now allows it,'' said Sandro Frigerio, who follows the auto
air-conditioning market at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in London. He said
innovation and miniaturization now enabled auto makers to cool
small European cars without significant power loss or higher gas
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   And as Europeans grow fond of air-conditioning in cars and
dentists' offices, more want it at home.
</P>
<P>
   Not that sales have exploded. ``The domestic market is really on
the edge of a boom,'' said Jacques Benoist, director of
certification at Eurovent, an industry association established
recently in Paris to certify air-conditioning equipment. ``But it
didn't happen yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are many reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The first, of course, is price, which is compounded by energy
problems. In some countries, like Italy, sufficient electricity is
scarce. Typical Italian homes are equipped with smaller circuit
breakers than American homes. In Italy, a separate circuit for
air-conditioning costs as much as $400.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, Europe's reluctance can be traced to the relatively mild
climate, with little of the tropical heat that assaults cities like
Houston or Miami. Yet temperatures in Granada, Spain, or Palermo,
Italy, can easily surpass those in New York. Some experts also
point to a tendency for Europeans to favor nature over technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they design a building, they take greater advantage of
natural lighting and ventilation,'' said Bruce Anderson, head of
marketing in Europe for Trane, based in Tyler, Texas ``So owners
will say, `There's no reason to have air-conditioning.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such reluctance is bolstered by a conviction that
air-conditioning is unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Italian newspapers, which regularly advise readers how to deal
with the heat, warn against it. The weekly health insert of La
Repubblica in Rome recently warned readers that air-conditioning
could cause colds and sore throats and spread ``germs, viruses and
bacteria'' through unclean filters.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, many experts argue the opposite. In the
recent heat wave, more than 120 deaths were attributed to the heat.
Indeed, some European doctors increasingly recommend
air-conditioning for the elderly and for people with heart trouble
and respiratory ailments.
</P>
<P>
   In response, European manufacturers have developed quieter and
more efficient models. And increased production, economies of scale
and cheap foreign imports will cut prices. In television ads,
Italian importers offer cheap Chinese air-conditioners free to
viewers who order mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as Europe deregulates the energy market, electricity
supplies are expected to rise, thus reducing the cost.
</P>
<P>
   In France the national utility, Electricite de France, offers
bonuses to builders who install energy-efficient heat pumps, which
warm homes in winter and cool them in summer. Italy's national
utility, Enel, now penalizes energy use by charging higher rates as
more power is consumed. ``Ten to 15 years ago, we had power
shortages,'' said Enel marketing director Roberto Formigoni. ``Now
we have lots to sell.'' So Enel is petitioning Rome's energy
authority to cut rates and increase the supply for homes.
</P>
<P>
   Antonietta Marconi, marketing director of GMC Climatizzatori,
where Liberali bought his equipment, says it cannot happen too
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the air-conditioning business for six years, and
prices will fall,'' she said. ``It will become like central
heating.''
</P>
<P>
   Voss, of Stuttgart University, agrees. ``With energy prices
coming down, I think it's safe to say the tendency will be for
demand for appliances like air-conditioners to continue to grow,''
he said. &QL;

IN DNA TESTING, THE RESULTS DEPEND ON THE QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As FBI scientists conduct tests on one of Monica Lewinsky's
dresses, trying to determine whether it contains physical evidence
of a sexual encounter with President Clinton, they are employing a
science that, though still sharply debated in court, is considered
highly reliable and capable of answering a number of questions with
remarkable speed and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite early arguments over its use, lawyers and scientists
agree that properly conducted DNA analysis is convincing evidence,
though jurors are still free to disregard it, as they apparently
did in the murder trial of O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time it works pretty well, particularly if you
have an ample sample,'' said Dr. William Thompson, a law professor
at the University of California at Irvine who often works with
defense lawyers and who has been sharply critical of DNA work done
in some laboratories that he says were incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of DNA, the material in human cells that records each
person's genetic inheritance, from height to hair color, cannot
give absolute proof that a given sample came from a particular
person. But scientists can calculate the odds, and their
calculations are persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you prove it to one chance in a million or one chance in a
hundred thousand, that's better proof than most of us ever see,''
said Dr. Charles Brenner, a forensic mathematician in Berkeley,
Calif., who consults for DNA testing laboratories, mostly for the
prosecution in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   But the actual process of analyzing a given piece of evidence,
like the dress Ms. Lewinsky provided to prosecutors, is a
complicated matter. It is easy to cut off a tiny piece of fabric
containing a stain and then soak off any cells on that fabric.
Then, however, what is learned depends on what questions are asked.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI will not comment on how it is proceeding or what tests
it is using on Ms. Lewinsky's dress, said Jule Miller, a
spokeswoman for the agency. But others who are familiar with
forensic testing described standard methods, which for the FBI are
routine.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the tests are ongoing, or whether they
have been completed, with the results closely held. Whatever the
case, the work is probably being done in one of two FBI DNA
laboratories, most likely the one on the third floor of the J.
Edgar Hoover building, the FBI's fortress-like headquarters in
Washington. That laboratory is one of more than 20 in the Hoover
building. Others are used to test everything from paint chips to
fingerprints. Those same laboratories were used in other
high-profile cases, including that of TWA Flight 800, which crashed
near New York. In fact, evidence from that investigations remains
in the laboratories there.
</P>
<P>
   The other DNA laboratory, almost a duplicate, is in the bureau's
training complex at Quantico, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, DNA testing was challenged in many courtrooms
and other forums because, critics argued, laboratories were prone
to make mistakes. But since then the debate has been muffled, and
DNA tests have been used in successful prosecutions and to allow
the Pentagon to identify remains exhumed from the Tomb of the
Unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lewinsky dress, the first task would be to look for
sperm cells. To do that, investigators like to use a ``Christmas
tree'' stain, named for the way it colors cells, said Dr. Edward
Blake, a forensic scientist at Forensic Science Associates of
Richmond, Calif. With this stain, a cell's nucleus, where DNA is
located, stains red. The cytoplasm, the jellylike material
surrounding the nucleus, turns green. Sperm are easily visible
because they have virtually no cytoplasm and so, unlike other cells
in the body, they stain only red.
</P>
<P>
   If scientists see sperm in the sample on the dress, they would
want to isolate the sperm DNA. All that is needed for a successful
DNA test is 300 sperm. Even a drop the size of a pinhead normally
contains 50,000 to 100,000 sperm, Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   With the sperm DNA in hand, scientists can test it with
molecular probes to be certain it is human DNA. If it is, they can
do the actual DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   The quickest DNA test focuses on six genes that vary slightly
from person to person. With one of the genes, dq alpha, individuals
can have any of 28 distinct gene patterns. The other five genes
come in either three or six variants. Enumerating the list of
possible combinations of gene patterns is almost like the list of
possible combinations in a lottery. There is only one chance in
3,000 that two people, by chance, would have exactly the same
combinations of the genes, Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see which variant of each gene a person has.
Scientists make multiple copies of the six genes in the person's
DNA by using an enzyme programmed to copy the genes. As they do so,
they add a marker to each gene copy. Then they pour a solution
containing the gene copies over a nylon strip embedded with all the
variants of the six genes. Each gene in the solution locks onto its
matching gene in the nylon strip. And when a gene docks with its
counterpart on the nylon strip, the marker makes it light up blue.
So by looking at the blue dots on the nylon strip, scientists can
immediately see which gene variants an individual has.
</P>
<P>
   Because so much might hinge on the result of the DNA test,
forensic investigators might want to confirm it with an even more
sensitive test that looks for individual variations in repeated
segments of DNA that are scattered about like molecular stutters.
An individual's pattern of these repeated segments is essentially
unique. But the standard test to look for such a pattern can take
months. A newer test that looks for shorter repeated DNA segments
can be completed in days, Dr. Blake said. But laboratories have
less experience with it, and results from it might be more
vulnerable to challenge in court, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic laboratories can also analyze cells other than sperm
that might be in a stain. If the sperm were ejaculated in a sexual
encounter, cells from the partner might be mixed in the stain, and
scientists can determine what kind of cells they are and whose
cells they are.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility that arises in forensics is a semen stain
that contains no sperm because the man had a vasectomy, which
severs the pipeline of sperm to the seminal fluid. In that case, a
DNA analysis would be much more difficult, if not impossible.
Scientists would be unable to separate the DNA from the few male
cells in the ejaculate from the DNA of the female cells mixed in
and would have to do delicate molecular tests and then infer the
man's DNA profile. The analysis would depend on how many male cells
there were compared with female cells and whether the female DNA
totally swamped that of the male. There is no information on
whether Clinton has had a vasectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Such an analysis could be pushing the limits of molecular
biology, Blake said. And it is when such limits are pushed, said
Thompson, that lawyers and scientists start disputing results.

FEDS SAY PRISON POPULATION GREW BY 5 PERCENT IN '97, DESPITE CRIME
DROP
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic on states with highest and lowest rates of
prisoners is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers can

 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's prison population grew by 5.2 percent in 1997,
according to the Justice Department, even though crime has been
declining for six straight years, suggesting that the imprisonment
boom has developed a built-in growth dynamic independent of the
crime rate, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report, the Justice Department said the number of
Americans in local jails and in state and federal prisons rose to
1,725,842 in 1997, up from 1.1 million in 1990. During that period,
the incarceration rate in state and federal prisons rose to 445 per
100,000 Americans in 1997, up from 292 per 100,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   As for why the number of prisoners continues to grow while crime
drops, Pennsylvania Secretary of Corrections Martin Horn said:
``You have to understand that as incarcerating more people has
helped reduce crime, the number of people we sent to prison in
previous years is tending to build up, creating a delayed effect.
So you've built in this escalating growth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Horn said, ``most people who work in the
prison business don't look for drops in crime to lead to drops in
the prison population; the two lines are somewhat independent.''
But, he added: ``If crime stayed down for the long term, then the
incarceration rate might fall. But crime never does stay down for
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the specific reasons for the continued growth in the
prison population, Horn and other experts said, are longer
sentences, reduced use of parole, increased arrests of parole
violators who are then sent back to prison, and improved efficiency
by the police in solving crimes as there are fewer crimes to solve.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the
department's statistical branch, found that violent offenses
accounted for the largest source of growth among male prisoners in
1997, 52 percent of their total increase. But drug crimes
constituted the biggest source of growth for female inmates, 45
percent of their total.
</P>
<P>
   Using new methods to analyze the race of state and federal
prisoners, the report found that the incarceration rate for black
men in 1996 was 3,096 per 100,000, eight times the rate for white
men (370 per 100,000), and more than double the rate for Hispanic
men (1,276 per 100,000). The figures provided one of the most
powerful illustrations of racial disparity in the nation's prisons.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1996, the report also said, there were more black
men in prison than whites, 526,200 to 510,900. The racial
disparities were particularly striking among young men, the report
found, with 8.3 percent of black men age 25 to 29 in prison in
1996, compared with 2.6 percent of Hispanic men in the same age
group and 0.8 percent of white men of those ages.
</P>
<P>
   There are also sharp regional differences in incarceration
rates, according to the report, with 7 of the 10 states with the
highest rates being in the South, led by Texas with a rate of 717
prisoners per 100,000 and Louisiana with 672 per 100,000. The
states with the lowest rates were North Dakota, 112 prisoners per
100,000; Minnesota, 113 per 100,000; Maine, 124 per 100,000, and
Vermont, 140,000 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the South had the highest incarceration rate, with 506
prisoners per 100,000, while the Northeast had the lowest rate, 317
per 100,000. The South has long had the highest crime rates of any
region, but the report did not try to analyze whether the South's
high incarceration rate was a result of its high crime rate or a
matter of public policy favoring tough sentencing laws.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Beck, one of the authors of the report, said that to
understand how the number of prisoners nationwide could continue to
grow while crime fell, it was important to remember that ``the
sources of growth are independent, to a certain extent, of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Many states, for example, have adopted tougher sentencing laws,
with mandatory minimum sentences, and this is helping increase the
amount of time prisoners serve, which in turn increases the prison
population. In addition, some states have abolished parole, and in
many other states parole boards have much less discretion than they
used to, Beck said, changes that also lengthen the amount of time
prisoners serve. In 1990, decisions by parole boards accounted for
39.4 percent of all prisoners released, a sharp drop from 55
percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Still another reason for the growth, while crime drops, is that
an increasing number of prisoners are being incarcerated for parole
violations, about 30 percent today compared with 15 percent in
1980, Beck said. That means that the larger the number of
prisoners, the bigger the number of people who will someday be
released, and then, either because of their own criminal
propensities or their experience behind bars, will be likely to
commit some new violation and be rearrested.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Love Child might not recognize the place.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Haight and Ashbury Streets, ground zero of the 1960s
counterculture revolution, a Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice cream store now
stands on one corner, a Gap clothing store on another.
</P>
<P>
   They are hardly the only reminders of mainstream America's
plunge into The Haight, a neighborhood that threw open its
psychedelic arms to the hippies and misfits whose Summer of Love
more than 30 years ago became part of the national conscience.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the trendy stores, specialty restaurants and
nearby Victorian houses that sell for $1 million and more is
perhaps The Haight's most compelling change, one that is less
discernible to the roving eye.
</P>
<P>
   While the now romanticized flower children were painted as being
spiritually connected by political ideology and the haze of a
marijuana high, many young people on the same streets today share
the common pain of broken lives and harder drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the kids back then came here, to something, and it
was a dream for many of them,'' said Jim Beck, president of the
Haight Ashbury Neighborhood Council, a citizens' organization.
``Kids here today are running from something, and for a lot of them
it's the nightmare in their past.''
</P>
<P>
   A 19-year-old who calls herself Froggy sat on a newspaper rack
in front of Ben &AMP; Jerry's. Reared by foster parents, she said she
found her biological mother when she was 9 and lived with her for
four years. She then set out on her own and hitchhiked here from
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't want me in the first place,'' Froggy said, with a
sad expression. ``So I took off.''
</P>
<P>
   She wears a tall, red hat and makes her way in the world by
selling drugs on the street, which she said she intends to do until
she saves enough money to buy a house in Montana. At night, she
sleeps nearby in Golden Gate Park.
</P>
<P>
   Froggy said she liked life on the streets of The Haight. But
Beth, who is 18, does not. Beth said she came here from Austin,
Texas, with her boyfriend ``two and a half lousy months ago''
because they had never seen California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he got sent to jail on four counts of assault with a
deadly weapon,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also sleeps in Golden Gate Park, and sometimes begs for
money. ``People throw three pennies in your face and tell me to get
a job,'' she said. ``I hate this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth was happy about one thing, at least. ``I kicked my heroin
habit yesterday,'' she said. ``I'm clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 23, has the hollow eyes of a ghost and wears a hood over
his head. Another Texan, he said he just got out of a hospital
after overdosing on drugs. Unlike Froggy and Beth, he has a place
of his own to sleep _ his car. He said he made money by selling
drugs, but now had no idea what he was going to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was back home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The streets are filled with people like Froggy, Beth and Thomas
among the chronic homeless who are everywhere in San Francisco and
constitute a major problem for city agencies. Local officials say
that at night as many as 5,000 people need shelter, and the city
can accommodate fewer than half of them.
</P>
<P>
   But here in The Haight, the roaming population of homeless
teen-agers, many of whom buy and use drugs like heroin, cocaine and
methamphetamine, is trying the patience of a community that has
prided itself on tolerance, understanding and the social services
it provides, like medical care from the Haight Ashbury Free
Clinics, founded in 1967 to help low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   A flier on the front window of the Haight Ashbury Music Center
says: ``Take Back The Haight. Enough of the constant mess. No more
begging, stealing, littering, hopelessness, despair and bad
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   It was written by Steven Capozzola, a resident of Ashbury
Street, who asked business owners to display the flier because he
had ``grown tired of the mess _ of coming home from work and
encountering an endless barrage of chaos, filth and waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Pasqualin, the manager of the music store and a longtime
resident of The Haight, said complaints about the street life were
cyclical. He and other residents say they have grown loud again
because area businesses are doing well, but the Froggys of the
world are creating an edginess to the daily routine that annoys
residents and could drive away customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haight has always been tolerant of the freedom of personal
expression. Even people who own the fancy homes support that,''
Pasqualin said. ``But when you reach a point where people have no
respect for the life style others want to live, and working folks
feel harassed because they can't walk the streets, that's when it
gets pretty frustrating.''

TWO FEUDING DEMOCRATIC VOICES CALL A TRUCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two long-feuding pillars of the Democratic Party, the AFL-CIO
and the Democratic Leadership Council, have agreed to a detente in
which they pledge to stop attacking each other and to seek common
ground to help the Democrats this fall and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   This truce between the leadership council, the Democrats'
leading centrist voice, and the labor federation, the party's most
powerful liberal voice, comes after the council and the federation
savaged each other in last year's dispute over trade legislation.
</P>
<P>
   DLC president Al From went so far as to accuse the
13-million-member union group of leading the opposition to the
president and of wanting ``to stop change in our party.''
</P>
<P>
   After White House officials warned the council that its harsh
words were undermining Democratic unity, From and AFL-CIO president
John Sweeney agreed to abide by a nonaggression pact and to seek to
forge some common positions. In the past, the two groups have
clashed not only over trade, but also over education, reducing the
size of the federal government and overhauling welfare.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, From said, ``If we could ever bring the New
Democrats, with our broad appeal to the electorate, together with
labor and its organizational strength, we would have one big
progressive coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing that it wanted to mend fences with labor, the leadership
council opposed a California measure, defeated in a June
referendum, that would have crippled labor's political clout by
requiring that unions get each member's permission annually before
spending a member's dues on politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two sides still clash over trade, they are trying
to find common positions on many issues, including Social Security
and charter schools, innovative public schools that are allowed to
operate free of many bureaucratic rules. In the past the leadership
council has supported wholesale changes in the schools, while
unions have been ambivalent, wanting to insure that innovative
schools did not threaten teachers' job security.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Rosenthal, the political director of the AFL-CIO,
referring to the leadership council, said, ``They make a
contribution to the Democratic Party, and so do we. And we have to
figure out where there's common ground.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups also agreed on the leadership council's call for
``expanding the winner's circle'' to help insure that most
Americans, not just a minority, benefit from increased trade and
the increased integration of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   This agreement comes at the same time that the White House has
brought many of the party's leading moderate and liberal thinkers
together to try to forge a united voice and common themes that
would help strengthen President Clinton's legacy and would help
Democrats in this year's elections and in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership council generally backs programs that promote
market-driven solutions on economic policies. It has long fought
with the AFL-CIO and other liberal groups that are more
enthusiastic about government-sponsored programs that protect the
disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   The council has been one of the Democratic Party's most
outspoken voices in favor of freer trade. It fervently backed the
fast-track legislation, shelved last fall in the face of intense
labor pressure, that would have made it easier for Washington to
sign free-trade agreements with other countries. Fearing that the
legislation would drag down wages and eliminate jobs, the AFL-CIO
fought it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the truce, many tensions remain. In the spring issue of
its magazine, the leadership council criticized ``the union
hierarchy'' for seeking ``political allies among left-wing
activists.''
</P>
<P>
   The council and the federation also disagree about the best
strategy for the Democrats in November. The leadership council
favors a moderate message that appeals to suburban middle-class
voters, a pivotal swing group. But the AFL-CIO backs a more
have-nots versus haves message that would mobilize the party's
liberal-labor base.

<P>
   PORNOC, Yugoslavia _ Gzim Shala looked around at the tufts of
grass, the hard ground where they fought to grow, the skinny trees
that gave his family campsite little shelter from the sun, and the
turgid stream nearby, blanketed by dancing insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best we could find,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week Shala was the proud head of his extended family,
owner of a house, livestock and equipment earned in 20 years of
farming. Now he is one of perhaps 100,000 ethnic Albanians driven
from their homes by a Serbian offensive aimed at wresting control
over central and western Kosovo from ethnic Albanian guerrillas who
are fighting for an independent country.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees have only the slimmest measure of protection
against the disease and starvation that international aid officials
fear is imminent. A U.N. official said Saturday that the few
doctors who have reached refugees estimate that 50 percent of
children suffer dehydration and the first effects of malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Shala's family ran through Serbian artillery, walked over
mountains for four days and set up camp here. The youngest of his
clan of 16 is 1, the oldest 77.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the clothes we're wearing, three plates and two
forks,'' he said. ``One of those international aid groups _ I think
it was the Germans _ gave us five blankets.''
</P>
<P>
   With food and four foam mats and plastic sheets they got from
ethnic Albanian villagers nearby, they can survive in the open, for
now, as the rain has been light so far.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Shala children broke out in festering sores on
Friday. The group does not know when, or if, new artillery fire
will force renewed flight. They live off moldy bread and green
peppers cooked on coals from a fire built between two rocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only the beginning,'' Shala said. ``There will be more
hunger and disease because we can't go back home. Everything there
is gone, burned. And if we go back, the police will kill us.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Albanians who returned to one village, Glarev,
were killed. ``We saw that village burning on the way here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo Albanians' tight-knit society, many refugee
families have been taken in by relatives or strangers. But they and
their benefactors are relying on a collapsed economy. The villages
where most have found shelter are already lacking in food, clean
water and medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee officials spoke only on condition of anonymity, for fear
of endangering aid efforts already hurt by government interference.
They acknowledged that they were unprepared for such a massive
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the personnel to go out there and even assess
the situation properly,'' said one U.N. official.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the village of Prapa Can, where refugees have swelled the
population to 3,500 from 1,000, Dr. Shyt Shala's delivery room has
a rough concrete floor, a single light bulb and a candle for use
when the electricity goes out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I see about 30 women a day for prenatal care and
delivery,'' Shala said. ``Three are in labor here now, but I have
only five sets of sterile gloves, so by tomorrow we'll be back to
primitive medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran out of the normal prenatal medications like hormones
and antibiotics about two weeks ago,'' added the doctor, who was
almost too tired to speak. That was just after the offensive began,
he explained. ``If there is a premature birth, we can't get the
mother to a real clinic. Last night and a week ago a baby died
because we couldn't help them.''
</P>
<P>
   The government considers this enemy territory, as it does other
refugee enclaves. Indeed, Kosovo's ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs
roughly nine to one in this impoverished province of 2 million, and
most of them support the rebels. Many refugee families are lacking
young men, who they say stayed behind to fight.
</P>
<P>
   No Western government supports the rebels' aim of independence.
For the heavily armed Serbian police officers and Yugoslav soldiers
fighting for the government, that is a green light to regain
control of the territory _ by any means.

SECRET SERVICE REPORT CHALLENGES ASSASSIN STEREOTYPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Portraits of assassins are fixed in the American mind:
the deranged madman, the lonely loser obsessed with his target, the
political killer following threats with violence.
</P>
<P>
   These portraits are the stuff of myth, the Secret Service has
concluded in ``Preventing Assassination,'' a new study of all 83
people who attacked or tried to attack an American political figure
or celebrity in the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Agents and psychologists analyzed the lives and actions of Lee
Harvey Oswald, John Hinckley and lesser players. The study was
bolstered by interviews with a special corps of collaborators, 23
of the assassins themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The results, recently made available, challenge several
stereotypes. Fewer than half of the assassins showed symptoms of
mental illness. Many shifted from one target to another, valuing
the act more than the victim. Not one had communicated a direct
threat to the target or to law-enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, the Secret Service says, is that assassins are
recognizable, not by who they are, but by what they do. Though
assassins fit no physical or psychological profile, most share a
pattern of behavior. Assassination is not a spontaneous event, but
a trail of action that can lead to discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far more productive, and ultimately more accurate,'' the
Secret Service concluded, ``to examine a chain of thinking that
leads a person to see assassination as an acceptable or necessary
action, and to attend to behaviors that may precede an attack, than
to simply label assassins and assassination as `irrational' or
`crazy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lessons from the five-year research project are changing the way
the Secret Service identifies and investigates people who may pose
a threat to the President and other public figures. Experts outside
the Secret Service say the study is helping efforts to prevent
stalking, workplace assaults and other forms of targeted violence.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging art of ``protective intelligence'' was put in the
spotlight on July 24, when two policemen were killed at the Capitol
in Washington. The intentions of the accused gunman, Russell Eugene
Weston Jr., may never be known. It is known that in 1996 he was
interviewed by the Secret Service after he made apparently
delusional comments about President Clinton. Later, after
threatening a neighbor, he was involuntarily committed to a mental
hospital for paranoid schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the Secret Service tries to assess the risk posed by
about 2,000 people. Some have made explicit or vague threats
against the president or another national leader. Others expressed
romantic interest in a public figure, pressed grievances that
seemed unreasonable or tried to volunteer as a protector.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, as with Weston, the Secret Service finds that the
person presents a low risk and the case is closed. Only about 4
percent are arrested. About 13 percent are committed to mental
health treatment, many voluntarily, and often because they are a
threat to themselves or others near them, not to someone under
Secret Service protection.
</P>
<P>
   Protective intelligence is part science, part old-fashioned
investigation and part common sense. It is not foolproof. In 1975,
for example, Secret Service agents judged that Sara Jane Moore was
no threat, and police officers took a gun away from her, the day
before she shot at President Gerald R. Ford.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 the Secret Service started the Exceptional Case Study
Project, which begins with a 1949 case, when Ruth Ann Steinhagen, a
19-year-old fan, shot star baseball player Eddie Waitkus in a
Chicago hotel. He survived.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases include the killings of John Lennon, Robert F.
Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, and the attacks by
the Unabomber.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have long assumed that assassins fit a profile. But
the Secret Service found no profile of background or description
fitting enough assassins to be helpful in deciding who is
dangerous. Eighty-six percent were men. Seventy-seven percent were
white. The youngest was 16 and the oldest was 73.
</P>
<P>
   About half the assassins were single and had never been married,
and one in three had children. Almost half had gone to college.
Several had successful careers. Only one in five had been arrested
as an adult for a violent offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be inaccurate to dismiss these attackers and
near-attackers as inadequate, unaccomplished losers,'' the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``None were models of emotional well-being,'' the Secret Service
concluded, ``but relatively few suffered from serious mental
illnesses that caused their attack behaviors.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four percent of the assassins had histories of serious
depression or despair. Fifty-four percent had a history of
harassing others. Forty-one percent had made suicide threats.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight percent of the assassins had been hospitalized at
least once for psychiatric reasons, ranging from long-term
treatment to brief admissions for suicidal threats. An additional
23 percent had been evaluated or treated by a mental health
professional, ranging from counseling during adolescence to years
of care for mental disability. In all, 43 percent had a history of
delusions, but only 10 percent claimed to hear voices telling them
to attack.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger pattern emerged in their recent experiences. Nearly
all had suffered a recent trauma, like a marital breakup or job
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does seem clear is that, for almost all subjects, attacks
or near-lethal approaches occurred after a period of downward
spiral in their lives,'' the Secret Service found.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequent motive that assassins gave for attacking a
public figure was to achieve notoriety or fame. Only a few wanted
political change or acted in a group. Other assassins wanted to
avenge a perceived wrong, to end their pain by being imprisoned or
hospitalized or killed, to save the country or the world, to
achieve a special relationship with the target, or, rarely, to obey
voices ordering them to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Assassins seeking fame usually chose a prominent victim.
Feelings about the target were irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have voted for him if I hadn't been in jail charged
with trying to kill him,'' one unidentified attacker told the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the assassins considered more than one target.
Oswald, for example, fired a shot at a retired general less than a
year before killing President John F. Kennedy in 1963. And Hinckley
stalked President Jimmy Carter and actress Jodie Foster before
shooting President Ronald Reagan in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service still investigates all people who make a
threat, but it no longer assumes that a threat precedes an attack.
``Although some threateners may pose a real threat, usually they do
not,'' the Secret Service said. ``However, most importantly, those
who pose threats frequently do not make threats.''
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service has written a guide for state and local
officials on preventing assassinations and other violence directed
at individuals. The guide and the research report are now available
from the National Institute of Justice (800-851-3420 or 810 Seventh
Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20531).
</P>
<P>
   ``This work has broken new ground in the way people study
targeted violence,'' said Randy Borum, a forensic psychologist and
assistant professor at Duke University Medical Center. ``The Secret
Service has steered people away from the myths.''
</P>
<P>
   While robbing them of their mystique, the Secret Service gives
America's assassins the only thanks that their government is likely
to bestow upon them. ``We are also deeply grateful,'' the authors
write, ``to the men and women who were subjects of this study and
who consented to be interviewed.''

U.S. OIL COMPANIES CHAFE AT CURBS ON INVESTMENT IN IRAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKU, Azerbaijan _ American oil companies, the largest players
on the energy-rich Caspian Sea, are expressing growing exasperation
with the White House policy forbidding American investment in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an overture to Iran by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in June, the administration has insisted that geopolitical
strategy outstrips the commercial advantages being ceded to
European companies doing business there.
</P>
<P>
   Intense lobbying by letter, in advertisements and by oil
executives personally has gone nowhere in an administration that
promotes commercial diplomacy but draws a line at Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be admitted there is a problem with American
companies,'' Stuart Eizenstat, under secretary for economic affairs
at the State Department, said in a telephone interview. ``But this
is a situation where the strategic interests of the United States
are so great that they outweigh temporary advantages of American
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   By moving into Iran, Eizenstat said, European companies are
providing revenue that the Iranians may use to develop weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to be a factor the Europeans discount,'' he said.
``We don't have the luxury of discounting the strategic burden.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict dramatizes an administration in agonizing flux,
trying to adapt to a changed, intensely competitive global economy
in which America's allies are brazenly defying sanctions while
trying also to appease a Republican-controlled Congress that
adamantly supports the continued isolation of countries like Iran,
Libya and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the fall of the shah nearly two decades
ago, Iran is aggressively marketing investment opportunities,
making it a particularly hot subject for American oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference in London in July, European corporations lined
up to bid on 43 oil and gas projects worth $5.6 billion offered by
the state-owned Iranian National Oil Co.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast the American oil companies, constrained by a
sanctions law and a 1995 presidential order barring business in
Iran, sent only mid-level representatives who could gather
information but could not negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The London conference provided a great opportunity for the
West Europeans to gain great advantage,'' said Archie Dunham, the
president of Conoco. ``I hope it's only a short-term advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Clinton, Dunham made clear that as European
companies increasingly disregard American sanctions against Iran,
they are getting more than just a leg up. In the medium to long
run, American oil executives say, it is economically not realistic
to exclude Iran from the development of the Caspian as the region
becomes one of the world's major energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco has been a chief critic of the sanctions since the
company was forced to cancel a $2 billion contract with Iran two
years ago, only to watch this May as the United States granted a
French-led consortium a waiver from sanctions for the same deal.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium included Total SA of France, Gazprom of Russia
and Petronas of Malaysia. Clinton granted the waiver in return for
an agreement by the three countries to clamp down on the sale of
nuclear technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, in addition to barring
American business from the two countries, imposes penalties against
any company from any nation investing more than $20 million there.
</P>
<P>
   Dunham told Clinton that he supported the waiver even though
Conoco's competitors benefited, but he warned that the European
companies were gaining long-term advantages in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the governments of the foreign companies
investing in Iran are prepared to defend the actions of their
corporations,'' Dunham wrote. ``This is because Iran is important
to the economic and national development of the Caspian region.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Some American companies see Iran, one of five countries that
border the landlocked Caspian Sea, not only as a place for
exploration but also as an economic route for transporting energy
to Western markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration has put considerable diplomatic effort
into promoting countries that were once part of the Soviet Union _
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan _ as new sources of energy
that bypass both Russia and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, oil companies that have already started extracting
oil and gas from the Caspian are questioning the wisdom of an
administration-backed plan that would put oil in a lengthy and
expensive pipeline from Baku to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The administration likes this idea because it anchors Turkey, a
NATO ally, in the quest for oil and avoids Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing the growing disquiet about the proposed pipeline, an
American oil executive here said, ``We don't want to be stuck with
a white elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   As an indication of the complexities of the questions, the
administration has appointed a coordinator for Caspian Sea issues.
He is Richard Morningstar, who has been director of American aid in
the countries of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil and Conoco have led the effort to persuade the
administration to be more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco has proposed that American companies be permitted to
invest the same amount as foreign companies _ $20 million each
annually.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Mobil sponsored advertisements in two newspapers asking
that U.S. companies be permitted to ``swap'' oil with Iran _
deliver Caspian crude for use in Iran's northern cities, then pick
up an equivalent volume at the country's southern port of Kharg
Island.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements also suggested that the companies be allowed
to negotiate deals with Iran, with the understanding that these
would remain unconsummated until sanctions are lifted _ a precedent
established in Vietnam before the trade embargo there was abolished
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the advertisements asked for the repeal of a ban on the
use of Iranian equipment on the Caspian, a move that would free
American companies to participate with partners who use
Iranian-supplied equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders have been watching the progress of an
application for the swap waiver that Mobil made to the Treasury
Department in April, perceiving it as a bellwether of
administration policy.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat, the under secretary, said the application had not yet
been considered at the highest levels. But he said swaps were not a
``simple solution'' to the Caspian's transportation problems, and
asserted that they ``could create a dangerous dependency on Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the United States appears unlikely to budge much, oil
industry analysts said the pressure will continue to build.
</P>
<P>
   They cited a recent trip to Tehran by Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi, followed by a delegation of top European Union
leaders. Industry analysts expect more European leaders to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Both British Petroleum and Shell operate offices in Tehran.
Recently BP also sent crude oil samples from Azerbaijan to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco officials said they were not entirely pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that, in her overture to Iran, secretary Albright
spoke of the need for a ``road map'' to the development of
relations between the United States and Iran, the same language
that Conoco's Dunham employed in his earlier appeal to Clinton.

A CHALLENGE TO IMMUNITY FOR LOBBYISTS AT THE U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: India)  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Last year, as India's envoy to the U.N. headquarters
here was sipping coffee in the delegates' lounge, her aide pointed
out the man at the next table.
</P>
<P>
   It was Anup Chetia, leader of a separatist group in India that
had taken responsibility for the kidnapping of the envoy's nephew a
month earlier. Chetia, secretary-general of the United Liberation
Front of Assam, had gained entry to the U.N. grounds as a member of
a nongovernmental organization attending a session on human-rights
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My nephew had disappeared, and here was Chetia walking around
Geneva completely free,'' the envoy, Arundhati Ghose, said
indignantly in a recent interview. ``And we were going to have him
_ a criminal _ telling us about human-rights violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ghose wanted action against Chetia, whose group had
kidnapped Sanjoy Ghose, 37, head of a private development agency
helping villagers in northeast India. The organization insisted
that Ghose had drowned, but his body has never been found, leading
his family to believe that he was still being held by the
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so blinded by rage, I wanted to leap over the table at
him,'' Ms. Ghose said of Chetia.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of throttling Chetia, who was later arrested in
Bangladesh on unrelated charges, Ms. Ghose began a campaign to
alert U.N. and Swiss officials to the danger of suspected criminals
and terrorists taking advantage of the legal immunity granted to
certain interest groups while in Switzerland on U.N. business.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of such nongovernmental representatives enter the U.N.
headquarters in Geneva and New York each year. Switzerland
automatically provides visas to members of groups accredited by the
United Nations. So far, Ms. Ghose has succeeded in getting U.N. and
Swiss officials to take another look at their 52-year-old
agreement, which has been interpreted in practice as requiring
neither side to take action.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials maintain that Switzerland, as the host country,
gives immunity to nongovernmental organizations' staff members to
carry out their business, but that this should not shield these
people from accountability for crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss officials, for their part, argue that legitimate
nongovernmental staff members have immunity from arrest, and that
Swiss police are not permitted to enter U.N. grounds to make
arrests. This would extend, the Swiss say, even to a case like
Chetia's, even though while he was in Geneva, Swiss Interpol
received a top-priority request from India for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Nongovernmental staff members ``need to be able to travel to and
from the host country to be able to speak freely at meetings,''
said a U.N. legal adviser. ``Otherwise, you would open the door to
abuse for anyone who criticizes a government at any meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bitter complaints routinely surface at human-rights meetings,
where political adversaries are often in close proximity. In the
late 1960s and early 1970s, Israelis and Palestinians continuously
swapped accusations. In the 1980s, there were demonstrations when
Washington Carrasco, a former Chilean defense minister accused of
setting up torture centers, arrived in Geneva as his country's
delegate to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   At recent human-rights sessions, Iraq has been represented by
Saddam Hussein's half brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, who was head of
Iraq's intelligence services before he became the country's envoy
to the United Nations. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who
are seeking a separate homeland in Sri Lanka, and the Tupac Amaru,
the leftist rebels from Peru, regularly attend human-rights
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the IRA or Hamas or other such groups come here, who will
protect whom?'' Ms. Ghose asked.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Algeria's U.N. delegate formally complained that he had
been approached inside the U.N. building here by three men ``who
accosted me in a violent manner and uttered insults, abuse and
death threats.'' One of the men was identified as a member of a
nongovernmental organization.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation requests from nongovernmental organizations are
screened and approved by a U.N. panel, with 19 member countries
serving rotating terms, said Raymonde Martineau, head of the
panel's office in Geneva. Armed groups are barred, she said. To
keep matters even-handed, she noted, ``no country alone has the
right to veto an application.''
</P>
<P>
   Nongovernmental organizations insist that they have sole
responsibility for determining who is eligible for membership.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. _ As a crowd of Swedish tourists gathered around
Michael Johns, about a dozen 6- to 8-foot-long alligators lazed in
the corner of a sand pit. Basking in the afternoon sun, the
reptiles lay motionless, like giant fossils, many hatched from eggs
conceived in this small animal exhibition center.
</P>
<P>
   While a handler poked one of the alligators, grabbed its tail,
sat on its back and took hold of its jaws, Johns told his audience
how little energy the animals expend, how they tire easily, how
little pressure it really takes to keep their massive jaws clamped
shut. Afterward, the tourists were invited to sit on the reptile's
back for a picture.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was billed as a show on alligator wrestling,
but it was far removed from the riveting spectacle the term once
described.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get away from the notion of alligator
wrestling,'' said Johns, who caught his first alligator at age 7 on
a dare. ``We saw that, to remain popular, people didn't want to be
thrilled as much as they wanted to learn something.''
</P>
<P>
   From the southern Everglades to Orlando, the Florida alligator
is featured in amusement parks and zoos as a prime attraction. Yet
the reptiles no longer have the lure of the exotic that they once
commanded. Numbering about 1 million in the state, they have become
a commonplace sight in human settlements that increasingly dominate
the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestlers say that in an age of growing environmental awareness
and competition for tourists, they gear most shows toward educating
visitors about the habits and characteristics of the Florida
alligator, rather than staging a battle.
</P>
<P>
   So most shows are a far cry from the ones contrived in the
1920s, when white entrepreneurs, sensing a potential gold mine,
sought to attract tourists to the state by promoting two of
Florida's distinctive assets, Seminole Indians and alligators.
Soon, the trade flourished, as roadside shows featuring young
Seminoles wrestling alligators dotted major highways as well as
expanses of land that are now parts of downtown Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is estimated that only two dozen people still wrestle
alligators on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alligator wrestling is dying out, short of people who have a
true love for it,'' said Tim Williams, the director of public
relations and entertainment at Gatorland, an animal park in central
Florida. Williams has been wrestling and exhibiting alligators for
26 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Taylor, who began to wrestle alligators in the 1950s, is
one of the few who still put on the occasional show. In the old
days, he recalled, wrestlers often waged battles of strength and
will in water where the key to keeping one's body parts intact was
gaining control over the animal's unpredictable jaws.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential danger to humans, alligators are rarely
harmed from wrestling, and state officials say that the sport has
drawn relatively little fire from animal rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people are responsible and they know their animal, I
don't believe there's a problem'' with wrestling, said Lyanne
Lawhead, the executive director of American Alligator Cycle of
Protection, a nonprofit organization based in Dade City, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said that he opened the show standing in a pond where the
water reached up to his thighs, and beckoned an alligator to his
side by poking it with a pole, hoping that when the animal touches
his hand, its mouth will not be wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Securing the reptile's jaws with his hands, he said, he waits
for the alligator to wriggle violently and then tire out before
hauling it onto a sand pit. As Taylor taps its nose, a gesture that
irritates alligators beyond all measure, the reptile opens its
mouth. It is now the wrestler's choice whether to pop his head or
one of his hands in and out.
</P>
<P>
   In his 39 years as an alligator wrestler, Taylor, who now runs a
park in the Everglades, reckons that he has been bitten about a
hundred times. In his younger, more daring days, when he would
routinely slip his head into the animal's mouth, his face was
nearly crushed on two occasions by ``100 pounds of closing pressure
per square inch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at age 51 and with several hospitalizations behind him,
Taylor avows that alligator wrestling is a sport he has never
ceased to love. ``I always say that as a gator wrestler you have to
have high reflexes and a low IQ,'' he added. ``But every time I get
through a show, I know I've handled the alligator and gotten away
with it, so it's very rewarding for me.''
</P>
<P>
   And like Williams, who has been wrestling and exhibiting
alligators for 26 years, Taylor retains his fascination with an
animal that avoids humans, has a brain the size of a thumb, cannot
be trained, and, he cautions, should never be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Williams traces his own attraction to the sport to his boyhood.
Out on a hunting and fishing expedition in the swamps, he recalled,
he was struck by the mystery and exotic beauty of an ancient animal
that sits unrivaled atop the food chain of Florida's animal
kingdom, even though it rarely eats. ``It was such a big,
powerful-looking animal,'' Williams recalled thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to the crowd of Swedish tourists here at the heart of a
tiny Seminole reservation, the more mundane spectacle offered by
Johns seemed well worth the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Camilla Helman, 21, said that she was drawn to alligator shows
after she saw a television program featuring tourism attractions in
Florida. So when Johns invited his audience members to sit on the
reptile's back, she was the first to take advantage of the offer.
Laughing, she sat on the animal's scaly skin and posed as her
boyfriend took her picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very exciting,'' she said.

MISSING LAWYER'S CONVICTION STIRS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Colombia)  (lb) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When Michael Abbell, a former Justice Department
extradition chief, and William M. Moran, a criminal defense lawyer,
were charged with the crimes of the Colombian drug cartel they
represented, lawyers nationwide denounced the prosecution as a
government effort to intimidate the defense bar.
</P>
<P>
   In July, after a retrial, a jury found the two lawyers guilty of
crossing the line between criminal lawyer and ``lawyer criminal,''
in the words of a federal prosecutor, and convicted them on charges
of racketeering and money-laundering conspiracy, but not of
drug-trafficking conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   As defense lawyers weigh the repercussions of the case, however,
some lawyers are also grappling with a more immediate question:
Where is Moran? The 59-year-old defendant was last seen on July 17
in the federal courthouse, shortly after he learned that the jury
had reached a partial verdict, and he remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are wondering if he's OK,'' said Jack King, a spokesman
for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, in
Washington. ``It's cause for some concern as to Moran's state of
mind. You know what happened to Vince Foster,'' King said,
referring to the deputy White House counsel who committed suicide
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Moran, who once served as a Miami-Dade County state attorney,
and Abbell, 57, a former chief of the Justice Department's office
of international affairs and later a criminal defense lawyer in
Washington, were snared in a 1995 indictment that capped one of the
United States' largest drug investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The case drew nationwide attention not only because it targeted
the Cali drug cartel and 130 of its leaders and operatives, but
also because it accused six lawyers of collaborating in the cocaine
business through their representation of cartel members.
</P>
<P>
   Three lawyers pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering and
one to obstruction of justice and conspiring to import cocaine. And
on July 20, a jury convicted Moran and Abbell, a verdict that will
be appealed but that other defense lawyers say is already having an
intimidating effect in their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the criminal defense lawyers group said some
members were steering clear of representing the same client more
than once and of specialties like drug trafficking and organized
crime to avoid raising suspicion about legitimate work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is disturbing about this case is that the government used
against the lawyers the very acts that lawyers do in representing
clients every day _ visiting people in jail, preparing
affidavits,'' said Gerald Lefcourt of New York City, the group's
president. ``It puts us on notice that if you really want to be
safe, keep away from these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Ryan and William Pearson, assistant U.S. attorneys who
prosecuted the lawyers, said the case sent a message only to
lawyers who step out of their advocacy role to further the criminal
interests of their clients.
</P>
<P>
   They said the jury found that Moran and Abbell shielded cartel
bosses from extradition and that they obstructed justice by
soliciting phony affidavits to exonerate the cartel leaders and by
making payments to cartel operatives who had been arrested and to
their families, to ensure that they did not cooperate with
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that those charged worked for a cartel faction
that imported and distributed over 200,000 kilos of cocaine in the
1980s and '90s. More than 80 of the 130 indicted have been
convicted either here or in Colombia, the prosecutors said,
including the cartel leaders Miguel and Gilberto
Rodriguez-Orejuela, who are serving prison sentences in their
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their acts allowed cartel leaders to sit in Colombia and feel
more comfortable about what they were doing,'' Pearson said of the
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome could have been worse for Moran and Abbell. The jury
deadlocked on two drug-trafficking counts that carried a life
sentence. But the lawyers still face 20 years in prison for each of
the two convictions of racketeering and money-laundering
conspiracy, and Moran could get five more years for skipping his
$750,000 bail. Sentencing is scheduled for October.
</P>
<P>
   Moran seems to have buckled under the stress of two trials, the
first of which ended last October in an acquittal for both him and
Abbell on one racketeering charge, and a hung jury on the four
charges that the second jury considered.
</P>
<P>
   The day before he disappeared, Moran had been particularly
distressed when Judge William Hoeveler of the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of Florida dismissed a juror for refusing
to follow the law, said Moran's lawyer, Holly Skolnick. The juror
told fellow jurors that she found some of the laws she had to apply
``silly,'' and another juror reported her to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Moran and Abbell said the questioning of the jurors
was improper and would be a basis for an appeal. Ms. Skolnick said
that after that episode Moran lost hope for a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stress and the pressure just got to him,'' Ms. Skolnick
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moran already had a life of misfortune, Ms. Skolnick said. His
first wife committed suicide in 1967 with a gun he won at a card
game with court personnel when he was an assistant Dade County
state attorney, Ms. Skolnick said. The gun was court evidence kept
at the clerk's office, she said, and he resigned.
</P>
<P>
   He remarried, but his second wife died of cancer, leaving him
with two young children, Ms. Skolnick said. Shortly after his
second wife died, she added, Moran was arrested for drunken driving
and cocaine possession and entered a pretrial diversion program,
which he completed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, when Moran began representing drug traffickers as
Miami became the main point of entry for Colombian cocaine, his law
partner was shot and killed in front of their office. The office
was set on fire three years later by an arsonist suspected in a
series of fires in doctors' and lawyers' offices around Miami,
media accounts at the time said.
</P>
<P>
   Moran became a fugitive in July in the middle of divorce
proceedings with his third wife, Pamela Moran, to whom he was
married eight years ago. In court papers requesting a restraining
order against her husband last November, Mrs. Moran accused him of
leaving a message on her answering machine saying, ``I will kill
you,'' and of having someone follow her.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moran, who also accused her husband in the court papers of
having drug and alcohol problems, said that he had abused her
verbally since 1991 and that in 1996 he told her, ``I am so out of
control that I do not know what I am going to do to myself and to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the subdued Abbell, who let his lawyers defend
him, Moran took the witness stand and delivered a closing argument
in the first trial, and defended himself in the second with Ms.
Skolnick as co-counsel. Often explosive and disruptive, he made the
case intensely personal; at one point he addressed each juror by
name in pleading for an acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   The defense argued that the government was trying to prove its
case with testimony from other lawyers and former clients of the
defendants who had reason to lie to get reduced prison sentences
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing on July 30 to address the forfeiture issue, Ms.
Skolnick contended that 98 percent of the work that the government
asserted Moran did illegally was legitimate lawyering, like filing
motions or investigating cases for trial, that had to be
distinguished from criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of this case was defense lawyering, which was
aggressive lawyering that was not obstruction of justice,'' Ms.
Skolnick argued. Forfeiting all of the fees Moran got from the
cartel bosses, she told the judge, ``sends a very strong message
that this is an attack of defense lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Ray, an assistant U.S. attorney, contended that once
Moran became a member of a criminal conspiracy, as the jury had
found, none of the work was legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he crossed over that line, anything he did was in
furtherance of that conspiracy,'' Ray said.

GOVERNMENT PROGRESS ON FIXING YEAR 2000 PROBLEM IS QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal agencies are reporting progress in fixing
their computers to cope with the Year 2000 problem, but some of
them are exaggerating what they have done, according to independent
federal experts.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration's progress reports are
misleading because they describe as ``repaired'' some systems for
which crucial replacement parts have not been received,
Transportation Department auditors told a congressional
subcommittee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And auditors from the General Accounting Office said in June
that the Agriculture Department was reporting that 15 of its
systems were able to handle the problem ``even though these were
replacement systems that were still under development or were
planned to be developed.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO has previously complained that some federal agencies, in
addition to issuing misleading statements, have a poor grip on the
extent of their Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Willemssen , a computer expert at the accounting office,
said that if any agencies issued misleading statements, ``in the
long term it's going to be found out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department's inspector general spotted the
aviation agency's problem. John Meche, the department's deputy
assistant inspector general, said the FAA's score-keeping was ``not
consistent with guidance'' issued for federal agencies by the
Office of Management and Budget. Meche testified at a hearing of
the technology subcommittee of the House Science Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA is trying to solve the problem by replacing its computer
systems. But the agency acknowledges that it does not know if the
new systems are free from the problem, in which dates are stored as
a two-digit number and a computer may decide that the year after
1999 is 1900. Meche said four systems under development had to be
tested.
</P>
<P>
   If the FAA's computers are initially unable to deal with the
Year 2000 problem, the agency will probably have to reduce the
total number of planes it allows to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Willemssen of the GAO said he had been told by FAA employees
that the agency had recently agreed to pay an extra $23 million to
Raytheon Co. to make sure that one new system, scheduled to go into
service next March, would function properly after December. But
Dennis Degaetano, the agency's deputy associate administrator for
research and acquisitions, disputed that figure, saying the actual
amount was $2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for fixing the Year 2000 problem is obviously firm,
but it is hard to determine how much time it will take to make
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Degaetano said that the FAA was making rapid progress. In
February, he said, the agency was 17 months behind schedule, but in
the last six months it has accomplished 14 months' worth of work.
</P>
<P>
   Meche agreed that progress had been made. But he said that it
was ``way too early to start celebrating,'' and that the FAA should
begin testing its repairs immediately, to ``make a concerted effort
to give itself as much cushion as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials have acknowledged that they need more detailed
contingency plans in case they experience widespread computer
failures. But they have repeatedly expressed confidence that their
air traffic control computers and other systems will not break
down.

THOMAS STEEL, 48, LAWYER KNOWN FOR CIVIL RIGHTS CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Steel, a San Francisco lawyer who took on some of the
most widely followed cases in California involving the rights of
free speech, freedom of religion and the civil rights of
minorities, died at a San Francisco hospital July 18. He was 48.
</P>
<P>
   He died of complications from AIDS, a family member said.
</P>
<P>
   In Steel's most celebrated case, he won a $920,000 settlement
for Brian Willson, whose legs were severed by a train at the
Concord Naval Weapons Station near San Francisco in 1987 as he took
part in a protest against the United States role in Nicaragua.
Willson was struck by a train carrying munitions for the Nicaraguan
Contras, who were supported by the United States in their fight
against the leftist Nicaraguan government.
</P>
<P>
   Steel sued the federal government, arguing that the train crew
could easily have seen Willson and other demonstrators on or
alongside the three-mile spur of track to the munitions plant and
had sufficient time to stop the train.
</P>
<P>
   The train crew members filed a countersuit, contending that it
was Willson who had inflicted damage on them. They said they had
suffered emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe,'' Steel told the court, ``that their lawsuit is
particularly outrageous. What they are saying is that Brian got run
over intentionally to make them feel bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was ultimately settled, and with the money, Willson was
fitted with artificial limbs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first of Steel's cases to be followed widely was his
successful defense of Huey Newton, a leader of the Black Panthers,
on assault charges in Alameda County, Calif., in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   He also waged a 15-year legal battle against the FBI over
documents involving surveillance of the free-speech movement in
Berkeley in the 1960s, ultimately obtaining a court order in 1995
granting access to the documents for The San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Yuba City, Calif., Steel graduated from the
University of California at Berkeley in 1972 and the Hastings
College of Law in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his partner, Dr. Milton Estes; a son, Jacob,
of Mill Valley, Calif.; his parents, Margaret and Robert Steel, of
Yuba City, Calif.; four brothers, John and Michael of Oakland,
David of New York, and Paul, of Yuba City, and four sisters, Angela
M. Steel of Orinda, Calif., Susan Medland of Phoenix, Julie Ovian
of Madison, Conn, and Mary A. Steel of San Francisco.

GRIEVING FAMILIES FIND LIGHT SENTENCES FOR SCHOOL SHOOTERS HARD TO
ACCEPT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JONESBORO, Ark. _ Five months after his mother was shot to death
along with four girls in a schoolyard here, 3-year-old Zane Wright
still does not understand where she has gone. His father, Mitchell
Wright, will explain it to him when he is old enough, probably
sometime after his seventh birthday.
</P>
<P>
   By then, four years from now, one of the boys accused of
murdering Shannon Wright will be free, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He, Mitchell Johnson, was the one who shot her,'' said Wright,
his voice hot but controlled. Mitchell will turn 14 on Tuesday, the
day that he and Andrew Golden, 12, will be tried on murder charges
in the March 24 shootings that left 10 other people wounded at
Westside Middle School. Under state law, the boys must be tried as
juveniles and, even if found to be ``delinquent,'' they will be
released on their 18th birthdays unless they have committed crimes
while in detention.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is 3,'' said Wright, whose wife was an English teacher
at Westside. ``And by the time he's old enough to understand what
murder is, I have to turn to him and say that the boy who did this
is free. That scares me to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Both boys have been charged with murder, but their day in court,
and the punishment they could receive, is purely kid stuff, say
family members who lost someone that day. ``In a state like ours,''
Wright said, ``the value of a human being is based on the age of
the ones who murdered her.''
</P>
<P>
   Other people in this diverse college, manufacturing and farming
community of 50,000 have a similar sense of hopelessness going into
the adjudication hearing, the juvenile court equivalent of a trial.
There seems to be little drama over the outcome _ the boys were
caught, literally, with the smoking guns _ only a malaise as the
people hurt most by the killings prepare for a fresher pain as the
day of March 24 is replayed in court.
</P>
<P>
   And, when it is over, legal experts predict, there will not even
be a finding of guilt, at least in the traditional sense of a jury
trial. A judge, whose decisions are bound by the state law that
requires children under age 14 to be tried as juveniles and
sentenced to juvenile detention, can only judge the boys to be
``delinquent,'' and remand them to state custody, and then only
until they turn 18.
</P>
<P>
   That means Mitchell would serve four years, and Andrew, who was
11 at the time of the shootings, would serve less than seven.
</P>
<P>
   The two boys, dressed in camouflage, were arrested not far from
the school where, investigators say, they set off a fire alarm to
lure students and teachers into the schoolyard. Then, the
investigators say, the boys opened fire on their schoolmates with
hunting rifles.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged motive: They had said they were mad about being
teased, and one boy, Mitchell, reportedly was angry because he had
been rejected by a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Killed were Mrs. Wright, Britthney Varner, 11, Stephanie
Johnson, 12, Paige Ann Herring, 12, and Natalie Brooks, 11.
</P>
<P>
   Their deaths have prompted Arkansas to reconsider the age limit
at which children can be charged as adults, but any changes will
not affect the boys.
</P>
<P>
   Britthney's mother, Suzann Wilson, in a tearful appeal to the
Legislature recently, asked for changes in the state law. ``I'm not
advocating the death penalty for these boys,'' she told the
lawmakers. But, she said, a few years of confinement is not
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said he learned from investigators that Mitchell shot his
wife at least twice, in the chest and abdomen, as she shielded
terrified students with her body. Instead of running inside the
buildings, the police said, she stayed in the line of fire in an
effort to get the students away from the killing ground.
</P>
<P>
   How does he explain to his son the wrongness of it, the meanness
of it, he wonders, knowing that the boy who pulled the trigger
faces only a four-year sentence, less than other criminals can get
for snatching a purse, let alone a life?
</P>
<P>
   ``It eats you alive,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the dead children have tried to ready themselves
for what is expected to happen in a juvenile court setting that was
never intended to handle a case of such magnitude. Because the
judge imposed an order restricting the lawyers from talking about
the case, neither the boys' public defenders nor prosecutors can
say what they expect the hearing to be like. It is expected to
last, at most, for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here hope that the boys plead guilty, and shorten
the amount of pain the hearing will create. Yet no matter what the
outcome, the judge cannot hand down a sentence of a specific time.
He can only have the boys remanded to a state facility for juvenile
delinquents.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, the boys could be released before their 18th
birthdays, if they showed psychological improvements and if they
behaved themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You approach juvenile justice on the premise that
rehabilitation is still possible,'' said Joe Quinn, a spokesman for
the Arkansas Department of Human Resources, which oversees juvenile
detention.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether he thought the boys could get out early
for good behavior, he replied: ``I see that as zero possibility.
Zero.''
</P>
<P>
   For the murders of five people, the boys would live out their
time in a facility with a classroom, a library and computers,
probably in the Alexander Youth Services Center near Little Rock,
Ark. Ringed with barbed wire, it houses about 25 juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   On their 18th birthdays, the boys would leave. There are no
options, under state law, unless they commit a crime while inside
the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've accepted the fact that the law is the way that it is,''
said Regina Kaut, Britthney Varner's aunt. ``We know, logically and
intellectually, what's going to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   But, ``when we actually have to face that, I don't know how
we're going to deal with that,'' Ms. Kaut said. ``I don't think
about the boys a lot. And, I don't spend time being bitter or
wishing them ill will. It's not constructive and it's not in my
personality.'' She hopes it will be that way in court when she
looks into their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll always ask ourselves how two little boys could have done
this. And there's never going to be an answer,'' Ms. Kaut said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Jonesboro, people grit their teeth, not just at the pain the
boys are alleged to have caused, but at the way they have
reportedly behaved in the detention facility. The boys, being boys,
have asked for soft drinks and junk food instead of the meats and
vegetables that are served.
</P>
<P>
   They have complained to their jailers and parents that they are
being mistreated by not being allowed to play outside like the
other boys, although sheriff's department officials have explained
that that is only because there have been so many death threats.
</P>
<P>
   To people here, it is as if the boys insist on having things
that other boys have, and do not understand why they cannot have
them. That cheapens the lives of the people they killed, said
Wright, a sales representative who has found getting back to the
routine of life _ work, getting his son up in the mornings, among
other things _ still hard six months later.
</P>
<P>
   The state has one loophole, but it is a narrow one. Technically,
the boys could be held until age 21, under existing laws, if there
was a facility to hold them. The state does not have such a
facility, and the boys cannot, by law, be put in a prison for
adults. The state could build such a facility, Quinn said, and try
to keep the boys longer, ``but there would be some legal
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   That scenario is unlikely. The other, more likely one is almost
unbearable for the families of some of the victims. But there is no
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a messed-up world,'' Wright said.

3 WOUNDED EMBASSY WORKERS AIRLIFTED TO SOUTH AFRICA  
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ After a confusing scene at the
Nairobi airport Saturday morning, three wounded employees of the
U.S. Embassy in Kenya were flown to Pretoria on a South African
military airplane as other bombing victims awaited medical approval
to be transported.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival in Pretoria, the two men and a woman were rushed to
a military hospital. A member of the hospital's medical staff
reported that the woman, identified as Mary Robertson, suffered a
broken jaw and a broken bone in her left hand.
</P>
<P>
   One of the wounded men, wearing a bandage covering a four-inch
laceration on his head, was accompanied by his Swedish wife. ``The
blast was enormous,'' he said of the bombing, but declined to give
his name. ``I have no idea what happened to my colleagues. It was
terrible. There was absolute chaos. But I'm alive, and I'm very
grateful for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The South African air force jet had been equipped to carry up to
60 casualties. But as the injured were brought from local hospitals
to Nairobi airport, a doctor on board the South African airplane
said that American officials decided that only patients in stable
condition could be evacuated. It was unclear how many of the
wounded had made it to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dawie Roux described a mixture of chaos and order at
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation at Nairobi airport was calm and quiet, except
for the operations rooms where United States officials were trying
to sort out where the injured should go,'' Roux said. ``They were
still trying to sort out the injuries on the ground, and didn't
want to change their plans about where the injured should go.''
</P>
<P>
   A German airplane arrived in Nairobi shortly after the South
African jet, indicating that another airlift was expected, Roux
said. Bruce Wharton, press and information officer for the U.S.
Information Service, declined to identify the three embassy workers
brought to Pretoria pending notification of their families. Wharton
said two of the injured worked in the foreign commercial service,
and the third in the economics section.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the South African military hospital said the
three victims would be kept at the hospital for three days. ``They
have minor injuries, mostly lacerations from the blast, but the
major factor is shock,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pringle, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in
Pretoria, said that within an hour of the Nairobi blast his
consulate had spoken with the South African air force about the
need for clearance for relief aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy, which he said had ``well-oiled channels of
communication with the South African Defense Force,'' had hired a
private commercial airplane that was on its way to Nairobi when the
offer came from the South African air force.
</P>
<P>
   Pringle said cost was not discussed.

IRVIN IS AGAIN A TOPIC IN WAKE OF HORSEPLAY THAT GREW SERIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin shows up
at training camp in solid shape. This year was no different: he has
had an impressive camp and coach Chan Gailey has used Irvin split
wide, in the slot and even in the wingback position in some
formations.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin may be on his way to an outstanding season.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems it wouldn't be a Cowboys camp without some form of
controversy. Last year, it was Barry Switzer, then the head coach,
getting caught trying to bring a gun through an airport. This
season, it is an incident involving Irvin and the offensive lineman
Everett McIver.
</P>
<P>
   The facts that are not in dispute are these: A group of players
were getting haircuts in the players' dormitory on July 29 on the
campus of Midwestern State University, the team's training camp
site in Wichita Falls, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Irvin and McIver, who were in the room to get their hair
cut, started roughhousing. McIver ended up with a deep cut in his
neck, near the carotid artery, one of the four principal arteries
of the neck and head. The cut, caused by barber's shears, was so
severe that he missed last week's exhibition game against Seattle.
He missed most of this week's practices, returning to camp
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   What is in dispute are the details of how McIver was injured.
Those details could make all the difference in the world for
Irvin's immediate future and the coming season for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys maintain that the injury to McIver, a 6-foot-6-inch,
320-pound guard, was strictly the result of horseplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no fight or altercation whatsoever,'' said Brett
Daniels, a team spokesman. ``It was just an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels is regarded as one of the straight shooters in the
National Football League public-relations community, but there are
others who insist the incident was more than horseplay.
</P>
<P>
   One Cowboys player and three other people close to the situation
said that although they did not witness the incident, they were
told that Irvin and McIver were indeed at first teasing one
another, but that the teasing elevated to an all-out fight. And,
they said, McIver was injured as a result of that scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   The Midwestern State campus police have made preliminary
inquiries into the incident, said Police Chief H.G. Evans, but
since no complaint has been filed, there is nothing further his
department can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a complaint to move forward,'' Evans said.
``We're here if the person wants to file one. We don't solicit
complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have mostly been mum over what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin is currently on probation for pleading no contest to a
felony charge of cocaine possession stemming from a 1996 arrest. If
Irvin commits an act of assault, or almost any other crime, that
will constitute a violation of his probation. If that happened,
Irvin could face 2 to 20 years in prison, said Ron Goethals, the
director of the Dallas County community supervision and corrections
department.
</P>
<P>
   Goethals said his office is looking into the incident and has
spoken with the Midwestern State police officials, but there is
currently little either can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of right now we are not aware that Michael Irvin has
violated his probation,'' Goethals said, ``but that could change.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if the police do not investigate, it is possible that
Irvin will face repercussions from the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the cocaine charge in 1996, Irvin was suspended
for five games for violating the league's substance abuse policy.
Should the NFL decide to conduct its own inquiry of this incident
and it is found that Irvin violated the league's new violent crime
policy, he could face another suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The policy defines violent crimes as any crime involving the use
or threat of physical violence to a person or persons, the use of a
deadly weapon in the commission of a crime, possession or
distribution of a weapon in violation of state or federal law,
involvement in so-called hate crimes or crimes of domestic
violence, or crimes involving the destruction of property.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Irvin say he should be given the benefit of the
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have put the issue behind them and are back to
focusing on football.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the most optimistic the team has been in years.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have a new coach in Gailey, a rejuvenated Troy
Aikman at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Irvin, still one of the top _ but maybe the
most controversial _ receivers in the game.

NFL NOTEBOOK: JETS' ELLIOTT IS FIT TO PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the top physical specimen on the New York Jets right now
is offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott, who may be in the best shape of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott is coming off a knee injury from last season and is
extremely sharp.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to be toying with the Philadelphia Eagles' linemen in
Thursday night's preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who is about 295 pounds, said that he was getting so
toned that recently he had to start eating more than usual so as
not to get too light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get skinny,'' he said, joking.
</P>
<P>
   If Elliott keeps up his good play, he may be getting fat in
Hawaii at the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   A Ripple Effect
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from Carmen Policy's stepping down as general
manager of the San Francisco 49ers to join billionaire banker Al
Lerner in his bid to buy the Cleveland Browns continues.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Walsh, one of the builders of the 49er dynasty, said this
week that he has no plans of rejoining his former team on a
permanent basis, even if the owner Eddie DeBartolo asks him. Walsh
had discussions with DeBartolo months ago about becoming the
general manager temporarily, but Walsh is involved in trying to
bring an NFL team back to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it appears that if Lerner does get the Browns, one of his
first hires will be the talented Vinny Cerrato, director of player
personnel for the 49ers. Cerrato and Policy are close friends, and
while it is unclear what role Cerrato will have with the Browns, it
is clear that Policy will do whatever it takes to yank him from the
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Merry-Go-Round
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback position this past off season underwent a
drastic change as seven teams changed players. Buffalo went from
Todd Collins to Rob Johnson, Indianapolis traded Jim Harbaugh and
selected Peyton Manning with the first pick in the draft, and the
Jets cut Neil O'Donnell and gave the job to Glenn Foley.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego, Philadelphia, Baltimore and New Orleans all have new
starters.

THE U.S. WILL NOT BEND TO TERRORISTS, CLINTON VOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Saturday that terrorism
would not make the United States shrink from its role as world
leader, even though Americans are prime targets and the capture of
terrorists can take decades.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton also offered condolences to
the families of the 11 Americans who he said were known so far to
have died in the explosions Friday at two American embassies in
East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know nothing I can say will make sense of your loss,'' the
president said in a live broadcast from the White House.
``Americans are targets of terrorism in part because we have a
unique leadership responsibility in the world. We act to advance
peace and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that recalling American diplomats or withdrawing
American troops ``would give terrorism a victory it must not and
will not have.''
</P>
<P>
   The president went on to cite his administration's
anti-terrorism efforts, ranging from increased law-enforcement
resources to protection of computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``The most powerful weapon in our counterterrorism
arsenal is our determination to never give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke as rescue and recovery efforts continued in
Nairobi, Kenya, one of the bombing sites.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few minutes apart, the suspected vehicle bombings 400
miles from each other turned busy streets in two African capitals
into bloody piles of concrete and knots of steel. The second
bombing occurred in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reviewed the successes and difficulties encountered in
bringing terrorists to justice.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after a shooting incident outside the entrance of the
Central Intelligence Agency, he said, the gunman involved was
captured in Pakistan and convicted in a Virginia court of the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted how the United States had spent 16 years pursuing
a terrorist suspect in the bombing of a plane bound for Hawaii in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   Some terrorist acts against the United States remain unresolved,
the president acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   They include the 1996 bombing of an American military housing
complex in Saudi Arabia in which 19 American airmen were killed.
The FBI, which investigates terrorist acts against American
citizens abroad, has all but stopped its investigation of the case,
officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   In closing his address on Saturday, Clinton vowed to pursue all
terrorists, ``no matter how long it takes or where it takes us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the United States, the governments of Israel
and South Africa said they would also participate in the rescue
effort. The South African Air Force sent a Boeing 707 equipped to
carry as many as 60 victims to a military hospital in Pretoria, the
South African capital.
</P>
<P>
   Israel sent a search and rescue team to Kenya to help free
victims trapped in the rubble of the embassy building in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said Defense Secretary William Cohen had spoken on
Friday with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai of Israel about the
bombings in East Africa and other issues. Defense Department
officials said the conversation was routine and that Israel would
play no special role in investigating the attacks.

WAIVER WOES: CLAIMING A GUY YOU DON'T WANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the category of you better watch what you wish for because
you might get it, the San Diego Padres Saturday are the
questionably proud possessor of an expensive relief pitcher they
don't need.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Padres portray the Randy Myers move differently, the
prevailing view among general managers of other teams is that they
are a self-inflicted victim of a game known as waiver-claim
blocking.
</P>
<P>
   How do you play it? It's simple. All you need is a waiver wire
or a computer linked to Major League Baseball's transaction
computer. That equipment, of course, is not generally available,
which is why the game is left to the 30 general managers, many of
whom live and die by their waiver decisions.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of season when scrutiny of waivers is most
intense because trades can be made only if players clear waivers.
For many years, general managers did not make waiver claims as the
result of an unwritten gentlemen's agreement: don't claim my
players and I won't claim yours. But in the past few seasons,
claims have become rampant, particularly the blocking claim.
</P>
<P>
   When the general manager of a contending team sees the name of a
player on the waiver wire and suspects that another contender may
be trying to get him in a trade, he will put in a claim. Because
that player then does not clear waivers, a potential trade has been
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   One general manager said 40 to 50 players had been claimed in
the first week of the month. With pitching in such great demand,
teams have especially put in blocking claims for starting pitchers
in large numbers. Not every player for whom waivers are asked is
intended as trade bait, but suspicious contenders can't be certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to take a chance on having someone else get a
guy,'' one general manager said. ``They'd look like village idiots,
especially if the guy beat them in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   So, according to several general managers, claims have been made
on Al Leiter, Hideo Nomo and Bobby Jones of the Mets, Curt
Schilling of Philadelphia, Chuck Finley of California, Todd
Stottlemyre of Texas, Darryl Kile of Colorado, Tim Belcher of
Kansas City, Andy Benes of Arizona, Rick Helling of Texas and Mike
Hampton of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   All of these players were pulled back when they were claimed.
When the Padres claimed Myers, they did so to keep the Atlanta
Braves from getting him and using him as the closer they need. They
succeeded so well that they wound up getting Myers themselves,
adding him to a bullpen headed by the outstanding closer Trevor
Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   After they put in their claim, Blue Jays general manager Gord
Ash called Kevin Towers of the Padres and asked what he wanted to
do. The Blue Jays could have pulled Myers back and kept him, but
Ash couldn't wait to shed his contract, his shaky ninth-inning
pitching and his demeanor, which had not endeared him to teammates.
The teams wound up making a trade, with the Padres giving the Blue
Jays two minor leaguers (one to be named) who may never be heard
from. But the Blue Jays considered it a terrific deal.
</P>
<P>
   Two general managers, one in each league, called the development
``the block that backfired.''
</P>
<P>
   Said another, ``The one thing about that is you better be
careful what you're claiming, because you might wind up with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other general managers, they declined to be identified
because talking about waivers is frowned upon. Another general
manager addressed that very possibility. ``I said I'm not touching
this one,'' he said. ``I'm scared to death of it.''
</P>
<P>
   With $13,327,348 left on Myers' three-year contract, the general
manager did not want to be the one who would pay the left-hander
that hefty sum.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Towers nor Padres president Larry Lucchino returned
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   As for other players, general managers said two of the leading
claimers were the Mets, for the second successive season under
their general manager, Steve Phillips, and the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees claim so many players as a defense not just against
other teams but also against their owner, who would be livid if a
good player rode the waiver wire to another team. Other general
managers seem to be more understanding of Brian Cashman's claims
than those made by Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mets are at it again,'' said one front-office executive.
``They seem to be waiver-claim happy. Some year they're going to
get stuck with someone.''
</P>
<P>
   A Randy Myers perhaps? &QL;

BASEBALL NOTEBOOK: ANDY FOX AT HOME AS A NOMAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After one whole season and part of another with the New York
Yankees, Andy Fox was unable to break into their juggernaut last
spring, so they traded him to the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out of options,'' Fox said. ``They were going to have to
do something with me, either put me on waivers or something. I was
glad they were able to trade me and give me a chance to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has actually played somewheres else. He has started at first
(10 games), second (44) and third (17) base and in left (2) and
right (7) field for the expansion team. In the process, he has
become the team's leading hitter with a .295 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure a lot of people are surprised with my offense,'' said
Fox, who hit .196 for the Yankees in 1996, his full season. ``That
was a big question mark in New York. I came over here and made a
few adjustments and they seem to have paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   If he didn't start hitting when he was with the Yankees, Fox
began his career of versatility with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chance of getting to the big leagues was to be able to do
a number of different things,'' said the 27-year-old Fox, who spent
seven seasons in the minors before playing for the Yankees. ``It
kind of carried over here. It's been nice to get a chance to play
and establish yourself as a player who can play in the big leagues.
That's been the biggest thing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's versatility has been so impressive that manager Buck
Showalter is considering having him duplicate the feats of Cesar
Tovar and Bert Campaneris by playing him at all nine positions in
one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've talked about that,'' Showalter said. ``We're still
trying to win some games, but it would be kind of neat to do that
because not too many people have done it. I think I can do it. It
would be a nice challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Catching, Fox said, would represent the biggest challenge.
``I've worked out catching, but I've never caught in a game,'' he
said. Pitching? It would be trying to play catch with the catcher.
Hopefully they'd hit the ball right at somebody. I don't foresee me
putting up Maddux-type numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Best Deal He Could Do
</P>
<P>
   While Randy Johnson began paying for himself by drawing a record
regular-season crowd in Houston on Friday night, the Seattle
Mariners continued to endure criticism for trading the dominating
pitcher to the Astros for three minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that General Manager Woody Woodward would
have been able to make a far better deal two months ago had
ownership allowed him to trade Johnson then, but when he was
allowed to act, Woodward took what he felt was the best deal
available.
</P>
<P>
   After discussions about various players, Woodward asked the
Yankees and the Cleveland Indians for specific packages that
neither team was willing to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   From the Yankees: Hideki Irabu, one of their starting pitchers;
Mike Lowell, their top minor league third baseman, and another
minor leaguer of the caliber of outfielder Rickey Ledee or pitcher
Ryan Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   From the Indians: the starting pitcher Dave Burba, reliever Paul
Shuey, second baseman Enrique Wilson and outfielder Brian Giles.
</P>
<P>
   One executive said he hoped that the Indians would be willing to
make the trade, because then he would have gone to the Yankees to
try to extract a better deal from them. He knew the Yankees did not
want Johnson to go to the Indians. But that never developed.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees tried to change the names, as did the Indians, who
wanted to give the Mariners prospects for Johnson. In the end, the
Mariners liked the Astros' prospects more than the others. And
that's why Johnson was at the Astrodome Friday night, pitching a
five-hit shutout against Philadelphia in front of 52,071 frenzied
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Soon He'll Be Only in the 50s
</P>
<P>
   In the St. Louis Cardinals' nine games before Saturday, since
Mark McGwire hit his 45th home run, two of his teammates hit more
home runs than he did. Ray Lankford slugged three home runs and Ron
Gant two. McGwire hit none, batting 28 times without homering.
</P>
<P>
   What did the drought, his longest of the season, do to McGwire's
projection? When he hit his 45th, it was 69. Nine games later, it
was just under 64. He's almost a mere mortal.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The clusters of showers and thunderstorms that have plagued the
Middle West during the past few days will gradually shift east
Sunday and Monday. Weak high-level winds will favor slow-moving
thundershowers which can drop torrential rain in a few locations.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant clouds will prevail from the eastern part of the Great
Lakes and Ohio Valley to the central and southern Appalachians.
Broken areas of showers and thundershowers will develop as a jet
stream disturbance interacts with sultry air over the region. While
most areas will have less than a half inch of rain, locally heavy
amounts will occur near the central Appalachians and Carolina
coast, where a rich supply of moist air will be drawn from over the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to mostly sunny skies will prevail near the Northeast
coast as high pressure remains strong east of New England. Humidity
will increase over New England later Sunday as breezes from the
south develop.
</P>
<P>
   A weak front will promote broken clouds and a few thundershowers
from the western Great Lakes to the northern Missouri Valley.
Farther south, ample sunshine will boost temperatures into the 90s
and low 100s over most of the central and southern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the West will be very warm. Increasing high level winds
from southeast will draw moisture into the Southwestern states
resulting in scattered strong thunderstorms from the deserts of
southern California into Arizona and Utah. Elsewhere in the
Rockies, sunshine will be mixed with isolated afternoon
thunderstorms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Sunset &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just one week ago the sun dipped below the horizon at Barrow,
Alaska, for the first time in 83 days. Since then, the length of
daylight at the northernmost weather station in the United States
has shrunk by four hours. Daylight will continue to dwindle at
Barrow until, beginning on November 18, two months of total
darkness mark the depths of Arctic winter. Gradually, the deepening
chill in the north will act to increase the temperature contrast
between pole and equator. The storms that derive energy from these
contrasts will gradually strengthen enough to draw cold polar air
south for the winter. &QL;

FISHING HAMLET HAILS WHOEVER KILLED HUNDREDS OF PROTECTED BIRDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HENDERSON HARBOR, N.Y. _ When nearly 1,000 double-crested
cormorants were found shot dead on an island in eastern Lake
Ontario near here last week, federal wildlife officials labeled the
incident ``a brazen act of environmental terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   An animal rights group in California offered a $1,000 reward for
the capture of those responsible for what it called ``a brutal act
of animal cruelty.''
</P>
<P>
   But around this hamlet, where nearly everyone makes a living
indirectly or directly from sport fishing, the incident was likened
to the Boston Tea Party, and the as yet unidentified shooters were
hailed as heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only wish they'd killed every last one,'' said Ronald Ditch,
a longtime fishing guide. Ditch and many of his colleagues have
spent a decade pressing federal and state wildlife officials to
permit shooting of the rapidly multiplying fishing birds, which the
guides blamed for a sharp decline in stocks of smallmouth bass,
perch and other popular game fish.
</P>
<P>
   In the surrounding town of Henderson, where vacationing
fishermen help swell the population from 1,200 to 10,000 every
summer, anything that threatens the fish also threatens a way of
life, said Frank Ross, the Town Supervisor and a mechanic at a
local gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, about 70 guides were kept busy all summer
here taking fishermen from across the United States out into the
eastern basin of the lake, which was renowned as one of the best
bass-fishing spots in North America. Now there are about 20, marina
owners say.
</P>
<P>
   The cormorants were nearly extinct on the Great Lakes in the
1950s, depleted by the combined effects of shooting, DDT and
pollution. Although never protected by the Endangered Species Act,
they have been covered since 1972 by a federal law governing
migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
   But now their numbers have rebounded across North America, and
every spring and summer thousands settle in to nest on Little
Galloo Island, 10 miles west of Henderson Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   As the 52-acre island has grown to become the largest nursery
for cormorants in the United States, it has also become a focus for
the hatred of dozens of fishing guides and other business owners in
Jefferson County, who have seen a decline in revenue as fishermen
shift to waters with more fish and fewer birds.
</P>
<P>
   No conclusive link has been made between the return of the
cormorants and the decline of bass and other fish here.
Nevertheless, marina owners and fishing guides are losing patience
with federal officials, who prohibit shooting the birds unless a
clear economic loss is shown.
</P>
<P>
   The birds have so many enemies that the criminal investigation
this week was taking on the appearance of an Agatha Christie
mystery in which everyone is a suspect. Conservation officers were
faced with half a dozen communities in which almost everyone, from
fishing guides and gas station attendants to motel owners, had
motive, opportunity and _ given the popularity of duck and deer
hunting _ the necessary weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   The incident also had political overtones, since local residents
say they resent what they regard as the intrusion of unreasonable
regulations written far away and long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only oppress people for so long and they're going to
strike out,'' said David McCrea, a third-generation fishing guide,
as he left four anglers and their catch of 20 bass and four
walleyes at the Henchen Marina and Fishing Camp after a day on the
lake. ``If these birds did this in Washington or on some
politician's golf course, they'd be gone in a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state wildlife officials, traditionally focused on
saving endangered species, find themselves dealing increasingly
with problems created by species that have recovered so well from
past troubles that they have moved from rarities to nuisances. That
is the case with the double-crested cormorant.
</P>
<P>
   The mass shooting was by far the most brutal of several recent
incidents in which large numbers of birds protected under the
80-year-old Migratory Bird Treaty Act have been killed. That pact
was worked out among the United States, Canada, Mexico and several
other countries to protect hundreds of bird species that cross
international boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn on July 23, in Carrollton, Tex., city officials used
bulldozers in a pre-dawn raid on a large rookery for several kinds
of protected herons and egrets, killing hundreds of birds and
injuring many more. They were responding to complaints about the
squawking and odor from the colony.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same date, bulldozers clearing a road for a
development in Conway, Ark., plowed through woodlands containing
hundreds of egret nests, apparently killing many birds and sending
orphaned baby egrets wandering around nearby streets and back
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, protected birds have occasionally been shot
in anger or hunters have exceeded permitted limits for protected
waterfowl, federal and state wildlife officials said, but nothing
in recent decades has come close to the systematic slaughter of the
Little Galloo Island cormorants.
</P>
<P>
   The extreme nature of the incident most likely sprang from two
factors, local residents and wildlife officials said: the
exasperating nature of the cormorants, and the nature of the
community here.
</P>
<P>
   The birds are voracious predators, diving up to 60 feet to hunt
fish, from minnows to 12-inch bass. Each one can consume a pound or
more of fish a day. They brazenly dive under boats, swooping past
anglers' lures. ``They're an in-your-face kind of bird,'' explained
Russell McCullough, a state fisheries biologist.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like the birds, most of the little towns along the shore are
almost entirely focused on fish. ``We've got no Kodak, no Du
Pont,'' Ditch said. ``You're either a fisherman or a farmer if
you're going to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   For 14 years, he and other guides said, the cormorant population
has risen unchecked, until now tens of thousands of birds camp out
each spring and summer on Little Galloo. The birds and people were
bound to clash, everyone around here says.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions intensified with a recent unexplained crash of the
population of smallmouth bass, which was the main species fished
from Henderson Harbor for generations. Sampling by state biologists
over the last 22 years has revealed a precipitous drop.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the area say that some of the anger of the
fishing community is misplaced, that the fishing guides should
shift their business as the lake ecology shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything here is a kind of weird balancing act between
exotic species, native species, changes in the weather, changes in
tourism patterns,'' said Stephen Fort, senior planner for Jefferson
County. ``The charter captains and the whole industry just has to
adapt.''
</P>
<P>
   But that view was nowhere to be seen at the Henchen Marina,
where the docks were busy with the late afternoon rush of boats
returning from a day on the water.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Gamble oversaw the pumping of gas, the sale of ice and the
steady flow of fishermen sticking their catch on a board studded
with pegs to pose for cameras. Her grandfather had built the marina
60 years ago, and the family had seen many ebbs and surges in
fishing, but the drop in the bass these days _ and the related drop
in business _ was like nothing in memory, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the chest for bags of ice, white wooden placards
painted with the names of three dozen fishing guides sat in stacks,
but only a half dozen placards hung on hooks under a sign that read
``Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gamble said that just a few years ago, the numbers would
have been reversed, and that most guides would be out on the water
on a hot, sunny day like this one.
</P>
<P>
   If the cormorant population was kept in check, Mrs. Gamble said,
she doubted that people would hate the birds as they do. But when
fishermen have to pass through floating cordons of the birds
hundreds of yards long, their frustration is hard to contain, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature normally takes its course,'' Mrs. Gamble said. ``But
nature's out of balance right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieut. Christopher Hanley, who is leading the criminal
investigation for the state Department of Environmental
Conservation, said that no matter what the fishing communities
felt, there was no excuse for what took place on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' he said. ``These were
fledglings that could not fly away. This is a terrible crime.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The attack was discovered on July 29, when a team of state
wildlife biologists and technicians visited Little Galloo Island as
part of a study of the bird's eating habits. The study is intended
to determine, once and for all, whether the birds are responsible
for the changes in fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the same team returned to the island to resume the
work, which involves picking up regurgitated balls of fish bones,
then studying the material to determine the diet of the birds.
</P>
<P>
   But the biologist and two assistants also spent time picking up
more 12-gauge shotgun shells, which could be distinguished from old
shells left behind by duck hunters because the new brass still
gleamed in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   They crossed a barren landscape of roughly heaped nests, weeds
and dead birds. In the last 30 years, as the colony grew from a few
nesting pairs to more than 8,000 at its peak in 1996. The birds
have transformed the island from a grassy spot that once attracted
picnickers into a place of yard-high dunes of guano that feel like
a spongy mat under foot, a place where the few remaining trees
stand like bleached skeletons, whitened by years of bird droppings.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Edmonds and Laura Brown, the assistants, circled the
island as they had once a week since April. They reached the spot
where they realized that something terrible had happened a week
earlier. ``I found seven freshly killed birds,'' Ms. Brown said.
``Then seven led to 200, and 200 more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here is where we stopped collecting pellets and started
collecting evidence,'' Edmonds said.
</P>
<P>
   Just offshore, fleets of young cormorants bobbed in the chop.
The biologists said the shooting happened at the tail end of the
nesting season, so most of the birds escaped.
</P>
<P>
   But hundreds did not. The scientists passed spot after spot
where dozens of birds were shot en masse, with the desiccated
carcasses receding into the powdery soil, little more than black
smudges of feathers and bones.

COMMENTARY: HUGS FROM GERALDO 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I would like to be more like Catherine Deneuve.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to smoke cigarettes and murmur in a sexy French
accent about how crazy  &UR; zee &LR;  Americans are for persecuting
President Clinton. ``It's incredible that you cannot have a sort of
double life here without being scandalous,'' the actress told The
New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   The French have no problem with cheating. As long as it is done
elegantly and discreetly (words that will never be associated with
Clinton's dalliances). But then again, the French have no problem
with Mickey Rourke, either.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to be more like Matt Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, a Newsweek writer and moonlighting stand-up comic who
does an uncanny Clinton imitation, can spin whimsy out of smarmy.
</P>
<P>
   If the president decides to address the nation and offer an
apology about Monica, Cooper riffs that Clinton could use the
format of a '70s variety show, a la Sonny and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   The president could stride around a set festooned with big Pop
Art _ a confession booth, Freud's couch, a polygraph.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper jokes that the eager-to-please Clinton could spend the
next three and a half hours _ ``I'll see you again after your late
local news'' _ apologizing for anything and everything: ``Let's
start at the beginning. My name is Smirnoff and I'm a Soviet agent.
That trip to Oslo in '69? You were right to be suspicious. I was
meeting with my KGB masters. And, yes, I still owe Hot Springs High
a 55 cent library fine for `To Kill a Mockingbird.'''
</P>
<P>
   I would like to be more like Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Twain defended lying and rapped George Washington for setting
the bar too high for leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spoken lie is of no consequence,'' he wrote, adding: ``The
silent colossal national lie that is the support and confederate of
all the tyrannies and shams and inequalities and unfairnesses that
afflict the peoples _ that is the one to throw bricks and sermons
at.''
</P>
<P>
   Twain referred to the ``national lie'' of slavery. But he could
have been talking about Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I read about Robert McNamara, I feel better about Bill
Clinton. The president's lies are corrosive. But the former defense
secretary's lies were deadly.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara's second apologia about Vietnam, ``Argument Without
End: In Search of Answers to the Vietnam Tragedy,'' will be
published next spring. It is an account of his meetings with former
leaders of North Vietnam, exploring how America could have avoided
the war. His 1995 memoir, ``In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons
of Vietnam,'' was a best seller.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldn't there be a ``Son of Sam'' law preventing Robert
McNamara from profiting from books in which he finally grasps
truths that were obvious to many Americans three decades ago,
before all those names piled up on the Vietnam Wall?
</P>
<P>
   I would like to be more like Geraldo.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC correspondent wants to cuddle the dysfunctional
president. ``Mr. President, we love you,'' Geraldo said on ``Rivera
Live.'' ``I want to hug you. I want to hug you, please do the right
thing. This is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in the end, I can't really be like Geraldo or Deneuve or
Twain or anyone else. I just have to muddle through with my own
sober view that a lot has been lost here.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Clinton in the Rose Garden on Thursday with James
Brady, I was reminded of the good that a focused president can do.
Without Clinton in 1993, the Brady bill, curtailing the sale of
handguns and killer assault weapons, would not have passed.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton had not brought the Furies down on himself, through
his reckless, selfish behavior, if he had not betrayed family and
aides and allies with his vast carelessness, think of all he could
have accomplished in his second term. Surely, if he had been
operating at full throttle, he could have pushed through Sen. John
McCain's life-saving anti-tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The last years of the Clinton presidency will play like a
reverse version of ``It's a Wonderful Life'' _ a haunting vision of
all the ways Bill Clinton could have made a difference in people's
lives, but didn't.

AT 97, AN OFFICIAL STAYS INVOLVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALEX YANNIS   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He celebrated his 97th birthday on Aug. 6, but George Sands is
still a fixture at Metropolitan Golf Association events. Sands is
the oldest golf official in the United States _ and probably the
world. Sunday, he will attend the final of the Metropolitan Amateur
at Quaker Ridge in Scarsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   And he worked the Ike Championship last month at Wykagyl Country
Club, serving as an observer in the last group of the last round
and was involved in the presentations afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Sands' name and his enormous contribution to golf at the local
and national level are well-known in the area, but his name is
synonymous with the Ike.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat at Wykagyl's veranda overlooking the last green during
the two-day tournament, just about every player stopped by to shake
hands with him.
</P>
<P>
   Sands is an honorary chairman of the Ike, the stroke-play
championship of the metropolitan association. Sands and Dana Mosley
revived the tournament nearly two decades ago after its prominence
waned. The Ike was started in 1953 as a tribute to the country's
most well-known amateur golfer at the time, President Dwight D.
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Sands, fixing his blue eyes on faces, still greets everyone by
name, and he has a story to tell for just about everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he recalled in detail the 1941 club championship he
lost at the North Shore Country Club, where he has been a member
for 78 years.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's Ike, with his 88-year-old wife, Marjorie, at his
side, Sands rode a golf cart around the Wykagyl layout, observing
Michael Deo of Oak Hill and D.J. Lewin of Ardsley. The only
accommodation Sands has made to the strokes is to give up his pipe,
which was his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Sands could be called a trademark of the MGA. He rarely misses
an area golf tournament even though he and his wife, residents of
the East Side of Manhattan, cannot drive. Former MGA president John
Baldwin usually drives the couple to local events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being around the golf course,'' Sands said. ``The last
time I played was last year, but I love being around the course and
working for golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Sands has served on every committee of the MGA and was its
president in 1975. He has also served on several committees for the
U.S. Golf Association, but his pride and joy, along with the Ike,
is the Long Island Caddie Scholarship Fund, which he founded.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony last Tuesday night, he presented this year's 23
scholarship recipients with $1,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put more than 450 players through college, including
more than a dozen girls,'' Sands said about the fund. ``Our first
recipient is the president now. I get great deal of satisfaction
from the scholarship fund.'' &QL;

ABORTION DEBATED IN CHILE, WHERE IT'S ALWAYS A CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Nine years after Gen. Augusto Pinochet decreed
that abortion was a crime in Chile even when necessary to save the
mother's life, the Chilean Senate has taken up the issue for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of women's rights here say it is time for a change.
But in fact the bill before the Senate would only tighten
regulations by increasing prison sentences for anyone convicted of
conducting an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative opposition senators pushing the bill say they want
to crush the ``abortion industry,'' which experts say is
responsible for up to 160,000 clandestine abortions annually in
this country of 15 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But the conservatives concede that they hope to make abortion an
issue in next year's presidential election to embarrass Ricardo
Lagos, the Socialist who is leading in the polls and who has been
studiously ducking the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a moral question in which we have public opinion on
our side,'' said Sen. Hernan Larrain, the leading proponent of the
legislation who is also a close adviser to a conservative
presidential candidate. ``If we pass this in the Senate, we are
going to push this issue hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carlos Ominami, the leading opponent of the bill and an
adviser to Lagos, said: ``Abortion is a supercharged issue in Chile
and it is a very difficult one for any progressive politician.
Don't forget this is the only country in Latin America without a
law allowing divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of an interview, he said, ``I want to make myself
perfectly clear that I do not favor legalizing abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion is illegal everywhere in Latin America except Cuba,
although it is widely practiced among all social classes. Chilean
law was consistent with abortion laws around the region until the
Pinochet regime, with conservative church allies, put family issues
at the forefront of Chilean politics.
</P>
<P>
   Chileans are particularly polarized on political and social
issues, with about one-third expressing very liberal views and
another third expressing extremely conservative views. Each sector
is represented politically, with the governing Christian Democrats
leaning toward liberal economic policies but more conservative
social policies.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 Chileans, most of them poor women, are prosecuted each
year for having or carrying out abortions. Few spend more than a
few days in jail. Conservatives say that only by stiffening the
penalties can the practice be deterred.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good chance the Senate will approve the legislation,
perhaps as early as this week. The Christian Democrats, who govern
as part of a coalition, are divided on the issue. Passage in the
more liberal lower chamber of the Chilean Congress is considered
less likely, though still possible.
</P>
<P>
   About one in every three pregnancies ends in an abortion in
Chile, one of the highest rates in Latin America, according to
estimates gathered in the early 1990s by the Alan Guttmacher
Institute, a New York-based abortion rights group. As many as 100
Chilean women die every year from botched abortions, according to
local health experts.
</P>
<P>
   Four million abortions a year _ one out of every 11 in the world
_ take place in Latin America despite its being the most devoutly
Roman Catholic region in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion has always been illegal in Chile, but under a 1931 law
it was allowed in cases where a woman's life was in jeopardy. But
that law was repealed by decree in 1989 during the final months of
the Pinochet regime.
</P>
<P>
   Only El Salvador, Malta and Andorra have abortion laws as
restrictive as Chile's, abortion rights groups say.
</P>
<P>
   Under current Chilean law, a woman who has an abortion can be
sentenced to three to five years in prison. An abortionist who is
not a medical professional can be sentenced to 18 months to three
years, and a doctor, nurse or midwife can face three to five years.
But in most cases, judges have handed out suspended sentences or
allowed those convicted to serve time at night or to carry out some
kind of public service.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed law, abortionists who are not medical
professionals would face a minimum of five years in prison, and a
professional practitioner would face a minimum of 10 years. Judges
would have less leeway in reducing or suspending sentences. The
bill would not raise the sentences for women who have abortions,
but would encourage them to testify against practitioners in
exchange for lower sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates say poor women, who are by far the most
vulnerable to abortions carried out without proper medical care,
are already regularly interrogated in hospitals when they arrive in
emergency rooms with problems that appear to be abortion-related.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried,'' said Lidia Casas Becerra, a leading Chilean
advocate of abortion rights. ``The whole criminal justice system
would work against the poor if this bill passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Casas said that any well-to-do woman can safely have an
abortion in a private clinic or hospital for $1,000 to $2,500 _ a
price out of the range of most Chileans.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, poor women must turn to abortionists who lack
medical training, who may charge about $200 and who use wires or
primitive rubber probes.
</P>
<P>
   Any toughening of the law, she said, could raise prices
exorbitantly for all groups and make the whole process more
clandestine.
</P>
<P>
   The debate on the bill has received scant attention in the
Chilean press despite a march on the Senate on Aug. 4 by 60 women
who support abortion rights. Some jeered from the gallery at
senators who support a tougher law.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, some experts say, the lack of news
coverage is a reflection of the fact that Chileans are extremely
reluctant to discuss abortion at all.
</P>
<P>
   Ominami, the adviser to the Socialist presidential candidate,
knows how touchy the issue is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion,'' he said during a debate on the Senate floor last
month, pausing for effect. ``It's a strong word. It strikes a blow
to the ears. It's almost inevitable that from this subject only the
most acid discussions can surge.''

RABBI LEIBISH LEFKOWITZ, 78, LEADER IN SATMAR SECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rabbi Leibish Lefkowitz, an important figure in the
organization of Kiryas Joel, the politically powerful Satmar
Hasidic community in Orange County, N.Y., that has repeatedly gone
to court over the issue of public financing for its religiously
based schools, died Aug. 1 at Mount Sinai Medical Center in
Manhattan. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia following a stroke that he suffered
seven months ago, said Hertz Frankel, a spokesman for the Satmar
sect.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was never ordained, Lefkowitz was given the title
rabbi as a mark of respect, as is customary in the ultra-Orthodox
Satmar world for figures regarded as sources of wisdom and counsel.
According to his admirers, the rabbi was the epitome of leadership
in secular matters and the right hand of the movement's spiritual
leader, Joel Teitelbaum, the grand rabbi, who died in 1979, and his
successor, Rabbi Moses Teitelbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Lefkowitz was one of the handful of refugees who followed Rabbi
Joel Teitelbaum to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, after World War II to
rebuild their shattered sect, now the largest Hasidic group in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   As a natural leader and a man of means who had prospered through
his business, Crystal Clear Industries, a wholesale importer,
Lefkowitz was asked by the grand rabbi in the mid-1970s to seek out
land on which a village could be built for the Satmar, known for
their insularity and strictness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rabbi Lefkowitz and several other philanthropists went from
place to place, area to area, looking for a large tract not too far
from the city,'' Rabbi Frankel said. ``Finally, they decided on
Monroe because they thought there was room for expansion there and
bought the original 150 acres.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was needed. The original goal for the Monroe site in
Orange County was 200 families. Today, when it is commonplace for a
single family to have 10 or 12 children, the population is more
than 12,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was instrumental in making the deals and developing the
heart and mind of the project,'' Frankel said of Lefkowitz. ``He
contributed to the school, the synagogue, the ritual bath.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lefkowitz, who lived in Williamsburg and had a summer
home in Kiryas Joel, was the village's first mayor. He relinquished
the responsibility of that office, though not the title, several
years ago because of poor health. He was not a principal player in
the controversy that thrust the village he helped create into the
national consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Three successive times, the town fathers succeeded in persuading
the state Legislature and two governors, Mario Cuomo and George
Pataki, to enact laws creating a special Kiryas Joel public school
district to permit the schools to receive tax dollars for the
education of the community's severely handicapped children. Most
Kiryas Joel children attend local yeshivas, but the village has
sought money to educate disabled students whom it does not want to
place in public schools. Each time, the law was overturned in
court, most recently last month.
</P>
<P>
   Lefkowitz was born in 1920 in a Hungarian village, and after
being educated in a yeshiva, went to work for his father in the
lumber business. In 1943, he was imprisoned for six months in
Budapest for being Jewish but escaped and, with his wife, Dinah
Fischer, went to Palestine. He immigrated here in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   As he prospered in his business, he put much of his fortune _
and his energy as president of numerous organizations _ back into
his community. Among the projects he helped finance are the Satmar
Congregation Yetev Lev, which is now under construction and will
seat 10,000, as well as the United Talmudical Academy, the school
system for boys, and Beth Rachel, its counterpart for girls. The
systems have a statewide enrollment of 18,000 students. He was also
president of the World Council of Orthodox Jewish Communities, an
umbrella organization for Hasidic groups.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi's generosity was legendary. When parents found
themselves unable to pay tuition, they would be sent to appeal to
Lefkowitz, who would often pay the bills himself, Rabbi Frankel
recalled. In the case of one woman with eight children, not only
did he pay for their schooling but he also told the local grocer to
extend credit to her and to send the bills to him.
</P>
<P>
   Lefkowitz is survived by his wife of 57 years; a son, Abraham; a
daughter, Chana Green; a brother, Hershel, and a sister, Eva
Hillman, all of them of Brooklyn; and 16 grandchildren and 42
great-grandchildren.

COMMENTARY: AFTER TRUMP, RESTAURANT HAS A CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ Sabatini's specials of the day included
veal francese ($16) and spaghetti and meatballs ($10), both with
soup and salad. These are customer favorites, and in the dining
room, the little square tables draped in white linen cloths were
filling nicely with casino employees on break.
</P>
<P>
   A platoon of Sabatinis worked the posts. Mom and Pop _ Clare and
Vincent _ greeted guests and answered the phone. Stephen tended
bar. Michael, the chef, hunkered over the stove. Charles was on
call.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if Sabatini's, the little restaurant that beat a
powerful state agency's efforts to condemn it so that Trump Plaza
Hotel &AMP; Casino could expand its domain, was back where it was
before the fight started, five long years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Life has changed for the Sabatinis. Of course, in the three
weeks since they and their two neighbors _ The Golden Island pawn
shop and Vera Coking, the widow with a rooming house surrounded on
three sides by Trump Plaza parking _ won their very public court
battle with Donald Trump and the New Jersey Casino Reinvestment and
Development Authority, they've been basking in victory. Cards,
phone calls, television crews, not to mention new customers, have
been popping by.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sabatinis are not just heroic little guys who trumped
the master of ``The Art of the Deal.'' Now they're converts to a
cause: fighting eminent domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``What our case did is send a message to the entire country that
government cannot abuse its power to seize property,'' Mrs.
Sabatini said. ``I have heard from people all over the country who
want to fight eminent domain. I've heard from a woman in
Jacksonville, Fla., a person in Toms River, and another person in a
little town near Atlantic City. These people need our help and we
will not abandon them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to five years of cramming for court appearances, Mrs.
Sabatini said, she has become pretty adept at sniffing out the
legitimate cases of eminent domain, in which government takes
property for public purposes. When people call, she said, she helps
them sort out their options.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning,'' she said, ``what we were fighting is how
the government can take our property, our livelihood, to give it to
a private person. If somebody wanted to buy the property and
negotiate a price, that would be one thing. But we didn't have a
choice in the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   And those were five miserable years that the Sabatinis spent
fighting for their restaurant. When the Casino Authority condemned
the restaurant and the other two properties so that Trump Plaza
could expand its parking area, create a limousine staging area and
plant a few trees _ or perhaps do something else entirely _ the
Sabatinis and their neighbors were branded as greedy holdouts by
the Atlantic City mayor and other local figures.
</P>
<P>
   During the battle, Mrs. Sabatini had two heart attacks and Mr.
Sabatini's heart developed a pronounced irregular beat. Their legal
bills mounted. ``Well into the six figures,'' Mrs. Sabatini said.
``Maybe three or four hundred thousand. We don't even know.''
</P>
<P>
   They may not have to; the State Superior Court ruling dictated
that the Casino Authority and Trump organization pay the property
owners' legal bills. But the Sabatinis aren't celebrating until the
deadline to appeal passes in a couple of weeks, Mrs. Sabatini said.
An appeal is unlikely, but the Sabatinis are still worried.
</P>
<P>
   They wonder, with good reason, what would have happened if their
case hadn't received so much attention. Many other families and
businesses in Atlantic City have moved on, quietly but reluctantly,
for casino expansion. The Sabatinis were lucky to have Donald Trump
as an adversary and a little old lady on their side.
</P>
<P>
   When the Institute for Justice, a Washington-based conservation
legal organization, joined the case two years ago, it sent faxes
regularly to reporters, keeping the case in the news. Then, last
year, Garry Trudeau created a splash for the case with a week of
``Doonesbury'' strips lampooning the big bad Trump for trying to
steal Sabatini's away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garry Trudeau helped our message a lot,'' Mrs. Sabatini said.
``So did the Maury Povich show. I'm going to send them both
thank-you notes.''

PIECE BY PIECE, COLTS' OWNER BUILDS HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDERSON, Ind. _ Peyton Manning is wearing No. 18, the same
number his dad, Archie, wore when he was the New Orleans Saints'
quarterback. It is the first time in a long time that Manning has
dressed in that number.
</P>
<P>
   In his first couple of weeks at the Indianapolis Colts' training
camp, Manning saw Tennessee fans wearing his old orange and white
jersey, No. 16, and Colts fans wearing the new one: blue and white,
No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Old and new.
</P>
<P>
   Just where will Manning and the Colts draw the line between old
and new?
</P>
<P>
   Manning, who was the National Football League's No. 1 draft pick
last June, was preparing to make his NFL debut against the Seattle
Seahawks on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indianapolis is a town that really wants to be a winner,''
Manning said. ``We want to give them something to cheer about.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning is the new Colts cornerstone _ the present as much as
the future. His six-year, $48 million contract that features an
$11.5 million signing bonus is proof. Manning, 22, fresh from
college, is in transition.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts are in transition, too, but that is like saying a
pendulum swings. Of course the Colts are in transition.
</P>
<P>
   It has seemed that way since they made a circus-like midnight
move from Baltimore to Indianapolis in March 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts have had seven losing seasons since then, six of them
with 11 or more losses. They have never won more than nine games in
the regular season. They have had 16 starting quarterbacks. Eight
head coaches. Great drafts (Marshall Faulk, 1994). Painful drafts
(Jeff George, 1990).
</P>
<P>
   They won the American Football Conference East title in 1987,
but only four seasons later went 1-15. They produced a magical
season in 1995, coming within one game-ending pass play of making
the Super Bowl. Just 24 months later, they lost the first 10 games
of last season. That horrific yo-yo ride came to a 3-13 conclusion,
including a 41-38 victory over the Green Bay Packers, the Super
Bowl champions at the time, and a 41-0 knockout of the Miami
Dolphins, a playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   Scan the last 14 years and the view is full of such chilling
peaks and valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Who keeps knocking the Colts' horseshoe off the spike?
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rookie three years ago I almost went to the Super Bowl,''
tight end Ken Dilger said. ``Last year we were 3-13. I asked
myself, `How can a team get so bad so quickly?'''
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Coryatt knows. He has been a Colts linebacker for the
last seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had three head coaches,'' Coryatt said. ``I've had four
position coaches. I'm on my third or fourth defensive coordinator.
A lot of new faces. You can't win if you keep bringing in new faces
all of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Old and new. The Colts hope they have switched from old to new
in a few key positions for the last time for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with Jim Irsay, the owner, who took over the team
after the death of his father, Robert, in January 1997. Jim ran the
team last year, but this year his blueprint is fully in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have dreamed of total ownership, of what that involves,''
Irsay said, ``and now that it is here for me, I am going to build
continuity. This organization has not been able to sustain
greatness because of a lack of continuity. We want to take away the
falloff years. The revolving door with so many head coaches must
end. The foundation must be solid in owner, general manager, head
coach and quarterback. We have that.''
</P>
<P>
   To get it, Irsay brought in Bill Polian, the general manager,
from Carolina. Polian brought in Jim Mora as the head coach. Mora
had worked as a television analyst after resigning as coach of the
Saints a season earlier. And the three of them brought in Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Owner, general manager, head coach, quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts have a foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the youngest owner in the league, but I am one of the top
10 in experience,'' said Irsay, 39, who started as a ball boy for
the Colts at age 12 and worked as the team's general manager from
age 24 to 35. ``The legacy of what the NFL is about runs deep in my
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old Polian brings a history of success. He helped
build the Buffalo Bills into four-time AFC champions, then started
from scratch with the expansion Panthers and in two seasons got
them into the 1997 National Football Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   He knows what the Colts have lacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year this team had an offensive line that was untested
and the quarterbacks took a beating,'' Polian said. ``The special
teams missed kicks that could have won games and there were stupid
penalties. In four games they won the statistical battles but lost
in turnovers and lost the games.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Colts lacked discipline. Around the league, they
were viewed as soft.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Mora.
</P>
<P>
   Polian phoned him on a Thursday morning in late January and they
talked football for two hours. That Friday night, Polian called
back to offer the job and Mora accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Mora is intense. He grinds his players. Some say he is wound too
tightly. In New Orleans he compiled a 93-74 record that was built
on robust defense and lackluster offense. But when the Saints got
off to a 2-6 start in 1996, he held a profanity-laced news
conference and resigned a day later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not proud of the way it ended,'' Mora said of his tenure
in New Orleans. ``I'm not proud of quitting halfway through the
season. But I'd do it again. I had been there 10{ years. It was
probably too long. We struggled. It got to the point they were
better off and I was better off not being there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I have a second chance to coach.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 62, he doesn't intend to change his approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be demanding and never let up,'' he said. ``I
believe players want that. And the ones that don't, you don't want
them, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That is Jim Mora.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe that is what the Colts need.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, though, there are doubts. Mora's reputation is as a
heavy-handed defensive coach and many wonder whether he can groom
an offensive talent like Manning.
</P>
<P>
   So much lies in the hands of the Colts' offensive coordinator,
Tom Moore, who worked with Terry Bradshaw in Pittsburgh and more
recently with the Detroit Lions and Scott Mitchell and Barry
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Mora believes Moore is a solid coach. Of course, Mora thought he
had selected the right offensive coordinator in Carl Smith in New
Orleans and that did not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense in New Orleans did not take enough chances,'' said
Torrance Small, a receiver who played for the Saints under Mora and
now plays for the Colts. ``It was not aggressive. The offensive
players weren't as good as the defensive guys but they weren't as
bad as what they were restricted to do. This offense under Tom
Moore is going to be more open and spread the ball around. People
will like it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to bringing in players like Manning and Small, the
Colts are counting on their eighth-year center, Jay Leeuwenburg, to
solidify the offensive line and have looked for help there via the
draft, choosing Steve McKinney and Aaron Taylor, and the signing of
seven free agents, including guard Tom Myslinski.
</P>
<P>
   Mora acknowledged that defense is a priority, but he said: ``You
also have to have balance to win a Super Bowl. We'll get the most
out of Peyton.''

   Manning was a 9-year-old in New Orleans when Mora was named the
head coach of the Saints. Later, while in high school, Manning
would come to Saints practices and throw the ball to the Saints'
receivers, including Small.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what I see in this offense,'' Manning said. ``You take
your big shots, but all the while you concentrate on moving that
ball downfield at a pace that is steady. That way, you can't go
broke taking a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning's maturity and his attitude make Irsay smile. Irsay has
a new stadium lease in Indianapolis through 2014 and more than $35
million will be spent in the next year to upgrade the Colts'
stadium and office headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundation being laid here is causing tremors in this
city, in this state,'' Irsay said. ``But I want my footsteps to be
much louder than my words. I want us to live by what we do. I want
championships for Indianapolis. I want the Colts to be an original
mint. This is much more than a business. We are investing in and
creating a new horseshoe. It comes from the heart. And virtues from
the heart are always most important.''

GUILIANI SEEMS TO BE WINNING WAR AGAINST SEX SHOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAN BARRY and DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A funereal procession of police cars crawled along a
narrow street in lower Manhattan before stopping outside the
storefront in question. More than a dozen police officers and city
inspectors conferred on the sidewalk for a moment, then filed
inside to begin a process that may become commonplace in the city
of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani:
</P>
<P>
   The sex-club shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure that was followed Thursday night had a ritualistic
feel, one that recalled the shuttering of burlesque shows by Mayor
Fiorello LaGuardia in the early 1940s. Reporters and photographers
who had been tipped off were kept at a distance, but not far enough
to obstruct their view. Neighbors shouted their support. Then, with
a police videographer recording the moment, inspectors slapped a
bright orange sign onto the front door that announced the shutdown
of a Walker Street establishment with the wink-wink name of
Angel's.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three years of court challenges, New York City has
begun to enforce a zoning law specifically intended to curtail its
adult-entertainment industry. And although that enforcement has
generated a whole new round of court hearings that began last week,
the seemingly endless litigation has done nothing to slow the
city's resolve. Inspectors are dispatched every night into the
shadowy world of peep booths and lap dances, diligently seeking out
violations of the city zoning law.
</P>
<P>
   So far, seven live-entertainment clubs have been temporarily
shut down, while dozens of others are trying out ways to comply _
and still make a profit. Many more adult video and book stores,
such as the XXX Video Store on Reade Street in lower Manhattan,
have voluntarily locked their doors and hung out signs that say:
``Closed for Renovations to Meet City Ordinances _ Will Open
Soon.''
</P>
<P>
   But with those results have come questions. Is there enough
wiggle room in the language of the zoning law for some of the adult
clubs to bypass its intent? Will enforcement lead to the creation
of red-light districts along the fringes of struggling
neighborhoods around the city? And, ultimately, does it reflect a
triumph of Puritanism over free expression in a city that prides
itself on tolerance?
</P>
<P>
   A sign of the times, perhaps, is that Norman Siegel, the
ubiquitous director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, stands
virtually alone as an outspoken critic of the zoning law, which he
says was designed to stamp out legal activity that the mayor finds
personally offensive. He divines hope in the law's language.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some confusing areas in the law because it is not
that specific, intentionally so,'' Siegel said. ``And maybe some of
it will create problems for the judges, resulting in that the city
won't get what it wants.''
</P>
<P>
   But many others, including some critics of Giuliani, see the
zoning law as a triumph for his administration. ``It's a
significant legislative and legal victory for city hall and our
neighborhoods,'' said the city's public advocate, Mark Green.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   For decades, New York City grappled with how to strike a balance
between the rights of its adult-entertainment businesses and the
quality-of-life expectations of its communities. By the early
1990s, the issue had risen to the fore of the public debate:
depressed real-estate values had led to a proliferation of sex
shops in residential areas around the city and, especially, in
Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in September 1994, nine months into his first
administration, Giuliani proposed comprehensive zoning regulations
to prohibit adult video stores, X-rated theaters and topless bars
from operating within 500 feet of residences, houses of worship,
schools or one another. His proposal would essentially eliminate
the adult trade from Times Square, an area that was ripe for
redevelopment, and banish the businesses to the city's wastelands.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hurt the economy of the city,'' the mayor said then.
``They cost us jobs. They cost us money.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor chose his words carefully. The U.S. Supreme Court has
held that sexually explicit expressions are protected forms of free
speech, as long as they are not judged to be obscene. But the
courts have also allowed municipalities to use zoning laws to
restrict the adult trade as long as they demonstrate ``secondary
impacts'' that hurt the community, such as increases in crime and
declines in real-estate values.
</P>
<P>
   And the mayor felt confident that the city could demonstrate
those secondary impacts. The Department of City Planning had just
completed a survey that outlined anecdotal evidence of the harmful
impact of the adult trade on neighborhoods. The report also
explored the experiences of other cities _ including Boston,
Seattle and Los Angeles _ in restricting adult establishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the core of the problem,'' said Albert Fredericks, a
former assistant corporation counsel who helped draft the law. ``We
had to strike a balance between dealing with a serious problem
while observing the constitutional limitation and allowing some
access to this kind of entertainment material.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1995, the City Council overwhelmingly approved the
new zoning law. But before Giuliani could gloat about another
triumph in his quality-of-life campaign, a series of court
challenges were filed _ and eventually beaten back.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, enforcing the law in the streets of New York has
proven just as challenging as defending it in court. Inspectors now
find themselves mastering terminology such as ``completely and
opaquely concealed'' and ``discernibly turgid state.''
</P>
<P>
   The broad language of the law has also allowed for subjective
interpretation by adult businesses determined to survive. At
Billy's Topless , the dancers now wear bikini tops, as well as
bottoms that cover their buttocks; its owner argues that,
technically, he no longer is running an adult business. Other
establishments have concocted various methods _ using makeup,
latex, even Saran Wrap _ to create the illusion that the breasts of
performers are exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Causing the greatest confusion has been the law's use of the
phrase ``substantial portion'' in defining what makes a nightclub
or video store ``adult.'' Once the city acknowledged that
``substantial'' meant at least 40 percent of a store's inventory,
floor space _ or some combination of both, strip clubs and video
stores scrambled to comply.
</P>
<P>
   A wood-paneled courtroom with a drooping American flag in the
state Supreme Court building in lower Manhattan became the stage
last week for a protracted and frequently comic debate over
``substantial portion'' and other aspects of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently intimidated by the courtroom's formal setting,
officers called by the lawyer representing the city sometimes
hesitated to define exactly what they meant by ``spent condom'' and
``lap dance,'' in which a dancer gyrates on a patron's lap. When
words failed them, they would imitate the gestures of the
performers.
</P>
<P>
   At first it seemed that the city might have a hard time linking
the suggestive gestures of semiclad performers to an immediate
threat to public safety. ``There is constant touching and
contact,'' one of the city's lawyers explained, in arguing the
dangers of a lap dance. ``That is how diseases are contracted. This
person goes back to his family and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Stephen Crane seemed initially skeptical and jokingly told
the lawyer that if he had such a fear of disease he should avoid
riding the subway. But by week's end, the testimony of
solicitations inside the clubs and used condoms inside and outside
the clubs had persuaded the judge to permit the temporary shutdowns
of two establishments operated by a former dancer named Madeline
D'Anthony: Angel's and the Harmony Theater.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the move toward compliance continues. Last
week, Show World, the sex emporium that looms over Times Square,
ended a quarter-century of live adult performances; the
``peep-a-live'' performers have been let go, leaving only a few
adult-video booths as remnants of its stock in trade. Its manager,
Tom Simmons, said that Show World might become an arcade, or
perhaps a health club.

FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL STRUGGLES TO DEFEND WAR-CRIMES
SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark has made a
career out of representing unpopular defendants, but he faces an
unusual challenge this week at the trial of Jack Reimer, a retired
Brooklyn businessman who is accused of helping the Nazis to round
up and exterminate Jews and of lying about his background to gain
entry into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors, who are trying to revoke Reimer's
citizenship, are expected to call as witnesses several survivors of
Jewish ghettos in Poland that were liquidated by the Nazis,
including those in Warsaw, Lublin and Czestochowa. Another witness
is expected to testify about a mass execution of Jews in a pit near
Trawniki, Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government has said that none of the witnesses will
identify Reimer as being at the scene of the ghetto operations or
the mass killing, they are certain to offer powerful testimony that
Clark must try to counteract.
</P>
<P>
   He said Friday that their appearances as witnesses would be
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone profoundly feels the unbelievable tragedy,'' Clark
said. But he said that Reimer's future should not be affected by
evidence ``that doesn't identify or relate him to it in any direct
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he would treat the witnesses gently and with respect.
If they do not identify Reimer, he said, he may not ask them any
questions at all.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Reimer participated in the
persecution and massacre of Jews. Revoking his citizenship would be
the the first step to deportation. Reimer denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers declined to discuss the testimony of the
Holocaust survivors. In U.S. District Court in Manhattan last week,
the Justice Department's prosecutor, Edward Stutman, told Judge
Lawrence McKenna that their testimony would play an important role.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they will not identify Reimer,'' Stutman said, ``they
will testify to the activities of men who we shall show were under
Reimer's operational and tactical command.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the case, Clark has assumed the role of the underdog.
He and his 79-year-old client sit together at the defense table
without other lawyers or staff members. By contrast, Stutman has
been joined at his table by as many as six other prosecutors,
paralegals and staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 70, who was attorney general in the Johnson
administration, has said that he cannot afford to buy the daily
trial transcript or pay to fly to Europe to interview a particular
witness.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, he cited 59,000 pages of documents, many in
German and Russian, which the government had given him before
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't translate these documents,'' he told the judge. ``We
don't have money for a translator.''
</P>
<P>
   The government lawyers seem a bit frustrated by Clark's stance.
At one point Stutman told the judge that the government would even
pay for plane tickets if Clark needed to fly to Europe to interview
a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has also reported threats, while minimizing them.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, he told the judge that he had received a call
telling him about a threat on the Internet from a group calling
itself the Jewish Defense Organization. The group's Web site bore
the statement, ``Death to Nazi Scum,'' Clark said. It also listed
Clark's home address and phone number, and promised that there
would be a demonstration outside his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't bother me,'' he told the judge. ``I have been
going through that since 1961. But I thought the court ought to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   When the prosecutor, Stutman, offered to ask the marshals to
find an entrance to the courthouse that Clark and his client could
use without being exposed to the public, Clark sounded downright
insulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need any special way to get into the courthouse,'' he
said. ``We know how to get into the courthouse _ through the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the witnesses listed by the government is a journalist,
Jeffrey Goldberg, who wrote an article in New York magazine in 1994
that quoted Reimer as denying that he was at the mass execution of
50 to 60 Jews in a pit near Trawniki.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you will find this hard to believe _ I overslept,''
Reimer was quoted as saying in the article. He said he went to the
scene later, but by then, ``they were all dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is likely to use the quotation to argue that
Reimer was at the scene, and that he has given many conflicting
accounts to journalists and Justice Department lawyers and in legal
papers about his role in that massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, now a contributing writer for The New York Times
Magazine, said Friday that he had been subpoenaed and deposed. ``In
essence,'' he said, ``they were asking me if the quotes were
accurate, and I said they were accurate.'' (Because Goldberg is out
of the country on assignment, prosecutors are expected to introduce
an excerpt from his deposition.)
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg's appearance, however, seems to have spared a former
journalist from having to show up in court.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it looked as though Marvin Smilon, a former
reporter for The New York Post, was going to be asked to testify.
He had also interviewed Reimer and quoted him in The Post as saying
that he had overslept instead of going to the mass killing.
</P>
<P>
   But Smilon is now the spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office
in Manhattan, which is helping to prosecute Reimer, and the
prosecutors might prefer not to call one of their own to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for comment about that, Smilon said, ``No comment.''

 EDITORIAL: A CHALLENGE FOR JOHN McCAIN  
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editoroial for Sunday, Aug. 9:
</P>
<P>
   Among senators proud of their independence, no Republican stands
out more than John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Yet last week McCain sounded an uncertain trumpet as the battle
over campaign finance legislation shifted back to the Senate after
the House approved the Shays-Meehan bill to ban soft money. Instead
of rushing to assert his earlier leadership in favor of such
legislation, McCain waffled and raised doubts about how hard he
would push for Senate passage this year. His attitude is puzzling
and self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain wants to keep his reputation as a champion of clean
politics, he needs to drop the naysaying and direct the charge. If
he does, campaign reform can win.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts the dilemma facing McCain. His past battles over
the issue, as well as over tobacco legislation and pork-barrel
spending, have made him unpopular with some fellow Republicans, not
a welcome thing for someone with presidential aspirations. Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott is as determined to kill off reform as
he is to harvest vast sums of campaign money from special
interests. But McCain knows about persisting against long odds,
having spent five years in North Vietnam's prisoner-of-war camps.
With Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, he managed to get a majority in
the Senate to back campaign reform this year, only to be blocked by
a Republican filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   The path to victory lies in McCain's willingness to force the
issue when the Senate reconvenes in September. That means proposing
it as an amendment to bill after bill. Seven Republicans have
already joined with the Senate's 45 Democrats to support reform,
but it takes 60 votes to choke off the inevitable filibusters
engineered by Lott and his henchman, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
Last week, more than a quarter of the House Republicans broke with
House Speaker Newt Gingrich to vote yes. If that percentage of
Senate Republicans breaks with Trent Lott, those 60 votes will be
there.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, Christopher Bond of Missouri and Alfonse
D'Amato of New York are in tough re-election fights and cannot
afford to be seen as beholden to the corrupt status quo. Ben
Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado and Sam Brownback of Kansas
actually supported reform in the past. Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas
voted once to close off debate this year. John Warner, William Roth
and others have reputations for independence. Do they really want
to be seen as cowering before Lott now that so many House
Republicans had the grit to defy their backward leadership?
</P>
<P>
   McCain is concerned about overkill and losing his effectiveness.
But this is no time for senatorial delicacy. Unless he gets in
their face, Republican senators will do nothing. Rep. Christopher
Shays of Connecticut, once among Gingrich's most reliable backers,
angered his leadership so much that at times the speaker refused to
meet with him, but his tactics paid off.
</P>
<P>
   This is a piece of legislation that can transform American
politics by banning the unlimited campaign donations that were at
the center of the 1996 fund-raising scandals. It would also curb
fund-raising for attack ads by independent groups that have
provided a new conduit for special-interest contributions intended
to override the will of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Every senator knows that the public is disgusted by the way
money politics has distorted the electoral system. All the senators
need to do is put Americans' revulsion ahead of their own party's
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, this is a moment to add a heroic page to one of the
nation's most striking political biographies. Lott and others will
be trying to convince him that next year is the smart time to push
this legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But we believe that in his heart, McCain knows that now is the
right time.

EDITORIAL: THE OLYMPICS' DRUG PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Sunday, Aug. 9: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The drug scandals rocking the world of international sports have
confronted the Olympic movement with a much larger credibility
problem than its leaders seem to realize. Although the Olympic
Games no longer represent the ideal of amateurism, they still
embody ideals of fair play and honest competition. Yet drugs have
put even those simple values at risk. Why in the world would
anyone, much less hundreds of millions of people, choose to watch a
competition in which the race goes not to the swift but to the
chemically enhanced?
</P>
<P>
   This has been a drug-ridden summer in sports. The legendary Tour
de France nearly collapsed in embarrassment when five members of
the world's best cycling team, Festina, were suspended for using
performance-enhancing drugs. The International Amateur Athletic
Federation announced that two of America's top athletes, the
sprinter Dennis Mitchell and the 1996 Olympic shot-put champion
Randy Barnes, had tested positive for illegal substances, and
suspended both. Then, last Thursday, Michelle Smith de Bruin, the
Irish swimmer who captured hearts and three gold medals at the 1996
Summer Olympics, was charged with manipulating a drug test and
banned from further competition.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who cover sports say there is already so much cynicism
among the athletes themselves that anyone who sets a new world
record is immediately suspected of doping. So far that cynicism has
not spread to the public, but it will surely do so unless the
authorities move quickly to develop a more credible and
comprehensive system of testing and punishment. To be fair, the
International Olympic Committee does a far more effective job of
policing drug use than other athletic federations. But given its
responsibility for one of the world's premier sports events, it
must do even better.
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business is to change attitudes at the top.
Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC's president, has convened a board
meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Aug. 20 to prepare for a
doping ``summit'' next January. But Samaranch's own commitment to
the cause is suspect. He recently suggested to the Spanish daily El
Mundo that performance-enhancing drugs should be permitted unless
they pose a threat to the athletes that use them, a bizarre
statement that shocked many of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the IOC must be ready to spend serious money on the
problem. The IOC and others have agreed to put $2 million into new
research, but experts say more will be needed to develop tests as
sophisticated as the drugs they are meant to detect. During the
Tour de France scandal, experts noted that there were no reliable
tests to detect the substance at the heart of the scandal _ EPO, a
synthetic hormone that increases aerobic capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the IOC must bring other governing bodies into line. The
international federations that govern three Olympic sports _
cycling, volleyball and tennis _ do not even participate in the
IOC's testing program. It is also common knowledge that some
national Olympic committees are far more vigilant than others. Dick
Schultz, an American Olympic official, put the matter well in a
recent interview with The Times' Jere Longman: ``There is a morass
out there that needs to be reviewed to determine what is
performance-enhancing and what is not. I don't think there's any
question that the drug gurus who are trying to beat the system are
ahead of the police.''
</P>
<P>
   The next Olympic Games are two years away. That is not a lot of
time for Samaranch to get ahead of the gurus.

CONGO RECRUITS ITS YOUNG TO PUT DOWN REBELLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ With a week-old insurrection approaching
the capital, the government of Congo opened a recruitment drive
Saturday, aimed at enlisting thousands of youths into the country's
badly stretched armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to turn out volunteers, Congolese government
recruiters went from neighborhood to neighborhood urging youths
from ages 12 to 20 to respond to President Laurent Kabila's call to
defend the country against what he has characterized as an effort
by neighboring Rwanda to occupy the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   In the first day of the operation, witnesses said, more than
5,000 youths gathered in the city's Stadium of Martyrs to enlist in
the country's beleaguered army.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the recruitment drive got under way, security forces
reportedly stepped up efforts to round up Congolese of Rwandan
Tutsi descent, the so-called Banyamulenge. Many of them in the city
have gone into hiding since the beginning of the anti-government
rebellion, which is widely believed to be sponsored by Rwanda, in
the eastern regions of the country last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing the arbitrary arrests and mistreatment of the
Banyamulenge, the Archbishop of Kinshasa, Frederic Cardinal
Etsou-Nazabi-Bamungwabi, broadcast a statement on Roman Catholic
Church radio in the Congolese capital. He called upon the security
forces to stop entering churches and private homes in search of
Congolese of Rwandan Tutsi origins, and urged the government not to
``abandon the ideals of peace and love.''
</P>
<P>
   While the drive against Tutsi residents in Kinshasa accelerated,
Kabila met with fellow African heads of state in an emergency
regional summit meeting in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, in an effort
to end the crisis. Foreign diplomats fear that the situation could
lead to generalized fighting in Congo or a breakup of the country,
Africa's third largest.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-government rebels have consolidated their hold on much of
eastern Congo, and are pressing Kabila's forces in the west, where
they claim control of Moanda, the country's sole seaport, 300 miles
from Kinshasa. Under the circumstances, few diplomats said they
expected the talks in Zimbabwe to produce an effective cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Zimbabwean press agency said that after arriving at the
meeting Friday evening, Kabila initially refused to attend a dinner
with the heads of state of Rwanda and Uganda until he was
personally persuaded to take his place by the Zimbabwean leader,
Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila has accused both Rwanda and Uganda _ the sponsors of his
own rebellion, which ended 15 months ago with the seizure of
Kinshasa _ of instigating and supporting the current uprising
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries have denied any involvement in the Congo's latest
crisis, but both governments have spoken openly about their
disappointment with Kabila's rule. African diplomats say that their
most serious complaint against Kabila is that he has failed to
establish security in the eastern regions of his country, which
have long been used by Rwandan and Ugandan rebels to attack their
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Congo uprising began last week, just days after Kabila
ordered the expulsion of hundreds of Rwandan forces who had fought
on his behalf two years ago and were training a new Congolese army.
Diplomats say that Kabila suspected that the Rwandans were involved
in planning a coup against him.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering a string of catastrophic losses that recalled
his own rebellion against the former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko,
Kabila has enjoyed some military successes in the last two days,
which diplomats say could also harden his attitude in the Zimbabwe
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of intense, see-saw fighting, Kabila's
soldiers are said to have restored control over the strategic
northeastern city of Kisangani, which had come under heavy rebel
attack. Military analysts say that the loss of Kisangani would have
prevented the government from supplying any remaining troops it has
in the east and would have allowed the rebels to focus all of their
energies on attacking the western half of the country..
</P>
<P>
   ``Life appears to be returning to normal in Kisangani, and that
has got to make Kabila breathe a lot easier,'' a European diplomat
said. ``If that city had fallen, things would have begun to look
extremely grim.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, by attacking the seaport region in the far west, where
they have taken a strong foothold, the rebels have positioned
themselves to attack Kinshasa, or to deny it supplies of food and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will know in the next few days if the rebels are strong
enough to march toward the capital,'' the European diplomat said.
``If not, they may simply try to strangle the city by cutting off
its resupply.''

 SPORTS COLUMN: FINA's TESTING IS MARRED, TOO  
 (bl)  
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Jan. 10, Michelle Smith de Bruin, the 1996 three-time Olympic
gold-medal winner from Ireland, heard a knock at the front door of
her home in Rathcoole, a village just outside of Dublin. She opened
the door to discover an Irish couple, Al and Kay Guy, who politely
requested to get a beaker of, well, de Bruin's urine.
</P>
<P>
   They were drug-sample collectors employed by FINA, the
international governing body of swimming, and were making a random
urine test of de Bruin, as previously agreed upon by the organizing
committee and the 28-year-old swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   The test was to determine whether de Bruin had the presence of
any banned drugs in her body, the better to swim faster and
stronger _ and against the international rules.
</P>
<P>
   The couple were made to wait a half an hour at the door,
according to Phil Whitten, the editor in chief of Swimming World,
often called the newspaper of record for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   They were then allowed to enter the home, where upon Kay Guy and
de Bruin adjourned to the bathroom, where it was Guy's job to
observe de Bruin, who reportedly was wearing a bulky sweater, do
her little business for the sports organization.
</P>
<P>
   When completed, Guy then poured the contents of her beaker into
two vials, marked one A and one B, sealed them carefully with tape,
placed them in a Ziplock bag and then into a black leather pouch,
sealed this, and sent it off by express mail to a laboratory in
Barcelona, Spain, which handles such items for FINA. Vials A and B
were then separated. When Vial A was tested in January, it showed
that something strange was in this supposed urine sample of de
Bruin's, something with ``a very strong whisky odor,'' according to
FINA.
</P>
<P>
   Vial B was tested in May and showed the same odd quality.
Forthwith, it was determined that de Bruin's test samples contained
a degree of alcohol so large that it couldn't have been ingested by
a human without the person dropping dead from it.
</P>
<P>
   FINA decided, and not unreasonably, that something was fishy.
And what was piscatorial was de Bruin, who had been suspected of
drug taking to enhance performance in the past, although she was
tested with all the other athletes in the Atlanta Games after her
victories in the 200-meter and the 400-meter individual medleys and
the 400-meter freestyle and found to be, by the standards of the
tests, clean.
</P>
<P>
   Not now, though. Thursday, FINA banned de Bruin from competition
for four years, which would eliminate her from the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney, Australia, and in the world championships. This would
presumably eliminate her from any further Olympic competition since
she would be 34 years old by 2004, well past a swimmer's prime.
</P>
<P>
   And on what grounds did FINA base its punishment? On the
following, as issued in a news release:
</P>
<P>
   _ The urine sample was manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   _ The urine sample was not manipulated in the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   _ The urine sample was not manipulated in transport.
</P>
<P>
   _ The urine was not manipulated by the collectors of the sample.
</P>
<P>
   _ The urine sample was manipulated by the swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   _ The way of manipulation is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   This is a remarkable conclusion. What FINA is saying is that it
has no doubt that the sample was not manipulated in the lab, by the
postal workers or by the collectors themselves. How does FINA know
that? Have all of those in the chain of custody been questioned
thoroughly? FINA has given no information to back up its statement.
</P>
<P>
   But even more stunning is FINA's unequivocal assertion that she
did it, but the group doesn't know how.
</P>
<P>
   How doesn't FINA know? Wasn't its own collector on the scene at
the moment of urination and for the transfer of evidence from
beaker to vials? If the collector, whom swimming officials surely
questioned, does not know, how do the chiefs of FINA, sitting in
their offices in the International Olympic Committee headquarters
in Lausanne, Switzerland, know?
</P>
<P>
   There are assumptions, based on previously known cases of
manipulation. Some cheating female athletes have inserted a
catheter in their bladder with someone else's urine, or have filled
a condom or balloon with urine, placed it in their vagina, and then
broke it, usually by squeezing their legs together or bursting it
with a pin.
</P>
<P>
   Given the short time that de Bruin had to do something _ if in
fact she did do something _ then it was conceivably the latter that
was her deception of choice. And if she was going to, in a state of
possible panic, mask her unclean urine, she would grab whatever
liquid was quickly available, and whisky looks more like urine
than, say, milk or cocoa.
</P>
<P>
   De Bruin, who is appealing the decision, and her legal counsel
say that FINA is out to get her and to prove that the swimming
federation was right in its original assumptions about her.
</P>
<P>
   Whitten, of Swimming World, wonders if Kay Guy was not too
modest to closely watch de Bruin urinate, under the bulky sweater.
If so, FINA erred in not sending a more dogged or more seasoned
collector, for right now the best witness for de Bruin is Kay Guy,
who either saw nothing untoward or was uncertain of it.
</P>
<P>
   FINA, meanwhile, should do the following: sharpen its
drug-testing procedures, and stand de Bruin to a pint of Guinness
and allow her back in the pool.

SPORTS COLUMN: ROSE JR., FOREVER HIS FATHER'S SON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Okla.)   (bl)  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE FALLS, N.J. _ He came not to talk, only to hit. Pete Rose
Jr., famous son with a bulked-up body and a prefab burden, came to
New Jersey, the Northeast League, where the only at-bats were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll swallow my pride,'' Rose had said last week after yet
another baseball organization _ this time the Pittsburgh Pirates _
handed him his minor league walking papers, and he hustled off to
find any base he could call home.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of Rose's newest team, the independent New Jersey
Jackals, asked that reporters not harshly judge the silent man who
has had to tell his story in too many minor league towns, too many
places where the mere introduction of his name was an indictment of
his being there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been through a lot,'' manager Kash Beauchamp said Friday
night, before Rose cleared the bases with a second-inning triple
and sent Beauchamp's Jackals on their way to a 9-6 victory over the
Elmira Pioneers at Yogi Berra Stadium. It is a little field tucked
into the campus of Montclair State University, not far from two
major league ball parks. But, as Beauchamp and any New Jersey
commuter could tell Rose, the traffic between here and there is
often brutal. The trip could take forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have to tear the uniform off him,'' said Jackals coach
Hank Manning of Rose, a good friend made during his own tour of
Minor League America. The message being: other than 4,254 major
league hits, we should understand there is not much difference
between father and son.
</P>
<P>
   They are stubborn souls, with stocky builds, and familiar
bulldog faces. But by most accounts, baseball's career hit king,
who was banished nearly nine years ago for gambling, hardly knows
the man he and his ex-wife once called Petey. For having his
father's name, but not his attention, as he struggled to make it on
his own, sympathy for Pete Rose Jr. comes easily enough. But the
fact of the matter is that players with less celebrated names would
not have survived six years in Class A ball, often not hitting
their weight. The reality is that lineage was as much a factor in
Rose's career-defining moment as his surprising 25 home runs last
season in Class AA.
</P>
<P>
   If baseball ended tomorrow for the 28-year-old Rose, which it
most certainly will not, he would at least walk away with the
memory of having made his father come to Cincinnati's Cinergy Field
last September, to watch him hit in a major league game.
Beauchamp's own enduring retrospection, interestingly, is the
fateful night that he bowled over the catcher, a la Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp looks nothing like the thick-bodied Rose Jr., who now
packs more than 200 pounds into his 6-foot-1-inch frame.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old manager, tall and rangy, could still pass for
the major league center fielder he was supposed to become when he
was the first pick of baseball's winter draft _ two slots ahead of
Kirby Puckett _ by the Toronto Blue Jays 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Grove, Okla., a short drive from Commerce, in
Mickey Mantle country. His father, Jim Beauchamp, was a major
league ballplayer, a reputed tough out, even a onetime member of
the Cincinnati Reds, who gave his son a befitting name for the
financial scores that awaited his generation's players. Instead,
Kash became Crash, the ``Bull Durham'' film character, the minor
league lifer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was the best athlete to ever come out of my town,''
Beauchamp said in his office before writing Rose into his lineup
card, playing first base, batting third. ``It was a tough act to
follow. I was nowhere that good. I felt pressure, unbelievable
pressure. Just magnify it by 100 times, that's what he's going
through.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Rose, but there was more to his own story to
tell. Despite three surgeries on his left shoulder, Beauchamp was
hitting .330 at Class AAA Syracuse in 1986, when he tried one night
to score from second base. The catcher was Pat Dempsey, brother of
Rick, the former big leaguer. Beauchamp went the macho route, made
famous by Rose, straight through the catcher. Forearms were up. He
felt something in his shoulder snap. It was a bone, and his dream
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   His father would eventually tell him that Pat Gillick, the Blue
Jays' general manager, confided that Kash Beauchamp was, at that
time, no more than three days from being brought to the majors to
platoon with Lloyd Moseby in center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish my dad had never told me that,'' he said, his eyes
narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, the emotional wound was more noticeable than a
three-inch scar on the upper left side of his back. Beauchamp spent
13 years in the minors and never got so much as a sip from the cup
of coffee that his new first baseman drank in Cincinnati last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Under heavy local pressure, the Reds brought Pete Rose Jr. up on
Sept. 1, Labor Day, and put him at third base in a game against the
Kansas City Royals. Rose trotted out and, as he did every night,
scrawled his father's hit total _ 4,256 _ into the dirt. As he
always said he would, he used a bat his father had given him for
his first major league swings. He struck out, retired his father's
bat, and with a Barry Larkin model bounced a single off the first
baseman's glove in his second time up. Pete Rose stood and cheered
the son who had run on the field and hugged him when he broke Ty
Cobb's record in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   That day passed into Cincinnati lore, and Rose Jr. drifted out
of the town in which he grew up. He had 14 at-bats for the Reds,
fanned nine times, hit two singles and has said he was mystified,
even bitter, that he did not get more of a chance because just now
he believes he has learned how to hit.
</P>
<P>
   But he got a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would trade my 13 years for the time he had there,''
Beauchamp said, glancing at a photo on his desk of his father in a
Mets uniform, where Jim Beauchamp played, oddly enough, for Yogi
Berra. Instead, he is left to contemplate what Gillick told his
dad. He is left to think, ``If only I had known, I would have slid
into home.''

10TH ANNIVERSARY OF BURMA CRACKDOWN PASSES QUIETLY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ The 10th anniversary of a crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators passed quietly Saturday in Myanmar
without the violence many had feared, but also without any sign of
a resolution of the country's deepening problems.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats and a government official said there were no
demonstrations, after warnings from the government and a reported
call for calm by the opposition party, the National League for
Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove past some key points this morning, including the
university and the NLD office and I didn't see any additional riot
police or troops or any additional security measures anywhere,''
said a diplomat in the Burmese capital of Yangon, once known as
Rangoon.
</P>
<P>
   A statement faxed to The Associated Press said: ``There are no
demonstrations in Yangon or anywhere else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Though the anniversary passed quietly, there could be stepped-up
activity in the coming two weeks by the opposition, led by Daw Aung
San Suu Kyi. She has set Aug. 21 as the deadline for convening the
National Assembly, which was elected eight years ago in a vote that
was annulled by the military after her party won 80 percent of its
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the military rulers have systematically harassed and
imprisoned the elected opposition members and their supporters, and
have choked off any attempts at public protest.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing student unrest, authorities have closed the country's
universities for almost eight of the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Wiedemann, the top American diplomat in Myanmar, said the
opposition was ``clearly taking the initiative at this moment'' in
an effort to force some liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a principle involved: yes, they want to have the
election finally recognized,'' Wiedemann said of the Aug. 21
deadline. But practically speaking, he said, the immediate goal of
the opposition is to bring the country's leaders into talks.
</P>
<P>
   The military leaders have said repeatedly that they are only
caretakers and that they want to make a transition to democracy.
But their refusal to honor the results of the 1990 election has
raised questions about their intentions.
</P>
<P>
   And they have shown no sign of softening. ``As you can see,
looking at the events of the last week, the government, rather than
heeding the call for dialogue, is instead adopting a more
confrontational attitude,'' Wiedemann said.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to stepped-up harassment of the opposition party's
elected members of Parliament, the stifling of public protest and
the forced return of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi to her home on Wednesday
after she was halted attempting to visit party members outside
Yangon, and in a standoff spent six days in her car.

 EDITORIAL: SUMMER'S INFERNAL SUBWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is an allotment in Hades for time served, New Yorkers
should get credit for summer in the subway. As every rider knows,
the cars may be air-conditioned, but the stations are not. Standing
on the platforms, trying to read an increasingly damp newspaper, we
deal with temperatures that slowly shrink-wrap even the lightest
summer suits around our steaming bodies.
</P>
<P>
   As the temperatures above ground loitered in the high 80s one
recent afternoon rush hour, I took a thermometer into Grand
Central's subway stop. The idea was to register the legendary heat
coming from the old Lexington line. Each step down to the trains
brought a rise in the temperature _ 90 degrees, 94, 95. With an
express and a local both idling at the platform, their doors open
and their blowers sending out cool air, the temperature hovered at
100.5. As the doors closed and the two trains left at once, the
platform began to simmer and the reading soared to 102.9. A few
feet away stood a rush-hour traffic monitor for the station. He was
wearing an official orange vest over a wet shirt. When he saw the
thermometer, he looked away. ``How do you stand this?'' I asked.
``I try not to think about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has tried to calculate
the sources of this seasonal discomfort. It found that brakes
produced 60 percent of the heat, air-conditioning provided 20
percent and acceleration 13 percent _ a total of 93 percent of the
heat from the trains. Humans and electrical equipment (they are
lumped into one category by the MTA for the purposes of assessing
heat, it seems) added only 7 percent to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA promises cooler summers in the subways of the future.
Planned changes include larger, stronger fans and new trains that
no longer breathe so much heat onto the platform as the cars squeal
to a stop. As Grand Central is revamped, explains Lawrence Reuter,
the president of New York City Transit, the 42nd Street subway stop
will become ``air tempered.'' This is a way of saying that it is
not air-conditioned, but it will be cooler. At my own hub station,
Union Square, residents have complained for years about the swamp
that serves as a waiting area for the Lexington line. The fans are
coming, transit officials promise.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to figure out how to make the wait for public
transportation more comfortable. The technology is difficult. The
system is old. One suggestion: Wait for a hot summer day, then
issue a last-minute invitation to Gov. George Pataki and Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani to shed their chauffeured caravans and ride around
the city like the rest of us.

 SPORTS COLUMN: HEY, McGWIRE! BEWARE THE CURSE OF THE BABE  
 (bl)  
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Mark McGwire has any class, sense of geopolitics and love for
baseball, he will begin hitting only for average this week instead
of for distance. Line-drive singles to the opposite field, Texas
leaguers, grass cutters in the hole, bunts. He will proclaim, with
his bat, that salvation, enlightenment, the good of the game can
only be achieved with craft and sacrifice, never with the big bang.
</P>
<P>
   He will end the season with no more than 60 home runs, just
enough to declare himself the statistical equal of Babe Ruth, which
is the best he can hope for. As a personality, a symbol of his
times, a salesman for America and its pastime, he is not even in
the same ball park as the Bambino. He is a nice guy from suburban
Los Angeles, a dentist's son. But he doesn't even have a nickname.
</P>
<P>
   There are some very good reasons for him to take my advice, not
even including the lesson of Cal Ripken, who didn't. Poor Cal, milk
on his upper lip, egg on his face. Where is he these days? He is
still going to work and doing a progressively poorer job by the
day. Is anyone carrying a Cal Ripken lunch bucket, wearing Cool Cal
Hot Corner Boots?
</P>
<P>
   The first reason for McGwire to quit while he is ahead is to
avoid the true Curse of the Bambino, which Red Sox fans, in their
eternal vanity, think is a plague on them. The Red Sox would have
come up short even with Ruth in the lineup; that's Boston. The true
curse falls on those who surpass Ruth's record.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris, an excellent ballplayer and an all-round decent
guy, was the first to confuse monotheism for meritocracy. If he hit
61 homers, one more than Ruth, he thought, shouldn't he be
acclaimed? Poor Roger. Just being better isn't enough. Baseball
fans, besotted with Mickey Mantle in those days, had proclaimed him
the new Ruth, not Maris. So Roger was booed and his record was
devalued.
</P>
<P>
   We were then told that Ruth's real accomplishment was his career
record of 714. Thirteen years after Maris' record, when Henry Aaron
hit his 715th home run, he was the target for racial slurs and
death threats. And we were told that the one true record was Joe
DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason for McGwire to lower the boom rate is to
strike a blow for a return to the way the game should be played,
with guile and daring, speed and savvy, instead of the lucky big
bang. We have seen, in our time, the slam dunk, the slap shot and
the home run become, instead of a desperate measure, a routine
tactic.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain democracy to the homer _ an underdog comes
from behind with a dramatic gesture _ but it is also the equivalent
of quitting work to play the lottery after a lifetime of losing.
Soccer has yet to develop that lucky hit, although purists shudder
at the increase in booming passes from a deep defender to a
penetrating forward.
</P>
<P>
   The third reason transcends the arena. Since real life is merely
a reflection of sports, the ascendancy of the home run has had
enormous ramifications, including, among other, the development of
The Bomb and the initial stock offering; the popularity of
Native-American casinos, and the relentless search for the
all-cancer magic bullet instead of the management of individual
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   How could McGwire not want to stop pulling the ball?
</P>
<P>
   The last time I made this kind of suggestion was three years ago
when I called on Cal Ripken to take a day off so as not to break
Lou Gehrig's record of 2,130 consecutive games. I still think the
suggestion was written tongue in cheek, but the outraged reaction
convinced me for a while that I had been serious. After all, what
honor could there be in erasing the record of a man who stopped
playing merely because he had a terminal disease?
</P>
<P>
   As you may recall, Ripken ignored my advice and broke the
record, helping to revive the memory of Gehrig as more than the
name of a terrible wasting disease. Right-wing commentators, like
the part-Oriole owner George F. Will, quivered at Cal's role-model
work ethic but had little to say about the greedy corporate layoffs
and mergers that made that work ethic so remarkably difficult an
example to emulate. If Cal tried to pull a stunt like that in the
real world, he would be fired before his pension was vested.
</P>
<P>
   So Big Mac (you like that?) or Mighty Marky (animated
character?) hits 62 or 72. So what. The wise guys on the Web will
say that pitchers were grooving it for him, under orders from the
new commissioner to jack up the game. McGwire will only be beating
Maris, who has been devalued, not the Babe, who will have yet
another commercial rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   Does McGwire have the vision and humanity to check his swing and
try to save a piece of the world? As a gesture, it would be a real
home run.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Stern, the commissioner of the National
Basketball Association, appeared at the bargaining session between
the league and the players union last Thursday with something new:
a beard in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, during a telephone conference call, Stern was asked
about the beard. Did it have some significance, perhaps relating to
the negotiations?
</P>
<P>
   ``The betting,'' he responded, ``is whether I should shave
before we make a deal. But frankly I only want it to be a
summertime thing, and it might have to go to winter if that was the
case and I don't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The question and answer were the last in a series of questions
and answers that went on for about 30 minutes. The NBA later posted
a transcript of the conference call on its Internet site (NBA.com).
But the question about the beard and Stern's answer were omitted.
The transcript was also accompanied by Stern's picture. It was
obviously an outdated photo: it showed a clean-shaven commissioner.

ANALYSIS: BIG CHANGES AT GM  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. _ After three decades of decline, General
Motors remains the world's largest company, and its sheer size and
the enormous scope of its problems have prompted a succession of
executives to seek sweeping solutions costing billions of dollars _
usually with little success.
</P>
<P>
   The latest effort came last week, just after GM suffered a
crippling, nearly eight-week strike, as the company's leaders
dribbled out a succession of announcements. On Monday, the company
said that it would turn its auto parts subsidiary into a separate
company next year. On Tuesday, GM announced that it would combine
the marketing staffs of its Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Oldsmobile
and Pontiac-GMC divisions, with only Saturn remaining independent.
And on Wednesday, John Smith Jr., GM's chairman and chief
executive, said that the automaker would build a new generation of
assembly plants in the United States that would use fewer workers
than current factories do, to bolt together large chunks of
vehicles built by outside suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The three initiatives, all of which were expected at some point
but not all together last week, are significant because they would
change the way GM has done business since the 1920s. It would
become a company that designed, assembled and marketed cars and
light trucks but made few of the parts. In place of the ruthless
competition among divisions that led the company to dominance of
the domestic auto industry in the '50s and '60s, marketing managers
would be expected to cooperate and avoid duplication of effort.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than setting a new example, all three moves would
make GM a little more like the rest of the industry. The outcome of
all three strategies _and the futures of GM's 600,000 workers
around the world _ will depend on whether the company can carry out
these strategies better than its rivals. And GM has a deserved
reputation for poor implementation of grand strategies: Mediocre
middle managers and poisonous labor relations have repeatedly
scuttled the visions of leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for new assembly plants, at a cost likely to exceed
$500 million apiece, is typical of GM's approach of throwing money
at productivity problems that partly reflect management problems.
In a speech here on Wednesday at the University of Michigan's
annual auto industry conference, Smith said the factories were
needed to make use of the latest trend in auto manufacturing, which
is to rely more on suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The latest conventional wisdom, pioneered partly by GM's highly
efficient Brazilian subsidiary, says that productivity improves
when suppliers assemble large sections of cars, like dashboards,
instead of shipping crates of speedometers, radios and other parts
to be bolted together on the factory floor. GM's older factories
look like squares when viewed from above, while its new factories
will look like plus signs, so as to allow more exterior wall space
for loading docks where suppliers can deliver sections of vehicles
directly to the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Other automakers are also relying more heavily on suppliers. But
even after GM's announcement, few of them are convinced that they
need to build new assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   A report last month by Harbour &AMP; Associates, an auto
productivity consulting company, said that Ford Motor Co. had four
of the 10 most efficient car assembly plants in North America and
eight of the 10 most efficient light truck assembly plants. But
Robert Transou, the Ford group vice president who has turned around
the company's manufacturing operations, said that he planned to
rely more on suppliers without building assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get 99 percent of the benefits without building new
plants,'' he said in an interview here on Friday. The secret to
Ford's productivity, he said, lies in constantly pursuing lots of
little efficiency improvements in each factory, and in close
cooperation between workers and management. Ford has not had a
strike since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   GM's Brazilian subsidiary relies on suppliers, but it also has
an enthusiastic work force and imaginative middle managers. By
contrast, the ranks of GM's factory managers in the United States
have changed surprisingly little in recent years and have often
shown resistance to change. GM also has the worst labor-relations
record in the auto industry, including 22 strikes since 1990. In a
possible case of industrial sabotage, a GM assembly line in
Kentucky had to be shut down in late July when a pipe was
mysteriously jammed into a conveyor belt.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said GM wanted to improve its labor relations, and so had
chosen to settle the recent strike instead of pursuing legal
battles with the union. ``What good would it do,'' he asked, ``to
win and have a disgruntled work force that wouldn't have their
heart and soul in getting us back'' to full production?
</P>
<P>
   In addition to good relations with workers, the company will
need warm relations with suppliers once it builds the new factories
and spins off its auto parts subsidiary. Ford and Chrysler already
have good relations with suppliers, because they sold many of their
auto parts factories during their close brushes with financial
disaster in the late '70s and early '80s. Suppliers share their
latest ideas for reducing costs or improving parts designs with
Ford and Chrysler, confident that the automakers will share the
resulting savings with them.
</P>
<P>
   GM's relationships with suppliers are only now recovering from
the damage done in the early '90s when Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, a purchasing executive, renegotiated GM's contracts with
many suppliers and demanded that the company keep the savings
brought about by suppliers' innovations.
</P>
<P>
   The company's decision to consolidate most of its marketing
staffs, while leaving Saturn independent, will make it more like
Ford, which has an immense Ford marketing division for most of its
models and a small Lincoln-Mercury division on the side. But even
in marketing, GM will face an extra challenge, as it tries to
eliminate decades of rivalries within its divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The company's biggest problem is that every time it seems to be
catching up with the rest of the industry, other automakers make
further progress themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure everything they're trying to do is in the right
direction,'' said Chris Theodore, a Chrysler vice president for
engineering. ``They've made immense progress; it's just that the
world is moving.''

A WHOLE NEW LOOK FOR THE GIANTS' TOOMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the New York Giants' season ended last year, the team's
coaches gathered to evaluate the roster. In those meetings, it was
agreed that Amani Toomer, the wide receiver the Giants had drafted
with great promise just two years ago, might not be in the team's
plans much longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were going to draft two wide receivers. There was a
good chance Toomer would be cut in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fair to say,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said last week,
recalling the team's off-season evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   As the coaches were meeting in January, preparing their
unflattering reports of him, Toomer was at home. He remembers
watching the Denver Broncos play the Kansas City Chiefs in a
playoff game on television on Sunday, Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what it was about that day, but I sat there and
said to myself, `This isn't working out,''' Toomer said between
practices at the Giants' training camp in Albany, N.Y., on
Thursday. ``I'm hardly playing, they're not happy with me, and I'm
not happy. What was right or wrong didn't matter. I had to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants opened their preseason Saturday night, taking on the
visiting Cincinnati Bengals, and the same coaches who felt they
could probably do without Toomer are now calling him the team's
most improved player. Day after day this summer, a coach or a
teammate has referred to Toomer as ``a changed man.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is using a new, more physical playing style to battle
hefty linebackers for passes, or outracing cornerbacks down the
sideline for long touchdown passes, or running precise, clever pass
routes across the middle, Toomer has been the unquestioned star of
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something seriously wrong with you if you haven't
noticed the difference in Amani,'' Giants safety Sam Garnes said.
``He's a terror out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Danny Kanell was watching the group of defensive
backs and wide receivers run end-of-practice sprints the other day.
These are the fleetest of Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember last year when Amani was struggling just to finish
the sprints,'' Kanell said. ``I looked up the other day and he was
racing Jason Sehorn at the front of the pack, shoulder to shoulder.
Jason is the best conditioned guy on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a totally different man has shown up in Amani's
uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the 6-foot-2-inch, 200-pound Toomer showed up in a
different uniform. He ditched the No. 89 jersey he wore in his
first two seasons with the Giants and has taken jersey No. 81,
previously worn by Thomas Lewis, another disappointing high draft
pick who left the team this year after four unproductive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   No one is crediting the number change for the change in Toomer.
The change has been a simple one, if you ask him, although he seems
embarrassed when asked what it's like to be a changed man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'm the same person,'' said Toomer, who is quiet
and reserved. ``I just wasn't putting my best foot forward most of
the time. I knew I had to do a lot more and I had to be more
focused about what I wanted to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knew Fassel thought he was failing as a football player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to prove to him and everybody else that I did know what
I was doing,'' the 23-year-old Toomer said. ``That's what drove
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Toomer did in his make over was attend the
team's off-season strength and conditioning program every day it
was scheduled and some days when it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked harder than anybody,'' Fassel said. ``He worked so
hard I found myself pulling for him _ really pulling for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Toomer also took kung fu instruction in nearby Nyack, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their training exercises really strengthened my knee,'' Toomer
said, referring to his right knee, which was surgically repaired in
1996 after he tore his anterior cruciate ligament. ``In kung fu
there are some very low stances and you need strength and
flexibility at the same time do be able to do the movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's allowed me to play lower on the football field. I think
I'm coming off the cuts faster.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is Toomer's more aggressive attitude in pursuit of the
football that has made the biggest impression on the Giants'
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amani is just killing people to get to the ball when it's in
the air,'' said safety Percy Ellsworth, who is a physically
imposing player himself at 6-2 and 225.
</P>
<P>
   Told of Ellsworth's remarks, Toomer laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A state of mind,'' he said. ``You see the ball and get to it _
pushing, pulling, tripping people _ whatever helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Calloway is the dignified elder statesman of the Giants
receiving corps. Rarely highlighted, Calloway has led the team in
receiving for three successive seasons. He has also been watching
the new Toomer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never could put my finger on what was going wrong,''
Calloway said. ``But sometimes something clicks. He's in better
shape and having the best camp of anybody. There's just no doubt
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The next question, of course, is whether Toomer can sustain his
success in the regular season. Or is he a training-camp phenomenon?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will carry over into the regular season,'' Fassel
said. ``This isn't some trick, it's something built over months of
hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Toomer said he isn't eager to re-visit his football past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I keep doing this,'' he said. ``Then it will become a good
habit.''
</P>
<P>
   In April this year, the Giants did take two wide receivers in
the draft, Joe Jurevicius and Brian Alford.
</P>
<P>
   On the team's depth chart at wide receiver, they are behind the
other new guy in camp, No. 81, Amani Toomer.

<P>
   ROME _ Marco Liberali decided not to fiddle around while Rome
burned. Seeking relief from Rome's tropical temperatures, the
41-year-old mechanic installed central air-conditioning in his
family's apartment on the edge of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a difference it makes,'' Liberali said with the
assuredness of the newly converted. ``Humid heat is bad for you.''
</P>
<P>
   When Americans rushed to cool their air, Europeans traditionally
just slowed down and endured the summer heat. But now people like
Liberali, who got to know air-conditioning at the hotel where he
works, have decided to stop going without.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is becoming a big market for the air-conditioning
industry. Sales of air-conditioners for homes and small businesses
have grown more than 20 percent over the last three years, even as
they stayed flat in the United States, and the growth shows no sign
of abating.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, sales of air-conditioners for homes and small
businesses, including central air units for homes, are expected to
reach $3.2 billion this year, from $2.5 billion in 1996. In the
United States, they are expected only to inch up to $7.74 billion,
from $7.73 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Credit some of the growth to the pressures of a global economy,
which are increasingly forcing Europeans to work summers. Air
pollution is also bolstering the demand for air-conditioning, and
Europeans are becoming more accustomed to it in offices and their
cars, and increasingly want it in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists are concerned. Air-conditioners consume a
significant amount of energy, and their emissions help deplete the
ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many hurdles must fall before Europe can fully
indulge its new fondness for the big chill. Both electricity and
air-conditioners are costly, many homes lack proper wiring, home
power supplies are often weak and many Europeans view
air-conditioning as unhealthy: there is simply a bias to rely on
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the trend toward a cooler Europe is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above all in the whole area of small businesses and homes, the
use of air-conditioning is increasing,'' said Alfred Voss, director
of the Institute for Energy Use and Rational Use of Energy at
Stuttgart University.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe has a long way to go before air-conditioning becomes
the norm in homes. In Italy, 7 percent of homes are
air-conditioned, and in Spain 11 percent, compared with 71 percent
in the United States and more than 90 percent in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels, post offices, police stations, even hospitals, except
for operating rooms, generally do not have air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   So it is hardly surprising that the world's biggest
air-conditioner makers _ Japanese giants like Mitsubishi and Daikin
Industries, and American leaders like Carrier Corp., a unit of
United Technologies, and Trane Co., a unit of American Standard _
view Europe as a potential El Dorado. European companies, like
Riello and De Longhi in Italy, are jockeying to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture of air-conditioning is spreading,'' said Carlo
Segato, head of marketing at De Longhi, a specialist in portable
and room air-conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   But as temperatures climbed over Italy this summer, the
country's Green Party, echoing warnings from environmentalists
across Europe, argued that air-conditioners, while cooling the
inside of homes, forced out warm air, raising temperatures outside.
Moreover, they argued, more air-conditioners mean more
ozone-depleting gases in the atmosphere, which contribute to global
warming. ``Turning on your air-conditioner today,'' said Fulco
Pratesi, a Green Party spokesman in Rome, ``means suffering more
from the heat tomorrow.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The European air-conditioning market did not arrive overnight.
It was created after World War II by the companies that pioneered
the technology in the United States, including Carrier and York
International Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s the Japanese arrived. Mitsubishi and Toshiba have
factories in Britain and Daikin has one in Belgium. And the
Japanese got a leg up by introducing small, quiet portables and
wall models suited to small European dwellings. The Americans
responded quickly. Carrier bought local manufacturers in Spain and
Italy and redesigned its products to meet European demands.
</P>
<P>
   European companies, for their part, took a chapter from the
Japanese and copied Japanese models. The Italians introduced snappy
new models at competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
   De Longhi, long a maker of room heaters, began importing Toshiba
air-conditioners in 1988, then built its own, and its engineers now
use refrigerants that do not damage the atmosphere, including a
butane mixture similar to lighter fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Air-conditioning makers must scramble to find economical
substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons, gases traditionally used as
refrigerants, which were banned by the Montreal Protocol, a 1987
treaty signed by more than 150 countries, because they deplete the
earth's ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent accords banned the production of the interim
substitute, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, after 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's industry is under particular pressure because Germany,
Italy and Sweden, heeding environmentalists, want these gases gone
by 2000. When a company in eastern Germany first produced
refrigerators using butane in 1992, Greenpeace bought the first 10
prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   But substitutes are expensive. Sergio Zanolin, De Longhi's head
of research, said butane air-conditioners cost 10 percent to 20
percent more than conventional models. While Americans can trundle
down to a Home Depot and pick up a window unit for about $200, the
least expensive room models in Europe sell for almost $1,000
because of low production runs and expensive components.
</P>
<P>
   This year De Longhi expects to sell about $165 million worth of
air-conditioners and has even carved out a niche in the United
States. In part, sales received a boost in Europe from
air-conditioning's use as a marketing tool by stores, shopping
centers and professional offices of dentists and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last five years have seen a revolution in light commercial
use,'' said Halsey Cook, Carrier's head of marketing in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   When automobile air-conditioning caught on in the early 1990s,
it was largely thanks to stagnant auto sales, which prompted car
makers to offer air-conditioners to attract buyers. Five years ago,
hardly any European cars were air-conditioned; now, 28 percent are.
</P>
<P>
   That may be peanuts compared with the United States, where 95
percent of cars are air-conditioned, but the market continues to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting started, people are buying it, and the technology
now allows it,'' said Sandro Frigerio, who follows the auto
air-conditioning market at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in London. He said
innovation and miniaturization now enabled auto makers to cool
small European cars without significant power loss or higher gas
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   And as Europeans grow fond of air-conditioning in cars and
dentists' offices, more want it at home.
</P>
<P>
   Not that sales have exploded. ``The domestic market is really on
the edge of a boom,'' said Jacques Benoist, director of
certification at Eurovent, an industry association established
recently in Paris to certify air-conditioning equipment. ``But it
didn't happen yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are many reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The first, of course, is price, which is compounded by energy
problems. In some countries, like Italy, sufficient electricity is
scarce. Typical Italian homes are equipped with smaller circuit
breakers than American homes. In Italy, a separate circuit for
air-conditioning costs as much as $400.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, Europe's reluctance can be traced to the relatively mild
climate, with little of the tropical heat that assaults cities like
Houston or Miami. Yet temperatures in Granada, Spain, or Palermo,
Italy, can easily surpass those in New York. Some experts also
point to a tendency for Europeans to favor nature over technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they design a building, they take greater advantage of
natural lighting and ventilation,'' said Bruce Anderson, head of
marketing in Europe for Trane, based in Tyler, Texas ``So owners
will say, `There's no reason to have air-conditioning.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such reluctance is bolstered by a conviction that
air-conditioning is unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Italian newspapers, which regularly advise readers how to deal
with the heat, warn against it. The weekly health insert of La
Repubblica in Rome recently warned readers that air-conditioning
could cause colds and sore throats and spread ``germs, viruses and
bacteria'' through unclean filters.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, many experts argue the opposite. In the
recent heat wave, more than 120 deaths were attributed to the heat.
Indeed, some European doctors increasingly recommend
air-conditioning for the elderly and for people with heart trouble
and respiratory ailments.
</P>
<P>
   In response, European manufacturers have developed quieter and
more efficient models. And increased production, economies of scale
and cheap foreign imports will cut prices. In television ads,
Italian importers offer cheap Chinese air-conditioners free to
viewers who order mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as Europe deregulates the energy market, electricity
supplies are expected to rise, thus reducing the cost.
</P>
<P>
   In France the national utility, Electricite de France, offers
bonuses to builders who install energy-efficient heat pumps, which
warm homes in winter and cool them in summer. Italy's national
utility, Enel, now penalizes energy use by charging higher rates as
more power is consumed. ``Ten to 15 years ago, we had power
shortages,'' said Enel marketing director Roberto Formigoni. ``Now
we have lots to sell.'' So Enel is petitioning Rome's energy
authority to cut rates and increase the supply for homes.
</P>
<P>
   Antonietta Marconi, marketing director of GMC Climatizzatori,
where Liberali bought his equipment, says it cannot happen too
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the air-conditioning business for six years, and
prices will fall,'' she said. ``It will become like central
heating.''
</P>
<P>
   Voss, of Stuttgart University, agrees. ``With energy prices
coming down, I think it's safe to say the tendency will be for
demand for appliances like air-conditioners to continue to grow,''
he said. &QL;

 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE FALLS, N.J. _ He came not to talk, only to hit. Pete Rose
Jr., famous son with a bulked-up body and a prefab burden, came to
New Jersey, the Northeast League, where the only at-bats were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll swallow my pride,'' Rose had said last week after yet
another baseball organization _ this time the Pittsburgh Pirates _
handed him his minor league walking papers, and he hustled off to
find any base he could call home.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of Rose's newest team, the independent New Jersey
Jackals, asked that reporters not harshly judge the silent man who
has had to tell his story in too many minor league towns, too many
places where the mere introduction of his name was an indictment of
his being there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been through a lot,'' manager Kash Beauchamp said Friday
night, before Rose cleared the bases with a second-inning triple
and sent Beauchamp's Jackals on their way to a 9-6 victory over the
Elmira Pioneers at Yogi Berra Stadium. It is a little field tucked
into the campus of Montclair State University, not far from two
major league ball parks. But, as Beauchamp and any New Jersey
commuter could tell Rose, the traffic between here and there is
often brutal. The trip could take forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have to tear the uniform off him,'' said Jackals coach
Hank Manning of Rose, a good friend made during his own tour of
Minor League America. The message being: other than 4,254 major
league hits, we should understand there is not much difference
between father and son.
</P>
<P>
   They are stubborn souls, with stocky builds, and familiar
bulldog faces. But by most accounts, baseball's career hit king,
who was banished nearly nine years ago for gambling, hardly knows
the man he and his ex-wife once called Petey. For having his
father's name, but not his attention, as he struggled to make it on
his own, sympathy for Pete Rose Jr. comes easily enough. But the
fact of the matter is that players with less celebrated names would
not have survived six years in Class A ball, often not hitting
their weight. The reality is that lineage was as much a factor in
Rose's career-defining moment as his surprising 25 home runs last
season in Class AA.
</P>
<P>
   If baseball ended tomorrow for the 28-year-old Rose, which it
most certainly will not, he would at least walk away with the
memory of having made his father come to Cincinnati's Cinergy Field
last September, to watch him hit in a major league game.
Beauchamp's own enduring retrospection, interestingly, is the
fateful night that he bowled over the catcher, a la Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Beauchamp looks nothing like the thick-bodied Rose Jr., who now
packs more than 200 pounds into his 6-foot-1-inch frame.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old manager, tall and rangy, could still pass for
the major league center fielder he was supposed to become when he
was the first pick of baseball's winter draft _ two slots ahead of
Kirby Puckett _ by the Toronto Blue Jays 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Grove, Okla., a short drive from Commerce, in
Mickey Mantle country. His father, Jim Beauchamp, was a major
league ballplayer, a reputed tough out, even a onetime member of
the Cincinnati Reds, who gave his son a befitting name for the
financial scores that awaited his generation's players. Instead,
Kash became Crash, the ``Bull Durham'' film character, the minor
league lifer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was the best athlete to ever come out of my town,''
Beauchamp said in his office before writing Rose into his lineup
card, playing first base, batting third. ``It was a tough act to
follow. I was nowhere that good. I felt pressure, unbelievable
pressure. Just magnify it by 100 times, that's what he's going
through.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Rose, but there was more to his own story to
tell. Despite three surgeries on his left shoulder, Beauchamp was
hitting .330 at Class AAA Syracuse in 1986, when he tried one night
to score from second base. The catcher was Pat Dempsey, brother of
Rick, the former big leaguer. Beauchamp went the macho route, made
famous by Rose, straight through the catcher. Forearms were up. He
felt something in his shoulder snap. It was a bone, and his dream
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   His father would eventually tell him that Pat Gillick, the Blue
Jays' general manager, confided that Kash Beauchamp was, at that
time, no more than three days from being brought to the majors to
platoon with Lloyd Moseby in center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish my dad had never told me that,'' he said, his eyes
narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, the emotional wound was more noticeable than a
three-inch scar on the upper left side of his back. Beauchamp spent
13 years in the minors and never got so much as a sip from the cup
of coffee that his new first baseman drank in Cincinnati last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Under heavy local pressure, the Reds brought Pete Rose Jr. up on
Sept. 1, Labor Day, and put him at third base in a game against the
Kansas City Royals. Rose trotted out and, as he did every night,
scrawled his father's hit total _ 4,256 _ into the dirt. As he
always said he would, he used a bat his father had given him for
his first major league swings. He struck out, retired his father's
bat, and with a Barry Larkin model bounced a single off the first
baseman's glove in his second time up. Pete Rose stood and cheered
the son who had run on the field and hugged him when he broke Ty
Cobb's record in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   That day passed into Cincinnati lore, and Rose Jr. drifted out
of the town in which he grew up. He had 14 at-bats for the Reds,
fanned nine times, hit two singles and has said he was mystified,
even bitter, that he did not get more of a chance because just now
he believes he has learned how to hit.
</P>
<P>
   But he got a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would trade my 13 years for the time he had there,''
Beauchamp said, glancing at a photo on his desk of his father in a
Mets uniform, where Jim Beauchamp played, oddly enough, for Yogi
Berra. Instead, he is left to contemplate what Gillick told his
dad. He is left to think, ``If only I had known, I would have slid
into home.''

LOUIMA CASE SLOWED BY DISPUTE OVER REPRESENTATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the first anniversary of what prosecutors say was
the torture of Abner Louima by police officers at a Brooklyn
station house, the case against five officers is bogged down in a
dispute over legal representation.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the graphic reports of brutalization involving
Louima, a Haitian immigrant, the dispute in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn involves the much less sensational issue of whether the
lawyers for two of the officers should be removed from the case
because of possible conflicts of interest. The lawyers are partners
in a new firm that has a contract to represent all of the city's
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Until this issue _ which has been the focus of pretrial
proceedings for the last two months _ is resolved, matters
involving evidence and other issues that have to be dealt with
before the trial can begin will not be considered. And if the two
lawyers are replaced, the time needed for their successors to
become familiar with the case is expected to further delay the
trial, which is unlikely to start before early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The roadblock in a case that was already held up by a switch
from state to federal prosecution vividly illustrates how even the
most emotional case _ in this instance involving one of the most
politically and racially charged accusations of police brutality in
New York City in years _ can become bogged down in cerebral
courtroom skirmishing.
</P>
<P>
   But the diversion in the prosecution _ which stems from Louima's
encounter with police officers who arrested him in a brawl on Aug.
9, 1997 _ does not mean the emotions of the case are in remission.
In fact, they are expected to be intensely expressed when Louima's
family and supporters hold an anniversary vigil at the site of his
arrest, outside Club Rendez-Vous, a nightclub at 1438 Flatbush Ave.
And Louima's lawyers filed a civil lawsuit on his behalf on
Thursday against the city, the five accused officers and the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the union that represents
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors in the criminal case and Louima's
lawyers, four of the officers beat him in a police car on the way
to the 70th Precinct station house in Flatbush, and two of the four
tortured him there. One officer, Justin Volpe, is accused of
ramming a stick into Louima's rectum and then into his mouth,
inflicting major internal injuries, while the second, Charles
Schwarz, is accused of holding Louima down.
</P>
<P>
   They and Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese, two other officers
accused of taking part in the patrol-car beatings, are charged with
violating Louima's civil rights. The fifth defendant, Sgt. Michael
Bellomo, is charged with trying to cover up the beating. All five
officers are white, and Louima's civil suit charges that he endured
``ethnic and racist slurs'' during the assaults.
</P>
<P>
   The five officers insist that the charges are untrue.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict-of-interest dispute involves Schwarz's lawyer,
Stephen Worth, and Bruder's lawyer, Stuart London. Both have been
representing their clients since the case began last August. They
were retained by the officers' union, which had previously engaged
them, case by case, to represent other officers in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   When they were retained in the Louima case, Worth and London
were with separate law firms. But earlier this year they became
partners in a new firm that obtained a contract with the PBA,
effective in May, to represent all of its members facing charges in
criminal cases and in Police Department disciplinary matters.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers' new relationships with each other and with the
union raise ``serious conflict-of-interest issues,'' according to
prosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, who are
wary of any condition that might enable officers to appeal a
conviction with the argument that their lawyers' conflicts kept
them from receiving the most effective defense. The prosecutors
have indicated that they might seek the removal of Worth and London
from the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks posed by a single law firm representing
co-defendants in a criminal case,'' reads a recent prosecution
brief on the matter, include ``the possibility that one partner
will forgo viable defense strategies beneficial to his client but
which may conflict with the strategy of his partner.''
</P>
<P>
   And citing the contract under which the new firm _ Worth,
Longworth &AMP; Bamundo _ is to provide legal services to all police
union members, the brief argues that if police officers who might
be called as witnesses at the trial wanted legal advice, ``the firm
would then be in the position of providing a defense for Schwarz
and Bruder and advising potential witnesses against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth and London have told Judge Eugene Nickerson that their
removal is not required because there is no conflict between the
defenses of Schwarz and Bruder, and that the two want to continue
with their lawyers. And other lawyers could be hired to advise
potential police officer witnesses, Worth and London said.
Nickerson is expected to hold a hearing on the dispute, which is
not likely to be resolved for at least another month.

(ATTN: R.I.)  
 WITH NOD TO CONNER, DISABLED SAILOR'S AIM IS TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ It has crossed Paul Callahan's mind that he,
like his friend Dennis Conner, wants nothing to do with falling off
a sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   Conner never learned to swim, and Callahan couldn't swim if he
wanted to: he is a quadriplegic. Nevertheless, both are
championship sailors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why Dennis and I see eye to eye,'' Callahan said
recently. ``We both sail by instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, 40, will represent the United States in the 1998
Hartford World Disabled Sailing Championship, which starts here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-race regatta includes 17 teams from 15 countries
competing in 23-foot Sonar sloops.
</P>
<P>
   The world championship calls for fleet racing. But each boat
begins with a handicap rating based on the level of each crew's
disabilities. The scale runs from 1-7, with No. 1 representing the
most severe handicap. Callahan is rated a No. 1, which makes his
success in sailboat racing even more significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any world championship is hard to win,'' Conner said. ``Just
the fact that Paul is winning at this level shows what kind of guy
he is.''
</P>
<P>
   For competitors with disabilities, sailboat racing requires
subtle adjustments in technique to offset their handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan has minimal movement in his arms. To compensate, he has
rigged a special steering mechanism that allows him to pull rather
than push the boat's tiller.
</P>
<P>
   His crew needs to hike out on the rail farther than normal to
make up for Callahan's inability to shift his weight on a tack.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Burhans of Rochester, one of Callahan's two crewmates, is
a double amputee who lost both legs below the knee.
</P>
<P>
   His other teammate, Richard Hughes, of Philadelphia, is a single
amputee. Both wear leg prostheses.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of Shake-a-Leg-Newport, Callahan directs a
rehabilitative program for people with spinal-cord injuries. A
basic component of the group regimen is sailing, which allows the
disabled an opportunity to take up one of the few sports available
to them. It is how Callahan came to take up sailing five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Callahan asked the New York Yacht Club, which has
an annex in Newport, if it would help out with the world
championship. In an unprecedented gesture for disabled sailing, the
club agreed. The organization plans to send a team of race experts,
including about 50 volunteers, to organize the seven-race regatta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The club feels that there are certain events in which it
should give something back,'' said George Hinman, former chairman
of the New York club's committee on competitions.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile individuals have helped out, too. Conner donated a
$25,000 Sonar sloop to Shake-a-Leg two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Without telling Conner ahead of time, Callahan arranged for the
boat to be painted in the same red, white and blue colors as the
America's Cup yachts that Conner sailed for the Stars &AMP; Stripes
syndicate in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time for the Sonar to be christened in 1996,
Callahan began the dockside ceremony by draping the new boat in the
way that's typical for yachts with secret design innovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think this is,'' bellowed Conner, ``an America's
Cup campaign?'' Then the cloth came off, and Conner saw the paint
job. Callahan describes it as an emotional moment.
</P>
<P>
   Sports have come as easily to Callahan as fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan was a high school all-American in basketball in
Providence, R.I. But in his junior year at Harvard University, he
slipped on a wet linoleum floor and severely damaged his spinal
cord. He has been in a wheelchair since, and he still approaches
life with the confidence of an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan has received a master's degree in business from
Harvard. He is director of the Harvard Graduate School of Business,
and commutes by car _ which he drives himself _ from Newport to
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   That self-assurance was evident from the moment he stepped on a
sailboat in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day I went out sailing was extremely windy,'' he
recalled. ``The instructor said, `You seem like a skipper, so
you're driving.' After we left the dock, he wanted to go out in the
bay. But I wanted to weave in and around the other boats in the
harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cringed, but said it was OK It was my baptism by fire.'' &QL;

STREET FURNITURE DESIGNS STUCK IN GRIDLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some of the world's leading architects have designed
newsstands, bus-stop shelters and public toilets for New York City.
Not just models and renderings; life-size ``street furniture'' _
tall enough to walk in, sturdy enough to sit on.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for it anytime soon, however. At least, not on the
sidewalks of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Meier's street furniture can be found instead under a
grove of oak trees outside the Floral Glass &AMP; Mirror works in
Hauppauge, N.Y. The pieces designed by Josef Paul Kleihues are
arrayed around a warehouse in the northernmost Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   And in a vast storeroom in Astoria, Queens, a block from Kaufman
Astoria Studios, sit 14 full-scale bus-stop shelters, newsstands
and toilets _ lights shining, time-and-temperature signs flashing,
roll-down grates rolling _ designed by Norman Foster &AMP; Partners,
Gwathmey Siegel &AMP; Associates Architects, Polshek &AMP; Partners
Architects, Robert A.M. Stern Architects and Vignelli Associates.
</P>
<P>
   All were built in an effort to capture the proposed 20-year
coordinated citywide franchise for at least 3,300 shelters, 430
newsstands and 30 toilets. After spending millions of dollars on
their bids, however, the four prospective contractors were told
June 26 that the Giuliani administration had decided to cancel the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The official explanation was simply: ``The city is exploring
options to develop a street furniture program that would encourage
competition and greater design variation in the structures to
distinguish the city's different neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   What that decision leaves in its wake is not only two dozen
imaginative, expensive prototypes, but a hard-won expertise in
designing for the streets; expertise that may yet be called into
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we're disappointed, those were well-spent
millions,'' said Stephen Feinberg, president and chief executive of
Adshel, for whom Richard Meier &AMP; Partners designed two lines of
furniture. ``What I'm designing for Boston incorporates everything
I learned in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   (Boston will soon issue a request for proposals, making it the
next big prize in the race by private contractors to furnish
American streets with amenities _ and reap the advertising dollars
that follow.)
</P>
<P>
   Last month, after New York withdrew its request for proposals,
Adshel and two other bidders, J C Decaux New York and Wall City
Design, permitted an inspection of their previously confidential
submissions by a reporter and photographer from The New York Times,
although the companies would not disclose the financial terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has traditionally avoided design excellence in the
public domain,'' said the architect Charles Gwathmey, who worked
for Decaux. ``This should be an upbeat and positive signal that
there's a new vision of sidewalk amenities.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are extremely ambitious. And no wonder. The
winning company could have expected gross revenues between $1
billion and $2 billion over the 20-year term from the illuminated
advertising panels, against an investment of about $100 million to
build the structures, as well as the cost of maintaining them. The
winner would also have scored the promotional coup of having its
fixtures designated as New York City's official standard.
</P>
<P>
   So the bidders enlisted several prominent architects, who
produced designs ranging from fussy to futuristic, although most
relied on simple lines and metallic tones, providing enough
structural details to be interesting but not so many as to
encourage harvesting by vandals.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most ecumenical proposal came from J C Decaux and GE
Capital Services, for whom seven architects created seven distinct
designs. Besides those whose prototypes are in Astoria, the roster
included Eisenman Architects and Tod Williams Billie Tsien &AMP;
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the city's option to pick the ones they wanted,'' said
Suzanne Davis, senior vice president of J C Decaux USA. ``They
could have picked several different selections for different
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   J C Decaux, the French parent company founded by Jean-Claude
Decaux in 1962, holds franchises in some 1,135 cities worldwide,
among them San Francisco, where it signed a contract in 1994 for
newsstands, toilets and pillar-style kiosks. For four months in
1992, Decaux operated six experimental public toilets in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The architects working for Decaux had no idea what the other
teams were up to until they traveled to Plaisir, west of Paris, to
see the prototypes under construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They deliberately kept us free to come up with what we thought
was appropriate for New York City,'' said Susan Rodriguez, a
partner in James Stewart Polshek's office. She and Gwathmey paid a
visit last month to the Astoria warehouse, where the ruby-red
digital temperature sign on the Polshek shelter was blinking
``99.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like your seats,'' Ms. Rodriguez said, as she inspected the
neat, square panels in the cantilevered bench of the Gwathmey
Siegel shelter. ``They didn't build ours correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean?'' Gwathmey asked, turning his gaze to the
Polshek shelter a few yards away, with its barrel-shaped bench
frame. ``That looks pretty cool, hanging from that pipe.'' Ms.
Rodriguez explained that what was constructed as a flat surface was
meant to be convex.
</P>
<P>
   The distinguishing feature of the Polshek line, however, was
evident: the roof structure is connected to a steel pier by
stainless-steel suspension rods, recalling building canopies and
long-necked traffic lights, as well as the great bridges of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a heritage of ornamental metalwork in New York,'' Ms.
Rodriguez said. ``We were trying to capture the texture and
character.'' Plus, she said, the multifaceted building elements
would discourage graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of Mies van der Rohe, Gwathmey Siegel used highly
articulated steel channels and angles to create crisp, spare boxes.
One practical advantage, Gwathmey said, was that structural
elements would be interchangeable from shelter to newsstand to
toilet. ``What resulted, we hope, is not a mannered structure but a
clean, receptive, accommodative and less imposing structure,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Eisenman took a much different tack. He proposed an
angular Moebius strip of three-eighths-inch thick steel plates, its
bench cantilevered outward and its glass windscreen tilting inward.
The design was not intended for general use, Eisenman said, but for
exceptional civic settings like the Brooklyn Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a spatial object that was intended to cause people to
look at it and comment on bus shelters,'' he said. ``We want people
to be more aware of their physical environment, not less aware.''
</P>
<P>
   Easily the most ornate proposal was that by Robert A.M. Stern.
Painted forest green, his fixtures are framed by colonnettes with
gold bands and capitals. Clocks nestle in the eaves of the arched
roofs. The newsstand has a canopy that recalls the Art Nouveau
style of the Paris Metro and a roll-down grate on which 32 magazine
covers can be displayed when the stand is closed.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to echo New York's rich visual mix. ``I wanted to
make a shelter that fit into that richness and was itself rich in
details and character,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   In striking contrast are the snowy, planar fixtures by Vignelli
Associates, including a shelter with a transparent roof. ``What we
wanted to do was something airy, something very open and not too
enclosed,'' Massimo Vignelli said. ``We think that these little
pieces of white furniture in the context of the city will give a
dash of happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone might have been expected to gravitate to white, surely
it would have been Meier, who practically holds a trademark on
dazzling, crystalline structures. Yet his proposals for Adshel are
somber. There is the dark-gray ``Metropolitan'' line, with
extruded, channeled aluminum columns from which a tapered roof is
cantilevered, and the black ``New Amsterdam'' line, intended to
complement historic districts and nearby landmarks with its
shallow, translucent, barrel-vaulted rooftop.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we wanted was something that wasn't visually assertive
and seemed to fit naturally into the environment,'' Meier said.
``These should be apparent but not buildings unto themselves.
Therefore, whiteness didn't seem appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Adshel installed the Meier prototypes outdoors, on a property
near the Long Island Expressway, where it built small stretches of
sidewalk and curb as a setting. ``We wanted to see what would
happen in a New York environment,'' Feinberg said. From stains on
the pavement after a rainfall, he learned that a sliding assembly
on the newsstand was not rustproof. ``That'll never happen again,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Film canisters have been spotted on the other side of the
chain-link fence. ``Our competitors have been here,'' Feinberg
said, cicadas buzzing around him. ``That's flattering.'' He noted
that engineering details cannot easily be knocked off; like a
design that permits glass panels to break safely into pebbles under
high winds before the entire shelter sails away.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Meier designs would not be appropriate for Boston,
Feinberg said, they might wind up in Brisbane, Australia or
Glasgow. Adshel is a subsidiary of the More Group of Britain, which
was acquired this summer by Clear Channel Communications of San
Antonio, after a bidding war with Decaux. Adshel has more than 450
contracts, including the shelter franchise in Westchester County.
It was recently selected to provide San Francisco with news racks,
which will carry advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Wall City Design is the U.S. division of Wall Verkehrsanlagen.
Founded by Hans Wall and based in Berlin, the company holds
franchises in some 50 cities, including the recently awarded
bus-shelter contract for St. Louis. It also operates an automatic
public toilet near City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Its architect, Kleihues, is best known in this country for the
new Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. He created a shelter
with gently bowed ends and also a flat-topped structure that tapers
to a point at the ends. The fixtures might be silver or, in
historic settings, forest green.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get the right design, a modern thing doesn't look too
modern, even in a historic district in Harlem,'' said Wall City
president Douglas Watts.
</P>
<P>
   The full-scale shelter prototype cost $50,000; the newsstand
mock-up $150,000. The structures are built of steel and coated with
a baked-on, granular powder made of polymers that creates a hard,
nonporous surface from which most graffiti can be removed with
rubbing alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the city and you don't want anything too ephemeral,''
Watts said. ``We want potential vandals to look at something and
say, `This is bigger, tougher and stronger than I am.'''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth proposal was by Transportation Displays Inc., a
division of CBS, in partnership with Cemusa of Madrid. The
architect was Nicholas Grimshaw. The company declined to show his
designs.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Allman, the chief operating officer of TDI, allowed that
the company was ``disappointed'' but added, ``Inherent in every
procurement process is that risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The citywide franchise had been championed by Deputy Mayor Fran
Reiter before she managed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's election
campaign and then took over the New York Convention and Visitors
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a coordinated effort to say what we want
to allow or not allow, what esthetic values do we want to bring to
street furniture,'' Ms. Reiter said in 1996. ``We don't have public
toilets in New York. We have unsightly newsstands. We have bus-stop
shelters that, while functional, are not the newest generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly after her departure from City Hall, the Transportation
Department conducted follow-up sessions with the bidders. But
officials never saw the prototypes, so they had no chance to
appreciate the fact that both Decaux and Wall stocked their stands
with newspapers from Nov. 5, 1997: ``Giuliani Sweeps to Second Term
as Mayor'' (The New York Times) and ``Rudy Two'' (The New York
Post).
</P>
<P>
   Then, at a news conference in January, the mayor indicated that
the plan was in trouble. ``Is there a better and more competitive
way to do it?'' he asked. For example, he wondered, should there be
several smaller contracts, broken up geographically or divided into
different types of fixtures?
</P>
<P>
   The die was all but cast. On June 26, the bidders received a
three-paragraph letter from the Transportation Department informing
them that the request for proposals for a coordinated
street-furniture franchise (No. 84197MB039AD) had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since then, an interagency task force has been looking into the
questions that Giuliani raised. ``There is no timetable but they
are actively working,'' Deputy Mayor Randy Levine said last week.
In any case, he said, the contracts that emerge ``will not be of
the magnitude of the last RFP, where one successful bidder would
have had, in effect, the entire city.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is ``a strong believer that New York is very diverse
and that we shouldn't get locked into one design, one person, one
thing,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   But Councilman Walter McCaffrey, the Queens Democrat who heads
the zoning and franchises subcommittee, said the legislation and
the request for proposals already accounted for the objections
raised by the mayor, since they encouraged a variety of design and
allowed for a consortium of operators rather than a single
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two reasons given for scuttling the process are without
merit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said it would be possible for two contractors to share
Manhattan and divide the four other boroughs between them. ``This
is something that could be addressed very quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, because of increased ridership, some bus
stops have 50 or more passengers waiting around old, leaky shelters
without benches. ``When it rains,'' McCaffrey said, ``the people
standing out there unprotected can rightly ask themselves: `Why has
the administration delayed? Why am I standing in the rain?'''
</P>
<P>
   Other cities, inspired by New York, have been faster off the
mark. San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan was in Manhattan in 1992 for
the Democratic National Convention, when he saw the experimental
Decaux public toilet. Two years later, his administration awarded a
street-furniture contract.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, San Francisco's street furniture caught the eye of
Boston Mayor Thomas Menino when he was there last year for the
United States Conference of Mayors. Now, his administration is a
month away from issuing a request for proposals that will cover 250
to 300 shelters, 8 to 10 toilets, and multiple newspaper racks.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that New York has no interesting new street
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to miss the 140 or so stainless-steel telephone
kiosks that Telebeam Telecommunications has installed around
Manhattan. Thick, tapered legs support round-edged enclosures that
are topped by curving, illuminated canopies on radial spokes. The
design is by Rudy Fabiano.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the Grand Central Partnership and 34th Street
Partnership have erected 76 ``wayfinding'' signs, 13{ feet high,
pointing the way to the Empire State Building, Grand Central
Terminal, St. Patrick's Cathedral and other much-sought
destinations. The signs were designed by Gresham Smith &AMP; Associates
and A.M. Sign.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '90s, the partnerships have installed hundreds
of benches, bicycle racks, news racks, street signs, planters and
trees. Because the Giuliani administration dissolved the Grand
Central Partnership last month, however, the future of the
street-furniture initiative is unclear. Daniel Biederman, president
of both partnerships, said, ``If the BID continues in some form,
it's my expectation that whoever is running it will want to
continue working with the city on these improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Downtown New York, which runs the lower
Manhattan business improvement district, has embarked on a $13.5
million streetscape improvement, including specially designed
lampposts, wastebaskets, benches and a wayfinding system. This line
of furniture was designed by Cooper, Robertson &AMP; Partners and the
Pentagram Design graphics studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The BIDs, to their credit, have delved into this area,'' said
Municipal Art Society president Brendan Sexton, ``and shown what a
difference it can make to have an inviting bench here and there, to
clean up the newsrack disaster, to have a handsome lightpole at
pedestrian height.''
</P>
<P>
   What Sexton has seen of the coordinated street-furniture designs
is enough, he said, to make his mouth water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vendors recruited some of the best designers,'' he said.
``We absolutely must find a way to capture this work and not lose
it. And to do so now. It's a big city to furnish. We've got to get
started.''

NON-STAR JETS STRIVE TO WIN PARCELLS' FAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Coach Bill Parcells still has many questions about
the Jets' roster, most of which probably will be answered by about
midnight next Saturday. By then, the Jets will have had another
week of two-a-days and will have played their second exhibition
game, Saturday against the Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   But several players got off to a good start in Thursday's
opening game against the Eagles in bids to either win a job or
improve their status with the team:
</P>
<P>
   ALEX VAN DYKE: He set a collegiate record for season receiving
yardage at Nevada. He came in as the Jets' second draft choice in
1996, but under the shadow of the overall No. 1 pick, Keyshawn
Johnson. After two seasons, he has just 20 receptions _ only three
of which came last season. Van Dyke knows what is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he responded with four receptions for 67 yards. He
is battling the team's fastest receiver, Dedric Ward, to become the
No. 3 receiver behind Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in that third year,'' Van Dyke said. ``I guess I've
matured a whole lot. All that time I had to sit and watch those
games, I was growing up. You learn about what you've got to do to
get onto the field.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been one of the most diligent Jets in the weight room. He
is 6 feet, 200 pounds, and Parcells said, ``He's what an NFL
receiver is supposed to look like.''
</P>
<P>
   But Van Dyke also has to prove he has improved his
concentration. ``If we need a route at 14, he runs it at 12,''
Parcells said. ``It's attention to detail.''
</P>
<P>
   DORIAN BOOSE: Usually a team's first draft pick gets attention.
Few people in New York have noticed the defensive end, though,
because he is not a first-rounder. He was the 56th player chosen
overall after the Jets yielded their first-rounder to New England
in obtaining the free agent Curtis Martin. Boose has struggled in
camp. When someone asked Parcells last week whether Boose was
injured, the coach angrily replied: ``He's not hurt. He's getting
whipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Eagles' second-stringers, though, Boose was nearly
dominant. He got a sack and was credited with another on a safety.
He was constantly creating havoc. ``Bill told me: `You don't have
to be a superstar. Just be a part. Just help us get to the Super
Bowl,''' Boose said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the disparity between his play in the game and on
the practice field, Boose said: ``I do slack off a little bit, but
the game is serious, it's all business. I felt good about the plays
I made, but I also made a lot of mistakes. But at least the
mistakes I made weren't the same mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   RAY LUCAS: He is hoping to become the No. 3 quarterback, and is
learning the pro trade after playing on special teams for most of
his first two seasons. Against the Eagles, he led the team on a
touchdown drive. But he also threw an interception after the Jets
got within whispering distance of the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you the thrill of what it's like getting into a
game,'' he said. ``This was huge. Huge! But then when I got to the
goal line, I did all the wrong things. No exotic snap count, no
turnovers, no sacks, no interceptions. I did them all. So I went
from a hug from Coach Parcells to getting chewed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas will get another chance, but not next Saturday. It is
Chuck Clements' turn to try to put in a claim as the third-string
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   RICHIE ANDERSON: The running back has been in a training-camp
battle with Robert Farmer as the third tailback. But Anderson
generated 66 yards on 14 attempts against the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he helped himself,'' Parcells said. ``But Richie's got to
contribute on special teams. He's not going to be the starter.''
</P>
<P>
   SCOTT FROST: The great experiment of training camp. Parcells
just loves the idea of seeing a 6-3 quarterback who hits people.
But the rookie is not leading the Nebraska Cornhuskers anymore. He
is trying to become a strong safety as well as kickoff returner. He
brought back two a total of 41 yards. ``I thought he did some
pretty good things on specials,'' Parcells said. ``I've got to play
him more in the game now. I was fairly pleased with what I saw.
This is going to be a tedious thing. I don't think you should get
your expectations too high right now.''
</P>
<P>
   NICK GALLERY: The punter who broke Reggie Roby's records at Iowa
did two very important things in his bid to unseat Brian Hansen. He
kicked every ball well _ his four punts averaged 50 yards _ and he
produced a net average of 39.2. Parcells is looking for a net of at
least 37. Hansen has never reached that net in a career dating to
1984. Gallery will get another shot against the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   BRYAN COX: The perpetually angry _ on the field, anyway _
linebacker is out of shape after being cut by the Bears two months
ago. He has been a force, though, and will fit in somewhere. Still,
Parcells cautioned, ``I cannot emphasize too much how we're gearing
him to Sept. 6.'' That is opening day at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   JEROME HENDERSON: He started 14 games at free safety last year,
but is back at cornerback. Unfortunately for Henderson, Marcus
Coleman is having an outstanding camp trying to unseat Otis Smith
at right corner.

MARTIN, FORCED TO JUST SIT, STANDS SOLID WITH PARCELLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Curtis Martin stood on the sideline, in
uniform but idle, Thursday night in the New York Jets' first
preseason game. Resting a strained hamstring, Martin had nothing to
prove to himself by hurrying back and certainly nothing to prove to
coach Bill Parcells, whose relationship with him during his time in
New England is what brought him to New York.
</P>
<P>
   That made it a far cry from three years ago when he played in
his first professional game, a preseason game against the Detroit
Lions, and received his first lesson from Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so pumped up,'' Martin said as he hurried off to get
taped before yesterday's workout. ``It was my first game, the first
time I was going to touch the ball in a real game against NFL
players. Then I got out there and I expected to carry the ball a
couple of times. He gave me the ball eight times in a row. I was
hyperventilating.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells laughed at the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so excited about the game and now I'm running him to
death,'' Parcells said. ``It was a fake lesson, but he learned it,
that you need stamina to play in this league. I wouldn't start a
game and do that to him, but I was trying to get him to understand
what this job was going to be like. You've got to be prepared to do
this and I had to see how much he liked this.''
</P>
<P>
   A curious way to begin what is regarded as a close relationship,
but the bond was already developing between player and coach long
before that first game. The gruff and demanding head coach pushed
Martin from the start, but instead of rebelling, Martin responded.
And when Parcells left New England last year, Martin stayed one
more season and then followed. As the first restricted free agent
the Jets ever tendered an offer sheet to, he signed a six-year, $36
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has taken a slow path back from the injury this
preseason, being careful to avoid troubles like he encountered last
season when he was hampered by an abdominal muscle tear that
required off-season surgery to correct. He is expected to
participate in a full week of practice and is very likely to play
Saturday against Baltimore. There is no rush to earn the money now,
but it was not the money that made him come.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him if Parcells had an effect on his decision and he almost
jumps at the question. ``Oh definitely,'' Martin said. ``I respect
him so much. He's a man who demands what he wants, in a proper way.
I believe that that is his style of coaching and it's great for our
team.''
</P>
<P>
   While Parcells may have been testing him at the start of his
career, he did not exactly ease up on him when the season began. As
the 74th selection in the 1995 draft, Martin became the surprise of
the season when he topped the 100-yard mark rushing in his first
game, and then tied a National Football League rookie record by
passing the 100-yard plateau nine times that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curtis was very young when we met him,'' Parcells said. ``With
my background, where I'm from, the kid was so nice, I was almost
suspicious. People start talking to you like this where I come
from, you kind of look at them funny, like, `What's this guy want?'
But it turned that was just the way he is. I don't know why we hit
it off. I was very hard on him, but his skin was thick.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ The Jets waived defensive back ANTHONY MARSHALL and wide
receiver NAKIA JENKINS on Saturday, cutting the active squad to 78.
</P>
<P>
   _ Running back DUSTIN JOHNSON suffered a nondisplaced rib
fracture and will be out two-three weeks, which, combined with his
fumble Thursday, hurts his chances of sticking.
</P>
<P>
   _ The defensive lineman ERIC OGBOGU will rest for one or two
days with a stomach muscle problem. &QL;

VANCE I. OYAMA, BIOCHEMIST WHO SOUGHT LIFE ON MARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (kd) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vance I. Oyama, a biochemist whose laboratory-in-a-shoe box
aboard the Mars landers two decades ago helped fuel an intense
debate about the existence of life on that planet, died on July 27
at his home in Middletown, Calif. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Oyama, the former chief of the life-detection branch at NASA's
Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., died of cancer, his
family said.
</P>
<P>
   His experiment was one of three in a cubic foot of space aboard
the two Viking landers that reached Mars in 1976. In the
experiment, water and a ``chicken soup'' of nutrients were added to
samples of Martian soil. If there were microorganisms in the soil,
the thinking went, they would consume the nutrients and give off
gases.
</P>
<P>
   Oyama's experiment produced results ``even before he added the
chicken soup itself,'' recalled Gilbert V. Levin, the president of
Biospherics Inc., who had designed one of the other Viking
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the vapor coming off it produced a spontaneous emission
of oxygen,'' Levin said. ``It was very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The excitement was soon tempered for many of the scientists as
additional results came in. Beyond the quick release of oxygen,
Oyama's experiment gave little evidence of continuing metabolism of
nutrients by any life form. The two other experiments gave
similarly confounding results. And perhaps most important,
equipment designed to detect organic compounds in the soil found
none.
</P>
<P>
   Oyama, who had been optimistic about finding life, quickly took
the opposite view. He became convinced that the results could be
explained by the presence of oxidants, perhaps hydrogen peroxide,
in the soil. Such compounds readily release oxygen when they
encounter moisture, in some ways mimicking biological activity. The
idea that life did not exist on Mars became the prevailing view.
</P>
<P>
   Before his work on the Viking landers, Oyama, who received
undergraduate and master's degrees from Georgetown University,
worked on analyzing rocks from the Moon for signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Oyama is survived by his wife, Rose; a brother, Jiro, of
Cupertino, Calif.; two daughters, Denise Miller of Fremont, Calif.,
and Judith Olson of Chiloquin, Ore.; a son, Jerry, of Alta, Utah,
and four grandchildren.

CENSUS DEBATE FOCUSES ON CONGRESS, BUT BIG IMPACT WOULD BE LOCAL 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Nestled near Stony Brook Harbor on Long Island's
North Shore, the hamlet of St. James wears its suburban
tranquillity on a monogrammed sleeve. Its shady streets adjoin
manicured lawns. Volvos and minivans sit outside two-story homes.
Nearly all of the people are white and middle or upper class.
</P>
<P>
   The Crown Heights section of Brooklyn is 50 miles to the west
and a world apart. Brown apartment buildings rise six stories from
crowded sidewalks. Teen-age girls jump rope to boom box music on
car-lined streets. The residents are overwhelmingly black and
working class or poor.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other difference: St. James is as solidly
Republican as Crown Heights is Democratic to the bone. And that
clash has everything to do with a heated debate in Washington over
how the federal government should count people in the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, the debate is over a scientific polling technique
known as sampling. Demographers say sampling could significantly
increase population counts for poor urban areas like Crown Heights,
but often at the expense of affluent suburban communities like St.
James, which might see their counts reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats and President Clinton are demanding that
the Census Bureau augment the 2000 census with sampling to more
accurately count groups that have historically been undercounted,
like renters, black people and immigrants _ the kinds of people who
populate places like Crown Heights. Not insignificantly, those
groups tend to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the civil rights issue of the next decade,'' said Rep.
Carolyn Maloney, a Manhattan Democrat who has championed sampling.
``If you're not counted, you're not represented. And if you're not
represented, you're not getting the dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans want the 2000 census done the old-fashioned way:
a straight head count, which, they contend, is the only way to
insure accuracy. Under that method, forms are mailed to households
counted in the previous census; if the form is not returned, a
census taker visits the home in person. The system tends to
overcount people in affluent suburbs like St. James, demographers
say. Again, not insignificantly, such suburbs are the bastion of
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Republican-controlled House voted to allow
spending on the census only through March 31 as part of a tactic to
persuade the White House to drop its plans to use sampling in 2000.
The bill would enable the Republicans to block future funds for the
census. Clinton has pledged to veto any bill that tries to prevent
sampling.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, debate has often focused on the possibility that
sampling would help Democrats gain a seat or two in the House. But
demographers and political analysts say sampling's greatest impact
will be felt in state legislatures and city councils across the
country. That is because of the stark demographic and political
differences between communities like Crown Heights and St. James.

</P>
<P>
   With sampling, urban areas like Crown Heights would see their
share of a state's population increase, most demographers agree.
And since legislatures use the census to draw legislative
districts, New York and other Democrat-dominated cities would stand
to gain seats in their state legislatures, while the number of safe
Republican seats in the suburbs would decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition of the Republicans to sampling is predicated on
the belief that blocking sampling will give them a better chance of
controlling state legislatures,'' said Reynolds Farley, a
demographer and vice president of the Russell Sage Foundation, a
Manhattan center for social sciences research.
</P>
<P>
   The political consequences of sampling could be significant in
some states. In New York, for example, the Democrats already
dominate the Assembly. But the Republicans hold a five-vote
majority in the Senate. Demographers say sampling might give urban
areas one or two new Senate seats, which Democrats would be favored
to hold. And a shift of just two seats could upset the Senate's
political equilibrium by putting pressure on moderate Republicans
to vote Democratic, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big, big difference between a margin of five seats
and a margin of three,'' said Hank Morris, a Democratic political
consultant. ``It massively changes the mind-set of the Senate
majority leader, no matter how right wing or anti-urban he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The census is also used to calculate funding from a wide range
of government programs. If sampling caused the population to shift
from the suburbs to the cities, it would change the way Albany _
where regional bickering over money dominates every budget session
_ and Washington allocate money for schools, health care and other
important services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across hundreds of programs and hundreds of formulas, you can
be quite confident that it would translate into more funding for
the city,'' said David Goldin, an assistant corporation counsel for
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   A similar dynamic would be at work in other states with large
cities, particularly Illinois and California, demographers say. In
New Jersey, Essex and Hudson Counties would gain population from
sampling while Bergen and Ocean Counties would lose. And in
Connecticut, cities like Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport would
gain population under sampling while their suburbs would probably
lose.
</P>
<P>
   New York City would be one of the nation's biggest beneficiaries
of sampling in 2000, possibly gaining 250,000 or more people. But
two of the biggest potential losers are also in New York: Nassau
and Suffolk counties, which would have seen their populations
trimmed by 9,900 and 8,500, respectively, had sampling been used in
1990, when the previous census was taken.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in New York City's population could be enough to
shift control of two Assembly seats and one Senate seat to the
Democrats. The changes in Long Island's population would probably
not be enough to trigger a loss of legislative seats, but they
could force the redrawing of districts.
</P>
<P>
   National Republican Party officials have tried to drum up
opposition to sampling by circulating data showing that the
technique could help Democrats win more than 200 seats now held by
Republicans in state legislatures across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But in New York, the sampling debate has put Republican
officials in a bind.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mayor Rudolph Giuliani supports using the technique
because of its obvious benefits for the city, Gov. George Pataki
and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato have remained silent on the issue, largely
because sampling would reduce the political clout of the suburbs,
the base of power for both men, Republican officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Clinton administration's sampling plan, the Census
Bureau would try to get responses from 90 percent of the nation's
residents using the traditional head-counting method. It would then
use scientific polling techniques to estimate the number and
characteristics of the remaining 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the census missed 8.4 million people, according to
federal estimates. Though the reasons why are not entirely
understood, demographers say poverty, lack of family stability,
high mobility and mistrust of government all contribute to people's
failure to fill out census forms.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those factors are concentrated in urban populations. The
Census Bureau estimated that 14 percent of black men between the
ages of 30 and 34 were not counted in the 1990 census, the highest
undercount of any group. In general, renters are undercounted more
than homeowners, blacks more than whites, noncitizens more than
citizens and young people more than the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most undercounted census tracts in 1990 in New York
was a sliver of Crown Heights bordering Prospect Park on the west,
known as Tract 213. Had sampling been used in 1990, the tract's
population would have been 5,696, rather than 5,234, nearly a 9
percent difference.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 census told enumerators these things about that section
of Crown Heights: The population was 93 percent black. A third of
the families lived below the poverty line. One in five households
was on welfare. And 98 percent of the residents lived in rented
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   A walk through Tract 213 offers some hints as to why many
residents do not fill out their census forms. ``The government
already knows enough about me,'' said a man who shares a basement
apartment on Carroll Street with several other men, declining to
give his name. ``What more do they need?''
</P>
<P>
   But the census has also traditionally double-counted people:
about four million in 1990, according to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those were people who owned two homes and filled out
forms at both; others were college students who were counted at
campus as well as at their parents' homes. The double-counted tend
to be elderly, white and middle class or well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   St. James is the kind of affluent suburban community where
virtually every family returns its census form, and a few turn in
two. The 1990 census showed that a portion of St. James known as
Tract 1350.03 was 99 percent white. Nearly nine out of 10 families
lived in their own homes, and three out of four had two or more
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Had sampling been used in 1990, the tract's population would
have been trimmed from 4,006 to 3,956, a 1.2 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Today, St. James' congressman, state senator and assemblyman are
all Republicans. In Crown Heights, they are all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   For that simple reason, analysts say, Republican opposition to
sampling is not expected to wither away. Still, a few Republicans
are fighting for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Republicans lose clout because of sampling, it will simply
be because the count was more accurate,'' said Rep. Christopher
Shays, a Republican from Stamford, Conn. ``I can't imagine any
American opposing a more accurate count.'' &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From the morning at church to the afternoon
barbecue of ribs, chicken and shish kebabs, Reginald Washington's
entire day has led up to this singular Sunday ritual, the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's car, a blue and beige Ford Bronco with gleaming mag
wheels and tinted windows, was washed and waxed in the morning. And
before he meets up with fellow members of the Hustler Nation car
club in the afternoon to caravan to the cruise, he polishes the
tires and knocks the dust off.
</P>
<P>
   As the crown jewel of the urban social scene, the cruise draws
parents and children, blacks and Latinos, teachers and students,
and gang members who set aside their rivalries for a day to
celebrate cars in the capital of car culture.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington will not be cruising the south Los Angeles
hallmark spot, Crenshaw Boulevard, glorified by the movie ``Boyz N
the Hood'' and rap music videos. Instead, he is in the parking lot
of a social services building more than 60 blocks to the south. As
with the earlier, great cruising scenes of Hollywood, the San
Fernando Valley and East Los Angeles, the authorities are cracking
down on cruising Crenshaw, remembered by one lowriding historian as
the last cruise in Los Angeles. About the only cars cruising there
now on Sunday nights are black and white, with the word ``police''
on the side.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences held a 25th
anniversary party last month for ``American Graffiti,'' a
celebration of cruising and coming of age. But some Crenshaw
residents and business owners do not share the enthusiasm for the
movies' real-life counterpart, disliking the noise, the traffic and
the reputation that cruisers say is undeserved as a draw for crime.
</P>
<P>
   The police have been trying to rid Crenshaw of cruisers for at
least the last two years. It has become virtually impossible to
cruise because the police have been pulling over drivers on
Crenshaw on Sunday nights for the slightest infractions.
</P>
<P>
   But cruising endures, as best it can, by becoming more a park
than a cruise, though it moves to a nearby intersection after dark.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ridley-Thomas, a councilman whose district includes part of
Crenshaw Boulevard, said residents in the area ``have been
pleading'' for a stronger police presence to rid the boulevard of
cruisers, citing the mess that is made on Crenshaw and in the
surrounding residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   Once he arrives at the parking lot, Washington, 29, known to
friends as Double R, and his friend, Roderick Davis, survey the
scene: muscular rap beats boom from car stereos to compete with the
busy strains of salsa as hundreds of people pass the late afternoon
into the evening flossing _ showing off _ their cars, flirting,
catching up with friends and sipping Corona beer. With the drifting
scent of marijuana in the air, some bet on dice games and hop
competitions, seeing which cars, powered by trunks full of
batteries and hydraulic suspensions, can bounce the highest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just about cruising,'' Washington said. ``It's
California. California swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing Crenshaw disappoints Mary Sneed, a 60-year-old retired
collection agency worker better known as Moms. She has been
cruising since she was a member of the Lowriding Mamas of Compton
three decades ago. She said cruising was a positive way for young
people to channel their energy.

MAX KAPLAN, 87, SCHOLAR AND MUSICIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Wis., Colo., Ill., Mass., Calif., Nev.)  (mk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Max Kaplan, a scholarly sociologist and musician who made the
study of leisure a large part of an industrious life's work, died
on Tuesday at a hospice in La Grange, Ga. He was 87 and lived at
the Merry Oaks, his home in Georgia's rural Meriwether County.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's family said he had been suffering from multiple
myeloma, a bone marrow condition, for several years.
</P>
<P>
   His manifold interests ranged from gerontology to the sociology
of the arts. He taught, lectured and served as a consultant for
over four decades, writing or editing 27 books and some 350
articles along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's last book, ``One Life: The Free Academic,'' was
published in February by Associated University Presses. It combined
autobiography with a summation of his work and thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Other titles in print, published by Fairleigh Dickinson, suggest
their scope: ``The Arts: A Social Perspective'' (1990), ``Essays on
Leisure: Human and Policy Issues'' (1991), and ``Barbershopping:
Musical and Social Harmony'' (1993), for which he took the editing
credit.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Leisure in America: A Social Inquiry'' (Wiley, 1964)
methodically studied an astonishing postwar ``recreation
explosion'' among prospering Americans with more time on their
hands and the money to enjoy it, both as participants and as
spectators. Kaplan reported that in 1959, 33 million people went
swimming at least once, 32 million enjoyed fishing, while 32
million danced, 18 million bowled and 16 million hunted.
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished violinist, Kaplan often wrote about music
education. He told the Music Educators National Conference in 1967
that sociologists could help music teachers by examining the
process by which new audiences, especially among the poor, might be
introduced to the arts and by studying the schools' music programs
in relation to community needs.
</P>
<P>
   He addressed the subject at greater length in a book, ``National
Guild of Community Schools of Music: Observations and
Recommendations.'' Published by the guild in 1966, it too remains
in print.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan played chamber music and soloed with orchestras, served
as concert master and was a co-founder of the Greater Boston Youth
Symphony Orchestra, which played at the White House in 1963 at the
request of President and Mrs. Kennedy. As a resident of Tampa,
Fla., he was a member of the Gulf Coast Philharmonic and more
recently sat on the board of the La Grange Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Max Kaplan was born in Milwaukee and graduated from Milwaukee
State Teachers College (now the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee)
in 1933. He received a master's in music from the University of
Colorado in 1941, and master's and doctoral degrees in sociology
from the University of Illinois in 1948 and 1951. He then taught at
the university until 1957.
</P>
<P>
   His many other academic associations included Boston University
School of Fine and Applied Arts and the University of South
Florida. There he founded and directed its Institute for Studies of
Leisure.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Academy of Leisure and the World Leisure and
Recreation Association, Kaplan lectured and consulted across the
country, Europe and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan is survived by his wife, Barbara Connally Kaplan; two
daughters from a previous marriage, Marcia Rudin of Manhattan and
Theresa Abrahams of Tampa; a brother, Frank, of Los Angeles; a
stepdaughter, Charlotte Stock, of Reno, Nev.; a stepson, Philip
Rogers of Atlanta; seven grandchildren, and three
great-grandchildren. An earlier marriage, to Elizabeth Neu Abrams
of Tampa, ended in divorce.

POWER TO THE PEOPLE _ FOR LESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, New York state began deregulating the state's
electric power industry, with the idea that competition would lower
prices and the plan that every consumer be able to buy electricity
on the open market by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Now the New York State Energy Research and Development
Authority, a state-chartered nonprofit organization, has joined
forces with EIS Inc., a Manhattan energy consulting company, and
the West Side Heights HDFC Council, a nonprofit organization of
low- and moderate-income Housing Development Fund Corp. co-ops, to
demonstrate to unit owners and boards the benefits of buying energy
at bulk rates.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the program say that buying in bulk should
generate immediate savings of 15 to 25 percent on individual
electric bills and even more when competition heats up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the midst of a sea-change in the way consumers will
buy their electricity,'' said Rick Gerardi, program director of the
Residential Energy Affordability Program for the Energy Research
and Development Authority. ``Eventually, people in New York will be
able to choose their power company the same way they now choose
their long-distance carrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerardi said that in September 1997, the state's Public Service
Commission approved a plan in which Consolidated Edison, the power
company that produces virtually all of New York City's electrical
power supply, would make it possible, in the plan's first phase,
for about 63,000 of its customers to purchase power from sources
other than Con Ed. (More customers will be added in future phases.
Similar plans apply in the rest of the state.)
</P>
<P>
   Those sources, known in the industry as energy service
companies, can then provide electrical energy to consumers at
competitive rates. Under the agreement between the state and the
utility company, Con Edison continues to provide transmission and
billing services for customers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A problem with the plan, however, Gerardi said, is that before
an energy service company will offer truly competitive rates to
consumers, the consumers must provide it with an incentive to do
so. And the best incentive is the ability of a customer to buy lots
of power. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what we're doing is helping lower- and
moderate-income people band together in a way that will increase
their power in the market,'' said Gary Davidson, a spokesman for
the Energy Research and Development Authority. ``A vast majority of
residential power customers are individual unit owners in small and
medium-sized buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to rectify that problem, Davidson said, is to install a
central meter to turn individual customers into one large,
commercial-sized customer. ``That larger customer will then be more
attractive to power providers,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said the authority had awarded a contract to EIS Inc.
to install master meters in about 15 New York City HDFC co-ops that
are part of a pilot project to show other boards and unit owners
how much money can be saved at relatively little expense.
</P>
<P>
   EIS president Lewis Kwit said his company would be installing
master meters in front of the existing meters in the pilot
buildings. That means that at the end of each month, instead of
having 10, 20 or 50 individual electric bills sent by Con Ed to
unit owners, the co-op corporation will receive one bill for all
the power supplied to the building. Individual apartment usage will
be measured by the existing Con Edison meters and will be billed
internally. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Just putting in the master meter itself should take 15 to 25
percent off the co-op's monthly bill,'' Kwit said, adding that the
reason for the immediate savings results from the fact that power
consumption would be billed at a lower bulk rate rather than at
higher individual rates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those immediate savings, Kwit said, buildings
that install a master meter also increase their bargaining power _
a benefit that will be further enhanced if several buildings band
together to buy power in even greater bulk than one building could
buy on its own. ``We'll be meeting with different energy service
companies to see who will give us the best deal,'' Kwit said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, Kwit said, the cost of installing a master
meter in a building can range from $5,000 to $12,000. (Buildings
participating in the pilot program receive subsidies of $3,000 from
the authority.) And while Con Edison is allowing their existing
meters to remain in pilot program buildings, those meters will at
some point be replaced by more sophisticated models purchased by
the co-ops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that by using more sophisticated meters internally,
we will be able to bring down the cost of energy even more,'' he
said, explaining that newer meters monitor not only the amount of
energy used but also individual usage patterns. That is important,
Kwit said, because knowing those patterns makes it possible to
adjust them to minimize peak power demands, typically the most
expensive component of bulk-rate electric bills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Individual residential customers, he said, are billed at a flat
rate of about .18 cents per kilowatt hour. Master-metered buildings
pay .0455 cents per kilowatt hour, plus an extra charge for
``demand.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That charge for demand, Kwit said, ranges between $23 and $29
per kilowatt of power used during the half hour of highest usage
each month. The higher billing rate for that single half hour, he
said, is based on the premise that the power supplier must have
available at least that amount of energy for that customer at all
times.
</P>
<P>
   When the costs associated with demand are added to the
kilowatt-hour charges for master-metered customers, Kwit said, the
total cost averages about .12 cents per kilowatt hour. And that can
be reduced even further, he said, if peak power demands can be
lowered by usage monitoring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jordi Reyes-Montblanc, chairman of the HDFC Coalition, an
advocacy organization of HDFC co-ops, said that what is
particularly attractive about the pilot project, and electric
deregulation in general, is that those who stand to benefit the
most are those who need it the most. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we in New York City pay the among the highest
electric rates in the country,'' Reyes-Montblanc said, adding that
the highest ratepayers of all are individual homeowners and unit
owners like those in the 1,100 or so HDFC co-ops throughout the
city. ``This project will reduce these costs where it is most
needed,'' he said.

COLUMN: FRUSTRATION IN NEW BRUNSWICK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAWSONVILLE, New Brunswick _ The afternoon darkened as
thunderheads moved in from the west, lightning crackled, a sudden
stiff breeze swept up the steep valley of the Upsalquitch River and
in a matter of minutes I was fishing in torrents of rain, rain so
heavy that it was difficult to cast a long line.
</P>
<P>
   Neither my guide, Gerry Thomas, nor I made any suggestion about
going ashore to huddle under a tarp or to return to Two Brooks
camp. We were engaged in a final effort to catch an Atlantic
salmon, a goal that had eluded us for four days.
</P>
<P>
   There were salmon in our stretch of the river, although not as
many as the previous week. Five days before our group _ the others
were Joan Wulff, Marian Heiskell, Kathryn Fuller, Peter Maas and
our hosts, Joseph Cullman III and his wife, Joan _ had landed at
the Charlo airport in New Brunswick. We were greeted by Joe's
nephew, Edgar Cullman Jr., and his group, who had just come from
several days of superb salmon angling at Two Brooks camp on the
Upsalquitch. When we arrived, both the Restigouche and the
Upsalquitch, its tributary, had risen three feet. In spite of the
high water, we all fished from Joe Cullman's Runnymeade Lodge on
the Restigouche that night.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing a canoe with Joe, Kathryn Fuller had just begun to cast
when a grilse seized her offering, cavorted about and escaped. (A
grilse is a salmon that returns to its natal stream after only one
year at sea. The average size is about four pounds.) Joe then
caught a grilse and lost two other fish. The rest of us did
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   On the flight to New Brunswick, I had told Joe Cullman that I
intended to release all the fish I caught. This was a big
commitment for one who has always regarded the angling experience
as incomplete without bringing home a fish for the table. To angle
solely for the pleasure of outwitting one's prey has always seemed
to me to be effete, leaving no room for a token food-gathering
ritual.
</P>
<P>
   I went to be with good friends and to once again visit the
Upsalquitch, an intimate river of infinite charm. Lacking humility,
it never occurred to me that I might fail to release fish because I
could not catch them. My decision had been prompted by the parlous
state of North American stocks of the species, which are at their
lowest, so low that all commercial netting of salmon has been
halted and the recreational fishing limits severely curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   In New Brunswick, all adult salmon must be released; the daily
limit is one grilse, and one must stop fishing after a grilse has
been killed. One must also stop after two fish, grilse or salmon,
or both, have been set free.
</P>
<P>
   As the days went by _ I spent most of them at Two Brooks _ a
pattern began to develop. Fishing pools that I had flogged only a
few hours before with no success, the other members of the group
consistently caught grilse or salmon. When this happened with Joan
Wulff I was not distressed. An accomplished salmon fisher, former
champion fly-caster and widow of the legendary Lee Wulff, she
possessed, I knew, more salmon fishing savvy than I.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Maas was another matter. Although he fishes with a fly rod
infrequently, he has a knack for encountering salmon that are
willing to take. Maas caught a salmon and a grilse our first day at
Two Brooks, and when I returned the following evening his canoe was
already at the dock. Climbing the steep steps to the camp, I peered
inside, beheld Peter sitting at the writing desk in the cavernous
main room, and was smitten with envy. On the desk is the camp's
angling log in which guests record their catches. Peter, I knew,
had gone with the camp's manager, Lee Marshall, to the very spot
where I had raised a fish that morning.
</P>
<P>
   An author with an investigative bent, Maas could have been
checking the log for the catches of others in previous weeks, but
there was an air of triumph about him. He was logging in a
12-pounder that he had taken on a Black Dose.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly 20 years of fishing at Two Brooks and Runnymeade, I
had never failed to bring salmon home. Now, I was unable to catch
one in order to let it go.
</P>
<P>
   On one of my Two Brooks mornings, Joe Cullman and I went out in
the same canoe with Gerry. Joe refused to fish. ``We've got to get
you a salmon,'' he said. ``I'm just an observer.'' On that
occasion, I rose and pricked a fish that would not rise again.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Kathryn Fuller joined Gerry and me. We went to
the lower end of the Two Brooks waters at Rock Pool where Joan
Wulff had taken two grilse the evening before. I predicted to
Kathryn that we would be successful, but failed to take into
consideration the pall of failure that came with me.
</P>
<P>
   We raised nothing and saw one fish, a grilse that disdainfully
broke water three feet from the canoe. Kathryn didn't seem to mind.
As president of the World Wildlife Fund, she has little time for
fishing and was happy for the chance to sharpen her fly-casting
skills. She returned to Runnymeade and, free of my influence,
promptly caught a 17-pounder, the largest salmon taken by anyone on
our trip.
</P>
<P>
   On our last evening together after the tempest abated, Gerry and
I visited most of the Two Brooks pools. When it became too dark to
see well enough to change flies we headed back to camp through
swirling skeins of mist having failed to raise or see a single
salmon.
</P>
<P>
   I later learned that Bill Taylor, president of the Atlantic
Salmon Federation, caught a grilse on his second cast at Two Brooks
the following morning and his wife, Suzanne, caught a salmon and a
grilse in her first half-hour of fishing.

THE ART OF MAKING A HOUSE APPEAR SELLABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORINDA, Calif. _ It was obvious that the shag carpeting had to
go if the luxury hillside home was to sell for the maximum price
possible. But probably few people would have thought to replace the
dark-colored bedspreads with lighter-colored linens, hide a
shelf-full of liquor bottles and remove personal photographs from
the family-room wall.
</P>
<P>
   These were just some of the ideas that Jenifer Brunk and her
partner, Gray Hynes, noted while touring a very-1960s-era home that
they were preparing for resale after its owner, an elderly widow,
had died. In their experience, many potential home buyers like
luminous bedrooms, look poorly upon alcohol and are distracted by
personal photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the considerations of professional stagers like Ms.
Brunk and Ms. Hynes, whose business, Improve to Move, based in this
wealthy community 25 miles east of San Francisco, is to decorate
houses that are about to be offered for sale. Hired to accentuate a
home's value, stagers often violate traditional interior-design
rules to emphasize the positives of a house in a style that keeps
potential buyers focused on the space and not the furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our work cut out for us,'' said Ms. Brunk, after
walking through the house and deciding to repaint, remove dated
wallpaper and replace unattractive furniture with rented pieces.
``If you leave the house like this, your asking price is going to
be less and the time on the market is going to be more.''
</P>
<P>
   Staging exists in several cities around the country such as
Washington, Los Angeles Miami and some New York City suburbs, Here,
the service is generally performed in upper-middle-class and
wealthy neighborhoods where homes sell for at least $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of staging to a homeowner varies depending on the
amount of work. A consultation, in which a stager walks through a
home and offers advice, can cost as little as $200, while hiring a
stager to manage a miniature remodeling and furniture overhaul can
exceed $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lonna Trosclair, who owns a hillside home in Oakland, hired a
stager earlier this year partly because her house, with four
bedrooms, three baths and a basement apartment, was far larger than
those of her neighbors. Potential buyers who compared the price of
her ranch to others in the area, she worried, might mistakenly
believe they were getting a bad deal. In the end, the stager put
dishes and a pasta-sauce bottle on the basement unit's kitchen
table so that the apartment would have a lived-in look. In the
living room, the stager thinned out the furniture, installed rented
neutral-colored chairs that would appeal to a broad public, and
placed the couch facing the window to emphasize the glorious view
of the city and San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let her put away furnishings that were my favorites,'' said
Ms. Trosclair, whose home sold after 10 days on the market for the
full asking price of $670,000. ``You just have to have faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, informing a homeowner that some of the decor should
be removed requires diplomacy. If done incorrectly, some homeowners
can feel insulted by the implication that they have bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   Some furnishings that are almost always removed include stuffed
animal heads, guns and art with nudity that some potential buyers
may find offensive. Stagers also recommend that homeowners put away
personal possessions like family photographs and portrait paintings
that may draw attention from the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm talking to a client, I don't say `Get rid of all this
clutter,' '' said Stephanie Biorn, a stager from Palo Alto.
``That's too harsh. What I tell my clients is that you live in a
home much differently than how you should sell it. So we move out a
lot of the furniture and provide a neutral background to show off
the space.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also cases when stagers conceal the negative. For
example, Ms. Brunk and Ms. Hynes suggested putting away a portable
microwave in the house that they toured recently because it would
remind potential buyers that the kitchen did not have a built-in
one.
</P>
<P>
   In another house that they had already staged, the two women had
placed a potted plant in front of a patched hole in the wall that
had yet to be painted.
</P>
<P>
   Stagers also frequently decorate empty houses _ usually just the
public areas and master bedroom _ when the owners have moved out.
The same is usually true when they decorate a model home for a
developer. The theory is that most potential buyers have
difficultly imagining their possessions in an empty room.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Traditionally, real estate agents have been the ones who offered
clients basic advice about decorating a house for sale. Now, some
real estate agents refer their clients to stagers instead for more
sophisticated evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is the best money a seller can spend,'' said Malin
Giddings, a real estate broker at Tri Coldwell Banker in San
Francisco who specializes in luxury homes. ``If a homeowner is
going to retire and this is their last big sale, then I make a very
strong presentation for them to use a stager.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Giddings said that most homes could use at least a little
staging before going on the market, even those originally decorated
by an interior designer. She believes so much in the benefits of
staging that she said ``it is a crime'' for real estate agents not
to inform clients about seeking professional decoration advice.
</P>
<P>
   How much impact staging can have on the sale of a home is
difficult to determine. Obviously a clean, attractive house that
does not require repairs is going to impress potential buyers more
than one with chipped paint and grime.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Trosclair, who sold her home in Oakland, was generally
positive about hiring a stager and said she would do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know that it is worth it,'' she said. ``But the
results were certainly good.''
</P>
<P>
   If a staged house sells quickly, homeowners must still pay the
entire term of a furniture-rental contract, typically carrying a
minimum two-month term.
</P>
<P>
   Many stagers caution homeowners against having unrealistic
expectations of enrichment if they choose to stage their house.
Moreover, homeowners are not guaranteed a dollar-for-dollar return
on their investment in staging.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have this misconception that if you stage a home well
it will give you $100,000 more,'' said Carla Karsant, a stager from
Oakland. ``There are a lot of things that have to come together to
make staging a home successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some staged houses do not sell at all. In such cases,
stagers typically lay the blame on factors that are outside their
control. For example, one stager told of a hillside home that did
not sell because of building-code problems and a multi-level design
that required walking up a lot of stairs. Another stager told of a
house with a horse stable that was too customized to appeal to a
broad public.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the fundamental problem of price, said Claudia
Ellinghaus, owner of Escrow Garden and Staging in Oakland. No
matter how attractive a home looks, she said, ``if it is grossly
overpriced, staging isn't going to do a thing.''

WIDOW WHOSE HUSBAND DIED AMID SERIES OF PATIENT DEATHS AWARDED
$450,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. _ A widow was awarded $450,000 Friday by a federal
judge who said officials at a Columbia hospital failed to ensure
her husband's safety amid a series of mysterious patient deaths.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Nanette K. Laughrey ruled officials at
Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital were negligent in the 1992 death
of Elzie Havrum.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Helen, filed the wrongful death lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Havrum and several family members in the courtroom wept
for several minutes after Laughrey announced her ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just kind of in shock,'' son Gary Havrum of Fulton said
in a telephone interview later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just reflecting on this situation,'' he said. ``It's
just been a very stressful period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughrey said hospital officials didn't take adequate
precautions even though staff members noticed a pattern of
unexplained deaths in spring 1992 in Ward Four East, especially
when nurse Richard A. Williams was on duty. Havrum died in the same
ward while Williams was working.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum, given what was at stake, the VA was negligent,''
Laughrey said from the bench after a two-week trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials could have taken Williams off the night
shift, provided another employee to work with him or taken other
steps in reaction to the mysterious pattern of patient deaths, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first and foremost concern should be patient care, not
Richard Williams,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Laughrey said a ``preponderance of the evidence'' in the civil
lawsuit made her believe Williams was responsible for Havrum's
death.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the trial's outcome Friday, Williams said by
telephone from St. Louis, ``I have no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who now lives in the St. Louis area, told a reporter
in the past that he ``didn't become a nurse to mercy kill or to
determine when someone would die.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary L. Campbell, director of the hospital, said in a prepared
statement that hospital officials hoped the ruling ``will be able
to bring closure to this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Elzie Havrum died at 66 after being admitted for shortness of
breath.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Havrum said that although she first thought her husband
died of natural causes, by fall 1992 she had heard reports of a
high rate of deaths in Ward Four East.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, the FBI investigated the rash of deaths at the
veterans hospital. Of the 55 persons who died between March and
August 1992, 45 died while Williams was on duty. A doctor's
analysis had shown that patients were 10 times more likely to die
under Williams' care.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year, the FBI said it could not prove a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Havrum's case marked the first time that any of the deaths at
the veterans hospital have been aired in a courtroom. But no one
would speculate Friday on whether her case would prompt more civil
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hill, U.S. attorney for the Western District of
Missouri, said no decision has been made on whether government
attorneys will appeal the ruling. Hill said he thought government
attorneys showed Williams was not responsible for Havrum's death
and that Havrum did not die by a codeine overdose, as Helen Havrum
alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Laughrey's comments, the federal statute of limitations
prevents a new federal look at any role Williams might have had in
the deaths, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   And it's unlikely the case will prompt criminal charges. Boone
County Prosecutor Kevin Crane said Friday that he has no plans for
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal cases require more stringent proof than civil cases.
</P>
<P>
   Laughrey's conclusion that Williams appeared responsible for
Havrum's death ``would not equip me with any more evidence in a
criminal case than I had before she made the decision,'' Crane
said.
</P>
<P>
   During closing arguments, attorneys representing the hospital
disputed Havrum's claim that her husband died from a codeine
overdose. James C. Bohling, an assistant U.S. attorney, said that
lawyers for Havrum failed to prove that codeine killed her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``This again is speculation,'' Bohling said. ``Speculation is
not evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials carefully reviewed patient deaths and
``nothing was picked up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those individual cases were not considered to be remarkable,''
Bohling said. ``Each of those was considered by a physician to be a
reasonable death.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think it is clear from the evidence that this
hospital did its job.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Kurtz of Kansas City, Havrum's chief attorney, said FBI
officials concluded in a report that ``concentrations of codeine
found were at the lower end of the fatal range.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughrey said she believes Havrum had more codeine in his body
than from just taking a few Tylenol 3 tablets.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz also dismissed government arguments that hospital
officials imposed rigorous quality controls over hospital
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murderers kind of deviate from standard procedures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laughrey ruled in favor of the government on Havrum's claims of
medical malpractice, saying they were filed too late and were not
proven.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Christensen, a doctor at the veterans hospital who called
public attention to the series of deaths, said he was pleased with
the trial's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my mind the only right answer is to do exactly what she
did,'' he said.

MISSOURI COUPLE REMEMBER SON WHO DIED IN KENYAN BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: When Bonnie Hobson learned early Friday that a
terrorist bomb half a world away had killed her only child, she
couldn't help but think back to the note.
</P>
<P>
   It arrived at Hobson's home in Lamar in southwest Missouri no
more than a week ago by electronic mail. Her son, Sgt. Kenneth R.
Hobson II, 27, had been stationed in Nairobi, Kenya, since early
April. The note was happy, joyous. And it left her without worries
for his well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he was a career soldier with the Army, and that can always
mean danger. He'd been in the Persian Gulf War as an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   But he'd joined intending to get a college degree and retire in
20 years. These days he was the equivalent of an office manager at
the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. His duties were to understand the
labyrinthine world of military forms, to know immediately which
forms went with which occasions. He filed and sorted and kept the
office running.
</P>
<P>
   It was a safe job and a good fit for him, his mother thought.
Sgt. Hobson was not at all the kind who lived for danger, who would
take silly risks.
</P>
<P>
   He was a thinker.
</P>
<P>
   In high school in Nevada, Mo., when other boys played football
and basketball, he lived to play tennis and to debate issues. Above
all, he loved to pick a topic and argue it.
</P>
<P>
   ``His favorite debate was always the one he had going,'' Bonnie
Hobson recalled Friday afternoon. ``He was happiest when he had a
good argument going. He was a real brain child.''
</P>
<P>
   His high school speech teacher, Tim Gore, remembered him as a
mature, thoughtful young man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good student,'' he recalled. ``He'd stand his ground
when making a point, but he was never one to cause trouble. He was
one to mull over a topic, to analyze it and think hard before
reaching a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, his mother remembered his artwork, much of which is
still around the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he could pick anything he wanted and draw it,'' she said.
``He was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, it was that intellectual curiosity that convinced him
to join the Army after graduating from high school in 1989. He
wanted to travel, to see the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they finally called him and told him where he could go,
they offered him three places,'' she recalled. ``I can't even
remember the other two, but he said he wouldn't consider them, that
the other two were not places to raise a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenya wasn't perfect, but he was excited about it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And when she took her last look at him, an electronic image he'd
sent with his note recently, he still looked happy.
</P>
<P>
   The contents of the note were simple. During some a recent time
off, he, his wife, Deborah, and their toddler daughter, Megan, went
on a walking safari in the Kenyan countryside. The highlight was
the wildlife, especially seeing honest-to-goodness giraffes. The
electronic photograph showed the family and the giraffes.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Hobson said it was hard to believe a life that seemed to
be going so well could be over so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   She said she didn't know what came next. When will his widow and
child arrive back in the United States? When will his remains be
sent back? What she should do about funeral arrangements?
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Kenneth Hobson Sr., told The Associated Press he
was angry about his son's death, about the fact that terrorists
were able to get to another American embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to keep going on constantly,'' he said.
``They're not going to stop this.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that eventually his son's ashes would be scattered
over the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Big Sur, where he met
Deborah.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was adamant about that,'' his father said. ``If anything
happened to him, that's what he wanted.''

   LEAWOOD, Kan. _ Fifteen years ago few people talked publicly
about breast cancer. After all, that would have forced them to say
the word ``breast,'' and that was just too embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   Even eight years ago, when Christine Brunswick was diagnosed
with the disease, attitudes hadn't changed much.
</P>
<P>
   Women were dying, but no one seemed to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Brunswick was aghast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drugs I received were the same ones women had received 15
years earlier,'' said Brunswick, now vice president of the National
Breast Cancer Coalition in Washington. ``I said, `Wait a minute. We
haven't gotten any further than that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, progress is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Federal funding to fight breast cancer has increased 600 percent
since 1991, when the coalition formed and began demanding more
money from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And the number of people participating in the National Race for
the Cure Series _ a private fund-raiser _ has increased almost
tenfold this decade, to about 500,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes about breast cancer also have turned around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back five or even 10 and certainly 15 years ago, you
couldn't talk about it to anyone,'' said Mary Putnam, chairwoman of
Kansas City's fifth annual Race for the Cure, which was held Aug. 9
in Leawood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a female disease...that you had to keep in the
closet. Now you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the early leaders in the cause was Nancy Goodman Brinker.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Brinker started the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer
Foundation in Dallas in memory of her older sister. Komen died in
1980 at age 33, leaving a husband and two children in Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week from Dallas, Brinker recalled a
conversation with her sister a month before she died.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked at me one night and said, `Isn't this awful?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `Yes.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `When I get better, I want you to help me do
something so other women and their families don't have to go
through this.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Brinker said, she decided to spend the rest of
her life working toward a cure.
</P>
<P>
   The breast is the leading cancer site among American women, and
breast cancer is second only to lung cancer in cancer deaths. It is
the leading cause of death for women ages 35 to 54. About 44,000
women and 300 men are dying each year of the disease, a number that
has dipped slightly this decade because of early detection.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 years that the U.S. was fighting the Vietnam War,
58,000 men and women died in the fighting. In the same period,
breast cancer killed 330,000 women, according to information from
the Komen Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Brinker put her foundation together with $200 in grocery money
and a shoe box full of names of people to contact for
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would go to corporations to raise money, and they would
blush,'' she said. ``It was a time when you realized, `My gosh, we
can't even talk about this.' Literally, people would not be
responsive.''
</P>
<P>
   Brinker came up with the idea for the Race for the Cure to
benefit her foundation. The first 5-kilometer, or 3.1-mile,
walk-run took place in Dallas in 1983 with 800 participants. This
year the combination 5-K race and 1-mile walk-run is being held in
86 cities; 500,000 participants are expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone told me it (the race) was crazy, that it wouldn't
work,'' Brinker said. ``But I thought it would be good to do a
sporting event so survivors could bond and see there is hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The race brought in $23 million in 1996, the latest year for
which figures are available. Seventy-five percent of the revenue
raised stays in the cities in which the races are held; the rest
goes to the foundation for research and other advances.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which has raised more than $100 million since it
was formed, is growing at an amazing rate, Brinker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Komen Foundation, as well as grass-roots organizations such
as the National Breast Cancer Coalition, gave the breast cancer
movement its start, said Pamela Dougherty, legislative
representative for the American Cancer Society's governmental
relations office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition got the attention of Congress, Dougherty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a group of women not willing to be pushed or kept in
the closet any longer,'' Brunswick said. ``We were out there
demanding more money for breast cancer research, and that had never
been done before. Nobody had actually gone up to the U.S. Congress
and sat in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we put a face to the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo., has had its own triumphs with the Race for the
Cure, which began here in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really more successful than we ever expected it to be
right out of the chute,'' said Paula Porsch, one of three women who
got the race off the ground. ``It's phenomenal, the numbers they
are expecting this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say they are ready to handle many more participants
than the 5,600 they had last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal had been 7,500, but given the way the race has been
exploding around the country, we're planning for 9,000,'' Putnam
said. The number of participants in the June race in Washington,
for instance, increased 44 percent, statistics from the Komen
Foundation show.
</P>
<P>
   The races are growing because of people like Sharon Snowden of
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third year the 34-year-old breast cancer survivor
will participate. Snowden has beaten breast cancer twice, she said,
and wants to do what she can to make others aware of the importance
of early detection.
</P>
<P>
   She'll be at the finish line, timing the racers who care about
how fast they complete the race.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 of this year's participants are expected to be
survivors, visible in pink T-shirts and pink visors. Some of them,
such as Donna Valponi Brookhart, are in the midst of battling their
disease now. MORE
</P>
<P>
   LEAWOOD, Kan. _ their disease now.
</P>
<P>
   Brookhart is chairwoman of the race's survivors committee. She
took the post in 1997, after she had beaten the disease once. This
spring her breast cancer recurred. She had a mastectomy June 4 and
started chemotherapy July 10. Last weekend she attended Kansas
City's first breast cancer survivors luncheon, which she helped
organize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing great,'' Brookhart said. ``I think it's important
for survivors to go to the race, to go to the luncheon and take
advantage of these opportunities so we can celebrate life together.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of messages in our society that say if
you have cancer, you can't survive.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not true, she said, and survivors need to keep reminding
one another of that.
</P>
<P>
   When breast cancer is confined to the breast, the five-year
survival rate is more than 95 percent. The rate drops
significantly, though, when the cancer spreads beyond the breast.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs being developed now to fight breast cancer are
encouraging, those in the fight said, but a cure still seems far
away. That's why they keep talking about early detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of us, even though we know we should be doing monthly
self-breast exams, don't do them,'' Putnam said. ``And that is the
key.''

ARGUMENTS FOR TAX RELIEF ARE GROWING STRONGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The best arguments for a tax cut are decelerating U.S.
growth, stock market uncertainty and global economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the catalyst for tax-cut initiatives has been the
promise of substantial federal budget surpluses, tax relief would
be justified in any event.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Gross Domestic Product estimate showed the annual
rate of economic growth plunging from 5.5 percent in the first
quarter to 1.4 percent during the April-June period. Some
economists have begun to warn that a recession is possible in the
second half of the year, with a recession defined as two
consecutive quarters of GDP shrinkage.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market began to anticipate the growth slowdown
signaled by the preliminary second-quarter GDP report after topping
out at record levels July 17. Since then the stock market has been
poleaxed by earnings disappointments, recession talk and cautionary
congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   While the stock market's correction isn't an altogether bad
thing and has been expected and predicted, fiscal stimulus for the
economy in the form of a tax cut is more than justified. This holds
despite Greenspan's misgivings about healthy growth's potential for
reigniting an inflationary surge.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Schuyler, senior economist at the Institute for Research
on the Economics of Taxation, suggests that using the surplus to
finance a tax cut is preferable to paying down the national debt. A
properly designed tax cut, he said in a recent ``Congressional
Advisory,'' could both extend and rejuvenate the current economic
expansion and boost individual incomes while encouraging savings
and investment.
</P>
<P>
   The key, he indicated, is getting the surplus back into the
hands of individuals who will use the money to consume and save.
Paying down the debt might achieve the same result, but the
probability of this happening is not nearly as certain if
Washington keeps control of the money.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol Hill focus is on House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Budget
Chairman John Kasich and Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, who
are the main players. The numbers being bandied about are huge in
absolute terms, but not nearly as impressive when considered as a
percentage of total federal revenue over a decade of projected
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent hundreds of billions worth of proposed tax cuts
could extend the economic expansion, it would be healthy not only
for Americans but also for the rest of the world. Over the next few
years, most of the world's economic fortunes will be heavily
dependent on U.S. prosperity. The Asian crisis won't begin to
improve until Japan works out at least some of its financial system
problems, which will be at least a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the world, next year's introduction of
Europe's common currency, the euro, promises a prolonged period of
adjustment that can be expected to slow growth on the continent.
This also will have the effect of making a continued strong U.S.
economy critical to Europe getting through its monetary system
changes with a minimum of turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is also the specter of the economic drag some
analysts say will result from computer glitches when 2000 arrives.
How severe the so-called Y2K problem will be is anybody's guess,
but it almost certainly will create some temporary interruptions in
the flow of both U.S. and global commerce.

few weeks ago, a Cuban doctor-turned-defector living in Costa Rica
claimed that Castro suffers from a fatal brain disorder. There was
a barrage of similar ill-health rumors last summer, some even
announcing Castro's death. But, if anything, Castro appears more
robust than ever. He appears to be traveling more these days than
at any time in his 39 years in power. He continues his commitment
to communism, even as he's been striking a conciliatory tone
towards President Clinton. (Emling, Cox News Service).

an ecological sellout. We've been going through contracts and

<P>
   He celebrated his 97th birthday on Aug. 6, but George Sands is
still a fixture at Metropolitan Golf Association events. Sands is
the oldest golf official in the United States _ and probably the
world. Sunday, he will attend the final of the Metropolitan Amateur
at Quaker Ridge in Scarsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   And he worked the Ike Championship last month at Wykagyl Country
Club, serving as an observer in the last group of the last round
and was involved in the presentations afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Sands' name and his enormous contribution to golf at the local
and national level are well-known in the area, but his name is
synonymous with the Ike.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat at Wykagyl's veranda overlooking the last green during
the two-day tournament, just about every player stopped by to shake
hands with him.
</P>
<P>
   Sands is an honorary chairman of the Ike, the stroke-play
championship of the metropolitan association. Sands and Dana Mosley
revived the tournament nearly two decades ago after its prominence
waned. The Ike was started in 1953 as a tribute to the country's
most well-known amateur golfer at the time, President Dwight D.
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Sands, fixing his blue eyes on faces, still greets everyone by
name, and he has a story to tell for just about everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he recalled in detail the 1941 club championship he
lost at the North Shore Country Club, where he has been a member
for 78 years.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's Ike, with his 88-year-old wife, Marjorie, at his
side, Sands rode a golf cart around the Wykagyl layout, observing
Michael Deo of Oak Hill and D.J. Lewin of Ardsley. The only
accommodation Sands has made to the strokes is to give up his pipe,
which was his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Sands could be called a trademark of the MGA. He rarely misses
an area golf tournament even though he and his wife, residents of
the East Side of Manhattan, cannot drive. Former MGA president John
Baldwin usually drives the couple to local events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being around the golf course,'' Sands said. ``The last
time I played was last year, but I love being around the course and
working for golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Sands has served on every committee of the MGA and was its
president in 1975. He has also served on several committees for the
U.S. Golf Association, but his pride and joy, along with the Ike,
is the Long Island Caddie Scholarship Fund, which he founded.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony last Tuesday night, he presented this year's 23
scholarship recipients with $1,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put more than 450 players through college, including
more than a dozen girls,'' Sands said about the fund. ``Our first
recipient is the president now. I get great deal of satisfaction
from the scholarship fund.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Sea World has given up.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard has all but given up.
</P>
<P>
   The marine biologists have given up.
</P>
<P>
   The orphaned gray whale, J.J., has fallen off nearly everyone's
radar since she ditched her tracking transmitters within a week of
her March release.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone, that is, except a small legion of whale
watchers sailing up and down the California coast looking for the
mischievous whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep a close eye out for her _ we have pictures up in the
boats and we would assume J.J. would be a very friendly whale,''
said Don Hedden, better known as Captain Don. ``If we ever saw her,
we'd shut down the boat and see if she'd come over to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Don runs daily excursions to the Channel Islands from
Santa Barbara's Stearns Wharf in search of J.J. and other whales.
</P>
<P>
   J.J. gained fame when she became stranded about 1 1/2 years ago
near Venice Beach but was rescued and nursed back to health at Sea
World. In March, she was released into the Pacific Ocean off San
Diego Bay.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, J.J. grabbed daily headlines and potential
sightings were posted on a J.J. Web site on the Internet. J.J.'s
site hasn't been updated since April 3 and Sea World officials are
at a loss to recall when they last heard news of the whale they
miraculously nursed back to health last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get e-mail, I get phone calls, I get letters just about
every day,'' said Keith Yip, Sea World's general curator who
oversaw J.J.'s recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really have no idea where she is _ none of the sightings
have ever been confirmed and it's a big, big ocean out there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not stopping people like George and Veronica Erter, who
are spending their summer aboard different whale watching vessels
along the Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a needle in a haystack _ that's for sure,'' said
Veronica. ``We love looking at all the marine mammals and think
that we may just get a glimpse of J.J.''
</P>
<P>
   The Erters, both high school teachers in Salem, Ore., share the
passion for J.J. ``My wife and I have this intense fascination with
the whale,'' George Erter said.
</P>
<P>
   Sightings of mammoth blue whales have been a nice diversion for
the Erters, but for them, J.J. is the primary focus of the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' George Erter said, with a smile. ``It may
just happen.''

EARTH'S LARGEST MAMMELS ENJOY SUMMER OFF CALIFORNIA COAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BROOKE OLSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It has the heart the size of a Volkswagen Bug. Its
tongue is heavier than an African elephant.
</P>
<P>
   It's the largest animal on Earth _ and it resides just off the
coast of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The blue whale's immense presence along California's Channel
Islands has drawn the attention of researchers and whale
enthusiasts. Thought to feed on the krill, little shrimp-like
creatures that line the islands, the whale population has exploded
in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, Channel Island boaters can see as many as 20
blue whales feeding in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely getting a lot more sightings of these whales
in the last few years,'' said Joe Cordaro, southwest region
coordinator of National Marine Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't know why these whales are hanging out there _ it
appears that it's a popular feeding area for them,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Although their presence puzzles researchers, the appearance of
these great cetaceans dazzles boaters.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Tuesday morning, passengers crowded the front of the
whale watching boat Rachel G.
</P>
<P>
   The engines on the 90-foot long boat had been cut to neutral and
the passengers leaned over the rail in silence, straining to catch
a glimpse of the blue whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There _ over there!'' shouted one passenger, pointing off in
the distance.
</P>
<P>
   A tall, straight stream of air was catapulted 20 feet into the
air by the whale's blowhole. Within seconds, the blue-gray,
streamlined body broke the surface of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're absolutely beautiful,'' gushed Kim Biese, a Wisconsin
native who was spending her summer working on the boat.
</P>
<P>
   They are also incredibly large. The whales can grow as long as
100 feet and can weigh as much as 100 tons. On land, the whale
would be crushed to death by its own weight.
</P>
<P>
   But size isn't a precursor to savagery. These toothless
creatures are some of the most gentle creatures in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother nature in her wisdom made these whales toothless,
docile and friendly,'' said boat Captain Jerry Winingar.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time we had this group of schoolchildren on the boat and
the whale swam up to the side of the boat and just floated on by,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was bigger and longer than the boat, but there was nothing
scary about her at all,'' Winingar said.
</P>
<P>
   The whales were thought to feed in the polar waters during the
summer months and were found mainly in the Antarctic from May to
September.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade though, researchers noticed that the whales
are spending their summer months in the more temperate climates
just off the coast of Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of food there _ we know that much,'' Cordaro
said. During the summer feeding season the blue whale gorges
itself, consuming an astounding 4 tons or more of food a day. This
means it may eat up to 40 million krill daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen as many as fourteen different blue whales out in
the bay area at any one time,'' said Don Hedden, owner of Capt.
Don's whale watching tours. ``I can only imagine how many krill are
out there.''

HOSPITAL STRUGGLES TO SAVE LIVES OF BOMB VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The grievously maimed and the walking wounded
filled the wards, corridors and intensive-care beds at this
nation's largest hospital, and doctors, nurses and technicians were
strained to their limits Saturday as they struggled to treat the
victims of the car-bomb attack on the U.S. Embassy here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place was filled with blood,'' said Henry Njoroge, an
X-ray technician at Nairobi's Kenyatta National Hospital, which
treated 1,600 people in the hours after the blast and has admitted
257 other victims. ``We treated so many who were unconscious and in
shock, and we were shocked ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenyatta Hospital is running out of X-ray film, respirators,
sterile gloves, pain-killing drugs and other basics, hospital
administrators and technicians said. A remarkable public response
has helped the hospital staff cope. Hundreds of people have donated
blood, food, blankets and bedsheets. Doctors and medical students
have been working around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Red Cross said Saturday that there were blood
shortages at some of the seven hospitals treating more than 4,000
wounded, and handwritten signs taped on Kenyatta Hospital's cement
walls appealed for blood donations.
</P>
<P>
   But brain surgeons and other experts, and heart monitors and
other high-tech equipment will be needed to save the lives of the
most seriously injured, particularly those with head injuries,
nurses and doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, the 10-story hospital, about two miles from
the U.S. Embassy, trembled with the force of the explosion. Within
10 minutes, hundreds of people, their faces torn by flying glass
and their bones shattered by the blast and the debris, began
streaming into Kenyatta Hospital's front doors, driven by ordinary
Kenyans who pitched in to help, as well as by ambulances. Doctors
in private practice and off-duty medical students arrived minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very overwhelming,'' said Kepha Maroro, a 21-year-old
medical student at the University of Nairobi. ``There were so many,
we didn't know who to attend to. We were so few and the numbers
were so large. If someone could walk, we could not attend to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   With only three hours of sleep in the 36 hours since the
explosion, Maroro was on his way to get some aspirin for himself,
so he could stay on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   On the 7th floor of the hospital, Alice Mothoni, a 34-year-old
government clerk, lay on a metal bed in a room with six others. She
was on the 16th floor of a building next to the U.S. Embassy when
the first blast went off. She and her co-workers rushed to the
windows, and the second blast shattered glass that badly cut Miss
Mothoni's face.
</P>
<P>
   In the intensive-care unit on the first floor, doctors and
nurses were struggling to save lives Saturday evening. In one crib
was a tiny girl with a shattered head, who was listed on a sheet of
paper as ``unknown African child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more machines, more respirators, more gloves,'' said a
nurse in the intensive-care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Three blast victims died in the operating room here Saturday,
and five more who were in the intensive-care unit died, the nurse
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyatta Hospital's spokesman, Stephen Mureithi, said that
Nairobi had never experienced anything as devastating as the
explosion on Friday, and that the collective shock had not worn
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been touched by horror,'' he said. ``There you are,
walking down the street, no worries at all, and suddenly you are in
a hospital, with broken bones or a broken skull. But the public
response _ we have coped.''

REAL ESTATE: EXTENDED-STAY HOTELS EXTEND THEIR POPULARITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., Ill., Ga.)  (lb) 
 By ELEANOR CHARLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, the hotel industry has scrambled to respond to
an increasingly mobile business community. Companies sending
employees on assignments that could last from two or three days to
two or three years were clearly underwhelmed by traditional hotel
services and rates.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the extended-stay lodging concept offered by at least 19
companies currently operating about 1,000 properties nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Guests are typically offered a 250- to 450-square foot
accommodation with a bedroom, living room or living-room area,
fully equipped kitchen, housekeeping service and a work station
with two phone lines and outlets for computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The larger and more expensive units may include two separate
bedrooms and two baths, Jacuzzi, living room and two TVs and VCRs,
with the hotel's facilities including a swimming pool, exercise
room and 24-hour concierge.
</P>
<P>
   Most extended-stay hotels are found in suburban areas where
established corporate centers supply their customer base. In
Connecticut _ a natural target with its concentration of corporate
headquarters _ there are six existing extended-stay hotels with 632
units. Seven more with a total of 1,051 units are under
construction or projected through 1999, according to Smith Travel
Research in Hendersonville, Tenn., and individual hotel companies.
</P>
<P>
   An $8 million, three-story Homestead Village has broken ground
on a 3.6-acre parcel along Route 7 in Norwalk, Conn., with 129
rooms of 260 to 400 square feet. Rates are expected to range from
$209 to $419 a week or slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
   An application to build a second Homestead Village on Long Ridge
Road in Stamford, Conn., was rejected last month in a 3-2 vote by
the Planning Board, reinforcing a universal concern among
developers that the metropolitan New York region is tougher to
penetrate because of neighborhood resistance and complex zoning
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We explored Stamford for two years, and had lots of input from
adjacent homeowners,'' said Matt Whelan, vice president of
acquisitions and development for Homestead. ``They were supportive,
but unfortunately some residents from farther away were not as
receptive. Based on the trucking and commercial use that's there
now, we thought we were bringing an improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed site, a three-acre parcel in a residential zone,
has been occupied since prezoning days by Crystal Rock, a
water-bottling company, and by a vacant restaurant. Objectors to
the hotel fear that Long Ridge Road with its many office buildings
is shifting from a residential to a commercial area.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Redniss, president of Redniss and Mead, Stamford
development consultants for Homestead, is re-evaluating its
position and may reapply. ``The city is clearly underserved,'' he
said. ``We have hundreds of apartments that are being used as
extended-stay units _ some are being rented annually by
corporations, some by extended-stay providers who sublet them to
corporations, taking them off the market for people who need
housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Homestead Village, founded in 1992, has 95 operating properties
in 26 states and 74 more under construction or planned. Its newest
ventures are to rise on a site on Tremont Street in Boston and
three sites in New York, on 55th Street between Madison and Park
avenues, West 40th Street opposite Bryant Park and 45th Street near
Third Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very excited about this,'' said David Dressler Jr.,
co-chairman and chief investment officer. ``In Manhattan there are
many fabulous hotels, but very few alternatives for extended-stay
customers. Our customers tell us that they need us to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The current high occupancy rates of extended-stay hotels, a type
of lodging that has been in existence since the '70s, are
encouraging construction both by fledgling companies and by
traditional behemoths like Marriott and Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Occupancy nationwide through May of this year was 78 percent,
compared with 76.2 percent for the entire year in 1992, according
to Smith Travel Research. Occupancy at all hotels was 59.6 percent
in 1992 and 62.2 percent through last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are up to 146,000 rooms across the country, and between
60,000 and 80,000 are being built annually,'' said Peggy Berg,
president of the Highland group, a hotel consulting company in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A negative perception of extended-stay hotels sometimes
surfaces, said Ms. Berg of the Highland Group, when ``zoning boards
throw up horrible specters of 1960s motels that are not up to code
and will rent to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But objections of that kind have not been voiced in Stamford.
Norman Lotstein, speaking for the city's Downtown Special Services
District, said ``extended-stay hotels are patronized by people who
are heavy users of restaurants, theaters and shops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe they are better served by locating downtown where
those things are easily accessible,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The South and Southwest have been the most fertile ground for
building extended-stay lodgings to date, but development is
expanding in California and the Northeast, where costs are higher
but the customer base is commensurately richer.
</P>
<P>
   The extended-stay hotel, which is cost effective for companies
needing to temporarily put up employees on assignment, trainees and
relocated, house-hunting employees, is gaining ground particularly
in accommodations for middle-management and construction employees.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations base the quality of hotels on the salary of the
employee. Someone making $50,000 a year will not be accommodated at
the same level as someone making $150,000 a year and most
upper-echelon executives, according to extended-stay operators, are
still booked into the finest traditional hotels with restaurants,
room service and elegant furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Rates vary geographically and according to amenities, from $40 a
night to over $200 a night, with discounts for stays of five days
or more. The industry defines an extended stay as a minimum of five
days.

   Rates at Homewood Suites in Windsor Locks, Conn., are $139 a
night for up to four nights, $114 a night from five to 11 nights,
$99 a night from 12 to 19 nights and $89 a night thereafter. Open
since 1990, Homewood has 132 suites in six buildings and extras
that include an outdoor pool, Jacuzzi, basketball court, daily maid
service, complimentary dinner for dining between 5 and 7 p.m.,
complimentary beer, wine and continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Crinella, the manager, said, ``We get people in training on
projects for Konica, the copier and camera company; Asea Brown
Boveri, a power-generation company, the U.S. Postal Service and
other companies in the area.'' Homewood Suites has been in
existence since 1989, when it opened in Omaha, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   The first Connecticut property to be built under the banner of
Extended Stay America, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., company, is a
91-unit building scheduled to open in Farmington in November as a
Studio Plus Deluxe Studio Hotel. Work will start in Danbury on the
104-unit Extended Stay America Efficiency Studios, and the company
has a site under contract in Shelton for 104 rooms. Rates will
range from $199 to $399 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1986 and 1996 Marriott, a player in virtually every
segment of the hospitality market, built five Residence Inns in
Connecticut _ in Windsor, Meriden, Mystic, New Haven and Shelton. A
sixth will open in Danbury early next year and a seventh is
projected to open in Manchester next spring. Rates are $159 a night
up to four nights, and $139 from four to 11 nights, compared with a
single rate of $175 a night at the traditional Stamford Marriott
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott put extended-stay hotels into the downtowns of major
cities early on, opening Residence Inns during the last decade in
Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, New Orleans and Minneapolis,
among other places. Its Washington and Beverly Hills Residence Inns
will open this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jack DeBoer, chairman and chief executive officer of Candlewood
Suites in Wichita, Kan., built the Residence Inn system before it
was sold to Marriott in the mid-'70s. ``I was an apartment builder
looking for a way to enjoy hotel income,'' he said. ``The hotel
market was much deeper than I thought.'' He later co-founded
Summerfield Suites and 18 months ago opened the first of 40
operating Candlewood Suites, with 35 more under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Popular as it is, the concept doesn't suit all companies. Candy
Racine, a supervisor at Carlson Wagonlit Travel in Rolling Meadows,
Ill., said ``AT&AMP;T has little use for extended-stay hotels. Most of
their travel is short-term.''
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital and Xerox in Stamford responded to inquiries about
their use of extended-stay hotels by saying that they use them from
time to time, but they were not sure how much or by whom they were
used. Hotel operators attribute such reticence to corporations'
wishing to avoid an appearance of endorsing extended-stay hotels at
the expense of traditional hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday Inns, a division of Bass Hospitality in England since
1990, is the latest entry into this market with a product called
Staybridge Suites. The first hotel is expected to open in November
in Alpharetta, an Atlanta suburb, with 119 studios and one- and
two-bedroom suites. ``You can expect a burst of Staybridge activity
nationwide in the next 18 months,'' said James Anhut, vice
president of Staybridge Suites.

U.S. ACT FAILS TO EASE PMI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ California homeowners now strapped with private
mortgage insurance won't get automatic relief from premium payments
under terms of a new federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The New Homeowners Protection Act of 1998, signed recently by
President Clinton, takes effect July 29, 1999. But California is
one of eight states _ New York, Minnesota, Hawaii, Maryland,
Connecticut, Missouri and Texas are the others _ that already have
laws dealing with private mortgage insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, if a state's laws are tougher than the federal
statute, they will remain in force. If not, the states have two
years to meet or exceed the federal law. Although mortgage industry
officials in California are still sorting out the new federal
rules, they believe it'll have little to no impact on state
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to digest what the federal law means,''
said Mike Knudsen, vice president for government relations at the
California Mortgage Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Private mortgage insurance is usually required by lenders if a
borrower makes less than a 20 percent down payment on a home. PMI
protects the lender against short-term losses if a homeowner
defaults on the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage industry officials say that only about 20 percent of
the loans now in force have PMI. Still, the U.S. Senate Banking
Committee estimates that the premiums range between $20 and $100 a
month, so homeowners could realize up to $1,200 a year in savings
if they can get their PMI canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Premiums are based on a variety of factors, including the amount
of a loan and a borrower's credit history. So someone with a big
mortgage could end up paying less than someone with a smaller
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to homeowners' frustration is the fact that PMI is not a
tax-deductible housing cost.
</P>
<P>
   The federal statute says that consumers who buy a home after
next July and whose loan terms call for mortgage insurance will
automatically have the premium payments canceled once they pay off
22 percent of the loan, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law also requires that homeowners receive a letter
once a year telling them they can apply to have the payments
canceled if they think 20 percent of the loan has been paid. In any
case, borrowers will have to deal with their lenders on an
individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   California's laws are similar, though homeowners have to
initially wait two years before they become eligible to seek
cancellation of their PMI and 25 percent is the cutoff, not 20
percent or 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some area mortgage bankers wonder what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice, we have for at least the last two years always
had a policy of letting people remove the mortgage insurance when
they built up at least 20 percent equity and lived in the property
for two years,'' said Joffrey Long, president of Southwestern
Mortgage Inc. in Granada Hills. ``So the bill doesn't really change
anything from our perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Long thinks that the rebound in area housing prices is making
private mortgage insurance more of an exception than the rule these
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of our loans don't require PMI even at 95
percent loan to value. Most people are not opting for PMI to begin
with.''

   Toronto's Roger Clemens may want out after this season, upset
that the team appears to remain in a rebuilding mode. ``If ...
trying to win is put on the back burner, then they're wasting their
time and I'm wasting my time,'' Clemens said. ``If that's the case,
my choice is to go closer to home, to Texas or Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: With Mo Vaughn expected to be in a different uniform next
season, look for the Red Sox to make a run at soon-to-be free agent
Mike Piazza. ... The Yankees could win 100 games before September.
They will have to go 24-7 this month to do so and so far are 6-2.
... New York's Darryl Strawberry has tied a major-league record
with two pinch-hit grand slams in a season. Davey Johnson of the
Phillies and Mike Ivie of the Giants both did it in 1978. ... In a
game Wednesday, Orioles third baseman Cal Ripken Jr. laid down just
the fifth sacrifice bunt of his career. ... Don't expect Jimmy Key
to do a lot of pitching down the stretch for the Orioles. The
left-hander still is bothered by an inflamed rotator cuff that kept
him out for 2 1/2 months. ... The Devil Rays will have a big choice
at third base next season, whether to go with Wade Boggs, who will
be going for his 3,000th hit, or up-and-coming ex-Brave Bobby
Smith.

   The Indians might be on track to win another division title, but
Wall Street has little faith in them. Their stock, which came out
at around $15 a share and is traded on the Nasdaq, has dropped more
than 43 percent. ``We're disappointed but not discouraged,'' said
Ken Stefanov, the club's chief financial officer. ``We see this as
a long-term, capital play.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Showing how times have changed in Cleveland, when
reliever Doug Jones made his first appearance there in 1991,
attendance at old Cleveland Stadium was 3,785. When he came back to
the team late last month, Jacobs Field held 43,055. ... White Sox
starter James Baldwin has a 8-0 record in indoor parks. ... The
Tigers are still hopeful they can get right-handed closer Todd
Jones through the waivers process and trade him. ... Royals GM Herk
Robinson admitted, ``We were asking a lot,'' from the Braves for
closer Jeff Montgomery. The Royals wanted either prospect Bruce
Chen or Odaliz Perez, and the Braves said no. ... Minnesota
public-address announcer Bob Casey will work his 3,000th game
today. That's more than 37 years of service.

<P>
   The Mariners might have gotten more for Randy Johnson if they
had not waited until the deadline to move him. They had been
offered Hideki Irabu, outfielder Ricky Ledee and third baseman Mike
Lowell by the Yankees but balked. They also could have had
outfielder Brian Giles and infielder Enrique Wilson from the
Indians. In the end, they had to settle for three prospects from
the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Shane Monahan, a recent callup for the Mariners, is the
grandson of NHL great and former Atlanta Flames coach Boom Boom
Geoffrion. ... Texas has benefited from the acquisition of starter
Esteban Loaiza, acquired from Pittsburgh on July 17. In his first
two appearances with the Rangers, Loaiza has a 1-0 complete-game
win and an eight-inning effort in which he allowed two runs. ...
Monday was embarrassing for Oakland's Mike Oquist, who became the
first pitcher since Milwaukee's Bill Travers in 1977 to allow 14
earned runs in a game. A's manager Art Howe on the five-inning
performance: ``Life is cruel; I was bleeding with the kid.'' That's
three more earned runs than Atlanta's Greg Maddux has allowed since
June 2. ... Speaking of Howe, expect the A's to can him after the
season and replace him with Bob Boone, now a scouting assistant
with the Reds.

 &HT;    Glavine: Maddux wins Cy Young
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Most concession speeches come around midnight on
Tuesdays. Tom Glavine made his Saturday around lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' he said. ``Doggie's gonna win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux has won the Cy Young award? It's early August, 46
games to play, maybe nine more starts each. Both Glavine and Maddux
have 15 wins and Glavine has a better win percentage. And Maddux is
a projected winner?
</P>
<P>
   Said Glavine, ``Gotta be.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine's comments come after his first shutout of the season
Friday night, while he is in the midst of a 6-1 run and his ERA
down to 2.47, which is .08 lower than when he won his Cy Young in
1991. He cannot pitch much better. He lone shortcoming may be that
Maddux is around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing what (Maddux) has done year in and year out, he helped
me in my special year I had,'' said John Smoltz, the 1996 winner.
``But to win the Cy Young, it's supposed to be kind of a
once-in-a-lifetime thing. Well, yeah, I won one. Here's a guy who
(can) win five.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing my best to stay in it,'' said Glavine. ``Believe me,
I know if I'm going to win, some way I'm going to have to end up
with three, four or five more wins. He's got a better ERA (1.53 to
2.47), more shutouts (a NL-high five to one), more complete games
(nine to two). I would think that if it ended right now, he'd win
it. I kind of hope from here on out, if I can keep it interesting
and keep myself in contention, it will be good for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves staff has talked about the benefits of intramural
competition but there may not be a better example than how Maddux
and Glavine are driving themselves right now. Working 1-2 in the
rotation most of the year and exclusively since the second week of
June, the pair have lost back-to-back starts only once all year
(July 11-12 at Florida) and just generated back-to-back three-hit
shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Glavine, it's almost like match-play,'' said Smoltz.
``You want to go out and do well but when you're playing with
somebody who's at the top, it makes it that much harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, for the record, has not been impressed by any of this,
as veteran Dog-o-philes might expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard enough to win without worrying about a bunch of
other stuff,'' Maddux said. ``Cy Young? Yeah, I'd like to win. Who
wouldn't? It's nice. But it's not an issue yet. It's something
after the postseason, where you're sitting around in December, you
hope to get a phone call. That's it, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Springer update
</P>
<P>
   Russ Springer still feels the knot in his right elbow where he
received his cortisone shot Thursday but he hopes to do some light
tossing today just to see where he standsfour days into his 15-day
stint on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything goes right, then I'm supposed to throw off the
mound either the third or last day (Wednesday or Thursday) in San
Diego,'' he said. ``But at the same time, it's not something where
we have to rush anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer is not eligible for activation until Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss sits
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Walt Weiss passed the first stress test, playing seven
straight games after sitting out nearly two weeks with a sore left
quad. In reward, manager Bobby Cox let him sit Saturday after a
night game. Weiss has hit .321 since returning to the lineup and
after the two-week break, plus playing in this current spate of
fast games, Weiss remains fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the length of the games with this team is a big
difference,'' Weiss said. ``The games in Colorado were so long, it
felt like you played a 250-game schedule.''

 &HT;    On Deck: San Francisco Giants
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Today at 8:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: 3Com Park at Candlestick Point.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: ESPN, WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP John Smoltz (10-2, 3.14; 10-13,
4.11 lifetime vs. Giants) vs. RHP Mark Gardner (8-5, 5.13; 5-5,
3.77 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Smoltz, who has the league's best winning percentage at
.833, goes after his sixth straight victory. He has not lost on the
road since May 17 in Houston, when he began to suffer the elbow
pain that landed him on the DL six days later. Since returning from
the DL June 20, Smoltz is 6-1 with a 2.54 ERA. He has allowed a
.254 average and 101 hits in 106 innings but has struck out 102, a
rate of 8.7 strikeouts per nine innings, an amazing feat given his
elbow troubles. Over his previous five seasons, Smoltz had averaged
8.6 strikeouts per nine. He will be wary of Giants outfielder Ellis
Burks, who has a .400 career average against him with two homers in
15 at-bats. Gardner is 7-3 in his last 15 starts and probably
deserves better. Since the All-Star break, the Giants have lost in
four of his five starts, three of those losses coming in the last
at-bat. He is 2-1 against Atlanta is five starts as a Giant. He
drew no decision at Turner Field May 2 (three runs and nine hits in
six innings) in a game San Francisco lost in extra innings. Braves
outfielder Michael Tucker, who is in search of a break-out game,
will be glad to face him. Tucker is 3-for-7 (.429) lifetime against
Gardner with two homers.

 &HT;    Balance in the Bronx
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Before canceling the postseason and handing the World
Series title to the New York Yankees, this fact should be pondered:
Since 1989, the team with the best record in the major leagues has
not won the Series.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, these Yankees, an amazing 53 games over .500,
are special. They are playing at an incredible .739 clip. If they
continue to play at the same pace, they will blow away the all-time
record of 116 victories by four _ although they would not have the
best all-time winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   They also could reach 100 victories by going 18-33 the rest of
the season. Despite Boston's 66-47 record, which is good enough to
lead the league's other two divisions, the Red Sox trail the
Yankees by 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   It has been years since baseball has seen a team with this kind
of balance.
</P>
<P>
   When New York lost four of its first five games this year, there
was talk of firing manager Joe Torre. Talk about premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an incredible run, when you think about it,''
pitcher David Cone recently told the Sacramento Bee. ``This team is
relentless. I've never been on a team like it. Nothing distracts
them from winning ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's a team without a lot of big stars.
</P>
<P>
   Their biggest, center fielder Bernie Williams, has been hurt for
part of the season. No player started in the All-Star Game. Darryl
Strawberry leads in homers with 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no outs in that lineup,'' former Angels designated
hitter Cecil Fielder said.
</P>
<P>
   New York does not rely on the home run; instead, it finds ways
to manufacture runs. Typical power hitters Paul O'Neill and Tino
Martinez have shortened their swings and are hitting to the
opposite field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to go into a slump when you're sitting
around waiting for a three-run homer,'' Torre told the Bee. ``We're
a line-drive, contact team. We get a lot of walks and put the ball
in play.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitching is solid. The Yankees' rotation might not be as
good as the Braves' at the top, but it is deeper. Rafael Mendoza is
in the bullpen. The five starters _ Cone, David Wells, Andy
Pettitte, Hideki Irabu and Orlando Hernandez _ have a combined ERA
of 3.43. Closer Mariano Rivera has 29 saves in 32 opportunities and
has walked just seven in 42 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has been consistent with a .982 fielding percentage,
which ranks in the top half of the league.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference between this team and those of the
past is the clubhouse atmosphere. Everyone gets along, and owner
George Steinbrenner has had few complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are aware of the playoff woes of teams with the best
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could win 150 games and lose 12,'' summed up shortstop
Derek Jeter, ``but if we don't win the World Series, then what's
the point of the season?''

   Based on his past, Kevin Millwood is going to have some kind of
future. Of the Braves' five starters, he is going to be the only
one to have a winning record after his first two seasons. Millwood
is 17-9 during his two years. John Smoltz was 14-18, Denny Neagle
7-12, Greg Maddux 8-18 and Tom Glavine 9-21.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Even though John Franco is 37 years old, 0-6 with a 4.36
ERA and has blown four of his last seven save opportunities, the
Mets signed him to a two-year extension worth $6.15 million. ...
Since returning from offseason surgery, Todd Hundley of the Mets
has 15 hits in 69 at-bats. ... The Mets called off negotiations
with Mike Piazza on a long-term contract until after the season,
because they realize he does not want to return to New York. They
also think he's not worth $100 million. ... Anyone wondering
whether John Smoltz is back at full strength should check his
record since the All-Star break: 5-0 with a 2.02 ERA. ... In eight
of Curt Schilling's 11 losses, the Phillies have scored two runs or
fewer. ... Right now, the defending champion Marlins have an active
payroll of $5.8 million. They also are paying $7 million to injured
pitcher Alex Fernandez.

   Craig Biggio's 494-game consecutive game streak came to an end
Wednesday. Now second behind Cal Ripken and his 2,592 games is
Albert Belle at 285, followed by Vinny Castilla (201), Neifi Perez
(186), Jeromy Burnitz (171), Scott Rolen (129), John Olerud (127),
Chipper Jones (120), Kenny Lofton (118), Ken Griffey Jr. (116) and
Kevin Young (116).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Mark McGwire might be the leading candidate for MVP
honors, but before his two-RBI single Friday night, the last
non-homer RBI hit that he had came on June 7 against the Giants.
... John Mabry filled in for McGwire in the No. 3 hole and at first
base Wednesday and homered. ... A sign that times are getting
better for the Astros: On Monday, two days after trading for
Seattle's Randy Johnson, the club's Internet site had 434,000 hits.
... The one statistic that shows just how poorly Cubs shortstop
Jeff Blauser is playing: His slugging percentage is .298. Last year
it was .482. That's a big drop, considering Blauser moved to a much
more hitter-friendly park (Wrigley Field) than Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   West
</P>
<P>
   Why would the Padres, who already have one of the best closers
in baseball and a solid bullpen from top to bottom, acquire Toronto
closer Randy Myers? They were concerned if they didn't, the Braves
would, so San Diego was willing to swallow the $14.5 million left
on his contract for what will likely be the most expensive setup
man ever in baseball. If the Padres make it to the World Series, no
one will even bat at eye at the money.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Rockies pitcher Jamey Wright hit his first career homer
Wednesday. ``I don't even hit homers in pitchers' batting practice
in Coors Field,'' he said. ``I definitely wasn't looking for one.''
... The Dodgers are 23-19 since manager Glenn Hoffman took over for
Bill Russell on June 22. ... The Dodgers' acquisition of Carlos
Perez and Mark Grudzielanek from Montreal pushed their payroll to
$61 million. ... The Dodgers have had 47 different players on their
roster this year. ... Kevin Brown's 11-game winning streak for the
Padres is the longest in the majors this season. Yet it is San
Diego's Andy Ashby who is pushing Greg Maddux for the Cy Young
Award. Ashby, a 15-game winner, has walked just three in his last
eight starts. ... The Giants play great baseball on Sunday, Monday
and Tuesday with a combined record of 34-13. They are 28-40 the
rest of the week.

MUSCLES YANKEE WINS THE HAMBLETONIAN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Muscles Yankee didn't surprise anyone by
capturing the 73rd edition of the $1-million Hambletonian on
Saturday in the bright sunshine at the Meadowlands. The victory
gave the driver John Campbell his record fifth success in the most
prestigious event in harness racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win more Hambletonians than anyone is very special,''
Campbell said after piloting Muscles Yankee to his fourth
consecutive triumph and fifth in six starts this season, justifying
his reputation as the best 3-year-old trotter.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell vaulted Muscles Yankee into the lead just after the
halfway point and was never threatened the rest of the way,
covering the mile in 1:52.2. The time was the second fastest in the
classic's history, only one-fifth of a second off the stakes record
set by Continentalvictory in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Muscles Yankee, the son of Valley Victory, finished three
lengths ahead of David Raymond, giving the trainer Chuck Sylvester
the top two finishers and his third title as a trainer in the
ultimate event in harness racing.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first Hambletonian victory for the owner Bill
Perretti. ``I've waited 20 years for this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester also trained two other horses in the race, Silver
Pine, who broke stride at the halfway point and finished ninth, and
Armbro Rotary, who finished last in the field of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester said that Muscles Yankee raced a great mile. ``When he
was asked to go, he did just that,'' Sylvester said about
Campbell's decision to make his move to the top of the field around
the halfway point.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell agreed. ``He responded very well when I asked him to
step to the front, he said. ``He felt very strong and I felt real
confident. He's never shown any quitting in any of the starts in
his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester said that Muscles Yankee would race in the Yonkers
Trot, the second leg of the triple crown, on Aug. 29 and he would
take him to the third leg, the Kentucky Futurity, on Oct. 9. The
last trotter to win the triple crown was Super Bowl in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The driver Luc Ouellette finished sixth in the Hambletonian with
Giant Keeper, but he still had a successful afternoon. Ouellette,
32, captured the Hambletonian Oaks behind Fern and drove the
winners in the Oliver Wendell Holmes and the United States Pacing
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Driving Fern to victory in the $500,000 Hambletonian Oaks was
not the biggest victory of the season for Ouellette. He won the
biggest race of his career last month when he guided Day In A Life
to victory in the $1 million Meadowlands Pace.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bow Tie took the $100,000 U.S. Pacing Championship in
1:49.1, matching the stakes record. Browning Blue Chip captured the
$141,000 Oliver Wendell Holmes for 3-year-old colts and geldings in
1:50.3 and handed Artiscape his first loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Moni Maker, who dominated the $500,0000 Breeders Crown with a
world-class performance recently after victories in Europe earlier
in the season, captured her second consecutive $300,000 Nat Ray
Final, an open race for trotters, to polish off her
horse-of-the-year season. She posted her eighth victory in 13
starts and was such an overwhelming favorite she paid $2.20 for a
$2 wager.
</P>
<P>
   The $400,500 Mistletoe Shalee for three-year-old pacing fillies
was captured by Galleria, who covered the mile in 1:50.4 and paid
$7.40 for $2. Galleria took the lead at the three-quarter mark and
held on to beat Panned Out by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   Since this was the culmination of the season at the Meadowlands,
the the season's leading owner, trainer and driver were honored on
Friday night. Bob Glazer's Peter Pan Stables was honored as the
leading owner for the fourth consecutive year, Brett Pelling
extended his record with his sixth trainer's title and Campbell led
the standing as the leading driver.

 &HT;    Braves launch 20-hit attack
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This isn't a road trip. Thus far, it's a joy
ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves made 42-year-old Danny Darwin look like the tired old
man he is, raking him for seven quick runs and then weathering a
mid-game uprising to beat the Giants 14-6 Saturday. Now 2-0 on this
nine-game western excursion, Atlanta sends out John Smoltz against
Mark Gardner tonight for the sweep and if anything, it should be
noisy. The Braves have now scored 47 times in their last five
games.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez, Andres Galarraga and Greg Colbrunn each hit two-run
homers and Keith Lockhart and Andruw Jones added solo shots to
spike a season-high 20-hit attack. But this one ended early, the
Braves sending 27 men to the plate in the first four innings,
racking Darwin (7-10) for 10 hits (five doubles and two homers). It
was 9-0 before the Braves recorded their 11th out.
</P>
<P>
   The happy recipient was Kevin Millwood (13-6), who won for the
fourth time in his last six decisions. Millwood pitched four strong
shutout innings (extending a Braves scoreless streak to 22 innings)
before walks and some two-out bat work led to five Giants runs,
chasing Millwood after just six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The issue became so moshed in the late stages that the Giants
batted out of order in the sixth, when they scored three times and
the Braves dugout was so glazed over, it never noticed until it was
too late. Rich Aurilia, substituting for Jeff Kent, walked and
eventually scored, even though he hit in Joe Carter's spot, when he
was subsituted for J.T. Snow.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Braves realized Aruilia had batted out of turn, the team
could have appealed, by Rule 6.01 (a) and Aurilia would have been
out. But Cox, who had to want to get home as quickly as any of the
39,174 assembled, never protested and the run counted. Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga had three RBIs with a double and his 35th homer, the
highest total by a Brave since David Justice's 40-homer season in
1993 and the most by a Brave first baseman since Hank Aaron hit 47
in 1971. Lopez's homer was his third in his last three games,
giving him six RBIs in his last 14 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The last starting position player to log a hit, Andruw Jones
made it count with a homer to left off Rich Rodriguez, the Giants
fourth pitcher.

AWESOME AGAIN CAPTURES A SLOW WHITNEY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Awesome Again, who won the Jim Dandy
Stakes at Saratoga as a 3-year-old last August, returned to win the
Whitney Handicap on Saturday by three lengths over Tale of the Cat,
and added another level to his career by remaining undefeated at 4.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed Tale of the Cat to set a slow pace for almost a mile,
but did not let the speedy Cat steal the race. As they turned for
home, with the seasoned Pat Day biding his time, Awesome Again
collared Tale of the Cat, passed him after a brief duel and widened
his lead as they flew home with six other horses in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   This was the 71st running of the Whitney, one of the landmarks
of racing at Saratoga, and a crowd of 30,665 watched it on a
shining and sunny afternoon. The crowd followed form at the betting
windows, making Awesome Again the 8-5 favorite and Tale of the Cat
next at 2-1. And that's the way they finished. Crypto Star, the
fourth favorite, followed three lengths farther back in third
place, and Frisk Me Now, the third choice, was next in fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was no Awesome Again in the race,'' observed John
Forbes, the trainer of Tale of the Cat, ``we would have won.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was an Awesome Again in the race, and he won it with
all his skills flying. He won for the fourth straight time at a
mile and an eighth, he won for the second time in three starts at
Saratoga and he won for the third time this year with no losses. In
his last race, he even outran Silver Charm, winner of last year's
Kentucky Derby and Preakness. He also ran his career record to six
victories in nine starts, and he has run in the money eight times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just ran a great race,'' said Patrick Byrne, who trains the
star colt for Frank Stronach, of Canada. ``The fractions were a lot
slower than we anticipated, but Pat did a great job positioning
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Day's great job consisted mainly of not letting Tale of the Cat
slip away on an easy lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were walking out there,'' Day said, ``so I had to stay
real close to the lead. At the three-eighths pole, my horse was so
relaxed I didn't know if we were out of the race or if he was just
loafing. When I realized he had a lot left in him, I knew we were
in the driver's seat.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how slow the fractions were: the first quarter-mile in
25 seconds, the half-mile in 48 4/5, the mile in 1:37. But that was
when Day decided the slow-motion had to end, so he guided Awesome
Again past Tale of the Cat and steered him home under a hand ride.
</P>
<P>
   At the finish, Awesome Again was clocked in 1:49 3/5, nearly
three seconds slower than the track record. He paid $4.80 for a $2
bet to win, and went home with $240,000 of the purse of $400,000,
raising his career earnings close to $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   When he switched jobs last winter, Byrne surrendered his role as
trainer of Favorite Trick, the Horse of the Year. But he inherited
Awesome Again and Touch Gold, whom he considers the star of the
stable.
</P>
<P>
   Tale of the Cat usually sets the pace, but it's usually fast.
This time, he set the pace, but it was slow. It was only his second
start after a nine-month layoff caused by a bone ailment, and he is
still considered precocious and promising. He has won four of his
seven starts, and has always seemed ahead of his class.

GROUP CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY IN BOMBINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Who did it?
</P>
<P>
   As FBI investigators picked through the wreckage of powerful car
bombs in the capitals of Tanzania and Kenya, the government's
terrorism experts in Washington pieced together information about
the methods and possible motives behind the horrifying attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A possible breakthrough in the case occurred Saturday, when a
mysterious group called The Liberation Army of the Islamic
Sanctuaries claimed responsibility. The group threatened more
attacks to drive American and Western troops from Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
   The group offered just enough details to give credibility to the
claim. In a statement sent to Qatar's al-Jazirah Satellite Channel,
it said the Nairobi bombing was carried out by two men from Mecca,
Saudi Arabia, while an Egyptian staged the Dar es Salaam attack.
</P>
<P>
   Calling itself ``Islamic holy warriors from all countries of the
world and who belong to all Muslim people,'' the group said it was
retaliating for the occupation of Islamic holy sites in the Arabian
peninsula by US forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Islamic Army for the Liberation of Holy Places announces
its absolute determination to chase the American forces and
pronounces its resolve to strike at American interests in all
places until all its objectives are met,'' the group said, an
apparent reference to the US military presence in Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, and other Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
   But terrorism experts cautioned that the group might be trying
to exaggerate its importance by taking responsibility for one of
the most serious anti-American acts in years. Or the group might be
trying to deflect attention from the real mastermind. Perhaps the
Liberation Army does not exist, the specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   Several terrorism experts said a prime suspect is Osoma bin
Laden, a wealthy Saudi exile who has called for a Holy War against
the United States. Bin Laden, who was recently living in
Afghanistan, is a suspect in two bombings in Saudi Arabia that
killed 24 Americans in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and independent analysts said the attacks were
overseen by experienced terrorists because no one has ever attacked
two American embassies simultaneously before. The terrorists also
knew enough to locate soft targets in neighboring countries _
embassies that do not have security walls and shatterproof windows
that the US has required on federal buildings since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists said these explosions are chilling because, in an
age of biological and chemical weapons, the attackers used
relatively unsophisticated car bombs with materials that are
apparently widely available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that this was a coordinated attack on two embassies
in a few moments suggests a significant organization or national
backer,'' said Jerrold Post, director of the political psychology
program at George Washington University. ``But this is not a
technical masterpiece, not a highly complicated operation.''
</P>
<P>
   One US official who has served in high-risk areas said it is
also possible that the real masterminds may never come forward. He
said the attackers might have miscalculated, thinking they would
kill more Americans than Kenyans and Tanzanians.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone with a basic knowledge of US embassies knows that
only 20 to 30 percent of the employees are Americans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say this was done by an Islamic Jihad group,'' he said,
``They say they are showing solidarity with the third world against
America, but who did they kill mostly? People from Kenya and
Tanzania, and that is not going to help their cause.''
</P>
<P>
   At George Washington University, Post said that the nature of
terrorism has changed in the past couple of decades. ``In the early
days of terrorism, the goal of the act was to draw attention to the
group,'' Post said. ``As fundamentalist terrorism has been on the
increase, they don't need to have a headline in the paper. They
say, `God knows.'''
</P>
<P>
   With hardly any news about the investigation into the bombers'
identities, rumors were common in Kenya and Tanzania. In Nairobi,
for example, people told unconfirmed stories a Friday morning
shootouts between suspicious-looking men and US Marines.
</P>
<P>
   But US Ambassador to Kenya Prudence Bushnell refused to
speculate on the investigation. Asked if she had any theories about
the reason behind the bombings, Bushnell answered, ``Theories?
None. Do you have any?''

SUBSTANCE OF BARNICLE COLUMN AFFIRMED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Boston Globe internal review has confirmed the substance of an
Aug. 4 Mike Barnicle column regarding a Roxbury triple murder three
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the column, retired Boston police officer Edward Walsh was
quoted describing the crime as a slaying of three young women
allegedly by John Martorano, a gangland figure and FBI informant.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Jan. 7, 1968 story in the Globe library, Herbert
Smith, 47; Elizabeth F. Dickson, 19; and Douglas Barrett, 17, all
of Roxbury, were found shot to death on Jan. 6, 1968, in a car on
Normandy Street. No record of any arrests in the case could be
found Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle's column quoted Walsh as saying the homicide involved
three girls. Walsh told the Associated Press Saturday that he told
Barnicle he believed the victims were girls. He also said the rest
of the column accurately reflected what he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;  An initial Globe accuracy check could find no record of
such a killing involving young women. The Washington Post reported
that on Friday, and several other media followed the story.
</P>
<P>
   That column ran two days after Barnicle's ``I Was Just
Thinking'' column, in which eight jokes apparently came from a
best-selling George Carlin book without attribution. The resulting
controvery culminated in the Globe asking for Barnicle's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;  The columnist has refused to resign. He met with Globe
publisher Benjamin B. Taylor on Friday, but neither Barnicle nor
Taylor have commented on the outcome of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;  Saturday, Globe Managing Editor Gregory L. Moore said:
``We believe a triple murder reported in Barnicle's Aug. 4 column
did occur, although the genders of the victims apparently were not
accurately described.'' Barnicle could not be reached for comment
Saturday.

MORE THAN 150 PEOPLE STILL MISSING AFTER AFRICA BLASTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS AND ANDREA USEEM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI _ Rescue workers desperately burrowed with heavy
machinery, shovels, and their bare hands Saturday in an attempt to
free people from rubble of terrorist bombings at the US embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania as the death toll rose to 147 and the number
of injured soared above 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of American searchers, doctors, and intelligence
specialists fanned out across the bomb sites in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam, trying to save lives while preserving fragile evidence that
could indicate who organized the simultaneous attacks. The two
capitals were scenes of frenetic activity, as emergency operations
expanded, and stunned silence, as hope for finding more survivors
faded.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 people are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the powerful blasts, the effort to find survivors
proved almost as fruitless as the effort to find the mastermind of
the double attack.
</P>
<P>
   In the Persian Gulf country of Qatar, a group calling itself
``The Liberation Army of the Islamic Sanctuaries'' took
responsibility and threatened more attacks on Americans if US
troops remain in the Gulf and the Middle East. But terrorism
specialists said it is too early to evaluate the information.
</P>
<P>
   In Kenya, the toll of dead Americans rose to 11, including the
child of an embassy employee, with five still missing. Americans
were not killed in Tanzania, but several Tanzanians who worked at
the embassy were dead or unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers plucked a survivor from the rubble of a Nairobi
office block nearly 36 hours after the building crashed around him.
</P>
<P>
   Another man trapped in the wreckage of the office building for
24 hours died while being rescued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could only see his hand, everything else was crushed,''
said Ketan Banjara, 26, an American resident born in Kenya who
helped with the effort. ``He was so patient, only saying `I am
hurting' sometimes. Then he stopped saying anything.''
</P>
<P>
   One bomb was believed to have exploded in a vehicle in a parking
lot next to the embassy in Nairobi, which was monitored by
closed-circuit television cameras. They could provide importance
evidence, but US Ambassador Prudence Bushnell said she did not know
whether the cameras or film survived the blast.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said its top priority is to determine the type of
vehicle and explosive used, which spokesman Frank Scafidi said
``can be like a fingerprint of who did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism specialists at the Central Intelligence Agency, the
FBI, and other agencies sorted through reams of reports about past
threats as well as profiles of terrorists, officials said. While
many of the specialists focused on Middle East groups that have
used car bombs in similar attacks, officials said they had not
ruled out terrorists from Sudan, Yemen, and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real reluctance to start fingering people when we
don't know everything,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton received updates from his
national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, throughout the day. In
the afternoon, Clinton convened a meeting with his top advisers,
including Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Defense
Secretary William S. Cohen, to discuss the mission of looking for
survivors and identifying the bombers.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department took the lead and about 35 officials from
the military, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and
intelligence agencies gathered behind locked doors to share their
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who arrived on an overnight flight after canceling a
vacation in Italy, stopped in to thank the sleepless employees, an
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   American military doctors and nurses from the Ramstein Air Base
in Germany and the Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia arrived
in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam and set up emergency clinics. Marine
antiterrorism units flown in from Bahrain and Tampa secured the
bomb sites and a Foreign Emergency Support Team, with FBI agents
and rescue workers, arrived in Nairobi from Andrews Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in suburban Washington appealed for blood to send to
Kenya, where the number of injured was four times greater than
expected a day before.
</P>
<P>
   A planeload of 118 Israelis trained in urban search and rescue
arrived with equipment for monitoring sounds of humans caught in
wreckage and eight rescue dogs, but for most of the day, the
Kenyans had little equipment other than a crane and some other
earth moving machines. They used their hands to move pieces of
concrete and their voices to communicate with the trapped
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the buzz of volunteer rescue workers and journalists, a
dull silence settled over the normally bustling street corner, now
cordoned off by Kenyan security forces. Radio hand-sets crackled,
glass crunched underfoot, and the whine of a chainsaw emerged from
the embassy, where military personnel searched floor by floor for
more bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan police and army personnel sat wordlessly in chairs pulled
from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon, hospitals had treated 4,149 people for
injuries, Bonaya Godana, Kenya's minister for foreign affairs, said
at a press conference. ``Terrorism has been brought to our
doorsteps,'' Godana said. ``We had not considered antiterrorism a
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of bodies were thought to be still inside the Ufundi
Cooperative House, a five-story building that collapsed after the
midmorning bomb blast. At least 50 buildings were damaged,
authorities said, and US officials said the embassy suffered so
much structural damage that it would have to be razed.
</P>
<P>
   Beside the 11 American citizens confirmed dead, 14 Kenyan
embassy staff were killed, Bushnell said at a press conference.
Appearing tired and dispirited and wearing a thin grey bandage over
her lip, Bushnell said, ``Saturday morning, at about 10:40 a.m.,
literally thousands of people came face to face with evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell was meeting with Kenya's minister for trade, Joseph
Kamotho, a block from the embassy when the blast went off. Bleeding
from minor cuts and bruises, she walked down 21 flights of stairs
before coming out to see the destruction around the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result'' of this attack ``is broken hearts, shattered
lives, shock, dismay, anger, and most of all, incredible sorrow,''
she said. Leaning into the microphone and pausing to draw her
breath, she added: ``I can only hope that out of this depth of
sorrow ... that (there will be) some rich little seed that will
help all of us human beings to just stop it. Just stop hurting each
other like this.''
</P>
<P>
   About a mile outside of the city, in the suburb of Parklands,
the office of the United States Agency for International
Development was an oasis for Americans. In the large office, which
was not damaged, Americans from all branches of the military and
State Department dashed in and out, sometimes stopping to hug one
another. Staff members worked out the logistics of arriving
American missions, comforted families of the dead, and arranged for
the air evacuation of injured staff.
</P>
<P>
   Three injured American embassy staff, who could walk, were flown
to South Africa last night. Other injured staff will fly to Germany
later this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the search and rescue crews, Bushnell announced
that more than 100 US officials were arriving in Nairobi by late
last night: 33 members of a medical assessment team, 19 members of
a medical evacuation team, 60 FBI personnel and other
investigators, 37 members of a disaster relief team, 50 Marines,
and 27 other military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were eager to tell relatives and friends that they
had survived, and to share their grief. An older staff member put
down a phone somberly: ``I just had to call Washington and tell
them that someone I know is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans who work at the embassy said they were still stunned
by the enormity of the bombings. The main danger in Kenya was
supposed to be street crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the all the work, we have not had time to ponder
the terrible losses,'' said Chris Scharf, the US press attache.
``There is no one here who has not lost a friend, an acquaintance,
or a colleague. But if you want to get everything done, you just
can't think about it.''

George Sands, who celebrated his 97th birthday on Aug. 6, at the
Wykagyl Country Club, in New Rochelle, N.Y. Sands is the oldest
golf official in the United States -- and probably the world. ``I
love being around the golf course,'' says Sands. ``The last time I
played was last year, but I love being around the course and
working for golf.'' (Susan Farley/New York Times Photo)

Rose, who finally got a taste of the big leagues last season with

   (NYT5) LOS ANGELES -- Aug. 8, 1998 -- LA-CRUISNG, 8-8 -- The
ritual of cruising Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles, now takes
place in a parking lot, because of a crackdown by the Los Angeles
Police Department. The police have been trying to rid Crenshaw of
cruisers for at least the last two years. As the crown jewel of the
urban social scene, the cruise draws parents and children, blacks
and Latinos, teachers and students, and gang members who set aside
their rivalries for a day to celebrate cars in the capital of car
culture. (Jill Connelly/New York Times Photo)

Beth, 18, is part of the new generation on the streets of The
Haight in San Francisco, ground zero of the 1960s counterculture
revolution. A native of Austin, Texas, she sleeps in a park and
begs for money. While the now romanticized flower children of The
Haight were painted as being spiritually connected by political
ideology and the haze of a marijuana high, many young people on the
same streets today share the common pain of broken lives and harder
drugs. (Darcy Padilla/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT3) HOLLYWOOD, Fla. -- Aug. 8, 1998 -- ALLIGATOR-WRESTLING,
8-8 -- Paul Simmons, an alligator handler, selects an alligator for
a wrestling demonstration at a wildlife park in Hollywood, Fla.
Alligator wrestlers say that in an age of growing environmental
awareness and competition for tourists, they gear most shows toward
educating visitors about the habits and characteristics of the
Florida alligator, rather than staging a battle. (Gary I.

   (NYT2) ROME -- Aug. 8, 1998 -- EUROPE-AIRCON, 8-8 -- An Italian
family investigating air-conditioners at the Cucciolo housewares
store in Rome. Unlike the past, when Europeans traditionally just
slowed down and endured the summer heat, many who are now used to
air-conditioned cars and workplaces increasingly want to cool their
homes as well. In Europe, sales of air-conditioners for homes and
small businesses, are expected to reach $3.2 billion this year.

   (NYT1) ALANG, India -- Aug. 8, 1998 -- SHIP-GRAVEYARD, 8-8 -- A
migrant worker stripping a ship's metal for scrap, in Alang, India.
Once a poverty-stricken village, Alang has become the world's
biggest shipbreaking yard. In the 1990s, Alang has served as the
graveyard for almost half the ships scrapped by the world's navies
and merchant marines. (John F. Burns/New York Times Photo)

A CLEMENS RETURN? JUST ASKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, Gord Ash said, the Red Sox called about Roger Clemens
before the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once word got out on the street that Roger might be
available,'' said Ash, the general manager of the Toronto Blue
Jays, ``we received a lot of inquiries from a lot of clubs. The Red
Sox were one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was one of the few big-ticket Blue Jays who was not
moved by Ash in a house-cleaning in which they traded closer Randy
Myers, third baseman Ed Sprague, starting pitcher Juan Guzman, DH
Mike Stanley, and utilityman Tony Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what people think of Roger in Boston,'' Ash said,
``we were not going to give up a pitcher of his caliber for
`maybes.' We were looking for veterans who were visible and
prominent, and we didn't get that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays came close with one club. Rangers GM Doug Melvin
made a strong pitch for Clemens but in the end decided he wouldn't
give up starting left fielder Rusty Greer. Instead, while literally
working two phones simultaneously, Melvin swung deals within
minutes with the Cardinals for starter Todd Stottlemyre and with
the Marlins for third baseman Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had traded Rusty,'' Melvin said, ``we would have just
been creating another hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile already has made a big impact both offensively and
defensively for the Rangers. He hit home runs in his first two
games, converted seven chances against the Red Sox on Thursday, and
took away extra bases from Mike Stanley with a diving stop Friday.
Stottlemyre won his first start for the Rangers and will face John
Wasdin of the Sox tonight.
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, meanwhile, both Ash and Clemens have come under
withering criticism. Ash, a former groundskeeper for the Jays who
has worked in almost every capacity for the club over the last 20
years, is being held accountable for the performance of a team that
was marketed this season under the slogan, ``Bring It On,'' but
never was in contention.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, meanwhile, has been held up to ridicule by Toronto
columnists for saying that he wanted to bring a winner to the city
yet had his agents ask Ash to explore trading him to a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger was and is frustrated,'' Ash said from his SkyDome
office Friday. ``Obviously, he has been a tremendous competitor and
performer for us. He has aspirations for this ball club, and once
more they didn't come together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's of a mixed mind. On one hand, I understand his desire and
need to be with a winner. He sees his career winding down. But this
has also been a very comfortable place for him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never in a situation like Seattle (with Randy
Johnson), where we had to move him no matter what. He has two more
years left on his contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Ash would not rule out trading Clemens this winter. That, he
said, will depend on the direction the organization intends to
take, which will be determined in meetings with ownership in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He defended the deals he did make. With Guzman, he said, the
Blue Jays didn't want to be locked into a $5 million salary next
season, especially when they felt Kelvim Escobar was ready to step
into the rotation. He had only good things to say about Stanley,
both as a person and as a player, but moving him enabled the Jays
to make Jose Canseco strictly a DH and summon Jose Cruz Jr. back
from the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was worth moving for the pitching prospect they got
from the Mets in return, while the club had decided it wouldn't
pick up the salary option on Sprague for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Myers was a salary dump, freeing them from a $12 million
obligation to a closer who did not perform up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Ash said, the Blue Jays would like Canseco to
return next season as DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave us no reason this year not to be interested,'' Ash
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they can afford him remains to be seen. The Blue Jays
have some hard decisions to make, especially with the Canadian
dollar falling to 65 cents US, the lowest point it has ever been,
according to Ash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear in the American League East,'' Ash said,
``that if you're going to be a contender, you've got to spend big.
The Yankees spend big, the Orioles are not going to change their
approach, and Boston has stepped up big.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not capable of spending that kind of money. I can't
dream of having a $60 million or $70 million payroll. We have an
issue unique to ourselves and one other club (Montreal). The
Canadian dollar is sinking every day. That's not an excuse, that's
a fact of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't operate on the basis of significant losses. For us to
spend $50 million on payroll, that really means we have to take in
$75 million to pay that.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's not happening, not with attendance and TV ratings
down from the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays' situation has some calling for a savior, and
there are people who think they know exactly the man who fits that
bill: Pat Gillick, the original architect of the club who almost
certainly will leave the Orioles after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rumor that won't go away,'' Ash acknowledged. ``Pat has
a reputation of a genius, a guru here, and deservedly so. People
think he can come back and fix it. If that is being thought of,
it's by people above me.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Ash's bosses have expressed their support for the GM,
and the likelihood of Gillick coming back would seem to be a long
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Ash confirmed that when the Blue Jays were in Boston and he was
trying to close the deal for Stanley, Sox GM Dan Duquette wouldn't
meet with him, even though the men bumped in the hallway leading to
the pressbox. Instead, Ash met with Duquette's aide, Lee Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a big deal,'' Ash said. ``I don't know if Dan has a
problem with me, and I don't know why, if he does. But the bottom
line is getting the transaction done. Lee acted as the broker, like
when you're buying a house and going through a realtor.''
</P>

<P>
   &UR; Bob Starr &LR; , the former Red Sox broadcaster who also was a
sports anchor on WBZ-TV and the voice of Patriots and Boston
College football, was called the ``best radio announcer I've ever
heard'' by  &UR; Bob Costas &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who worked at KMOX in St. Louis when
Starr was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good baseball announcer,'' Costas told the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch after Starr's death last week at 65, ``but he was a
great football announcer. Bob Starr was a warm and decent man.''
</P>
<P>
   Current Sox radio announcer  &UR; Joe Castiglione &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was Starr's
broadcast partner when he was here, said that when Starr was with
the Angels,  &UR; Reggie Jackson  &LR; insisted that Starr be on the air to
call his 500th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, whose father laid oil pipes in Oklahoma, played football
at Kansas and while he was in the Army, he played baseball against
 &UR; Joe Morgan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the former Sox manager. Starr had hopes of signing a
contract with the Pirates, but GM  &UR; Branch Rickey  &LR; didn't offer him
a contract. As Castiglione tells it, Starr heard about an opening
at a local radio station, but was hesitant to apply.
</P>
<P>
   That's when his father stepped in. ``Well, you can talk, can't
you?''  &UR; Harry Starr  &LR; said to his son. ``There's not much more to it
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bob Starr, of course, as with  &UR; Jack Brickhouse &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the Spink
Award-winning broadcaster who did both Cubs and White Sox games and
died last week of cardiac arrest at age 82, there was so much more.
They will be missed.

<P>
   Sox pitching coach  &UR; Joe Kerrigan  &LR; said  &UR; Pedro Martinez's
 &LR; fastball Friday night was the type you see from him just a few
times all season. But Martinez was too strong and rushed his
delivery early, and was hurt by  &UR; Will Clark's  &LR; home run on a
3-and-0 pitch. On 32 previous occasions in which Clark faced a
3-and-0 pitch, he'd swung just three times, making two outs and
fouling off a pitch. Sox manager  &UR; Jimy Williams  &LR; yelled from the
dugout, ``He's swinging, he's swinging,'' to no avail ...  &UR; Cecil
Fielder &LR; , &UR;  &LR; designated for assignment by the Angels last week, told
friends last weekend that he expected something to happen when the
Red Sox were in Anaheim. He hinted at some friction with manager
 &UR; Terry Collins &LR; , &UR;  &LR; even though Collins called Big Daddy one of the
classiest professionals around. What the Angels are left with now
is a left fielder ( &UR; Garret Anderson &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; playing right field, a third
baseman ( &UR; Dave Hollins &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; playing first base, a first-year pro
( &UR; Troy Glaus &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; playing third base, and a former catcher ( &UR; Todd
Greene &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; available to play left field, first base, DH, and pinch
hit, a role the veteran Fielder wasn't eager to accept ... It's not
a question of whether ousted Red Sox farm director  &UR; Bob Schaefer
 &LR; will get another job in baseball. It's a matter of which job he
intends to take. He's already been contacted by a number of clubs.
Some Schaefer allies say he tried to do too much with the Red Sox
and needs to delegate more duties in the future ... A key to the
success of  &UR; Hideki Irabu &LR; , who looked like he might be a  &UR; George
Steinbrenner &LR;  folly last season? The New York Times last week paid
tribute to Irabu's interpreter,  &UR; George Rose &LR;  (Holy Cross Class of
'88). Rose went to Japan a year after graduating to teach English,
became fluent in Japanese, and has been at Irabu's side all year
... Don't look now, but the Sox and Orioles meet six times in the
last 12 games. The Orioles, 12 games under .500 at the All-Star
break, were 21-5 since then as of Saturday. There's no overstating
what an inspiration  &UR; Eric Davis  &LR; continues to be to cancer
patients. Davis, who last season had surgery for colon cancer and
has undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatments, has led the
Orioles' surge with a 23-game hitting streak that began with a
grand slam against the Red Sox right after the break. He has hit 10
home runs during the streak, the longest of his career, and the
Orioles are now quietly negotiating a two-year contract extension
with the outfielder ... There's little doubt that the Padres'
decision to claim Myers on waivers was a ``Hollywood Squares''
move: They took Myers to block him from going to the Atlanta
Braves. The stunning aspect of the move, of course, is that the
Padres are obligated to pay Myers a guaranteed $12 million for the
next two seasons, plus $1.1 million for the rest of this season.
That's a ton of dough for a setup man, which is the role Myers will
assume for closer  &UR; Trevor Hoffman &LR; . But the Padres, who face an
important stadium vote in November, were ecstatic to deny the
Braves a potential closer, while picking up a lefthander in the
pen, which they needed. Myers was the Padres' closer back in '92.
``We like this deal better than Randy Johnson,'' San Diego GM
 &UR; Kevin Towers  &LR; said. ``We didn't have to mortgage our future. And
it shortens our games to six or seven innings.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   High praise from former MVP  &UR; Ken Caminiti  &LR; of the Padres for
Phillies third baseman  &UR; Scott Rolen &LR; : ``I guarantee that he hasn't
reached his full potential. He is a player who is an All-Star and a
MVP. He not only can carry a team. He can carry a team to a
championship.'' ...  &UR; Jim Thome's  &LR; broken pinky finger may have
postseason implications for the Red Sox. Without Thome for the next
4-5 weeks, the Indians will be hard-pressed to maintain a better
record than the AL West-leading Rangers. If the Red Sox win the
wild card, they'll meet the division winner that has the next-best
record to the Yankees. Thus, if the Rangers pass the Indians, the
Sox will open the first round of the playoffs Sept. 29 at The
Ballpark in Arlington ... Pirates pitcher  &UR; Jason Schmidt &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
began the season 8-1, is now 8-9. The Pirates pitcher who had a
similar winless streak was  &UR; Tim Wakefield &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was 0-9 over 13
starts for the Bucs in 1993. Schmidt is unhappy about what he
perceives as a nonchalant attitude toward losing on the part of his
teammates. ``Every day it's the same thing,'' he said. ``You come
in, and everybody's rah-rah, like we won 10 in a row.'' ... Tough
National League debut for former Sox farmhand  &UR; Joe Hudson &LR; , who
went to the Brewers 10 days ago in a deal for minor league
infielder  &UR; Eddy Diaz &LR; . Hudson faced seven batters Friday night for
Milwaukee. Six of them scored in the Reds' 12-run explosion, the
biggest inning ever against the Brewers. Hudson threw 27 pitches,
just eight for strikes. ``It was a tough situation for him,''
Brewers manager  &UR; Phil Garner  &LR; said. ``He came in with no breathing
room and he had a tough outing.'' ... The Cubs have some interest
in  &UR; Gary Gaetti &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the soon-to-be 40-year-old Cardinals third
baseman who was designated for assignment Saturday. But he has some
contract incentives that might cause the Cubs to pass ... Former
Sox pitcher  &UR; Ken Brett &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who pitched in the '67 World Series as a
19-year-old and was a broadcast partner of Starr's, had a brain
tumor removed this spring. Brett, 50, has returned to the broadcast
booth for fX after undergoing radiation treatment. ``Mine is a good
story,'' Brett told the Los Angeles Times, ``because I'm not going
to die. I lost some hair, but I can live with that.'' ... New
Dodgers pitcher  &UR; Carlos Perez &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was torched in a 9-0 loss to
his former team, the Expos, still has pain in his right
(nonthrowing) shoulder stemming from a car accident in Montreal in
which he ran into a light pole. It restricts how much Perez turns
in his delivery.

<P>
   &UR; Wade Boggs  &LR; is not going to reach 3,000 hits this season, nor
is he going to get the 500 plate appearances needed to guarantee
his contract with Tampa Bay for 1999. That raises questions about
what is to become of the 40-year-old third baseman, who gave his
hometown expansion franchise a big slice of credibility but also
knows that rookie  &UR; Bobby Smith  &LR; will play more third base next
season. The Devil Rays have an option for Boggs in '99 but won't
say whether they plan to pick it up. Boggs came into the weekend
121 hits shy of 3,000. ``Would he have a chance to get 3,000 hits
if he's back next year? Yeah, he probably would,'' Tampa Bay
manager  &UR; Larry Rothschild  &LR; said. ``Does that mean Bobby Smith
doesn't play as much as he needs to play? I couldn't let 3,000 hits
get in the way of that. But yet I'll still be very aware of where
Wade is and what has to be done, just because it is such a
tremendous milestone. It's good for the organization and good for
baseball in general for people to follow. I can't think of a more
thrilling time than what you would see here when he got close.''
... Despite an unbelievable stretch in which he hit nine home runs
in 30 at-bats, including a pinch-hit grand slam in the ninth inning
to tie a game the Yankees went on to win, 10-5,  &UR; Darryl Strawberry
 &LR; still may have his playing time cut. Yankees manager  &UR; Joe Torre
 &LR; maintains that when  &UR; Chili Davis &LR;  is healthy enough to return to
the lineup during the next homestand, he will serve as the regular
DH. Strawberry may get an opportunity to play left field if his
left knee allows him enough mobility ...  &UR; Larry Herndon &LR; , &UR;  &LR; fired as
the Tigers' hitting coach and replaced by  &UR; Toby Harrah &LR; , &UR;  &LR; was the
last man in a Detroit uniform who had a link to the club's most
recent championships: their world title in 1984 and East Division
crown in 1987. He hit the decisive homer in Game 1 of the 1984
World Series and in the final-day, regular-season showdown with
Toronto in 1987 that put the Tigers in the playoffs. No Tigers
player or coach goes back with the club even to 1994 ... Do you get
the impression that Williams, who refused to bump  &UR; Steve Avery
 &LR; from the Sox rotation, was less than wild about the team's trade
for  &UR; Pete Schourek &LR; ? Perhaps Williams figures that if Schourek
could be a big contributor down the stretch, the Astros, who are
trying to win the NL Central, never would have let him go ...
Planning for post-Mo? The Sox are discussing moving  &UR; Dernell
Stenson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the 20-year-old, lefthanded-hitting outfielder who leads
Double A Trenton in home runs, to first base ...  &UR; Shane
Spencer &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the Yankee rookie who filled in for  &UR; Paul O'Neill
 &LR; Friday night and went 5 for 5: ``I never had five hits in my life.
Not even in Little League.'' ... Orioles ace  &UR; Mike Mussina  &LR; has
flirted with a perfect game twice within the last year: 25 outs in
a row last season, 23 last week until Tigers rookie  &UR; Frank
Catalanotto  &LR; doubled into the right-field corner with two outs in
the eighth inning. ``Everybody thinks doing something like this is
disappointing,'' Mussina said. ``I don't know why that is.
No-hitters and perfect games are unique experiences. I'm just happy
that I could pitch as well as I did. I'm not here to be a guy who
throws five no-hitters and wins 400-some games. I'm here to pitch
and compete and do what I can.''

HEINZE SHOWS HIS HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Heinze jokes that for an unemployed hockey player, he's
very busy this summer.
</P>
<P>
   He has been working out regularly at Mike Boyle's Sports
Acceleration North in Burlington, he recently became engaged, and
he's been playing golf and participating in charity events. The one
thing he hasn't done lately is negotiate with the Bruins, who own
his rights.
</P>
<P>
   Heinze, a Group 2 (restricted) free agent, and his
representative, Steve Mountain, have taken a rather novel approach
to negotiations: They told the truth right out of the gate. The
28-year-old right wing is asking for a two-year contract for $1.15
million next season and $1.3 million in 1999-2000. They don't want
any more, but Heinze said he won't take any less. He didn't go in
asking for the moon. He asked for exactly what he thought he should
earn.
</P>
<P>
   It was a risky move, considering most players go in asking for
much more than they want, knowing that when the contract is finally
resolved, they will have to settle for less. Most teams, likewise,
offer less than they're willing to pay, and the sides come to an
agreement somewhere in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being as honest as I can be,'' said Heinze. ``I can
probably make more on the open market, but I also realize I play
for the Bruins. I'm an honest guy; I believe that's what I deserve
to get paid. It's consistent with the team and the league, and
(management) didn't hit that number (with their offer). Were they
way off? No. But they weren't at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always hear the word `loyalty,' and it's thrown around a
little bit too easily, I think. It is a business. I would love to
be loyal to this team if I thought they'd be loyal to me on all
levels. Once you're under contract to the Bruins, there is a lot of
loyalty and you wear that B and you wear it with pride. Every
summer when you don't have the B on and you're unemployed, it's
kind of on a different level. We're going in with the number we
want, and we're not going to move. If it goes right up to camp,
then it will be decision time.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last couple of years, Heinze has signed one-year
contracts and had no leverage in negotiations either because his
statistics didn't support a big salary increase or, in the case of
the 1996-97 season, he was limited to 30 games because of injuries,
though he scored 17 goals. Last season, Heinze was the club's
fifth-leading scorer with 26 goals and 46 points in 61 games and
made $650,000.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bruins having so many free agents to sign this summer,
including leading scorer Jason Allison and defenseman Kyle McLaren,
Heinze said he's not sure what's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody gets settled before camp, and I'm the only guy
hanging out, it's different than five of us hanging out,'' said
Heinze. ``If there are five of us, do they cave in to Allison
because he has the most points? Do they cave in to me because I've
been here longest? It will be up to Harry (Sinden).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it happen, so I don't know. I've seen Cam
(Neely hold out); I've seen Glen Wesley do it. But that was
different than the Al Iafrate fiasco. I don't know how Harry would
handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Heinze believes he has the leverage to support his
demands. He and Mountain negotiated with the team right up until
the arbitration filing deadline. Heinze opted not to file, saying
he didn't want to put his future in the hands of a third party and
the process was too much of a crapshoot, anyway. The fact is, too,
that there were few comparable players that Heinze could use to
support his unusual position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a hard-fought battle because we do
have a bit more leverage,'' said Heinze. ``Not that we caved in the
last few years, but we really didn't have a bargaining chip of 26
goals and things like that. We're talking higher numbers than we
talked in the past, and obviously that will be more intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze feels he has given in the last couple of years and this
time, it's the club's turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to make what everybody else is making and be
the high-paid guy,'' said Heinze. ``I knew I was good enough to do
it with that 17-goal season in 30 games. I wanted to get paid as a
30-goal scorer, but with past precedents and what I only did for 30
games, it was understandable that the Bruins wouldn't pay me as a
30-goal scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating but in the same sense, it was somewhat
understandable that they would go that way. I wouldn't say I was
overjoyed with the deal, but I was content, I guess. I don't think
if you talk to anybody, they've ever been overjoyed with a deal in
Boston. They deal hard and they don't give it away, from Ray
Bourque right on down. It's a business and they deal with it that
way.''

   With Dmitri Khristich and Rob Tallas scheduled for arbitration
hearings this week and the Bruins' other free agents up for new
pacts, Heinze is not sure when he and the Bruins will get back to
the table. He expects that it could go right down to training camp
or beyond. He is prepared to sit if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to stay here, but if push comes to shove, I
understand I can move on,'' he said. ``Now I know I'm good enough
to score in this league on any team that wants to have me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely want to stay here. I wouldn't want to hold out,
but if it comes to that, yeah, I'm prepared to. I do like it here
as long as I'm going to get a chance to play. It is still a game,
and I'd play it for $5 if everybody in the league was getting paid
$5 to score 26 goals.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a criticism of Heinze, it's that he has been a
streaky player. After a good regular season, Heinze had zero points
in six playoff games against the Washington Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That damn team _ I never score against them,'' he said. ``One
game, I had eight shots on net. I don't think I played terribly
bad. My minutes didn't decrease. I don't think (coach Pat Burns)
was unhappy with my efforts. It's just that the damn puck wouldn't
go in the net. (Washington goalie) Ollie (Kolzig) was standing on
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I've had some highs and lows. It's something I've
always tried to work on. I'll have five or six games with no goals
then five or six in a row scoring goals. Harry has mentioned that
in negotiations, he wants more consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the current stalemate, Heinze is optimistic that he will
be back playing for Boston and will get what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've actually been pretty relaxed so far this summer,'' he
said. ``When (camp) gets closer, maybe I'll think about it more.
I'm good enough to play in this league. I don't want to sit out a
whole year. I don't want to be what's-his-face from Pittsburgh,
Petr Nedved. I'm not asking for that kind of money, so I don't
think it will come to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things tend to work out. That's why I have an agent. That's
why you pay him, so he can lose sleep over it.''

   Reading the news out of Western Canada, it's hard to say whether
the saga of Vancouver star  &UR; Pavel Bure  &LR; is a soap opera or material
for a suspense novel. Bure has said he doesn't want to play for the
Canucks anymore. That stuff happens all the time. But with Bure,
it's more bizarre. The moody Russian said he's tired of being in
the limelight, that fans in Vancouver won't leave him alone. He
wants to be traded to a contender and wants a shot at the Stanley
Cup. Think he can do that in a vacuum? If you want to be traded,
fine. No big deal. It's hardly unprecedented in any sport. But if
he wants out for the reasons he says and wants to play in a cave so
no one knows him, Bure should realize that no one will pay him the
approximately $8 million a year he is due to make now. This
ridiculous situation is the headache of new GM  &UR; Brian Burke &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
has to decide where to trade Bure. Burke, no shrinking violet, told
Bure and anyone else within earshot that he will trade Bure to
whatever team gives him the right deal, and if he doesn't get it by
the time the season opens, then Bure will be suspended if he
follows through on his threat to sit out. Can anyone say, ``Too big
for your britches,'' in Russian? No one put it better than Flyers
GM  &UR; Bobby Clarke &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who said, ``If he wants to get lost, tell him
to go back to Moscow.'' ... Speaking of Clarke, he minced no words
when discussing Flyers captain  &UR; Eric Lindros &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is rumored to
be on the trading block. ``If you want to be the highest-paid
player in the game or close to it, you've got to play that way,''
Clarke told the Philadelphia Inquirer. ``You're not a kid anymore.
He's 25 years old, and he's been in the league six years. It's
time. If you're going to pay him $8.5 million (Lindros's salary for
the upcoming season), you hope to get more games out of Eric. And
better games. ... You can't keep paying someone on potential.'' ...
The Maple Leafs announced last week that  &UR; Rick Ley  &LR; has been hired
as assistant coach to  &UR; Pat Quinn  &LR; and  &UR; Terry Simpson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; an interim
assistant coach for two years, would not be retained.

   Looks like Colorado goalie  &UR; Patrick Roy  &LR; may have to throw his
jersey in the dryer to shrink it before the start of the season.
The league has announced it will crack down on all the goalie
equipment, not just the pads and blockers it regulated last year.
Now jerseys, pants, chest protectors, and arm pads will be
targeted. Eventually, catching gloves will be regulated. According
to the new rules, the jersey may not be wider than 29 inches across
the chest, 30 across the hips, 9 at the wrist, and 14 from the
front of the shoulder to the back. No inserts or additions may be
made and the shirt can't be longer than 32 inches. The pant legs
will be restricted to 11 inches across the thigh. While the Players
Association was in on the new restrictions, not all the players
were ecstatic, especially Buffalo netminder  &UR; Dominik
Hasek &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who &UR;  &LR; won the Hart Trophy as Most Valuable Player the last
two years. ``Amazing,'' Hasek told The Sporting News. ``A goalie is
named MVP for the first time since 1963. Then he wins the award
again. And now everyone in the league wants to change the rules
because they say goaltenders are cheating. The next thing you know,
they will prevent us from leaving the goal crease, they'll reduce
the size of equipment to the size our kids use, and maybe even make
us play without a mask.'' The fact is, this isn't a safety issue.
Give someone an inch, they'll take a mile. The NHL has decided to
take back the mile. ``I can't say we didn't see this coming,'' said
Toronto's  &UR; Curtis Joseph &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was part of a group of netminders
who met near Ottawa to discuss the situation. ``You probably
couldn't absolve anyone of wearing some form of illegal equipment,
although shoulder pads like the ones  &UR; Garth Snow  &LR; wears and
sweaters like the kind Patrick Roy and  &UR; Trevor Kidd  &LR; wore last
season were obviously illegal to almost everyone. With the pads he
had on last year, Trevor Kidd could almost cover the whole net.''
... 62 days to Opening Night.

MINOR GIVES HIS DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN AND PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Having been depicted by the mother of his three children in
court and in the media as a neglectful father and violence-prone
man, Celtics forward/guard Greg Minor realized he had to speak out
following an encounter with a fan at Logan Airport last spring.
``You've got to take better care of your family business,'' Minor
recalls the fan telling him as they waited for luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Although he quickly challenged the man, saying that he did not
know all the facts, Minor was convinced by the remark that he
needed to be more energetic in getting out his side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the age of 12, I've been the one who has been
responsible in my family,'' said Minor during a four-hour interview
with the Globe last week. ``And I come from a small town where
everyone gets along and does things the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from a family and town as close like that, you think
I'd have children born out of wedlock and leave them behind?,''
said Minor, now 26. ``That's insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Minor and his attorneys had declined requests for interviews,
and soon he was portrayed as indifferent to his children's welfare,
or as Sports Illustrated described him in May, a ``standard bearer
for irresponsible fatherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   That perception was drawn from statements made by Celestyne Y.
Rowan, 27, the mother of his children and Minor's girlfriend for
six years before their breakup, to the Globe, Sports Illustrated,
CNN, and Oprah Winfrey. However, that portrayal appears to have
been drawn from incomplete information. While he appears to have
displayed financial and emotional immaturity during his
relationship with Rowan, as well as anger and bitterness toward her
after their split, there is little indication that he knowingly
neglected his children or cut himself off from them.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Rowan's accounts, it was easy to believe the worst
about Minor. While he had signed a contract with the Celtics that
was paying him $12.5 million over a five-year period, she said he
was providing only $2,000 a month in support for his children. In
addition, he had allowed Rowan and the children to be forced from
their Louisville, Ky., home by not following through on a contract
to purchase the property, and he had had only infrequent contact
with the children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Minor and Stephanie Barrack, his fiancee, are now
providing versions _ and with some issues, documents _ that differ
from Rowan's accounts and on some points contradict her.
</P>
<P>
   Informed of this during an interview Thursday, Rowan persisted
in portraying Minor as neglectful about his financial and parental
responsibilities in 1996 and 1997, during the year after their
relationship ended.
</P>
<P>
   However, she did concede that during that year Minor provided
nearly $30,000 above the $2,000 a month in child support. Neither
Rowan nor her attorney, Maury D. Kommor of Louisville, offered
details of those payments to reporters or mentioned them in court
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sides continue to dispute issues publicly,
privately they are trying to settle their differences on child
support, custody, and visitation rights. Jefferson County Family
Court Judge Denise G. Clayton has imposed a gag order on Minor and
Rowan, but both sides confirmed that negotiations are ongoing and a
deal is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to move on, Greg wants to move on, but I want to make
sure that the children are taken care of,'' Rowan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But agreeing on things that happened in the past, and on whether
Minor acted responsibly as a parent, is a different story. The
major areas in which they disagree are the following:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Support payments &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Rowan told reporters last year that she was having a difficult
time making ends meet on the $2,000 support payments being made by
Minor. The Globe reported in June 1997 that Rowan was fending off
bill collectors, unable to make the monthly installment payments on
her washing machine, dryer, and refrigerator, or replace a tire on
her car.
</P>
<P>
   While at the time Rowan was receiving only the $2,000
court-ordered support payment from Minor, she made no mention of
the fact that during the eight months between September 1996 and
April 1997 she had received an additional $27,120 from Minor to
take care of expenses for herself and the children. In addition, he
said, he had documentation to prove that he had put $7,248 in
charges on his Visa card to pay for plane tickets and hotel
accommodations for a trip to Boston taken by Rowan and the children
during the Christmas season in 1996, as well as gifts for the
children.
</P>
<P>
   After signing his new contract with the Celtics in August 1996,
Minor now says, he realized that his relationship with Rowan was
ending and he needed to meet the financial needs of their children.
He says he directed his financial adviser to wire additional money
that Rowan might need to meet her monthly bills. Minor acknowledges
that Rowan did not abuse the authorization and sought only to meet
necessary expenses. But he emphasizes _ and Rowan now agrees _ that
the children could not have been living in near-poverty while the
wire transfers continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I felt I was a bad parent or I didn't handle my
responsibilities, then I'd say fine'' about being criticized, Minor
said. ``But my obligation was to make sure my kids were brought up
the proper way, to make sure they got the proper schooling so they
didn't have to struggle like I had. And I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vacating family home &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks before signing his contract with the Celtics, Minor
put down $38,000 to buy a new house that Rowan had picked out for
herself and the children in a well-groomed, safe neighborhood in
Louisville. Both Minor and Rowan say that under their agreement
Minor was to take out a real estate loan for the remaining $117,000
and Rowan would make the monthly $900 mortgage payments out of her
child support money.
</P>
<P>
   However, Minor never finalized the mortgage with the bank and
Rowan lived in the house for nine months without making any
payments. Finally, on April 30, 1997, Larry E. Thompson, the
contractor who had built the house and arranged the sale to Minor,
informed Rowan by letter that she had to vacate because Minor had
not followed through.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Rowan moved from the comfortable, four-bedroom
house to a far worse neighborhood in the west end of Louisville
where Rowan and the children were forced to share a single bedroom
in her mother's home.
</P>
<P>
   Minor said last week that he was shocked and deeply troubled to
learn that Rowan and the children had been forced to leave the home
and that he did not know of their plight until he read about it in
the Globe in early June.
</P>
<P>
   According to Minor, he thought Rowan had finalized the loan
papers on her own and had been making the mortgage payments out of
her support money, as they had arranged. He shifted the blame to
Rowan for not calling him in Boston or telling him about the
situation when she saw him and Barrack at a party in Louisville in
early May.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rowan said it was Minor's fault that she and the
children were forced to move. She said that Minor was angry with
her for seeking a significant increase in child support and had not
returned numerous messages she left on his pager.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who is involved in a lawsuit with Minor over the
house, sided with Rowan. He said that he spoken with Minor, Minor's
financial agent, the bank officer, and the Celtics' front office,
informing them that the sale had not been consummated and that
Rowan and the children may have to leave the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that he was trying to find a better mortgage so the
monthly bills would be lower, and that's why he kept stalling,''
Thompson said. ``I didn't want to do it but I had no alternative
but to force them to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Financial straits and court default &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   While denying that he delayed signing the mortgage papers, Minor
acknowledged that he was in dire financial straits at the time.
Although he had received $1 million immediately after signing with
the Celtics in August 1996, Minor said that money was used for his
agent's fee ($310,000), down payments on the houses he bought for
Rowan and for his mother in Georgia and on a condo for himself in
Waltham, and a long list of personal debts he had accrued while he
and Rowan were together.
</P>
<P>
   The $33,000 in monthly checks that Minor was netting from the
Celtics also was not bringing him, Rowan, or the children many
luxuries. After a hearing on Jan. 27, 1997, that Minor did not
attend, a domestic relations commissioner ruled that his monthly
support payments be increased to $30,000 to reflect his new
multimillion-dollar contract with the Celtics. A family judge
upheld that amount in June '97 and set up an escrow account. It
wasn't until last November that Minor got the amount reduced
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   At the original January hearing, Rowan, under questioning by her
attorney, Kommor, testified that she was receiving $2,000 a month
in child support, without mentioning that Minor was sending her
additional money to pay living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   She and Kommor also told the hearing commissioner that Rowan was
making $1,000 monthly mortgage payments out of her child support
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Later, while agreeing that Rowan did not make any mortgage
payments, Kommor said neither he nor Rowan intended to mislead the
hearing officer. Instead, he said, they were trying to provide an
accurate picture of what Rowan's anticipated financial condition
would be if and when Minor followed through on his pledge to
complete the mortgage deal with the bank.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rowan emphasized that all of the extra $27,120 that
Minor sent to her went to hospital bills for the children and other
necessary living expenses. ``Not a dime of that money went into her
pocket,'' said Kommor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Rowan's testimony could have been countered by Minor
if he had attended the hearing, but he defaulted from it, claiming
he hadn't had adequate notice. However, court papers show that he
was handed the legal notice of Rowan's request to increase child
support payments by a Jefferson County special court bailiff, and a
copy of that notice was sent to his mother's home in Sandersville,
Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Minor was successful last fall in getting a judge to reduce his
$30,000 payments to $7,860 but said he would have been able to
avoid the costly, year-long litigation battle if he simply had been
informed that Rowan was going into court and if she had provided a
clearer picture of her financial situation at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Both Minor and Rowan acknowledge that any hope for restoring
their relationship had disappeared by early 1997 and communication
between them was breaking down.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Emerge program &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   On two occasions in 1996, angry words between Minor and Rowan
had led to Minor striking Rowan and shoving her. Minor was arrested
on June 21 and charged with fourth-degree assault, but a Louisville
judge ruled that the charges would be dropped if he completed a
48-week, battery-prevention course in Massachusetts titled EMERGE.
</P>
<P>
   His experience with the program was not trouble-free. According
to news reports, he did not attend 14 of the first 36 sessions, and
nodded off or declined to participate in some of the others.
Although he ultimately attended the requisite amount of sessions
and the assault charge was dropped, Minor, like about half of those
who are ordered to attend EMERGE, was not considered a successful
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Minor is not considered to have successfully completed the
program because of insufficient program in other areas,'' wrote
EMERGE director David Adams in his report. ``Mr. Minor does not
appear to grasp the adverse effect that his violence has had on Ms.
Rowan or his children ... At the conclusion of the program, Mr.
Minor had no empathy for Ms. Rowan or an understanding of her
concerns as a parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Minor acknowledges that he did not agree with some of the
instruction during the EMERGE sessions and that he had difficulty
getting counselors to listen to his side of the story. However, he
said he learned much about himself and how to contain his anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my years, there was only one relationship like that,''
Minor said of his assaulting Rowan. ``I'm not proud of it but I
can't change it. At the same time, though, I can learn from it and
I have, and I've moved on.''

USA STOPPED SHORT OF GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ There was a 10-point lead with 3:09 to go. And then
there was nothing but self-destruction, agony, and, ultimately, the
numbing shock of seeing a 6-foot-10-inch forward named Serguei
Panov drive three-quarters of the floor to sink an easy layup with
2.9 seconds remaining that gave Russia a 66-64 victory in the World
Basketball Championships.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt the United States thought it had Saturday's
semifinal game won when Jimmy King tomahawked one home on a
two-on-one fast-break feed to make it 64-54 with 3:09 to go. It was
a fatal miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was still a three-minute game left. They played like a
veteran team, and we played like a young team,'' sighed David Wood,
who badly wanted a gold medal to validate his vagabond basketball
existence over these past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But he will have to settle for a bronze, at best. The gold is
going elsewhere. In the mini-game that mattered, Russia outscored
the United States, 12-0. It wasn't just a giveaway, either; the
winners must have done something right.
</P>
<P>
   There will be justified talk about calls and non-calls and it is
true, as Rudy Tomjanovich said, that, ``It was a horrible display
of one-sidedness.'' by the officiating duo of Slovenia's Izstok
Rems and Argentina's Paul Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also true that the US blunders in the final three
minutes would not have mattered had Sergei Babkov not made them pay
with two monster threes, or if the 28-year-old Panov, one of seven
Russian players who had been twice thrashed by the omnipotent NBA
stars four years ago in Toronto, had not had the basketball brains
to ignore coaching instructions to feed the rampaging Babkov (30)
and take it to the rack himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That definitely surprised us,'' said Wood. ``The guy made a
great play.''
</P>
<P>
   As a final sad coda, Wendell Alexis almost made a better one.
The US resident graybeard (34) sank a potential 35-foot game-winner
in response to Panov _ but it was clearly a tick or two after the
clock had moved to 0:00.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Rudy had a legitimate lament, because someone on the
Russian team had touched the ball after Panov's shot, and in this
game, that's a no-no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier in the tournament,'' Rudy pointed out, ``we got a
technical for doing that. There should have been one then.''
</P>
<P>
   How do you say ``fat chance'' in the World Basketball
Championships language of your choice?
</P>
<P>
   The embattled US was not going to get this, or any other call,
in those painful final three minutes, and Rudy knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' he said. ``We had to overcome some horrible
calls. But from the start we knew what we'd be up against, and I
told our guys we couldn't use the referees as an excuse. We had a
margin, and it just wasn't big enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The US would have won if it had kept its head, and remembered
where it was. Michael Hawkins plays right here in Greece, so he
should know. He should know that if the score is tied (64-64) and
you stick your off-hand out as you make a move, an experienced
player such as Russia's Vassilij Karassev is going to execute a
classic phony flop, and that he will get the call. That's precisely
what happened with 10 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But to dwell on the officiating inequities down the stretch is
to likewise ignore the fact that Hawkins had two good looks at
threes (1:37 and 1:04) and he missed them, and that Babkov had his
own looks at a pair of vital threes, the first when trailing by 6
and the second when trailing by 3, and he buried his.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made mistakes,'' sighed Rudy T, ``and they took advantage
of their opportunities. Babkov was a player on a mission, and we
had no answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the Russian saga was Babkov's absence during the first
10:38 of the second half. Sometime in the midst of torching the US
for 20 first-half points, the smooth Russian guard sustained a
sprained ankle. When he made his first appearance of the second
half, his team was down 8, 58-50.
</P>
<P>
   Until those final three minutes, the US was on its way to an
ultimate team triumph. The no-name, multi-rejected, off-Broadway
substitute for our pampered NBA idealogues were winning a game
against a good international foe with just one man _ starting
center Gerard King (oh, sure, you remember him) in double figures,
and that was 10.
</P>
<P>
   There were times you'd say to yourself, or perhaps the guy next
to you, ``How are they doing this?,'' because it never felt like
they were ahead, and because Babkov was firing away with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with him in Spain last year,'' said Wood. ``He'll do
something like that once every five games.''
</P>
<P>
   But the US was finding a way. They'd have a little run here and
they'd make a steal there, and people such as King, Ashraf Amaya,
and Alexis were holding the Russians to one shot. And when King
echoed those Fab Five memories with that big slam, the championship
game was within sight.
</P>
<P>
   Now they must pull themselves together for a bronze medal game
against Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically shot ourselves in the foot,'' said Amaya. ``This
is what some people back home thought we were going to do. We had a
chance to make people eat crow.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been a growing concern among the Europeans that a US
victory here would have been nothing less than a catastrophe for
the sport. The thinking was it is one thing to lose to pedigreed
NBA stars with the seven- and eight-figure incomes and the bulging
portfolios, and another thing to lose to guys who specialize in
attending tryout camps, or who are just pretty good players in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not Yugoslavia; this is the very best team we have,''
lamented one Russian observer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice team, and it's going to play for the gold Sunday.
The US squad is going to want those last three minutes back
forever.

ARMSTRONG NOT READY TO GIVE IN

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ This time, the heartache lasted longer than
it used to, just as all the other aches are starting to for Bruce
Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Losing has always hurt Armstrong, who for so many years was the
very best player on some very bad Patriot teams. Even in some of
the darkest years, he never seemed able to accept that his team was
going to lose and lose and lose some more, and that caused him
great pain and frustration, which cannot be said of all his former
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But last season's ending was different somehow. The pain was
deeper and the ache lasted longer, and Armstrong now knows why.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar made it different. Armstrong is getting old _ or,
at least, older _ in a job that has no respect for aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I ever thought about the end coming for me was
after the Pittsburgh (playoff) game,'' the six-time Pro Bowl tackle
explained. ``That was bad. It took me a week _ ah, 10 days _ to get
over it. I always thought we'd win that game. Even on the last
drive, I thought we'd win and go on to the (AFC) championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all those years when you knew your season would be over
on Dec. 17 or something, it was difficult to accept. We had every
intention of changing our history in the Pittsburgh game, so to
lose, 7-6, on the last series ... it gave such a sense of finality
to the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I went home, I kept thinking about it. I couldn't forget
the game. Then it came to me what it was. I knew for the first time
what the end would be like for me. It was a rough week or 10
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Armstrong got over it, just as he has gotten over so
many other losses in his 11 years in New England. It's gone now, if
not quite forgotten, and he is back at 32 to try to do a little bit
more this time. To try a little bit harder not to lose the last
game of this season.
</P>
<P>
   He is trying to do that while wearing a walking cast. There is a
bone in his leg that seems ready to give in and needs constant
shoring up, like a steep hill next to the house that needs a
retaining wall to keep it in its place. Armstrong is wearing that
cast wherever he goes, but he's also playing football the same way
as always _ intensely and with purpose.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way he intends to play tonight against the Minnesota
Vikings in an exhibition game that he could certainly skip but
won't because to do that as 33 approaches is to court your own
demise.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to his decision than survival, just as there
was more to that loss in Pittsburgh than there seemed at first.
Simply put, you don't take days off if you want to become a
seven-pineapple guy.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's media guide, every Patriot who has gone to a Pro
Bowl in Hawaii has the blue outline of a pineapple next to his
name. Drew Bledsoe has three of them. Ben Coates has four. But no
one except the Dole Company has more pineapples in New England than
Armstrong, so he goes to work with a slight limp to keep them and
the victories coming in the hope that one day he will have a season
when his team is out of games before it's out of victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember what those first years were like,'' Armstrong said
of the seasons between 1987 and Bill Parcells's arrival in 1993.
``If I'd had to spend my entire career that way, my only
accomplishment would be you made a lot of money. You wouldn't have
achieved anything. I didn't know that before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we won (the Super Bowl) two years ago, it might be
questionable if I'd be playing. But we didn't. That's why I wanted
to come back here and get better. You can't assume you've got 14 or
15 years to win it. I'm shooting for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be rough to play all your life and never win a
championship, but I never won one in high school or college so I
know there's no guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   There is only work and hope and the firm knowledge that, as you
get older, the pain gets worse when you lose and there's only one
way to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, you gotta make a drive like the one we didn't
make in Pittsburgh,'' Armstrong said. ``Someone has to make The
Catch like Dwight Clark did for the 49ers or The Drive like John
Elway did for Denver. At some point, you've got to escalate
yourself from the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, Bruce Armstrong did that a long time ago. Now, in
his 12th season of professional football, he has but one hope for
his newest and perhaps most talent-laden team. He hopes they're
ready to join him.

   Speculation that Patriots tight end  &UR; Ben Coates  &LR; could be the
first test case of the league's new anti-violence policy has been
overstated. First, it would apply only if Coates is convicted of
the assault charge he faces. The mere fact that he was involved in
a driveway altercation with a former girlfriend is not, in itself,
enough to compel commissioner  &UR; Paul Tagliabue  &LR; to fine or suspend
Coates. Secondly, and perhaps most important, the NFL Players
Association has never agreed to the policy's language, although it
supports the intent. ``We are not going to comment on any specific
case, but everybody is interested in making sure violence off the
field is not a part of NFL football,'' said  &UR; Doug Allen &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the
union's assistant executive director. ``But the policy itself is
not something the union has agreed to or signed off on. The
discretion the commissioner has in this area is a function of the
language in the basic agreement, not the new policy. We are
confident Paul will exercise that authority appropriately. The
commissioner has taken a deliberative and responsible approach in
deciding issues before him concerning drug policy cases, so we're
not suggesting we don't have confidence in him with this new
policy. We do. We don't oppose the notion, either, but we have
never agreed to its language so we don't feel our members can be
held to the strict language of that policy, because we didn't agree
to it.'' ... In his time, special teamer  &UR; John Henry Mills &LR;  has
played linebacker, fullback, and tight end but never for long in
first Houston and now Oakland. The six-year veteran began saying,
``I have skills,'' a few years back when asked what position he
played, since not even he could describe exactly what he did for a
living. Eventually Mills parlayed ``Mills has skills'' into a
charitable foundation of the same name. Last week he was seen at
Raider training camp wearing a cap with ``Skills, Inc.'' on the
front, and when he couldn't get a license plate reading SKILLS
(already taken, by someone else with skills, one supposes) he
settled for 5KILL5. Close enough ... While the multifaceted Raider
offense is set at the skill positions, Oakland is still looking for
a right guard. Four players have been tried there this summer, but
neither  &UR; Scott Whittaker &LR; , &UR; Derrick Graham &LR; , &UR; Darryl Ashmore &LR; , nor
 &UR; Gennaro DiNapoli  &LR; has asserted himself. DiNapoli is a rookie who
was given work with the first team last week ... Old friend  &UR; Pat
Harlow  &LR; reports that his back is fine after another operation but
says his new blond hairdo might not play in New England. ``Out here
it's trendy,'' Harlow said of the Bay area. ``Back in New England,
you're a jerk.'' ... 49ers coach  &UR; Steve Mariucci  &LR; is publicly
saying the right things about AWOL left tackle  &UR; Jamie Brown &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but
privately he was seething last week when Brown did not show up for
the first exhibition game after it was announced he would not play
because of a recurrent hamstring and groin problem. Brown told no
one he wouldn't be at 3Com Park to watch the Niners play the
Patriots. He apologized to his teammates, claiming he was
``frustrated.'' Mariucci is frustrated as well. He traded a
second-round draft pick to Denver for Brown, who had done little
with the Broncos but show promise. ``I am going to allow him to
prove to us he is what we hoped he would be,'' Mariucci said. ``I'm
going to give him an opportunity to work his way back in. When he's
ready to contribute, he'll be given every opportunity and we'll
leave it at that.'' A minute later Mariucci said, ``We had _ have _
starting expectations for him. Now that's not necessarily a given.
You know, you don't hand a guy that unless he performs to that
level, and he will be given every opportunity to show, and
hopefully that occurs soon.'' Two minutes later he was praising
 &UR; Dave Fiore &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who handled the position against the Patriots and
will do the same this weekend in San Diego. Fiore had not started a
game since he was at Hofstra in 1995.

   On Tuesday,  &UR; Jerry Rice  &LR; participated in his first full-speed
workout of the summer and beat at least one young cornerback deep.
He also slipped and fell several times without any aftereffects to
his surgically repaired kneecap, which was broken last season when
he unwisely tried to come back too soon from an early season
injury. The 49ers have said Rice will not play in any of their
exhibition games, but Rice has told friends he might test himself
Aug. 23 at home against Miami because the game will be on natural
turf. To give you an idea of just how cautiously Rice is being
handled, at one point Tuesday cornerback  &UR; Tony Blevins  &LR; unwittingly
bumped into Rice during a seven-on-seven drill and said, ``Sorry, I
didn't know it was you.'' Rice is notorious for his workout fervor
and is not happy about the restrictions on him but is trying to
cope. ``I'm not comfortable with it, but Steve is going to make the
decision,'' Rice said. ``I feel it's always good to get some kind
of timing before that first game. But if I have to go in a little
sluggish and work my way through it, I will. I just hope that I go
out there and everything comes back without thinking about it.''
After 11 Pro Bowl seasons, Rice should be on safe ground ... Former
49ers tight end  &UR; Brent Jones  &LR; got his baptism by fire as a
journalist when he visited the Raiders' training camp as a
correspondent for CBS. As Jones walked by Raiders owner  &UR; Al
Davis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; he heard Davis mumble something about calling security.
Jones tried to explain by saying, ``Mr. Davis, I'm now with CBS,
covering the AFC.'' Davis snapped back, ``I know who you're with.
It's the other thing'' _ i.e. being an ex-49er _ ``I wonder about,
and why they let you in.'' Jones was once critical of the way Davis
ran the Raiders in comparison to the way  &UR; Eddie DeBartolo  &LR; ran the
49ers. The Raiders have had a longstanding territorial feud with
the 49ers and their former club president,  &UR; Carmen Policy &LR; , which
reportedly is the reason the two refuse to play a quite logical
preseason game ... Speaking of Policy, he seems to have saddled up
the right horse after resigning his $1.5 million-a-year job as
president of the 49ers. Policy recently joined forces with  &UR; Al
Lerner &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the credit card billionaire, to form one of an expected
half-dozen groups trying to buy the new Cleveland franchise. The
NFL has hired the investment banking firm Goldman Sachs to review
the proposals, and it won't hurt that Lerner has had a long-term
relationship with at least one of Goldman Sachs's top executives
and is a friend of former Browns owner  &UR; Art Modell &LR;  (he flew Modell
on his private plane to Baltimore when Modell was making his escape
plans from Cleveland). Although some NFL owners were peeved when
Policy quit the 49ers because they believe he's trying to convince
other potential bidders to pull out (and thus drive the price
down), he is well-known and respected among the owners who will
approve the winning bid. In other words, slam dunk for Policy as
long as the numbers are big enough on Lerner's offer sheet.

   It's interesting that reports of a background check requested by
the Jacksonville Jaguars and Chicago Bears into a group called
Champions for Christ came only after Bears executive  &UR; Ted Phillips
 &LR; grew exasperated over the holdout of running back  &UR; Curtis Enis
 &LR; and called a Jaguar executive to inquire about an agent he knew
little about. Enis had dumped his original agents last month and
signed with  &UR; Greg Feste &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is a friend of several members of
Champions for Christ and had never negotiated a major NFL contract.
When a clause in the contract became a sticking point, Phillips,
who thought he'd nearly closed the deal with Enis's original
agents, called the Jaguars because they have an unusual number of
players affiliated with the religious group. Now, suddenly, the
Bears and Jaguars say their concern is not Enis's holdout but that
players may be giving too much money to the group. ``We've never
had a complaint from a player about them,'' an NFLPA union source
said. ``I don't think that's what's motivating this. It has
everything to do with Enis not being in camp and not that anyone is
afraid he'll give too much money to Champions for Christ.'' The
union has monitored the negotiations, and although it concedes that
Feste has been a little more aggressive than some agents, it
insists he is not ``coming out of left field.'' ... Miami coach
 &UR; Jimmy Johnson  &LR; has been pleasantly surprised by the play of No. 1
draft choice  &UR; John Avery &LR; , who came from Mississippi with the
reputation of being a small, quick, third-down type back who could
not take enough of a pounding to play regularly. He reportedly has
shown enough in training camp to begin running with the first team
and remains in a battle with veteran  &UR; Karim Abdul-Jabbar &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
scored 15 touchdowns last season but averaged only 3.2 yards a
carry ... You've got to like the attitude of new Vikings owner  &UR; Red
McCombs &LR; , who is nothing if not an optimist. After first being
rebuffed when he tried to buy the franchise, McCombs hung tough and
closed the deal after novelist  &UR; Tom Clancy  &LR; lost his hunt for real
cash. After McCombs's $250 million offer was finally accepted, he
looked at his new property and declared, ``I think this team has a
very good chance of winning every game on the schedule.'' Don't
they play the Packers and Buccaneers twice? They do, but you have
to like his attitude. McCombs also said he would not consider
moving the Vikings despite the fact he is a Texan who also owns the
San Antonio Spurs and is unhappy with the Metrodome lease, which he
says is one of the NFL's worst. Why does everyone's lease become
``one of the NFL's worst'' a couple of years after it's signed?
Well, in McCombs's case, consider this: The Vikings pay the city of
Minneapolis $1 million a year for control of their luxury suites,
receive only 10 percent of the concessions and none of the signage
fees, and pay the city a 10 percent tax on ticket sales ... Anybody
seen  &UR; Curtis Martin  &LR; lately? The Jets haven't. Martin continues to
struggle with hamstring and hip woes ... Actor  &UR; Dennis Quaid  &LR; has
been studying the passing form of the 49ers'  &UR; Steve Young  &LR; to
prepare himself for a role as a lefthanded quarterback in a film
called, ``Any Given Sunday.'' When Mariucci was asked what he
thought of Quaid's passing form, he said, ``He can't throw a cat
out of the house.''

VIKINGS WILL PROVIDE FAST LESSON FOR JONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Tebucky Jones: fast-forward.
</P>
<P>
   The acceleration of Jones's professional career has begun, and
the Patriots' rookie cornerback will be taken to new, challenging
heights tonight at Foxboro Stadium, when he'll be up against a very
talented Minnesota Vikings receiver corps, with the distinct
possibility he'll have to cover Randy Moss, the 6-foot-5-inch
rookie from Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has received plenty of reps with the first team in the
past few days, covering both Terry Glenn and Shawn Jefferson,
winning some battles and losing others. In any event, he's winning
brownie points for effort and toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very physical player,'' said Jefferson. ``Once he
understands the receivers in the league and what they do and don't
do, he's going to be a tough corner in this league. He's learning
as he goes along right now, but he's been impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've all tried to help him a little bit with
different pointers, and he's not afraid to ask questions like, `Why
did you do that move?' and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is almost fully recovered from the hamstring problem that
plagued him earlier in camp, but still can't completely turn on the
burners and show his 4.3 speed. But the Patriots continue to hope
that Jones makes enough progress between now and the start of the
regular season to earn a starting role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now he's as green as a pea,'' said defensive coordinator
Steve Sidwell. ``He's done some good things and he's learning fast,
but right now that position is a real question mark for us. No one
has been able to take the job yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Jones nor last year's No. 1 choice, Chris Canty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris has made great progress and his attitude is so much
better than a year ago,'' said Sidwell. ``The job is there for the
taking, and Chris could be the one who takes it. But right now that
hasn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be an interesting juxtaposition in Foxborough tonight
as Jimmy Hitchcock, the cornerback traded by the Patriots as they
placed their faith in Jones, plays for the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the action is liable to be on the right side of the
field, as Drew Bledsoe is likely to throw the ball often to
Hitchcock's side, while the Vikings' Brad Johnson is expected to
test Jones and Canty often.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe has had a strong week of practice; the timing of his
passes seems much sharper than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see some things cleaning up,'' said coach Pete
Carroll. ``The passing game has shown some good signs. Drew has
been on the money for the most part, and I'm hoping we can carry
that into the game. He has to feel the live rush and get the ball
up in time. We look like we're progressing.''
</P>
<P>
   After a subpar effort against the 49ers a week ago, the Patriots
placed a lot of emphasis on the running game. In San Francisco,
they averaged only 2.8 yards a carry, far short of the 4 yards
they're hoping for. Tonight they expect to give the bulk of the
running load to the Shaws, Sedrick and Harold.
</P>
<P>
   Sedrick Shaw had gains of 6 and 9 yards last week but averaged
only 3 yards per carry. The Patriots will be looking for him to
turn the corner and get the ball upfield more.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are more and more impressed with the straight-ahead
running of Harold Shaw, who had an excellent week in practice and
is quickly moving up the depth chart while No. 1 pick Robert
Edwards's groin heals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity that I need to take advantage of,'' said
Harold Shaw. ``You get to this level, you don't have much time to
show what you can do, so you'd better go all out all the time and
open some eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot, 230-pound sixth-round pick out of Southern
Mississippi could very well wind up being the sleeper in the
Patriots' draft. He's already proven to be a punishing type of
runner, and his style makes it easier for the offensive line to
run-block.
</P>
<P>
   Many eyes, too, will be on veteran offensive tackle Bruce
Armstrong, who is wearing a brace on his right leg to protect what
could be a broken fibula. The Patriots say Armstrong is doing well
with the brace and they don't believe they are taking any
unnecessary risks by letting him play.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there should be significant playing time for second-year
tackle Ed Ellis, who at 6-6, 347 pounds has really come on. The
soft-spoken Ellis has been nasty in practice all week, including
getting involved in an altercation with safety Larry Whigham.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, who has spent entire afternoon practices on special
teams, is hoping to see the fruits of that emphasis with strong
play tonight. He has been looking for a few good head hunters and
appears to have them on cover teams this year.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll expects his first offense to stay on the field for
almost a half or until a pattern of success develops, which it
never did in the 21 plays Bledsoe was involved in against the
49ers.

FIRED UP MCGINEST READY TO FLATTEN FOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Coaches might swallow 10 or 20 or more of
their whistles if they could concoct from scratch _ and then bottle
_ that silent trust that binds the defense of the New England
Patriots. It is the intangible of all intangibles, that unspoken
bond, that oneness, that chemistry, that trust in each other that
needs to be there for the job to be done.
</P>
<P>
   The offense of the Patriots doesn't have it the way the defense
does. And neither is there that silent trust between the offense
and the defense, as was much too clear in the final eeks of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   On the New England defense, there seem to be no individuals,
even though there are many very good individual players. Ty Law is
a very good player, but he talks team; Willie Clay is very good,
but he talks team; the same with Lawyer Milloy and the linebackers
in front of him, Ted Johnson, Chris Slade, Todd Collins, and Tedy
Bruschi. The silent trust among them is huge; they all have eyes to
see a good thing building but very few ``I's'' to disrupt it.
</P>
<P>
   And up front, on the line, there is Willie McGinest. The tone
and tenor of Pete Carroll's defense is to attack, and no one
attacks more than the Elephant Man himself, defensive end Willie
McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thing as a defense is just to stay sound, make plays and
keep our offense on the field,'' said McGinest. ``The big thing is
to be the aggressor, to attack. We're always in the attack mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what McGinest has been in camp, chasing down Patriot
quarterbacks, even getting involved in a scuffle on Thursday,
attacking, attacking, attacking _ and doing it loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all pretty vocal on defense because we all understand
each other on defense so well,'' said Milloy, a safety. ``We don't
have one particular leader of the group.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Milloy went on, ``Willie's one of the more vocal leaders of
the group. Willie kind of speaks for the defense when we have our
team meetings, you know, that kind of leader. But, as far as the
huddle is concerned, every one has something to say when they want
to say, and every one listens because we have respect in that
huddle. But Willie can be vocal.''
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, and well into the season, though, McGinest
was uncommonly quiet, bothered by injuries (hamstring and knee),
and it was not until December that McGinest was himself. And not
coincidentally, it was in December that the Patriot defense bonded
and became one of the NFL's best _ if not the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurt last year and it took me a while to get back,''
said McGinest. ``But then (the knee) started to get better and we
started to play very well and it just seemed to carry over and
over. And now we're a lot further along than last year. I think
we're going to be even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy, like other Patriots, noticed ``how much it really hurt
Willie not to be there early last year with the injuries he had.
This year Willie wants to be with us from beginning to end and it's
showing in a lot of ways, especially his attitude toward the game
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot defense had been reasonably solid, but erratic late
in games, through the 1997 season until the team arrived in
Jacksonville last Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when it really turned around for us,'' said McGinest.
``I don't think Jacksonville had lost at home for something like
three seasons, but that's when guys started making a lot of plays
and we finally seemed to understand what we had to do. Our defense
had been doing all right, but that Jacksonville game was when we
took a stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a perfect time for us to try and play a perfect
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The best word to describe what happened to the defense last
December is that it ``clicked.'' Using an untold variety of schemes
and blitzes, the defense had the Jacksonville, Miami, and
Pittsburgh offenses almost completely off balance, leaving
quarterbacks such as Mark Brunell, Dan Marino, and Kordell Stewart
confused more often than not. The return of McGinest to full health
was a key to the New England defensive surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this year, we've got the same system and guys are a lot
further along in understanding it,'' said McGinest. ``We're not
really confused and we're putting a lot of stuff together and now
everybody's on the same track; the difference is it's happening a
lot earlier this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the first time in franchise history, the Patriots
could be known first, last, and foremost as a defensive team,
conjuring up images of Steel Curtains and cries of ``Dee-fense'' in
Foxboro Stadium. Indeed, if the Patriots don't find a running game,
the defense had better be as good as it was last December and
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got something special here,'' McGinest said. ``And as
long as we keep progressing, and understanding what we're doing,
and doing it all together, then we'll be a good defense.''

<P>
   Getting stronger
</P>
<P>
   McGinest plays the ``Elephant'' position, lining up at defensive
end opposite the strong side of the offense, often going against
the tight end. Ray Hamilton, his defensive line coach, compares
McGinest to players of Hamilton's era, a combination of the very
quick former Patriot defensive end Tony McGee and the strong 49er
end, Fred Dean. As for ``Elephants,'' Hamilton said McGinest is up
on that high shelf with Charles Haley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Willie is that he really, really works hard,''
said Hamilton, ``and he really, really wants to be good. And during
the offseason this year we talked to Willie about improving the
strength of his lower body. Willie was already very strong in his
upper body but in order to get his rush going a little quicker, he
needed to increase his leg strength. And Willie came into camp a
lot stronger in his legs and you can see it already. He's
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest already had a quick rush but now, said Hamilton, ``He
can push those tackles back a little more and, if you can combine
the strength move along with his speed move, he can keep (an
offensive lineman) guessing all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, said Hamilton, ``This is the healthiest Willie has
been since he's been here. He hasn't missed a day. I mean, last
year at this time I didn't even have him. He got hurt, then he came
back and he got hurt, and even when he came back again, he was
still hobbling. It wasn't until December that he got going, and
when Willie's going, he's just a blur. To be as big and as strong
as he is, and to be as fast as he is, he is ideal for the Elephant
position we play him.''
</P>
<P>
   As his teammates say, so does Hamilton that ``McGinest is a very
active guy in there (the huddle) with his mouth. He's revving up
his teammates, but it also revs himself up. He's such a competitive
guy; he wants to win every snap.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, said Hamilton, McGinest is more comfortable this
season playing on the tight end. Last year, said Hamilton,
``Because it was new to him, he was being aggressive but he wasn't
quite getting it done the way we wanted to get it done. But this
year is like night and day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' approach toward the Elephant position is very
simple, said Hamilton:
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that when a defensive lineman is on a tight end it's
a mismatch. He should kill the tight end every play. Last year,
Willie was thinking too much about his responsibility, but this
year he's just manhandling the tight end.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest, of course, started out his career with the Patriots as
a linebacker ``but that was a waste of his pass-rushing skills
there,'' said Hamilton. ``So we felt we'd put a few pounds on him,
line him up at end and have him come a-humming.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, if not decades, it has been the Patriot offense that
has been forced to rescue the defense by scoring points. By the end
of last season, though, the situation had been reversed and the
frustration of some defenders toward the offense was well known.
</P>
<P>
   In a horrible loss last December to the Steelers in OT at
Foxborough, and then two wins over the Dolphins and finally the 7-6
loss to Pittsburgh in the playoffs, the Patriot defense kept
getting better and better while the offense was getting worse and
worse. By season's end, it was clear to fans that New England's
defense not only had to stop the other team, but also had to score
TDs itself if the Patriots were to win, the offense being beset
with injuries to key players.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, some on the Patriot defense felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understood that for us to be a successful team, we were
going to have to go out and stop people and make plays and
turnovers and cause fumbles and keep our offense in position to
score,'' said McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the defense views the offense today, McGinest said,
``We don't control what the offense does. All I know is that as
soon as we start worrying about what Drew (Bledsoe) and the rest of
the guys are doing, then it takes away from us. I mean, the offense
has a new coordinator, a lot of new things and new players, and I'm
sure by the time we get to Denver (for the opening game) they
should be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   No need to even voice the words: McGinest is sure the defense
will be all right.
</P>
<P>
   A defensive alliance
</P>
<P>
   Chris Slade and McGinest have been the closest of pals since
McGinest arrived with the Patriots in 1994, a year after Slade. The
word ``close'' would be an understatement to describe their
friendship; on the field or off, McGinest and Slade seldom are far
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had heard of each other _ I knew of him and he knew of me _
but we'd never met until Willie came to camp,'' said Slade. ``We
hit it off right away. It was like we complemented each other; he
was looking for the same thing I was looking for and we had the
same type of style, we were the same type of guy on the field. You
know, a pass-rush guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just clicked from the jump, you know? It was like one of
those `love at first sight, friends at first sight' kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing about Willie is he's a `go-hard guy' all the
time, very competitive on the field. Willie's so competitive and
he's got such a great work ethic. Willie's the kind of guy you
really want to have on your team when it's time to go to war. You
can always count on him to be there for you.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the sanitized newspaper version. Slade then laughed
and gave a more playful view, saying, ``Willie's kind of a loud guy
_ too loud, real obnoxious loud _ he always wants everybody to know
who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a tough side to him, but he's also a gentle guy at
the same time,'' said Slade. ``You know what I mean? Willie puts on
an image that he's a real tough, street-kind of guy _ which he is _
but really he's very generous and sensitive and caring.''
</P>
<P>
   The two used to have a friendly wager each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was over whether Willie or me would get the most sacks,''
said Slade. ``But one time we did that, we kind of jinxed ourselves
and neither of us got any sacks for a few weeks, so this year we're
not going to do that.''

EXPERT ESCAPE ARTIST STRIKES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Tyson told the world the truth about himself recently, but,
as has been the case throughout much of his life, the world didn't
want to listen.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Tyson doesn't want to fight anymore but the world
can't accept that, just as it still can't accept that Evander
Holyfield twice destroyed Godzilla with relative ease and will do
it again if the occasion presents itself. The world hears one thing
but believes another.
</P>
<P>
   The world wants to tell itself that Tyson's sudden, angry
display of temper in front of the people he was supposedly pleading
with to have his boxing license reinstated was a sign of his animal
lust for confrontation. It wants to believe his expletive-laced
explosion was about anger and frustration and pent-up rage, the
kind of rage that can earn you big money in a boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the world wants to believe because the portion of it
interested in boxing has invested a lot of time, money, and psychic
energy in that fiction and would rather it not be exposed for what
it has always been _ a Halloween ghost story with punch.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's eruption in front of the New Jersey Athletic Control
Board July 29 was really a search for a way out, which is the way
he has taken most of his life and the way his long line of enablers
has let him go time and again.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern continues today with a new set of advisers, veteran
fight manager Shelly Finkel, and music impresarios-turned-fight
guys Irving Azoff and Jeff Wald. Together they allowed Tyson not to
face what he needed to face, which was the truth of what he did to
Holyfield's ears on June 26, 1997, in a Las Vegas ring.
</P>
<P>
   They allowed him a way out of going back to the scene of the
crime and asking for his license back, the same license Nevada
revoked after he tore a chunk of Holyfield's ear off rather than
take another long beating from the heavyweight champion of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was looking for a way out of the ring that night, an
action predicted 24 hours earlier by his former trainer, Teddy
Atlas. Tyson took it and learned nothing from it.
</P>
<P>
   When he insisted on seeking a license in New Jersey, he was
looking for a way out of having to go back to Nevada and beg for a
chance to go to work. Finkel provided that by claiming his fighter
might have a better chance of being reinstated elsewhere because
Tyson's former promoter, Don King, has influence in Nevada and
might try and use it.
</P>
<P>
   This implies that King has little influence in New Jersey, where
he was just relicensed as a promoter only weeks after beating
federal insurance fraud charges for the second time. If Finkel
believes King has no influence there, he must also believe in the
Tooth Fairy.
</P>
<P>
   When Tyson slammed his hand down on a table near the end of a
three-hour hearing and refused to read a prepared closing
statement, he knew what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   When his attorney, Anthony Fusco Jr., tried to calm him by
telling the board, ``How many times does one individual have to be
asked, `Are you sorry for what you did?''' Tyson interrrupted his
lawyer and said loud enough for the board to hear, ``Why do I got
to go through this (expletive) all the time?'' When he said those
words, he knew what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   It was all as orchestrated as the punches Tyson used to throw in
precise combinations in the days when many thought he was a
wrecking ball. This was no display of unbridled rage, but Tyson is
smart enough to know that's how the world would look at it.
</P>
<P>
   This was the act of a career con man looking for a way out of
something he doesn't want to do anymore, which is fight to make
other people rich. As Tyson rounded his shoulders and sunk his neck
into them, his eyes reduced to beady slits, he resembled a rat with
his tail between his legs, scurrying to find an exit from a long
tunnel he'd been running down for too long.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his life, Tyson has been a fighter who conned
people. He has been a powerful puncher who could pressure others
but couldn't take the pressure himself. The few times he was put
under it, he snapped or caved in because, as Holyfield put it
perfectly before their first fight, ``Pressure busts pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year suspension, Tyson is now under that pressure again.
Although he has assets, he has no cash, according to people who
should know. He needs money, and the only way he knows how to get
it is to fight, but he doesn't want to fight, for a simple reason.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every heartache Tyson has ever had came from fighting.
Sure, he's made hundreds of millions of dollars, become world
famous, and dragged himself out of the ghetto through boxing, but
he's also become the target of public ridicule, a convicted rapist,
a social misfit, and a failed fighter who lost his honor in a
boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   I have spent more than a little time around Tyson since he
became a professional fighter. I do not claim to know him _ how can
you know someone who doesn't know himself? _ but what I do know is
that this has always been a man living a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is a man who talks of how much he loves his children yet
is seldom in the same state with them _ even now, when he's free to
live where he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is a man who had a homecoming parade and party after
leaving prison. The parade was through the streets of Harlem, where
he never lived one day of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is a man who claims Holyfield kept butting him, when every
tape of those fights shows Tyson, not Holyfield, leading with his
head. Holyfield simply refused to back up when charged as so many
of Tyson's victims had before him.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is a man who repeatedly has claimed he is ``sorry for what
I did,'' to Holyfield, yet every time he's said that, he's almost
immediately claimed Holyfield butted him in both fights and he then
``snapped,'' which is another way of saying he wasn't responsible.
</P>
<P>
   That's always been the bottom line with Tyson. He's never
responsible. He's always the victim. He's always ``poor Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   He's broke, but that's King's fault.
</P>
<P>
   He's convicted of rape, but that's the fault of the young woman
and a bad lawyer, not to mention a racist society.
</P>
<P>
   He lost badly to Buster Douglas, but that was the fault of a
referee who couldn't count.
</P>
<P>
   He lost to Holyfield, but that was the referee's fault or his
trainer's fault.
</P>
<P>
   He was disqualified the second time for twice biting Holyfield,
but that was Holyfield's fault.
</P>
<P>
   He got his license revoked in Nevada, but that was Nevada's
fault.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I believe, Tyson is hoping he won't get that license back
in New Jersey because then he will have an excuse not to face what
he has to face and he'll have someone else to blame.
</P>
<P>
   He won't have to face Holyfield, or the fishbowl existence
boxing has turned his life into, or King, or the bloodsuckers who
will replace King, or the media who hound him. He won't have to
face any of that, and, best of all, he'll have an excuse for his
latest misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   He'll blame the New Jersey Athletic Control Board. He'll say
he's a victim, and he knows the world will believe him because it
doesn't want to know the truth any more than he does.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing, though, is that Tyson told the world the truth
not long after his outburst in New Jersey. After the proceedings in
Newark ended, he was taken into a conference room by his handlers
and when he came out Tyson signed autographs and told reporters,
``I never lost my cool.''
</P>
<P>
   He was telling you the truth then, folks. A con man never loses
his cool. He just does what he has to do and says what he has to
say to avoid facing the truth. The world should understand that
about Tyson because he's been doing that for a long, long time, and
a year off couldn't change that.
</P>
<P>
   As Tyson's old guru, Cus D'Amato, used to say, ``A guy born
round don't die square.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Main Events promoter  &UR; Dino Duva  &LR; was in federal court last week
with his newest fighter, International Boxing Federation
welterweight champion  &UR; Felix Trinidad &LR; , &UR;  &LR; to do battle with King,
Trinidad's former promoter. Duva claims Trinidad's deal expired
June 11 and that an extension clause King included in the middle of
a bout agreement for a fight with  &UR; Troy Waters  &LR; is not valid. Duva
has a lot riding on this because the multimillion-dollar agreement
he signed with HBO to televise Trinidad fights was contingent on
Duva proving Trinidad was free to enter into a promotional deal
with him by Aug. 21. Without HBO's millions, Duva could not sign
Trinidad, who wants no part of returning to King's stable but may
have no choice if he loses. The judge hearing the case is  &UR; Lawrence
McKenna &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who just presided over the government's failed insurance
fraud case against King. McKenna listened to several hours of
arguments from Duva's lawyer,  &UR; Pat English &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and King's longtime
representative,  &UR; Peter Fleming &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and is expected to rule
expeditiously. ``Don inserted what appeared to be an
inconsequential sentence or two in the Waters bout agreement that
was different from Trinidad's multifight agreement with King,'' a
source close to the case said. ``Those sentences extended the deal,
but there's a legal question whether or not he can do that.'' ...
Featherweight champion  &UR; Prince Naseem Hamed  &LR; finally appears set to
fight  &UR; Kennedy McKinney  &LR; on Halloween night, but not at Madison
Square Garden as originally planned. The fight is headed to  &UR; Steve
Wynn's  &LR; newest Las Vegas hotel, which has yet to open. The date has
already been reserved with the Nevada State Athletic Commission,
but the Garden reportedly has the right to match Wynn's price.
Don't count on it ... Veteran referee  &UR; Mills Lane  &LR; continues to
negotiate with Fox network for a job as a ringside commentator. If
he accepts that position, his career as a referee would be over,
according to both Lane and Nevada Athletic Commission executive
director  &UR; Marc Ratner &LR; . ``Mills is 60 years old and I think he's
looking long-term,'' Ratner said. ``If he gets a long-term contract
with Fox and goes full-time, he wouldn't be allowed to referee in
Nevada because it would be a real conflict. He understands that and
accepts it.'' ... The America Presents card in El Paso Friday will
decide who fights for the vacant World Boxing Council super
lightweight title. No. 1 contender and former WBC lightweight
champion  &UR; Miguel Angel Gonzalez  &LR; takes on two-time IBF junior
lightweight champion  &UR; John John Molina  &LR; in one bout, and assuming
Gonzalez survives that match, he'll square off with the winner of a
12-round elimination bout between No. 2 contender and former IBF
junior welterweight champion  &UR; Kosta Tszyu  &LR; (20-1-1) and No. 3-rated
ex-IBF lightweight champion  &UR; Rafael Ruelas  &LR; later this year. It
would be Gonzalez's third try at the 140-pound title. He vacated
the lightweight title to move up and challenge  &UR; Oscar De La Hoya
 &LR; and lost a lopsided 12-round decision. Then he fought  &UR; Julio Cesar
Chavez  &LR; to a controversial draw when they met for the vacant title
in March ... In case you missed it (and you probably did),
heavyweight prospect  &UR; Ike Ibeabuchi  &LR; (18-0) returned to the ring
last month for the first time since he upset  &UR; David Tua  &LR; and
stopped  &UR; Tim Ray  &LR; in one round. It was good to see Ibeabuchi back
after a tortured time in his private life when he was found to be
suffering from manic depression. That led him into a near-fatal car
accident that some believe was a suicide attempt and an assault on
the young son of his ex-girlfriend when she left him on the same
day. Ibeabuchi spent a brief time in a Texas jail while the matter
was sorted out. He was seen as a rising star after he upset Tua but
has slipped from the public consciousness of late.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The same week Tyson announced he would seek a license to box in
New Jersey, a federal appeals court reinstated a $4.4 million
judgment against him won by his former trainer,  &UR; Kevin Rooney &LR; .
With interest, it comes to $7.6 million, and Tyson reportedly
doesn't have the money. Tyson announced his decision to return to
boxing 48 hours after the ruling. Rooney had this to say about his
ex-fighter's financial plight: ``He says he's broke but he's got
things to sell. He can sell a house and a few cars. Way I figure
it, he's made $180 million since he dumped me. Ten percent of that
is a lotta house.'' ... Chavez was ordered to appear before the
Nevada State Athletic Commission medical board July 31 to have his
cut eye examined by a plastic surgeon to avoid a repeat of the
fiasco when he lost his first meeting with De La Hoya on cuts and
later claimed he'd gone into the fight already cut. Ratner,
executive director of the commission, &UR;  &LR; said Chavez was found 100
percent healthy ... Little-known Danish heavyweight  &UR; Brian
Nielsen &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who holds the even lesser-known International Boxing
Organization heavyweight title, has shifted his training to  &UR; Janks
Morton's  &LR; gym in Washington, D.C. Despite a hand injury, he hopes
he can get himself into the big-money heavyweight sweepstakes in
the US. Nielsen ballooned to nearly 300 pounds while unable to
train because of hand problems.

   Probably few people watched  &UR; Vinny Pazienza  &LR; and  &UR; Glenwood Brown
 &LR; do battle recently, but it was a fight  &UR; Rocky Graziano  &LR; and  &UR; Tony
Zale  &LR; would have appreciated. This was not a fight for big money or
a world title. It was just two professionals battling with all
their hearts to show the other what the word ``fighter'' means. In
the end, Pazienza won the way he has so often _ not because of his
skill but because of his will. After three rounds, his nose was
broken, he had been knocked to one knee, and soon after was also
cut above the eye. This led Brown to wrongly conclude _ as  &UR; Dana
Rosenblatt  &LR; once did _ that, ``When I hit Vinny with that left hook
in the third, I thought it was all over. But he showed what a great
champion he is by coming back. I hit him with some great shots and
he took them.'' With the fight dead even, Pazienza came out for the
final round and landed 66 of 113 punches. Had this been a 12-round
world title fight, that pace would have yielded 1,356 punches and
792 connections. That is what people have so long paid for with
Pazienza. He now hopes to convince IBF super mid-dleweight champion
 &UR; Charles Brewer  &LR; to give him a title shot by the end of the year
before he calls it a career ... After denying a report from this
corner weeks ago that he was contemplating a comeback, former super
middleweight champion Irish  &UR; Steve Collins  &LR; has confirmed that he
is plotting to come out of retirement if he can lure  &UR; Roy Jones
 &LR; into the ring. Collins retired 10 months ago but is now seeking a
tuneup fight with old British rival  &UR; Chris Eubank &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was just
stopped by cruiserweight champion  &UR; Carl Thompson &LR; . Jones's people
are talking with representatives of Collins as well as  &UR; Gianfranco
Rocchigiani &LR; . Eubank would seem a safe start. He's lost four
straight world title fights and is considering retirement himself
... Here's one of the more unusual statistics you're going to find.
Massachusetts middleweight  &UR; Adrian Brown &LR;  is undefeated but has yet
to win a fight. Brown has fought to a draw in each of his first
three bouts ... On a recent card in Hyannis, undefeated  &UR; Billy
Rollins  &LR; (11-0-2) was engaged in a bloody battle with New York's
 &UR; Scott Lopeck &LR; . The timekeeper became so engrossed in the action
that he forgot to ring the bell. Rollins was knocked out 48 seconds
after the third round should have ended. The decision was
eventually changed to a no-contest.

WHAT'S A FOOTBALL FAN TO DO IN AUGUST? WORRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is too early to worry about the Patriots. Everyone who cares
about the team is supposed to know that by now, right? We aren't
even halfway through August, there are still stories in the paper
about New England humidity, General Parcells and his Jets won't be
in Foxborough until October, and we have yet to see the Pats play
in two of the flimsy events that the NFL likes to call preseason
games.
</P>
<P>
   No one frets about football in August. Except, maybe, a chronic
worrier. Which is another way of saying that if this were my team,
I'd never leave the house unless accompanied by an entourage of
Patriot supporters. That way a calming peer group would be in place
when I went into my inevitable problems-of-the-Pats-inspired August
frenzy. Then again, maybe I wouldn't want my entourage around too
often because they just might be wearing, say, a Pats hat and
T-shirt, which would remind me why I was worrying in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to worry. I truly believe that. But two days ago
Pete Carroll stood at a podium in Smithfield, R.I., and calmly said
that his team doesn't have a go-to running back. He also said: ``I
would like to see one guy take the position. I don't know if that
will happen, though. We'll have to wait and see ...''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't that make you nervous?
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be so bad if Carroll were doing the wait-and-see
thing with Terrell Davis, Barry Sanders, and Eddie George competing
for the top spot. But we're talking about, primarily, second-year
man Sedrick Shaw and rookies Harold Shaw and Robert Edwards _ who
just happens to be hurt. All are fighting in a vacuum formerly
known as a solid Curtis Martin/-Sam Gash/-David Meggett/-Keith
Byars backfield. Those runners are gone now, which leads us to
believe that Bob Kraft, Bobby Grier, Carroll, et al must have a
blessed pact with the football gods. Why else would a team allow
its starting and backup backs to walk away with no proven runners
to replace them?
</P>
<P>
   The big story of camp last week was Harold Shaw, a sixth-round
draft pick from Southern Mississippi whose favorite player was a
fellow Mississippian, the great Walter Payton (OK, that's one less
worry: the man has good taste). Harold Shaw, though, is the
anti-Sweetness in that he barrels toward collisions rather than
darting away from them.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Todd Collins still remembers a pop Shaw laid on him
early in training camp. We thought Collins would bring some
serenity to the pack of worriers when he was asked if Shaw reminded
him of anyone. He didn't have to say anything outrageous. But a
reference to Chris Warren wouldn't have been bad. So, how about it,
Todd? Harold Shaw reminds you of ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Harold Shaw,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was asked if the quality play of such a late-round pick
surprised him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a pretty good sixth-round pick in Denver,'' the coach
said, referring to All-Pro and Super Bowl MVP Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh. With that comment, I'm now worried about Pete Carroll.
But it's only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the coach was listed as a team unknown. He had gone
6-10 in his only season as a head coach (with the Jets) and was
replacing Parcells. There were many times when Carroll had that
awkward New Guy look about him. That was a drastic contrast to the
savvy Parcells, whose five best press conferences could be shown on
Classic Sports. You knew Carroll had his own ideas, but you also
knew he didn't want to walk into the locker room with too much
bravado. Especially with a team that had just gone to the Super
Bowl and wasn't losing any major contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been around Carroll this summer have said he is
more confident. And, they say, the man whom Gash and others ripped
for being too laidback has been less hesitant to lash out at
players.
</P>
<P>
   So who are we to worry? It's silly. It's only August. We haven't
even spotted the first tourist driving toward Western
Massachusetts, talking about the wonders of fall foliage. And just
because the Patriots are holding auditions for a lead runner
doesn't mean they won't be able to run the ball. As long as Bruce
Armstrong is on the offensive line, no Pats fan should be
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Bruce Armstrong. The same Bruce Armstrong who, news reports
tell us, could be playing with a broken fibula in his left leg.
Armstrong is a tough man. He is also human. Most humans who do
office jobs would not be able to go to work from September until
January with a problematic fibula. Now imagine what it's like to
throw your body into 300-pound linemen who view you as the sole
nuisance between them and Drew Bledsoe. They aren't concerned about
your fibula or your pain. They want the QB. If Armstrong goes down,
Bledsoe loses his best protector; the young backs lose one of their
best providers; and the team loses a chunk of its offensive soul.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least the team still has its defense. There's not much
to worry about there. As long as you are willing to ignore right
cornerback. Tebucky Jones may be one of the best corners in the AFC
midway through the season. But, by then, the Patriots will have
already played four games against AFC East teams. Steve Israel is
fast _ and hurt. Jones is fast, talented _ and inexperienced at the
position. But you knew the guy was no lightweight corner when he
got into a tangle with Ben Coates and didn't have to be carted out
of Bryant College. And Chris Canty? Canty is, uh, ahem, well ... We
hear Chris Canty is a gifted rapper. In the spirit of that, am I
the only one who hears Public Enemy's Chuck D. singing, ``I've got
so much trouble on my mind ...''?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is too early to worry. Maybe Parcells should be
worrying. He's the one who says he hates penalties and turnovers,
even though he has walking advertisements for both on his team in
the persons of Bryan Cox and Vinny Testaverde. It is too early to
worry. I'm convinced of it. But, I was just wondering, how often do
you pray?

FERNANDEZ CONTINUES TO BEAT THE ODDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Mary Joe Fernandez will be 27 years old next Wednesday, still
young, even if nearly a lifetime removed from turning pro at age 14
when she was all baseline and braces.
</P>
<P>
   Some 13 years later, and about $5 million in winnings to the
plus, she will be here this week competing in the Boston Cup, the
Corel/WTA stop that officially begins Monday at Babson College, the
first women's tour stop in Boston in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Once one of the game's brilliant ingenues, the 5-foot-10-inch
Fernandez now has reached senior status in the valley of the
volleys. Only recently back on tour after undergoing offseason
wrist surgery, her shot revitalized and her legs sharpened by a new
workout routine, she has no plans to move permanently to the
sidelines soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I had endometriosis in 1993, when I was 21 or 22, I
thought I'd be out at 24, max,'' recalled Fernandez, whose painful
bout with scar tissue around her ovaries, ultimately leading to
surgery, proved to be only a temporary setback. ``You know how that
goes: I hit 24 and then it was another number.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, said Fernandez, she talked with Billie Jean King about
what was the right time to bid goodbye to her game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she said to me, `Mary Joe, you have to take it year by
year,''' said Fernandez. ```Look at Martina (Navratilova),' she
said. `She retired five times.' What it comes down to is you have
to evaluate it year by year. Both Martina and Billie Jean were well
into their 30s. She gave me some good advice: `Just play and see
how you feel.' And really, I think that's the best answer.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be difficult for some to fathom Fernandez being on this
side of the playing curve. Only weeks after turning pro in February
1986 she was running around Wimbledon as another of the world's
hard-hitting wunderkinds. Women were getting in the game as girls,
seemingly showing up with their games stronger and ever more
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Even before turning pro, Fernandez became the youngest player
(eight days beyond her 14th birthday) to win a US Open match when
she dumped Sara Gomer in '85. Triumphs such as that led to her
decision while at Sacred Heart Catholic School in Coconut Grove,
Fla., to carry her school books in one arm and sling a racket for a
living with the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is different,'' said Fernandez, recently reflecting
on her decision to turn pro at such a young age. ``There's no
simple answer, because everyone matures and grows at a different
pace. It was right for me to turn pro at 14, but I made a point to
stay in high school and graduate at 17 _ I'm very pro-education;
because you never know what's going to happen. It worked for me,
but it's not the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever the child is, he or she has to love the game of
tennis. I'd say that's the most important part. It's a great game,
a wonderful game, but it's a difficult one, too, full of hard work
and sacrifices. If the person doesn't absolutely love it, it might
not be the best decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez will be joined here by a smattering of the world's top
names, including top seed Amanda Coetzer (ranked No. 8 in the
world), Anke Huber (18), Lisa Raymond (19), and Elena Likhovtseva
(24). It was about this time seven years ago that Fernandez briefly
nosed ahead of Navratilova in the rankings, to No. 4 overall,
making her the highest-ranked American, other than Chris Evert or
Navratilova, since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Fernandez has slipped to No. 50 in the world, after
finishing No. 10 last year with a triumph in the German Open and
nearly $770,000 in prize money. She only recently returned to
competitive play, following nearly a seventh-month layoff after
December surgery that repaired a torn ligament in her right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   It took 14 months of playing in pain to convince Fernandez it
was time to call a timeout and tend to the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taking anti-inflammatories and cortisone, but the pain
was too much,'' recalled Fernandez, reached at her home in Miami
last week before she flew to Boston Friday. ``It was after the
third cortisone shot that the doctor said, `That's it, you can't
have any more shots.' So there was no choice. I know exactly how I
did it. I hit a ball late _ a ball that I thought was going out,
but at the last second I decided to hit it. I could feel something
snap. The surgery was simple, done with a scope, and just a small
incision, but it's taken some time to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks after the surgery, Fernandez wore a cast, followed
by another six weeks in a splint. The pain dissipated quickly, but
lingering soreness and little range of motion kept her off the
court and in the training room. She still carries a ball of putty
wherever she goes, kneading and squishing her way back to full
strength and free movement.
</P>
<P>
   Initial results have been promising: After Boston, she'll head
to Montreal for the du Maurier Open (Aug.17-23), a stop she added
only after initial playing results were promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one positive out of this is that I finally had time to get
in good shape,'' said Fernandez. ``You lose conditioning when
you're out on the road, competing all the time. But this gave me
the time to lift some weights, run my sprints, to get in as good a
shape as possible for my return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a big fan of working out, but the time away
helped me establish a goal that I want to be more consistent with
it now. You don't want to get too tired or too sore, but you can
work in some weights, some lunges, some sprints after a match _
things you should do to stay in top playing shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The view from the sidelines also helped Fernandez rediscover her
enthusiasm for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing, but you can get stuck in the day-in, day-out of
playing professionally,'' she said. ``There is no break in the
schedule, so it's like one long year out there on the road. It gets
tiring when there's no time to regroup, get a fresh start. You go
to your matches, you live in a hotel and that hotel food gets old
after a while. But when you're not playing, you realize that you're
lucky to do what you do, and I do feel lucky. It can be hard, but
on the other hand, the pluses outweigh the negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fernandez who takes the court at Babson this week will look
much the same as the Fernandez who broke in a lifetime ago. Her
game, however, looks different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls who come in now are a lot stronger and faster than
when I broke in,'' she said. ``I think I've adjusted well over the
last decade. I'm definitely not a power player, but I've tried to
find a way to compete. I was always known as a baseliner, but as
I've gotten older I'd say I'm more aggressive; I take more chances.
I've got more of an all-court game now, and as you get older you
know more strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game has changed a lot since I turned pro. Monica (Seles)
made it more of a power game in the late '80s, more than the
Martina and Chrissy days. Then, in the last five years, the overall
depth of women's tennis has improved. It's not just the top 10
players anymore. It's the top 100.''

SAHALEE AWAITING FIRST MAJOR TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Sahalee. This former agricultural town some 25 miles east of
Seattle becomes golf's capital this week as the 80th PGA
Championship is contested at Sahalee Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a major professional championship was staged north
of San Francisco was in 1946, when Ben Hogan beat Porky Oliver in
the match-play final of the PGA Championship at Portland (Ore.) GC.
The PGA also was held at Manito G&AMP;CC in Spokane in 1944, when Bob
Hamilton took a 1-up victory over Byron Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love 3d, who will defend the championship he won at Winged
Foot in dramatic fashion a year ago, has not yet seen the course,
but the two most discussed questions are whether Love can repeat
and whether Masters/British Open champion Mark O'Meara can become
the first player since Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Love, who missed Media Day at Sahalee in June because of back
problems, has talked to PGA regular Rick Fehr about the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's filled me in on what a great golf course it is and how
difficult it is,'' says Love. ``He's told me about how deep the
rough's getting and how they've trimmed back some trees that really
didn't affect the play of the golf course _ made it open up a
little bit for the gallery but didn't make it any easier on us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about defending my championship. I've planned
my whole golf career trying to win a major championship, and then
to have that dream come true at Winged Foot has been a great
experience to me.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, who defeated Brian Watts in a four-hole playoff to win
the British Open last month at Royal Birkdale, has had an
exceptional year in becoming the oldest player to win two majors in
the same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that winning doesn't happen that frequently in this
game because the talent is so good,'' says O'Meara. ``I play to
win. Your pride is such a huge thing, and for me the win at the
Masters was a tremendous victory because of the way I held up
coming down the stretch and making the putt on the 72d hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was in itself a big relief, knowing I had crossed that
hurdle. Golf is a little bit of good breaks here and there. When
you win, that's what it takes. Breaks have to happen, and I think
that any player who wins a tournament realizes that the good luck
has been on his side that week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what really has helped me over the last few years
is to realize I have to hang in there. I don't think I necessarily
always hit it perfect, and I may not have the perfect golf swing. I
use past experience to my advantage, so when I'm near the lead I've
been able to finish off the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the Pacific Northwest, where trees and moisture are
prevalent. August is supposed to be the second-driest month of the
year in Greater Seattle, but who knows? The rough will be grown to
4 inches, and the trees will come into play on errant tee shots. It
sounds a tad like Valderrama in Spain, where the US team was beaten
by the Europeans in last year's Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always enjoy being called the PGA champion,'' says Love.
``I really don't want this year to end. We were just so lucky to
get it in with all the bad weather. Everything just came pouring
down on me in that last burst of rain, and I was trying very hard
to keep my emotions in. I know sometimes I don't look like I'm
happy or excited on the golf course, but I was trying to stay very,
very focused on just hitting the golf shots and getting to the
clubhouse without having an emotional breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The first professional at Sahalee was Paul Runyon, who won PGA
Championships in 1934 and 1938 and will attend a press conference
at the site Tuesday at the age of 90. Rees Jones, who has been
known as the US Open Doctor ever since he presided over the
restoration of The Country Club for the 1988 tournament, has done
some minor work with Sahalee's 59 bunkers and a few tees. Just
think narrow, rough, trees aplenty, and a few lakes. That's Sahalee
CC, all revved up for its first major championship.

   &UR; Richard Connolly Jr. &LR; , the heart and soul of the Francis Ouimet
Scholarship Fund as director of the annual Ouimet Memorial
Tournament and past president of the fund, has announced the
establishment of the Connolly Family Scholarship within the Ouimet
structure. Connolly grew up as a caddie at Woburn CC, where  &UR; Ernie
Doherty  &LR; inspired him and hired him to help run the course through
Connolly's high school (Malden Catholic) and college (Holy Cross)
years. He encouraged present Brae Burn superintendent  &UR; Don Hearn
 &LR; to get into the business, and Hearn became president of the Golf
Course Superintendents Association of America. ``I was a Ouimet
Scholar,'' he says. ``The best experience I ever had was being a
caddie. It's the lessons you learn, watching how people act on a
golf course. I have two sons ( &UR; Richie &LR; ,  &UR; Ryan &LR; ) who caddie (at
Concord CC) and a third son ( &UR; Kevin &LR; ) who plays, and he's 10.'' ...
The City of Boston has opened up bids for the operation of the
William Devine GC at Franklin Park. The course went into decline in
the late 1980s but was reborn when the city entered into a
seven-year agreement in 1989 with Community Golf Course Management
Corp. and  &UR; Bill Flynn's  &LR; Franklin Park GC Inc. The lease ended in
March 1996. The city received $242,979 of the $5,623,300 gross
revenues taken in between 1990 and 1997, according to a Boston
Finance Commission Report dated Jan. 20, 1998. The concern is to
protect the Franklin Park Golf Course Guardians Inc., which the
report states is ``a nonprofit group comprised of area residents
and longtime users of the golf course. The Guardians are active in
the community and contribute to it. The role of the Guardians is
important to the community. The golf course was closed in most of
the 1980s. It was the perseverance of neighborhood people and
people who had played the golf course for years that led to its
restoration.'' There are three Boston-based groups expected to bid
for the job of running the operation, and one is expected to be
named next month.

   The three Bay State qualifying sites for the US Amateur are
Tedesco CC (Monday) and Shaker Hills and Berkshire Hills (Tuesday).
The Tedesco entrants include recent Massachusetts Amateur champion
and CVS Charity Classic participant  &UR; James Driscoll &LR; .  &UR; Frank Vana
Jr. &LR; , who won the Ouimet Memorial, is at Shaker Hills.  &UR; Jim
Salinetti &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who won the State Amateur a year ago, is in the group
at Berkshire Hills. Four from each of the sites will qualify ...
 &UR; Matt Kuchar &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was a media favorite at the Masters and US
Open, has decided to remain an amateur and return for his junior
year at Georgia Tech. ``He was very close (to turning pro),'' says
his father,  &UR; Peter Kuchar &LR; . ``Whenever you're feeling pressure, the
best thing you can do is to take a step back. It was a decision
that did not come easily, and one we now feel comfortable with.''
...  &UR; Justin Rose  &LR; jumped into the pro ranks after finishing tied
for fourth at the British Open, where Kuchar missed the cut ... The
B.C. Open is feeling the jerk strings of the PGA Tour. This unique
event, usually held in the fall, will be played opposite the
British Open for at least three years starting in 2000. They
decided to stick it out without ever having the benefit of a major
corporate sponsor. ``We're going to be on Tour, we're not going to
be kicked off,'' said former B.C. Open tournament director  &UR; Alex
Alexander &LR; . &UR;  &LR; ``They didn't want us to leave.''

GORDON PERFECTS GET-RICH-QUICK ROUTINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Wow!'' said Jeff Gordon when apprised of his $1,637,235 payday
after winning last Saturday's Brickyard 400.
</P>
<P>
   Wow is right. Except for perhaps, ``Can I have that in large
bills, please?,'' what else was there for Jeff Gordon to say after
his windfall at Indianapolis Motor Speedway?
</P>
<P>
   The rich get richer ... and richer ... and richer.
</P>
<P>
   With the biggest payout of this NASCAR Winston Cup circuit
season, Gordon bolstered his career earnings to $20,297,547 and
became the first driver to capture the Winston No Bull 5 $1 million
bonus. Gordon is eligible for another $1 million bonus, along with
the other top five Brickyard 400 finishers _ Mark Martin, Bobby
Labonte, Mike Skinner, and Dale Earnhardt _ at the next Winston No
Bull 5 race, the Mountain Dew Southern 500 at Darlington, S.C.,
Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, you'll recall, also won the Winston Million last season
with a victory at Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   But it all seemed like pocket change compared with Gordon's
victory at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indianapolis is already a special race,'' said Gordon, a
native of Pittsboro, Ind., who also piloted his No. 24 Dupont
Chevrolet into Victory Circle at Indy in the 1994 inaugural
Brickyard 400. ``It never seemed like we had it in our hands 'til
the end. But when they put up the big money in a race, this team
just seems to step up to the plate. It's not just the money, it's
the prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, dangling a $1 million bonus over a race can add an
immeasurable amount of intrigue, but where was the suspense _ or,
for that matter, the prestige _ in a race that ended under caution?
To many observers, the fact that NASCAR allowed the 160-lap race to
end under caution _ taking three laps to clear Jimmy Spencer's
wrecked car from the track _ was a travesty. It led to yet another
caution, the ninth and final of the race, on a single-file restart
on Lap 158 when Joe Nemechek's car made contact with Jeff Green's
on the front stretch and set off a chain-reaction wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, as a result, cruised to the checkered flag at a pace
well below the race average of 126.770 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone had reason to gripe about the way the Brickyard 400
ended, it was Martin, who finished runner-up to Gordon and remained
second to him in the Winston Cup point standings, 2,897-2,825.
</P>
<P>
   But if you were to ask Martin whether NASCAR should explore ways
to end races under green, you might be surprised by his response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything wrong with the way it is now as
long as it's consistent, which at least the Brickyard finish was _
consistent with a typical NASCAR Winston Cup race finish,'' said
Martin during a weekly Winston Cup teleconference last Tuesday.
``Saturday was consistent with what we've seen in the past, and I
don't think there's anything wrong with it. It works in some
people's favor and against other people, and you just have to hope
that you're on the receiving end and not on the losing end.''
</P>
<P>
   While Martin and the thousands of NASCAR fans who paid good
money to watch wound up on the losing end, it was Gordon who wound
up on the receiving end. Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely sweet to come to Indianapolis and win,'' said
Gordon, who stands a pretty good chance of getting his seventh
victory of the season after winning the pole position (his sixth of
the season) for Sunday's Budweiser at the Glen in Watkins Glen,
N.Y. ``I actually shut off the engine when I came down pit row so I
could hear the crowd cheering. It's an awesome thing to hear,
especially when we go to other places (and get booed). I love
coming here, it holds so much prestige. It makes winning here that
much better. For me, winning is my way of giving something back to
them.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The split between New Hampshire International Speedway and the
Indy Racing League seemed inevitable, so it came as no surprise
when the parties went their separate ways last Tuesday, leaving the
1-mile oval without an open-wheel racing date. Why has open-wheel
racing struggled in New England while NASCAR Winston Cup has
enjoyed nothing but success at NHIS? It seems that NASCAR has
simply built a bigger following. Championship Auto Racing Teams
came and went after failing to draw more than 50,000 in its
four-year stint at NHIS. The IRL, meanwhile, fared worse, with
attendance declining from 24,000 to 20,000 in its third and final
year. But the real reason for the parting of the ways was simple:
There didn't seem to be enough promotion _ by either track owner
 &UR; Bob Bahre  &LR; or the IRL. In the end, the IRL didn't want to sink
more money into a losing proposition and wound up pulling the
sponsorship it had promised NHIS, leaving the Bahres to take a
substantial financial hit. That was the last straw.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Retiring CART driver  &UR; Bobby Rahal  &LR; will make one of his more
sentimental stops on his self-styled farewell tour _ Rahal's Last
Ride _ at Mid-Ohio for Sunday's Miller Lite 200, the last race in
Ohio for the native Buckeye. Rahal attended his first race at
Mid-Ohio in 1963 and watched his father,  &UR; Mike &LR;   &UR; Rahal &LR; , compete.
``I just remember continually washing the dust off my dad's car,''
recalled Rahal, who often returned to the track during his college
days at nearby Denison University to watch Can-Am and Formula 5000
races. ``I won the Lumberman's race here, I've won IMSA races here,
I've won SCCA races here, I've won Championship Car races here. I
just have great memories of this track. Great history.'' Asked if
he would get emotional, Rahal said, ``I'm not sure I'll get misty,
but I'm not making any guarantees.'' ... IRL driver  &UR; Billy
Boat &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who suffered a fractured leg and pelvis in a wreck at NHIS
June 28, was back in the car for a tire test at Atlanta Motor
Speedway July 28-29 and hopes to be back racing for the next IRL
event at Pikes Peak, Colo., next Sunday. ``It felt good to get back
into the race car,'' said Boat, driver for legendary car owner
 &UR; A.J. Foyt &LR; . ``Within five laps at Atlanta, I was running 215. I
don't think the accident hurt my confidence at all. The only thing
it does hurt is the longer you are out, the more apt you are to be

GALAXY WINS ON JOLLEY'S GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Jolley couldn't have chosen a better moment for his first
Major League Soccer goal, a last-minute header that tagged the
happiest of endings to the 90 minutes of frustration the Los
Angeles Galaxy endured Saturday afternoon in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring above two defenders at the far post to nod home a
flicked-on cross from Mauricio Cienfuegos, Jolley who has emerged
as a defensive force in captain Dan Calichman's absence presented
L.A. with a dramatic 2-1 victory over the Fire before 37,122 at
Soldier Field, extending its lead in the Western Conference to 15
points and placing it on the verge of clinching a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of just six shots the Galaxy (18-6, 52 points)
managed in a physical, defensive affair that provided their
attacking players little opportunity to create but saw one of the
finest performances this season by L.A.'s defense.
</P>
<P>
   Second-place Chicago (13-10, 37), which dropped its fifth
straight game and fell to 0-6 without injured playmaker Peter
Nowak, also struggled on attack, finding space in L.A. territory
only in the second half and using it with little success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way teams in a rut turn things around: play good
team defense,'' said defender Robin Fraser. ``We dug in and battled
and pulled out a win like this. We've been losing the close games,
but when we dig in, we can pull them out.''
</P>
<P>
   It was much like the first two meetings between the teams, both
Chicago wins: Slow-paced, with the Fire content to shut down space
while trying to poke holes in L.A.'s defense. With Soldier Field's
long grass neutralizing Cobi Jones' and Welton's speed and former
Galaxy midfielder Chris Armas shutting down Mauricio Cienfuegos,
there was little the Galaxy could accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about the fact that we won,'' said Coach Octavio
Zambrano, ``but we should have controlled the game a lot better in
the later stages. I'm not entirely pleased with how we managed the
game. We have experienced guys who should know how to do this. I'm
going to have to talk with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two scored were on own goals, the first a header by
Chicago defender Francis Okaroh that should have been enough for a
Galaxy win. It came off a free kick from midfield by Martin Machon
that cleared Carlos Hermosillo at the edge of the Fire box. The
ball took one bounce, and Okaroh under some pressure from
Hermosillo tried to head the ball to Jorge Campos, his goalkeeper.
Campos, as is his custom, had come out of his nets and was cleared
by Okaroh's header; he scrambled back late and the ball beat him
inside the far post.
</P>
<P>
   The win L.A.'s second in a row after losing four of five
appeared assured until the 89th minute, when Danny Pena returned
the favor, knocking a cross from Zak Ibsen on the right wing into
the Galaxy net.
</P>
<P>
   Jolley's heroics arrived seconds later, after Zach Thornton had
replaced Campos in the nets (an effort to replace Okaroh, who'd
suffered bruised ribs) and as Campos searched for red shorts on the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos earned a free kick near the corner flag, then booted
the ball to the far post. Paul Caligiuri got his head to it,
sending it to the far post, where Jolley rose above two defenders
to nod it into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty ecstatic,'' Jolley said afterward. ``You can't ask
for a better situation to score your first goal. ... I think the
good man upstairs was definitely looking out for me.''

CUBS' SOSA THE POWER SURPRISE OF THE '98 SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Sammy Sosa was attending the Toronto Blue Jays'
Dominican Baseball Academy when Rangers scout Omar Minaya
intercepted him. Sosa, just 17 at the time, had a weekend pass to
go home to San Pedro de Marcoris. Instead, Minaya sneaked him on a
baseball field for a tryout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember he didn't have much power, but the ball jumped off
his bat,'' Minaya said. ``He was 5-9, 5-10. If you liked him, he
was 6-foot. He was really skinny and thin, fragile. You looked at
him and you knew the kid was malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I liked the way the ball jumped off his bat. It would get
through the infield quickly. It would die when it got into the
outfield, but that was because he was weak and malnourished. A lot
of the kids are that way down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Minaya, remembering that summer day in July 1985, was impressed
enough to offer Sosa $3,000 to sign with the Rangers. Sosa wanted
$4,000. They settled for $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stuck to his principles. I liked that,'' Minaya said. ``He
was very aggressive. Everything he did, he did with aggressiveness
and with confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Minaya thought Sosa would be a good major-league baseball
player. He never suspected he would one day join Mark McGwire and
Ken Griffey Jr. in pursuit of Roger Maris' single-season home run
record. But Sosa has risen from the slums of the Dominican Republic
and has overcome his wild-swinging habits to become one of
baseball's premier power hitters, having hit his 44th home run
yesterday against the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a challenge, but I just want to finish strong
and help my team into the playoffs,'' Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Minaya, now the New York Mets assistant general manager,
``I'm proud of him. You look at those other guys, McGwire and
Griffey. They were both first-round draft picks. This is a kid who
was signed out of a poor area of a poor country. I mean, we're
talking about a third-world country. Now he's being mentioned with
those guys. That's pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs signed Sosa to a four-year, $42.5 million contract
extension last summer, allowing him to move his family into the
same Chicago apartment building where Oprah Winfrey lives. That's
more than a step up from San Pedro de Marcoris, where he had to
shine shoes and sell fruit on the street corner to help his family
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Joaquin Andujar, Julio Franco, George Bell, they
all had beautiful homes,'' Sosa said. ``They were always in the
middle of a crowd. I remember thinking it would be nice to live
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Minaya first met Sosa, the player's stepfather was ill and
couldn't work, so Sosa's mother had to toil at a number of odd jobs
to support seven children. Sosa's biological father passed away
when Sosa was very young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy was the hope of the family,'' Minaya said. ``When he was
in the minors, he was supporting his whole family on $850 a month.
They're a very close-knit family and he had to carry them on his
back. But he was always a confident, happy, aggressive,
street-smart person. He had an idea how to survive, and he was very
intelligent. He forced himself to learn English quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in the neighborhood shielded him from all the bad
stuff. Athletes are protected there because people can see they
have a chance to make something for themselves and get out of
there. People would say, don't touch him, this guy is going
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa did get somewhere, but he has not forgotten where he came
from, particularly since he talks to the president of the country
on a regular basis. He donated 250 computers to Dominican Republic
schools and set up the Sammy Claus Foundation to provide Christmas
presents to poor children, both there and in the United States. He
also invested in a new major shopping center in his old
neighborhood, where none had existed before.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said, `You're not going to make money there,' '' Sosa
said. ``I said this is not about money, this is about giving back
to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's giving back to a community that already has enough
shopping centers and computers. What Chicago really wants is for
Sosa to lead the Cubs to their first World Series since 1945. The
Cubs are currently on top in the National League wild-card
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa prefers to focus on the playoff chase and let McGwire and
Griffey worry about the Maris chase. But the Cubs' success, and his
surprising bid to hit 61 home runs, have fed off each other. Sosa
has found it's easier to hit on a winning team, rather than trying
to carry a last-place team by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' Sosa said. ``I used to try to carry the team all
by myself but not any more. I would try to hit two home runs in one
at-bat and if you do that, you're never going to do what you're
supposed to do. When you're on a winning team, you don't have to
worry about that. It's more fun. You can come to the ballpark early
and focus on your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa averaged 34 home runs the past four seasons without any
real power hitters batting behind him to protect him. The best the
Cubs could do for support in those years was Luis Gonzalez, who hit
15 home runs in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers discovered it was stupid to throw him a strike,
especially since he'd swing at almost anything within a foot of the
strike zone anyway. He led the majors with 174 strikeouts last
year, a team record.
</P>
<P>
   Bases on balls never appealed much to Sosa, who learned long ago
like so many others in the Dominican Republic: You can't walk off
the island.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa also indulges in an occasional fantasy, wondering what
would have happened if the Rangers hadn't traded him and he was
batting in the same lineup with longtime buddy Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd have more than 118 RBI right now, I can tell you that,''
Sosa said with a smile. ``But I'm comfortable with what I have
now.'
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Cubs got serious last off-season and traded
for Expos outfielder Henry Rodriguez, who has 27 home runs. Manager
Jim Riggleman also changed his lineup, moving Sosa into the No. 3
spot, making Mark Grace the cleanup hitter and batting Rodriguez
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Grace has never hit with much power, but he's batting .321 with
a .411 on-base percentage, which Riggleman thought would be ideal
between two free-swinging sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   Once Sosa got comfortable in the lineup, he took off. He hit 20
home runs in June, a major-league record that jumped him right into
the middle of the Maris chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anybody have a month like that,'' Grace said.
``It was incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll tell you he's got better hitters hitting behind him,''
Cubs coach Billy Williams said. ``But I think security \Rof a
long-term contract\S changed Sammy more than any of us. Some guys
get long-term deals, they start coasting. Sammy worked harder. He
put in more time, accepted more responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has worked particularly hard in abandoning his life-long
free-swinging habits, but he's not going to fulfill hitting coach
Jeff Pentland's goal of 100 walks.
</P>
<P>
   But he's on pace to draw 68 walks, which would be a career-high.
The .308 batting average and .374 on-base percentage that he has
after yesterday's game will also be career highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go to the plate, swing at two or three pitches and
that was it,'' Sosa said. ``Not anymore. Now I'm more relaxed and
disciplined. I look for my pitch. I try to hit to right field. I
have a better idea of what I'm trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to attach the word discipline to that you can,''
said Riggleman. ``He is taking more pitches. But Sammy has done
great things every year and it's extraordinary that he's been able
to accomplish more things this year. I think it's just a process of
year after year of hard work and maturity culminating in what he
has done this year.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he has become a huge hit at Wrigley Field, where he
takes steps on the field blowing kisses to his mother, flashing a
``V for victory'' sign in honor of the late great Harry Caray and
exchanging all kinds of salutes with the fans in the right-field
bleachers. Part of his ritual is beginning each game by throwing a
baseball into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'm having a bad day and people are yelling at me,
`Don't worry Sammy,' '' Sosa said. ``They're trying to lift me up,
make me feel good. That makes me think, go up to the plate and try
hard to pay them back.''
</P>
<P>
   He's done that with the home runs. A bigger payback would be the
National League pennant flying once again over Wrigley Field.

FOR VICTIMS' KIN, THE BAD NEWS IS SUDDEN AND SHOCKING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to refine, add info)   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Friday mail brought a flimsy letter from Africa to the home
of Delbert and Mary Olds in Panama City, Fla. It was from their
daughter, Sherry, and inside the envelope was a Post-It sticker. It
read, ``Will E-mail you soon.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday evening, two Air Force officers arrived with another
letter. It informed the family that Sherry Lynn Olds, a senior
master sergeant with the Air Force, had died earlier in the day
after a terrorist bomb exploded outside the U.S. Embassy in
Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a beautiful girl,'' said Pat Casey, the victim's aunt,
who spoke for the parents. ``She was very special to her parents.
It is a devastating loss to them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the families of the victims in various parts of the country,
there was no good way to learn the bad news. The phone rang before
sunrise at Bonnie Hobson's home in Lamar, Mo. Her son, Sgt. Kenneth
R. Hobson, Jr., 27, had been killed. Her daughter-in-law, Debbie,
was calling from Nairobi, sobbing uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the telephone call that did not come that worried friends
and relatives of Molly Huckaby Hardy, 51, a State Department
employee from Valdosta, Ga. They had seen the bombings on
television. ``When we hadn't heard from her, we knew something had
happened,'' said Marsha Bates, a childhood friend of Ms. Hardy's.
``If she could have crawled to a phone, she would have let us know
she was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The American death toll was not yet clear, but by Saturday
night, the State Department had identified five of the victims.
They are Master Sergeant Olds; Hobson; Ms. Hardy; Sgt. Jesse N.
Aliganga, 21; a Marine from Tallahassee, Fla.; and Arlene Kirk, 50,
a Defense Department budget officer who had just returned to
Nairobi from home leave in South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department also released the names of four other
Americans killed: Prabhi Kavaler and Michelle O'Connor of the
General Services office; Tom Shah, an employee of the political
section; and Jean Dalizu, an employee of the Defense Attache's
office. The Associated Press added two more: Jay Bartley, son of
Consul General Julian Bartley, and Louise Martin of Atlanta, an
employee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin worked for the health agency in Kenya with her
husband, Douglas Klaucke. She would have turned 46 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Bryson of Lawrenceville, Ga., said of Ms. Martin, her
sister: ``I still don't believe it's real. She died in a country
she loved, she died doing the things she liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kirk and her husband, Robert, 50, a project development
officer for the U.S. Agency for International Development, had
planned to extend their stay at home for several days, said Ms.
Kirk's sister, Katherine Wright, from South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Kirk worried that her bosses wanted her back to work
sooner, her sister said, so the couple and their 14-year-old son,
Robbie Jr., flew back, arriving in Nairobi early Friday morning.
``They were both exhausted,'' Ms. Wright said. ``She went home and
then was rushing to get to work. She went to work late. We think
she went into work just before the bomb went off.''
</P>
<P>
   During her six weeks in South Bend, Ms. Kirk cared for her
elderly parents, Frederick Arthur, 84, and Mary, 83. ``She was busy
trying to get them enrolled in some exercise classes,'' said Ms.
Wright. ``She took them to the doctor. Their health is not that
great.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of six children, Ms. Kirk met her husband at
Indiana University. After graduating from Indiana University
business school, they went to South Africa, where Kirk taught
democratic principles to township mayors. During the next 25 years,
they worked for the federal government in various positions in
Botswana and Egypt and, for the last three years, in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   The couple lost a young daughter, Kamilah, to cancer in 1992.
Their oldest child, Maisha, 23, attends Tuskegee University in
Alabama. Family members said the couple planned to move back to the
United States next year. ``It's a bitter pill to swallow,'' Ms.
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   After a State Department career that spanned more than two
decades, including posts in Brazil and Laos, Ms. Hardy had told
friends and family that she also planned to return to the United
States, possibly next June, to work as an instructor for State
Department employees. Her childhood friend, Ms. Bates, described a
woman who loved the adventure of her job. Her family had recently
received letters and photographs of her remodeled home in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just loved being there, I think,'' Ms. Bates said. ``She
found it a beautiful place. Molly was fun-loving, just great _ an
intellectual that everybody liked.''
</P>
<P>
   While working in Laos in 1973, Ms. Hardy became pregnant, Ms.
Bates said. Like other civilian employees, she was ordered to
evacuate, and her only child, Brandi Plant, was later born in
Washington. Ms. Hardy and her former husband were later divorced.
Her last visit to Valdosta had come in April 1997 to attend the
funeral of her sister, who had died when her car collided with a
dump truck that had crossed the center line of the roadway.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, Ms. Hardy apparently had a potential brush
with danger. ``A plane went down in South Africa that Molly was
supposed to have been on,'' said Ms. Bates, noting that Ms. Hardy
ended up catching a different flight.
</P>
<P>
   While riding on the second flight, Ms. Hardy called to tell her
mother and daughter not to worry. When a similar call did not come
on Friday, her family feared for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Olds had returned to Nairobi in June after spending two
months in Birmingham, Ala., taking courses to qualify for a
promotion to become a chief master sergeant. Her aunt, Ms. Casey,
said that Sergeant Olds passed the test and was expected to receive
her promotion in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Olds had joined the Air Force out of high school,
following the footsteps of her father, who is now a retired civil
servant. Ms. Casey described her niece as a ``free spirit'' who had
also served in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   During her coursework in Alabama, Sergeant Olds also spent a
week with her family in Panama City, engaging in her favorite
hobby. ``Shopping,'' said her aunt with a gentle laugh. ``That
sounds very strange, but that was her favorite pastime.''
</P>
<P>
   On one shopping spree, Sergeant Olds purchased boxes of corn
meal and grits _ the ingredients of some of her favorite Southern
dishes _ and mailed them to her address in Nairobi. She often sent
her family presents of African jewelry, amber and carved wooden
games.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sergeant Olds, Hobson joined the military as a ticket to
see the world. ``He knew there was more to life out there, and he
was determined to see it,'' said his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in a modest blue house behind a sturdy old maple
tree, he was known as a talented and popular boy. He loved to
debate world affairs and play tennis, act in school plays, go
hiking, cook gourmet meals and paint.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson, the son of a Vietnam veteran, dreamed of retiring from
the Army at age 37, attending culinary school and then opening a
bed and breakfast, his mother said.

JUSTIN RIDES LOVE OF WEST, COWBOYS INTO RODEO HALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a bone-rattling night at the Fort Worth Stock Show Rodeo
in the early 1960s when cowboy Bill ``Good Times'' Federson bounced
off a bronc and hobbled out of the arena, leaving fans questioning
how Federson got branded with that upbeat nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Moved by compassion, a wealthy Fort Worth boot manufacturer
named John Justin carried Federson to the Fort Worth Petroleum
Club, where Justin was a member. For several days, Federson soaked
in a whirlpool, receiving sports medicine equivalent to what a
Dallas Cowboys running back gets after a Sunday pounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a lot of injuries _ it wasn't that serious _ he
just needed a little help so he could continue riding, and he ended
up doing well in the rodeo,'' Justin said of Fort Worth's renowned
Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   When the 81-year-old Justin was inducted yesterday into the
Prorodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs, Colo., the sport
enshrined its greatest friend alongside some of its greatest
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame added Justin to the ``rodeo notables'' category
for accomplishments such as creating Justin Heeler, which provides
sports medicine physicians and facilities at professional rodeos,
and the Cowboy Crisis Fund, which has offered financial assistance
for cowboys who have sustained serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, perhaps Justin's most notable contribution to
Fort Worth was heading a late 1980s fund-raising campaign that
garnered $3.5 million to help build the Will Rogers Equestrian
Center in Fort Worth. Since then, the center, which has three
indoor arenas, has wrangled several major shows _ including this
week's American Quarter Horse Association youth championships _
from other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Justin loves the Western tradition,'' said Bob Watt, the
Fort Worth Rodeo general manager who worked closely with Justin on
the fund-raiser. ``He's the most unusual person with no arrogance
about him. Anything that has to do with supporting an aspect of the
Western tradition, he's totally dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Added legendary 1950s cowboy Jim Shoulders: ``I'm glad John
never decided to take up bull riding when I was competing. If he
had, he would have been tough to beat because when he makes up his
mind to do something, he's very determined. When he becomes your
friend, he's very loyal.'' A cowboy haven For many years, Justin's
home was filled to the brim with cowboys, including Shoulders, when
they were competing in the Fort Worth rodeo, traditionally staged
each January and February.
</P>
<P>
   After a rodeo performance ended on those cold winter nights,
cowboys dragged in at all hours to rest their bronc-busted bones.
</P>
<P>
   Justin has fond memories of running a boardinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one occasion when we had several dogs at our
home,'' Justin said with a big grin. ``A cowboy came in late one
night and it was very dark in the house. He thought he opened a
container of sandwich spread, but instead it was dog food. He put
it on a sandwich and seemed to like it OK. But the next morning, we
all realized that he had eaten the dog food.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sun rose over Fort Worth's wooded rolling hills each
morning, Justin's wife, Jane, who attended the induction ceremony
yesterday, prepared breakfast for competing cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``One morning, Jane was frantically running all over the house,
room to room, sticking her head in the doors,'' Justin said. ``I
said, `Jane, what are you doing' She said, `I'm getting a head
count of cowboys so I'll know how many eggs to break.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though Justin was never a prize-winning rodeo competitor, many
athletes sought his help, especially when the entry books were
about to close at the Fort Worth rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a cowboy would see that he was about to miss the deadline
for entries, he'd ring me up and say, `Would you sign me in?'''
Justin said. ``I'd go over and put in the $40 so he wouldn't miss
an opportunity to ride.''
</P>
<P>
   But on one very rare occasion, Justin decided to enter the Stock
Show Rodeo in an event dubbed the wild horse race. The event
featured teams of three competitors. Each team was assigned to a
hold, saddle and ride a wild horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to enter while we were having a rodeo party,''
Justin said. ``I think a fellow named Jack Daniels told me to
enter.'' A cowboy's refuge Justin is revered for taking the bull by
the horns in terms of organizing and funding desperately needed
programs that aid major-league rodeo's Dukes of Hazzard.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 consecutive years, the Justin Heeler physicians and
on-site facilities have provided assistance to ailing cowboys at
rodeo arenas nationwide. When Justin began the program in the early
1980s, there were virtually no training rooms at rodeo arenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Used to be, when a guy got hurt, they'd hobble out of the
arena and nobody would pay attention to them,'' Justin said.
``They'd have to take a cab to the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, two mobile sports trailers and two permanent facilities
provide assistance at about 140 Professional Rodeo Cowboys
Association shows. J. Pat Evans, a former team physician for the
Cowboys, and Don Andrews, the program's director, are credited for
the program's inception.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the sports medicine program began providing
assistance for Professional Bull Riders shows. Dallas physician
Tandy Freeman is scheduled to attend almost all the association's
24 Bud Light Cup Series shows this season. Freeman also regularly
provides assistance at a permanent training room at the weekly
Mesquite Championship Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before John started the sports medicine programs, if you got
hurt at the rodeo, you'd go into the clown's quarters and find what
little medicine and bandages you could,'' Shoulders said. ``Now,
they have these nice training rooms. I know this makes the cowboys
mad, but sometimes I go in and call it the sissy room while the
guys are taping themselves up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in all seriousness, I know that it does them a lot of good
to have a place to get help.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Mesquite Championship Rodeo Friday, Freeman and the
Justin Sportsmedicine team carried Weatherford bull rider Pace
Newman out of the arena on a stretcher after Newman was bucked off
and stepped on by bounty bull Dodge Durango. Newman sustained a
broken leg and was transported to a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   When former world champion Jerome Davis was paralyzed from the
chest down after breaking his neck at the PBR tour stop in Fort
Worth in March, the sports-medicine team rushed in and assured that
Davis was transported carefully to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Though rodeo is a rough-and-tumble sport, career-ending injuries
are rare. In most occasions, the sports-medicine team's work keeps
competitors on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors who work for them are very knowledgeable much
about rodeo,'' said six-time world all-around champion Ty Murray of
Stephenville, who competes in all three bucking stock events. ``If
you injure your arm, they know how exactly much pressure a bull
would put on your arm if you were to continue riding, and they can
give you accurate advice on whether you should compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also help educate you on how to tape, how to stretch and
how to exercise an injury. And things like that make a big
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Former world all-around champion Dave Appleton of Arlington said
he remembers when the team helped him continue competing at the
Cheyenne (Wyo.) Frontier Days in the mid-1980s despite sustaining a
small break in a leg bone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some really good horses drawn, and I needed to keep on
riding,'' Appleton said. ``Without their help, there's no way that
I would have kept on competing. They worked on me constantly for
four days and they loaned me equipment to take to my hotel room.
All that helped keep the swelling down. I was able to continue
riding, and I won the rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can liken the Justin Heeler program to a mobile repair
shop. If we have a bent fender, they fix it and put us back in the
race.'' A cowboy recovery Three years ago, Justin faced perhaps the
biggest challenge of his life when doctors found that he had
leukemia. But he bucked the odds after undergoing rigorous
treatment at the M.D. Anderson Medical Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first went to the doctor, I asked, `What will happen if
I don't take the treatments,''' Justin said. ``The doctor said,
`Well, you'll only have about 60 days to live.' I said, `When can
we start?'''
</P>
<P>
   For the first year, doctors banned Justin from attending rodeos.
When the 99th Stock Show Rodeo began in 1995, Justin addressed the
crowd by phone on opening night.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Stock Show celebrated its 100th anniversary the
next year, Justin rode in the grand entries and has continued to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently got a computer printout from my doctor that said he
has treated eight different patients in my condition in recent
years,'' Justin said. ``The statistics show that five of them have
died, and the three other people have lived for 10, 18 and 38
months. I'm the guy who has lived 38 months. When I first went in
for treatment and the odds of recovery were so slim, I told them
the doctor I was going to beat it and make him famous.''
</P>
<P>
   He did beat it, and 81-year-old John Justin might be one of the
most famous people in and around rodeo never to bust a bronc.

Astros' Johnson prefers to deflect praise to family, team
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The minute Randy Johnson enters a big-league ballpark, he's the Big
Unit _ the most intimidating pitcher of his era.
</P>
<P>
   He's a man who forces some of the best hitters in the game to
take a day off while using almost every explanation imaginable,
stopping just short of claiming ``the dog ate my uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Get him on the subject of his family, and Johnson turns
downright cuddly. Son, husband, father, brother, pitcher,
superstar, music lover, photographer; these are the many faces of
Randy Johnson. But there's no doubt what generates the biggest
smile and the most joy.
</P>
<P>
   Above everything else, he's a devoted family man.
</P>
<P>
   The way Johnson sees it, his job _ burning a catcher's hand with
a 98 mph fastball _ is nothing compared to the job his wife, Lisa,
does every day with their three children. In his book, she's the
Most Valuable Player of Team Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball revolves around my family, which I think it should
for any professional athlete,'' said Johnson, who is 2-0 with a
dazzling 1.13 ERA in his first two starts as an Astro. ``Obviously,
it's nice paychecks and a lot of freebie stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the other side of it is being away from my family, and
that's probably the hardest part. My wife is the one who has to
deal with waking up in the middle of the night and taking care of
the kids. I've said, comically, that I could sleep in until one
o'clock and get room service. She's the one who has to be there 24
hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Lisa, Samantha (3 years old), Tanner (2) and
Willow (two months) are constantly in his thoughts, and deservedly
so considering he credits them with playing a big part in his
escalation to the top of his profession.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career, Johnson was his own worst enemy and
easily his own biggest critic. His emotions were about as difficult
for him to control as his blazing fastball used to be. Sometimes,
he probably didn't know where either was going.
</P>
<P>
   Then he met Lisa, and the truly important things in life began
to fall neatly into perspective. That, coupled with the Christmas
Day death of his father in 1993, had a lot to do with shaping the
man Astros fans hope will help lead the team to its first World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   But who is Randy Johnson? What makes him so complex yet so
simple? What makes him a pit bull on the days he pitches but a
teddy bear when approached by autograph seekers at the Galleria,
where he did some shopping on the eve of his Astros home debut?
</P>
<P>
   There he was _ all 6-10 of him _ striding through Houston's
biggest shopping mall as if he were a kid who had just been dropped
off by his mom. Being recognized as the one and only Big Unit was
the least of his worries.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, he was spotted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a haircut, so it couldn't have been the hair,'' cracked
Johnson, whose quick wit should be as much a part of his reputation
as strikeouts. ``Maybe it was the height.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the height. That's where everything begins with Johnson, who
along with former Mets pitcher Eric Hillman are the tallest players
in major-league history. It causes stares, and it's the first thing
people notice when they see him coming their way. It's even more
unique to see someone Johnson's size stuffed into a baseball
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Freak show? Hardly. Considering the way Johnson pitches, his
performances are more like a thrill show.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson has always known there was a certain appeal to his
size.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize I'm an oddity being 6-foot-10,'' he said. ``But I'm
really no different than (teammate) Shane Reynolds.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is humble that way. He's only been an Astro for eight
days, but he's made one thing clear during the short time he's been
on the scene: He doesn't like special attention or anything that
detracts from the team.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Johnson feels so strongly on the subject because he
wasn't always the definition of dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the small Northern California town of Walnut
Creek, Johnson was just another kid playing a game of street ball.
He pretended to be former big-league pitcher Vida Blue, who starred
for the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants, but he never
entertained any real thoughts of following in his hero's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never envisioned playing professional baseball,'' said
Johnson, the youngest of six children. ``Growing up 40 minutes east
of Oakland, Vida Blue was a pitcher I always watched, but that's
about as far as it went. A lot of people say they want to be a
professional athlete, but very few of them go on to do it. I feel
very lucky and gifted to be blessed with a good fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   That much was obvious in high school. While not as dominant as
he is today, Johnson clearly remembers throwing harder than most of
the kids in his two-high school town. Suddenly, playing baseball
for a living didn't seem so far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I got into high school _ my junior and senior years _ I
realized scouts were watching me and that there was some interest
in my ability,'' Johnson said. ``There were also some colleges. At
that time I realized I might have a chance to go farther. I started
concentrating on learning how to pitch instead of just being a
thrower like I had been in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves drafted Johnson in the third round out of
high school in 1982, but he decided to attend the University of
Southern California instead. After three years of watching him
pitch for the Trojans, big-league scouts were on Johnson's trail
again.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Expos picked him in the second round of the 1985
draft, beginning his career in professional baseball. Johnson spent
a year each at Class A Jamestown (N.Y.), Class A West Palm Beach
(Fla.), Class AA Jacksonville and Class AAA Indianapolis before the
Expos thought he was ready to make his major-league debut in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``During that span of four years, I got a lot of coaching and
developed more into a pitcher,'' Johnson said. ``(Pitching coaches)
Rick Williams and Joe Kerrigan took me under their wings and gave
me extra tutelage. When most of the guys were done for the day, I
stayed an extra hour to get more work.''
</P>
<P>
   It paid immediate dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was 3-0 with a 2.42 ERA in his first taste of the big
leagues. He opened the following season with the Expos but was sent
back to Indianapolis. Coincidentally, the Expos were at the
Astrodome at the time of Johnson's demotion.
</P>
<P>
   Later that season, he was traded to Seattle, where his career
would eventually began to soar. Johnson won 133 games in 9{ seasons
with the Mariners, and in Seattle he was close to one of his other
loves: rock music. Seattle is famous for the grunge sound, and
several groups emerged from there during the 1980s and 1990s.
Johnson, who plays the drums, became friends with members of
Soundgarden and Bush among other local bands.
</P>
<P>
   It was also in Seattle where he met Lisa and experienced the
birth of their three children. Most of his friendships in baseball
were established during his tenure with the Mariners, which is one
of the main reasons it was difficult for him to leave them.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who is eligible to become a free agent at the end of
the season, knew his days in Seattle were numbered when the
Mariners decided against offering him a contract extension. It
began an ugly saga that lasted through most of this season and led
to his giving the media the silent treatment for 1{ months because
he thought the contract issue was becoming a distraction for the
team. Some in the media had begun to question Johnson's desire,
which didn't sit well with him at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of mannerisms out there,'' he said. ``I slap my
chest with my glove and get real animated. If I didn't do that,
people thought that I wasn't into the game. Well, I haven't done
that in my two starts (with the Astros), but I think I've pitched
pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean I'm not into the game. It's just something
that kind of flows out of me. When I get in a routine, it all comes
natural. I'm just as much of a competitor as the next guy. I don't
like to lose. That's why it was so hard in Seattle. People are
always saying you have to put all of that stuff behind you, but
it's not that easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk began to surface about Johnson being moody and volatile.
Was that just a case of the Big Unit being misunderstood?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a shy person, but people have said I'm a loner,''
Johnson said. ``I kind of keep to myself, I don't make a lot of
noise, and I don't cause any trouble. I just kind of do my own
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially on days when he's pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a different story,'' he said. ``My wife doesn't even
come up to me on the days I pitch. I'm trying to fit in right now,
but if I'm pitching, don't be surprised if I give you a dirty look
and growl at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning to comprehend Johnson means understanding and
accepting that he has no desire to be a one-man show. He's already
warned against expecting miracles of biblical proportions, and he's
been quick to praise the work of his new teammates and stress the
significance they will play in the Astros' quest for October glory.
</P>
<P>
   With a Cy Young Award on his mantel and a long history of
success to his credit, Johnson is no stranger to media attention.
But even he has been overwhelmed by the volume of reporters who
have scurried from the woodwork to stick a microphone or notepad in
his face since the Mariners traded him to the Astros last week.
</P>
<P>
   The effect at the box office has been similar.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's Astrodome debut attracted 52,071 fans to the Dome for
Friday's game against the Philadelphia Phillies. It was the largest
regular-season crowd in Astrodome history.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this attention is kind of embarrassing,'' said Johnson,
34. ``I'm sure it will stop, but hopefully the hype will stay here
for the team. You don't often get the opportunity to be in a city
where you have a championship-caliber team. There should be
35,000-40,000 people here every night. I know it's not in
everyone's budget, but for those who it is, come out and support
us, because this is exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' main reason for acquiring Johnson was the fact he
gives them a bona fide staff ace who can match up with any starter
in the majors. That's a valuable commodity to have in the playoffs.
But don't think for a minute the Astros weren't cognizant of
Johnson's drawing power.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson isn't uncomfortable with his status as an attraction,
but he wouldn't feel comfortable playing for a team that only
wanted him for that purpose. He knows that isn't the case in
Houston, where the Astros are just as hungry for a championship
ring as he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that were the case, I'd almost feel like a three-ring
circus, and I'm in the middle ring,'' he said. ``I guess it's a
novelty going to a game when you can watch a guy strike out a lot
of people, much like it's fun to watch Mark McGwire have a chance
to hit a home run farther than you've ever seen. But I'm still a
little overwhelmed by all of the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   One can assume the lights never shined this brightly in Walnut
Creek.

METS BEAT ROCKIES, 4-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Armando Reynoso is the antithesis of the power pitcher.
Just ask Darryl Hamilton, who Saturday described Reynoso's fastball
as ``his dead-fish pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt that Reynoso can pitch, regardless of how
hard he can throw. And Saturday afternoon, as Reynoso's former
manager, Don Baylor, said, ``Armando pitched an Armando game.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind seven strong innings from Reynoso _ in his first game
back at Coors Field since he played for the Rockies from 1993-1996
_ and a gutty relief performance from Turk Wendell, the Mets held
off the Colorado Rockies, 4-3, to clinch their first winning series
here in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Mets' 14th in their last 20 games and their
second in a row in a place that has never been very kind to them.
More important, the Mets (62-52) pulled as close as half a game and
.003 percentage points of the Chicago Cubs in the National League
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be really good news if we each had one more to
play,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``But there is still a
long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the Mets, who have won their last four games by one run,
it should be exciting. The Mets won Saturday with the help of a
two-run home run from Edgardo Alfonzo and two doubles from the
red-hot John Olerud. Olerud is the National League's leading
hitter, at .346, and he extended his hitting streak to 22 games,
the longest in the league this season and two off Hubie Brooks'
club record.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no way the Mets could have won without the
performances of Reynoso and those who followed him. Reynoso (3-0)
allowed 10 hits in his seven-plus innings, but gave up only two
earned runs in one of the toughest parks to pitch in in all of
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows you what you can do with an 86 mile per hour
fastball,'' Valentine said. ``And that's when the wind's at his
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor said: ``He scattered 10 hits. That's the way he
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendell, meanwhile, came in in the set-up role for one of the
few times this season, in relief of Dennis Cook, who only faced one
batter, with the Mets up, 4-2, runners on first and second and one
out in the eighth. A Mike Piazza passed ball (on a Wendell slider
that broke the wrong way) and a Mike Lansing ground-ball single to
left, and it was a one-run game.
</P>
<P>
   But with runners on first and third, Wendell caught Jeff Reed
looking with an 0-2 fastball for the second out of the inning, then
induced pinch-hitter Derrick White into an inning-ending force-out
at second base.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco pitched a scoreless ninth, retiring Dante Bichette
on a popout to second with a runner on first for the final out.
Franco's 23rd save and second in as many days left Reynoso, whose
earned run average over 22 innings this season is a spartan 0.82,
undefeated in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not really strange,'' Reynoso said of pitching at Coors
Field. ``I just tried to pitch the way I know and the way I know
them, too. They got a lot of base hits and I had a lot of runners
on base. But I always got out of problems with not much damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming in, Reynoso, 32, had not allowed an earned run in 15
innings this season, after missing more than a year due to arm
troubles. But the Rockies scored a run off their former teammate in
the bottom of the first to erase a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, however, Alfonzo lofted his eighth home run of the
season, a two-run shot over the scoreboard in right for a 3-1 Mets'
lead.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, the Colorado left-hander Bobby Jones (no
relation to Bobby Jones in the Mets' rotation) delivered a two-out,
run-scoring single off Reynoso to make it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets rallied. With two outs in the top of the fifth,
Olerud lined an inside fast ball into the right field corner for
his second double. Piazza followed with a hard grounder to third
that glanced off Castilla's glove and into left field, the error
scoring Olerud for a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso made it look easy. He set the Rockies down on five
pitches in the bottom of the fifth, retired the side on seven
pitches in the sixth, then retired the side in order on six pitches
in the seventh. His pitch count was only at 89 heading into the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' Jones said later. ``He jammed guys with an
85 mile per hour fast ball.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Reynoso would not record another out. But
Cook, Wendell and Franco were able to bail him out _ something the
Mets' bullpen had had trouble doing before this road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said, ``That's the way it's supposed to work.''

YANKS BEAT ROYALS, 14-1  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ Forfeiting to the Yankees would be more beneficial
than playing them, a rival American League manager suggested
earlier this season. A forfeit is neat and clean, while playing the
Yankees is messy and depressing, serving only to confirm their
greatness _ and just how crummy you are by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Royals had won 6 of 7 games before coming here,
playing good baseball in the estimation of their manager, Tony
Muser. But in three games over two days against the Yankees, the
Royals have been wiped out by a composite score of 36-5. Playing
before 45,975 at Yankee Stadium Saturday, the Yankees drubbed
Kansas City, 14-1 _ the third time in the last six days the Yankees
had scored 14 runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 83-29, they have won three straight games, their
snowball is careering down the mountainside of this 162-game
schedule and there does not appear to be any way to slow them down.
Think about this: The last time they played a game without holding
a lead was June 28, against the Mets at Shea Stadium. They have
held a lead in 37 consecutive games. They are relentless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a morale factor,'' said Muser, who is very
competitive by nature and not the manager who talked about a
forfeit. ``We were playing pretty good coming in here, and we
couldn't have felt any better about ourselves. I can tell you this:
The New York Yankees have put us in a different frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, we haven't accepted the challenge like I would like.
We have a game left, and I hope tomorrow to come out and play
better baseball. It looked like we were maybe going to turn the
corner today, in the first five innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City turned the corner in the fifth, trailing Orlando
Hernandez by 1-0 _ and then got smothered under an avalanche of
Yankee runs. One run in the fifth, six runs in the sixth, three
runs in the seventh and three more in the eighth. Jorge Posada
drove in a career-high six runs, Scott Brosius hit a three-run home
run and Chuck Knoblauch smashed his 15th home run.
</P>
<P>
   This does not seem like baseball anymore. This is Nebraska
against Prairie View in football; the Cornhuskers rush for 650
yards, the Yankees are averaging 10.1 runs per game over their last
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees lead the American League in earned run average
(3.57). They have allowed the second-fewest unearned runs (27), and
have committed errors in only 1 of their last 10 games. They are
averaging 6.1 runs per game, while allowing 3.8.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (7-3) stifled the Royals, as David Cone and David
Wells had in Friday's doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   ``That probably is as good as starting pitching as we've seen in
three consecutive games all season,'' Muser said. ``And as good as
offensive production as we've seen all season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are so far ahead now in the American League East
that they will spend the rest of the regular season chasing records
and smoothing wrinkles before the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez allowed 10 runs and 13 hits in Anaheim on July 29, and
the next day Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, spoke to
him about pace.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers tend to be more effective if they work quickly,
Stottlemyre told him; their fielders' reactions are sharper.
Hernandez had fallen into the habit of working slowly, of nibbling
at the edges of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to learn and agreeable to whatever the Yankees have asked,
Hernandez increased his pace and aggressiveness, as if he had
traded in an Edsel for a Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Hernandez would throw a pitch and then take the throw
from Posada, the catcher, as he was returning to the rubber. He
worked quickly enough that in the second inning, some of the Kansas
City batters began stepping out, trying to disrupt Hernandez's
tempo.
</P>
<P>
   But they could do nothing to adjust to his repertory, which was
more varied and better deployed than in any of his previous 11
appearances. Often passive with his fastball before, Hernandez
fired his fastballs inside repeatedly Saturday, creating a major
problem for the Kansas City hitters, who were preparing for his
breaking pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best stuff he's had,'' Posada said. ``It was the
best I've seen him throw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals' Scott Leius and Mendy Lopez struck out on fastballs,
with the ball buried deeply in Posada's glove when each started his
swing.
</P>
<P>
   The five right-handed hitters in the Kansas City lineup
sometimes fell backward as they swung at Hernandez's sidearm
slider, which was accentuated by the shadows drifting across the
sky during the late afternoon game.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals mustered just four hits in eight innings against El
Duque, who struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday Kansas City faces Andy Pettitte. Relentless.

NEWS MEDIA AND THE McIVER STORY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dale Hansen, the Dallas-Fort Worth WFAA/Channel 8 sports anchor
whose reporters took the early lead in advancing the real story
behind the Everett McIver situation in Wichita Falls, is missing
the point when he says on the radio that the local papers haven't
been as aggressive in handling the story because they're running
scared of the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an attitude among the media that `We don't want to
take on the Cowboys, we certainly don't want to take on Michael
Irvin and any lawsuits and we don't want to take on the fans,'''
Hansen contends. ``Should we be careful? Absolutely. But that
doesn't mean you don't pursue the story as aggressively today as we
did three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be closer on the last point than the first two. Maybe
what we're afraid of is being wrong and further destroying
credibility with the fans. Maybe we actually learned something from
the last time almost everyone went crazy over a story about Michael
Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   That something may have more to do with being cautiously fair
than with concern about lawsuits or stepping on Jerry Jones' toes.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there's an argument to be made that when the
Star-Telegram reported that Irvin was involved, the story could
have been played on the section cover instead of Page 5. The reason
it wasn't was because 95 percent of the story was a rehash of what
had already been reported and it was an editor's decision to keep
it inside.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's name was surfacing for the first time but with no real
particulars about how he was involved. It was Hansen and his team
who then followed up with details about a haircut and scissors and
ending with McIver sustaining the cut on his neck.
</P>
<P>
   That this story has been more radio talk show-TV talk driven
rather than a made-for-newspaper story is inarguable. The Cowboys'
shutdown of information has made it extremely difficult to advance
the story from a newspaper reporting standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The talk shows, meanwhile, don't have to have new information to
speculate and talk the issue to death, and they have.
</P>
<P>
   What is being forgotten in the debate over the media's handling
of the story _ and don't you know Jones is loving that red herring
_ is that the Cowboys, who spent so much time and money to change
their image, now are clearly involved in an unseemly coverup,
apparently to protect Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   It won't last. It can't.
</P>
<P>
   Any man who's ever been to a barbershop knows there's one thing
that barbers _ and new rumors indicate there may have been two of
them in that dorm room _ do even better than cut hair.
</P>
<P>
   They talk....
</P>
<P>
   You've got to like the attitude new starting pitcher Todd
Stottlemyre brings to the Rangers. When Stottlemyre was in Toronto,
baseball writers there regularly got up a pot each spring, wagering
on which of the Blue Jays' pitchers would hit the first home run
when the team played National League opponents during exhibition
season. Stottlemyre heard about the pool, asked whether he could
get in and always selected himself as the Blue Jays' pitcher who
would be first to swat one out of the park. ...
</P>
<P>
   Uh oh. Coming over to the ``S-T'' might force columnist Randy
Galloway into the computer age whether he likes it or not.
Galloway, who once vowed that his editors would have to pry his
ancient Underwood portable typewriter out of his cold, dead
fingers, was issued a state of the art laptop the other day, and
his eyes started rolling like a slot machine.
</P>
<P>
   A TV producer at The Ballpark congratulated Galloway on his move
but complained that he couldn't get the ``S-T'' delivered to his
home in Garland.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' answered Galloway, being the high-tech, '90s guy
that he is. ``You can just call me up on the ``intercom.'''' On the
information superhighway, some are 18-wheelers and some of us are
just roadkill. ...
</P>
<P>
   You think Cowboys defensive line coach Jim Bates doesn't like
No. 1 draft pick Greg Ellis? ``He has all the intangibles, all the
things you look for in an athlete,'' Bates says. ``He's got size,
he's got arm reach, he's got power, he's got good speed, and
mentally he's a very intelligent and a very competitive person.
He's got all the ingredients to make a good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Now if Ellis could just get a preseason sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know when the light's going to go on for a rookie,''
Bates says. ``Sometimes it takes a half a year, sometimes a couple
of years for a youngster to come into his own and be as good as he
can be.''...
</P>
<P>
   Never mind Rusty Greer for Roger Clemens. If the Rangers had
really wanted ``The Rocket,'' it would have taken Greer, Darren
Oliver and top prospect Ruben Mateo. That's two outfielders who'll
be starting here in 2000, plus Oliver for a 36-year-old
right-hander. Yep, I'd love to have Clemens starting twice against
the Yankees in the playoffs, too, but that one makes me pause for
some deep thought. ...
</P>
<P>
   I'm still thinking. ...
</P>
<P>
   I didn't have a chance to spend as much time with legendary golf
writer Bob Green and his wife, Ivy, as I would have liked, but on
those occasions when they visited at Colonial the past few years,
Bob was invariably upbeat, congenial, gentle and kind, despite the
cancer that finally took his life.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise when Green was buried in Weatherford last
week that golfer Lanny Wadkins, Tom Kite's wife, Christy, and PGA
officials John Morris, Lee Patterson, Marty Caffey and Chris Smith
were in attendance at the services. ...
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey entertained his old high school coach
from Americus, Ga., Johnny Hightower, last week in Wichita Falls
and said he has a soft spot for high school coaches in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``High school coaches impact our society maybe more than any
other group because they impact athletes,'' Gailey says, ``and
athletes in general, men and women, are the ones who become
society's leaders as they go on down the line.''...
</P>
<P>
   Running back Emmitt Smith says the Cowboys can't allow
themselves to use the fact that they're implementing a new offense
as an excuse to start slowly this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not someone who believes that just because it's our first
year \Rwith a new offense\S that we have to start slow,'' Smith
says. ``We don't have to start off 0-and-6. We are professionals. I
expect everybody to go out there and do their jobs. You give them
the playbook, then you iron out the little mistakes so you can make
the big plays happen.''...
</P>
<P>
   A double dose of bad news arrives from the Rangers' training
camp in Port Charlotte, Fla. Joan Santucci, owner along with
husband Frank of Charlie's Raw Bar, a favored dining spot for
players, writers, club officials and fans, lost her battle with
cancer last week. She had dreamed of someday opening a Charlie's
close to The Ballpark in Arlington. Our hearts go out to Frank, her
family and her many friends. ...
</P>
<P>
   This on the heels of reports that the famed ``776'' roadhouse at
El Jobean, refuge of baseball writers and club officials alike, has
closed it doors. Sigh. Things will never be the same there again.
...
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' search for a left-hander for the bullpen is at
least semicritical, as Mo Vaughn's homer off Eric Gunderson on
Thursday night attests. Which makes it at least semi-interesting
that the Rangers allowed Randy Myers to slip through waivers to San
Diego. Myers would have been the perfect lefty setup man for John
Wetteland, but general manager Doug Melvin balked at picking up
Myers' $6 million a year contract, which runs through next season.
``That's a little stiff for a setup man,'' Melvin says. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' GM is very high on Rangers farmhand Mike Venafro,
the left-hander promoted to Oklahoma from Tulsa, but don't look for
him before September. ...
</P>
<P>
   Montreal left-hander Carlos Perez was on Melvin's list of
pitching possibilities as the trade deadline approached but along
with a high asking price, there were concerns about team chemistry.
...
</P>
<P>
   Forget Viagra, get me some of whatever Albatross had been
eating. When he departed for that Great Stud Pasture in the sky
last week, the magnificent harness-racing champion had sired 2,546
offspring. And counting. Do we even need to ask how he died?
</P>
<P>
   And then there was this headline in the official Rangers' notes
package the other night: ``Wives Auction Tomorrow.'' No word on
which wife attracted the highest bid or who bought her.
